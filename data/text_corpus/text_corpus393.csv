1965,droughts due to their complex nature are difficult to predict however research is showing that there are often clearly defined patterns to their occurrence the temporal aspects are usually more apparent when comparing regions with defined climatic characteristics such as those with recognized wet or dry seasons but recognizing these patterns can help in defining and understanding the overall processes influencing drought occurrence especially in the context of climate change it is crucial to recognize temporal patterns and quantify them to help diagnose current and future event probabilities the objective of this work is to introduce a new tool for assessing temporal patterns of streamflow drought based on the harmonic oscillator theorem called the harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model the testing dataset consists of monthly minimal flows and drought occurrence information calculated based on daily flows from the national water model nwm retrospective v 2 1 dataset for the period 1979 2020 the model framework allows for trend and seasonality signal decomposition as well as the extraction of the first five harmonics by means of a fast fourier transform fft based machine learning algorithm the model framework enables the extraction and evaluation of five different harmonic models based on short and long range components as well as linear regression sloped harmonics the results show that the best fit models are based on two superimposed sinusoidal functions with an accuracy of around 70 90 for streamflow drought occurrence with different spatial parameters reflecting varied environmental conditions the models were able to capture two patterns 1 annual precipitation variation and 2 longer term inertia the latter of which is likely driven by large scale circulation with a roughly eight year period keywords host model harmonic oscillator streamflow drought seasonality trend stl decomposition data availability links are indicated in manuscript in data availability statement 1 introduction the severity of hydrological droughts is increasing as climate change progresses changes in precipitation amplify changes in streamflow affecting spatial and temporal distribution and shifting the duration and timing of high and low flow peaks byun et al 2019 gu et al 2018 tabari 2020 changes in streamflow toward more extreme conditions increase the risk of impacts to natural and man made systems due to prolonged droughts drought is expected to increase in the future regardless of the emission scenario ipcc 2022 cook et al 2020 fang et al 2018 grillakis 2019 gu et al 2018 with areas affected by extreme drought increasing more rapidly haile et al 2020 the direction of the changes in specific regions around the world is however unclear with some studies suggesting that dry regions will become drier and wet regions will accumulate more water dai 2011 haile et al 2020 marx et al 2018 theis pattern however was only detected in about 10 20 of regions around the world with a similar percentage of opposite dependence dry regions becoming wetter and wet regions drying yang et al 2019 greve et al 2014 the variation in this pattern results from the complexity of the natural environment including multiple characteristics contributing to the environmental water balance sheffield et al 2012 and affects water based economy sectors such as agriculture that are becoming more vulnerable to changing climate and therefore note year to year increasing losses arora 2019 ortiz bobea et al 2021 ray et al 2019 with further effects on gross domestic product gdp kompas et al 2018 as a result accurate forecasts of hydrological extremes become crucial for efficient planning of water management systems tabari 2021 the most important question has changed from will it occur to when will it occur an increasing number of scientific research shows evidence of cyclic reoccurrence of drought forootan et al 2019 marx et al 2018 mcmahon finlayson 2003 rad et al 2016 droughts are becoming more common in warm seasons marx et al 2018 vlach et al 2021 with precipitation and evaporation timing playing an important role in the propagation scheme apurv et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 as hydrologic regimes are observed to change toward rainfall dominance in rivers around the world future drought prolongation will change as a result brunner tallaksen 2019 in some regions of the world drought occurrence is related to the el nino southern oscillation enso chiew mcmahon 2002 2003 forootan et al 2019 piechota dracup 1996 ryu et al 2010 with streamflow correlation on interannual scales of two to eight years and maximum dryness coinciding with la nina abdelkader yerdelen 2022 the intensity direction and length of these reoccurrence periods depends on the region of the world and several local factors such as geology land cover and climatic conditions bormann pinter 2017 cervi et al 2017 dierauer et al 2018 guzha et al 2018 haslinger et al 2014 jenicek et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2019 van loon et al 2019 wang et al 2019 additionally anthropogenic processes not only on climate change but also on streamflow as manifested in reservoir operations and intakes and outlets located in river channels has a direct impact on drought magnitudes marx et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 nevertheless the existing pattern seems to duplicate itself and persist at the moment we do not have enough observation lengths or tools to quantify the nature of cyclic hydrologic patterns or to determine whether the patterns are changing hao et al 2018 however we can observe changes in the intensity of the phenomenon manifested in the occurrence of statistically significant trends hammond et al 2022 peña angulo et al 2022 most studies agree that depending on the region of the world the intensity of hydrological extremes changes unfortunately the direction and intensity of change are not unambiguous and unified as the results of the research do not coincide for many regions of the world due to different definitions of drought or large differences across indicators of precipitation soil moisture runoff and vegetation health cook et al 2018 sometimes in the same region different studies indicate different directions of the development of the phenomenon predicting an increase or decrease in the intensity of hydrologic extremes such as drought piniewski et al 2017 the difference results most often from the different time periods used and the aforementioned cyclicality raczyński dyer 2020 in meteorological research a frequently used method to assess cyclicality is harmonic analysis harmonic analysis is often used to assess the impact of teleconnections e g enso on the seasonality of other meteorological characteristics like precipitation or the impact on streamflow around the world chiew et al 1998 chiew mcmahon 2003 garcia 2005 lee julien 2017 shrestha kostaschuk 2005 for example the first harmonic function of 24 month enso related signals in general reflects anomalies found in streamflow data chiew mcmahon 2002 2003 kahya dracup 1993 besides circulation studies harmonic analysis has successfully been used for assessment of short and long term periodic changes in precipitation or wind cycles bawiskar et al 1989 dabanlı et al 2017 mitchell et al 1979 used harmonic analysis to discover a 22 year cycle of solar activity while clark 1988 discovered the same length cycles in fire distribution kadιoğlu et al 1999 found that first and second harmonics explain over 90 of the climatological variations in turkey and similarly in jordan tarawneh kadıoğlu 2003 in saudi arabia tarawneh 2016 found around 70 of precipitation variance to be explained by the first two harmonics tase 1976 found that about 84 of precipitation variance over the upper great plains in the usa can be explained by the first three harmonics and most precipitation variance over iran by the first harmonic as found by sabziparvar et al 2015 besides water demand forecasts kozłowski et al 2018 harmonic analysis has not found wide applications in hydrology due to a rather poor goodness of fit for example abebe and foerch 2008 in their study of streamflow data over ethiopia found that the first two harmonics explain around 87 of the periodic mean variance but 17 of the total variance with a negligible portion explained by other harmonics in turkey kahya et al 2008 found that 50 of variance could be explained with applied harmonics in another study harmonics used for streamflow data reconstruction correlated weakly with streamflow data at about 14 20 young 1994 as harmonic analysis does show potential in defining hydrologic patterns especially in regions where streamflow patterns are associated with cyclic climatic conditions this paper presents a new approach to the analysis of hydrological drought using harmonics to address poor harmonic performance in general a data decomposition is performed prior to performing a harmonic fit to the data this step allows for the removal of the residuals representing random extremes and the extraction of short and long term changes in data the introduced classifier allows for the estimation of the range of the harmonic function corresponding to the occurrence of drought for minimal flow data forming a continuous dataset classical goodness of fit measures are applied the set of methods used in this study forms the harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model framework the purpose of this work is to introduce the host model framework in a hydrologic application and assess its performance in a study area the southeast united states with a range of hydrologic drivers 2 study area and data the developed methodology is verified over the southeastern part of the united states corresponding to us geological survey usgs region 3 south atlantic gulf region fig 1 this region which includes all rivers flowing to the atlantic ocean and the gulf of mexico between the james river catchment in virginia and the lower mississippi river in mississippi comprises a total area of around 724 000 km2 the research area represents a diverse landscape in terms of land use meteorological and hydrogeological conditions elevations vary between 25 and 1589 m a s l and affect regional accessibility to water with a dense river network in the north and northeast and sparse in the south the majority of streamflow comes from baseflow and only around 40 is contributed by runoff chen teegavarapu 2019 the climate is subtropical over a majority of the area with hot and humid summers and tropical characteristics in florida and along the coast of the gulf of mexico a k a the gulf coast the mean annual temperatures range between 14 c and 25 c joshi et al 2020 and annual precipitation ranges between 1000 and 2000 mm year 1 joshi et al 2020 sagarika et al 2015 the occurrence of la niña results in higher temperatures lower precipitation and stronger droughts mourtzinis et al 2016 with an increasing population growing agricultural needs and a changing climate the region faces serious water supply shortages and a substantial drought threat cook et al 2020 dai 2011 keellings engström 2019 marx et al 2018 the study data provided by the national water model nwm retrospective v2 1 dataset constitutes daily mean flows for 60 750 streamflow nodes fig 1 for the period 1 feb 1979 31 dec 2020 2 551 500 stream years the daily mean flows were calculated based on hourly mean flow values from 00 to 23 utc for each day the initial dataset contained 338 037 retrospective stream nodes hereafter nodes in the study area but the majority of these nodes had zero or null data therefore only nodes of strahler order 3 or higher with no more than 5 of missing values were considered in this study 3 methodology 3 1 streamflow drought identification a streamflow drought is a period of water levels below a specific threshold with the threshold level method tlm often used to determine the criteria value van loon 2015 for this study however an objective breakpoint approach raczyński dyer 2022a was used to estimate the low flow threshold for each node in this approach the unique shape of each node s flow duration curve fdc is considered which allows for the inclusion of environmental factors in the decision making process the fisher jenks natural breakpoint algorithm was used to objectively determine the specific flood threshold qobj the flow is considered low when its value reaches or falls below the value of qobj low flows occurring in a series forming an event are called streamflow drought van loon 2015 3 2 seasonal and trend decomposition seasonal trend decomposition using loess stl was used to decompose a single data series into three series representing trend seasonality and residuals decomposition allows for the presentation of data xt behavior on three scales describing low frequency variation in the data in conjunction with nonstationary patterns i e long term changes in data trend tt variations in data on short scales such as seasonal fluctuations seasonality st and the remaining components residuals rt that do not reflect any specific patterns and can be related for example with the occurrence of extreme events cleveland et al 1990 1 x t t t s t r t t 1 n extracted series present data behavior without distortions caused by interrelationships in the occurrence of short term and long term changes or extreme situations which in turn allows for insightful analysis of the patterns hidden in data that normally cannot be observed the stl approach allows for the extraction of nonlinear trend components changes in seasonal components over time and is robust in the presence of outliers cordeiro et al 2022 the stl decomposition method is widely used in the natural sciences as a reliable method for removing seasonal components from analyzed data series and is used to determine both seasonal and long term patterns in hydrogeological systems shamsudduha et al 2009 wunsch et al 2018 hydroclimatic studies bogning et al 2021 he et al 2022 papacharalampous et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 or flow simulation apaydin et al 2021 luo et al 2019 patidar et al 2019 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the detailed procedure for stl calculation is provided by cleveland et al 1990 3 3 harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model framework both direct flow data and decomposed data can be described using mathematical functions a special characteristic of this set is repeatability which results among others from seasonality and or large scale factors influencing water resources e g circulation and water supply from aquifers a harmonic oscillator generally described as a mechanical model with one degree of freedom can be used to describe repetitive variations in natural systems fernández guasti 2004 gitterman 2005 plebanski 1956 in terms of classical mechanics an oscillator is described by the following equation fan 2009 fernández guasti 2004 gitterman 2005 um et al 2002 2 a t ω 0 2 x t 0 where a t time dependent acceleration x t time dependent position ω0 the circular oscillation frequency of the oscillator pulsation meaning how quickly a given periodic phenomenon repeats pulsation is related to the frequency f and the period t by following relation 3 ω d θ dt 2 π t 2 π f where θ phase of oscillating motion frequency in turn describes the number of cycles of a periodic phenomenon per unit of time 4 f n t 1 β where n number of oscillations t time β period which in the case of a harmonic oscillator is equal to 5 β 2 π ω 0 on the basis of dependencies 4 and 5 it can be concluded that 6 f ω 0 2 π the commonly used solution for the harmonic oscillator equation 2 is ebaid 2010 fernández guasti 2004 gitterman 2005 7 x t a s i n ω 0 t φ with sin and cos occurring interchangeably depending on the interpretation where a amplitude represents the magnitude of the sine wave measured from center line to peak φ phase depending on the values and shifts in relation to the regular position of the sinusoid describing the motion fig 2 the final equation has the form 8 x t a s i n ω 0 t φ c where c offset a k a vertical shift representing value at which sine is concentrated after identifying the periods with streamflow drought the series were divided into two sets of data aggregated in monthly scales representing direct values of minimal flows qmin and occurrence of streamflow drought according to relation 9 occ 0 for n 0 o c c 1 for n 1 where occ occurrence of streamflow drought n number of streamflow drought episodes in aggregated period this approach assumes the occurrence of dry conditions without incorporating their magnitudes this might introduce a bias in the harmonic function depending on the resolution of the data used i e if monthly aggregated data are used the maximal difference might be 30 days 31 days of dry conditions vs one day occurrence however for weekly aggregated data the maximal difference will be only six days this bias is additionally controlled by the decision threshold applied over the function in order to transform its values according to binary classification fig 4 the oscillator form presented in 8 was used as the initial form of the function describing the behavior of variables in the analyzed period the function is then initialized over the set of its initial parameters a ω0 φ c and optimized using the fast fourier transform fft algorithm the algorithm was limited to 100 000 executable repetitions but in a few cases it was necessary to increase the limit to 500 000 repetitions for the optimized function to be correctly assigned due to the dominant character of periods without drought values of 0 constitute around 95 of data in the case of a non decomposed dataset the factors corresponding to long term and seasonal changes overlap so it may happen that the fitted oscillator function represents one of these factors for this reason a repetitive excluding fit approach was used consisting of the re fitting of the harmonic oscillator function x t 1 to the non decomposed dataset of x t reduced by the values of the matched function x t fig 4 for data series decomposed by the stl method the obtained trend can be either linear or non linear in the case of a linear trend its equation represents a simple relation 10 y α t c where α slope of the trend line in relation to the x axis c intercept with the y axis for nonlinear trends described by the harmonic oscillator function equation 8 is insufficient due to the occurrence of a factor related to the slope of the function fig 3 due to this fact the modification of equation 8 is necessary so that the linear trend is included in the equation 11 x t α t a s i n ω 0 t φ c the fit of the model to the data representing the decomposed trend was performed for the modified equation 11 if any of the model elements oscillator or linear trend were irrelevant their coefficients α or a can be zeroed resulting in the component being removed from the equation and consequently obtaining equation 8 or 10 the studied variable can be explained both by long term and seasonal changes but also by both processes simultaneously in this case the function describing the variable is the sum of the two oscillators determined for the trend and seasonality variables together with the possible factor of linear change according to the following 12 x t α trend t a trend s i n ω 0 t r e n d t φ trend a seasonality s i n ω 0 s e a s o n a l i t y t φ seasonality c this means that as a result five functions describing the examined characteristics are obtained these functions represent the following models trend data fitted model tf trend data sloped model ts seasonality data fitted model sf combined trend and seasonality fitted model cf and combined sloped trend and seasonality fitted model cs at the last stage fig 4 the values of the resulting functions are compared with the characteristics describing the original data set and the accuracy of the model is analyzed the ratio of the true model data to all observations problems at this stage may result from the interpretation of the harmonic oscillator curve representing a given model and the corresponding event characteristics does the specific function value represent the occurrence or absence of drought qmin can be considered a continuous variable while occurrence has a discrete distribution therefore these variables have to be compared to model outputs using different statistics occurrence should be considered a boolean classification problem therefore a set of accuracy statistics is used the occurrence of hydrological drought can be predicted using modeled harmonics at local maxima as well as a specific threshold value such as one that is greater than the function mean the implementation of topological analysis was introduced in walked threshold analysis fig 4 where in order to establish a threshold the values are iterated sequentially from highest to lowest at each iteration the boolean classification returns every value above the iterated threshold as an occurrence of drought bool true or 1 according to equation 9 and every value below the threshold as an absence of drought bool false or 0 according to equation 9 a set of accuracy parameters is returned precision a measure describing how many of the model predictions of occurrence are correct over all the model predictions 13 precision p 11 p 11 p 01 values of the metric range between 0 and 1 with 1 meaning that all the model predictions reflected occurrences in the raw data recall also known as sensitivity a measure describing how many of the model predictions of occurrence are correct over all occurrences in the raw data 14 recall p 11 p 11 p 10 values of the metric vary between 0 and 1 with 1 meaning that the model correctly classified all occurrences from the raw data accuracy a measure describing how many of the model s predictions of both occurrence and absence were correct 15 accuracy p 11 p 00 n values of the metric vary between 0 and 1 with 1 meaning that the model correctly classified all cases of occurrence as well as the absence of drought compared to the original data f1 score a harmonic mean of precision and recall 16 f 1 s c o r e 2 precision r e c a l l precision r e c a l l metric represents the balanced ratio between precision and recall with lower overall scores for models with one of the metrics considerably smaller than the other values range from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating a better fit of the model n is total number of values and p characteristics reflect the number of cases according to the contingency table table 1 the threshold characterized by the highest f1 score is classified as the best fit threshold for the model which minimizes the possible bias that arises due to the assessment of non magnitude drought occurrence the f1 score is then compared across all resultant models to determine which has the best fit minimal flows series qmin can be considered a continuous distribution with no threshold applied this value presents the lowest flow in a considered aggregation resolution and therefore no threshold value can assess whether the specific value represents dry or wet conditions as a result accuracy statistics are inadequate to compare the model output with qmin data the efficiency coefficient is applied in hydrological modeling widely applied measures are the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and its modern alternative the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 although both methods received some criticism in the literature there is still a gap in the improvement of the hydrologic decision metrics clark et al 2021 lamontagne et al 2020 liu 2020 pool et al 2018 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 therefore for this study a modified version of the kling gupta efficiency was applied kling et al 2012 to test the differences between the model outputs relative to different lengths of the initial dataset and address the method performance under commonly used train test splits a mann whitney u test was performed the shortening was applied at every 5 step which corresponds to a 2 year reduction reducing the data series up to 50 of its original length the test null hypothesis states that the distributions of both populations are the same compared to the alternative hypothesis that the distributions are different the test u statistic described for the xi sample from the first distribution and the yj sample from the second distribution is defined as 17 u i 1 n j 1 m s x i y j where 18 s x y 1 if x y 1 2 if x y 0 if x y the full harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model framework is outlined in fig 4 all statistics were calculated using two sided α 0 05 4 results 4 1 occurrence 4 1 1 direct harmonics the first harmonic function extracted from the occurrence data series corresponds to a short change cycle with a period of around 10 12 months this period length reflects the annual occurrence of streamflow droughts in the warm season due to seasonal precipitation variations except in the appalachian mountains and coastal regions second and third harmonics reflect long term changes in 2 10 year cycles fig 5 this might be related to the groundwater cycle or general water circulation schemes in the area the long term change cycle is well visible in the appalachian piedmont area in all five extracted harmonic functions in the reminder of the area fourth and fifth harmonics presents random variability with a period between 2 and 8 months the functions fitting real data show weak correlation with most r 2 values below 0 1 the first harmonic function has the highest explained variance with a mean of 9 5 the second harmonic has a mean of r 2 0 035 and the residual has a mean of r 2 0 03 thus the first five harmonics explain on average around 21 4 of total variance ranging from 4 to 62 9 there is no correlation between function parameters and stream order with the correlation coefficient r ranging between 0 049 and 0 008 for the first function and 0 037 0 103 for the subsequent functions the correlations generally weaken with consecutive functions the lowest share of variance explained by the first five harmonics is found in coastal nodes as well as appalachian nodes reflecting the lowest fit of the hydrologic variability to cycles of harmonic functions the highest variance explained is observed in the western part of the study area in mississippi northwestern and central alabama and central georgia as well as partially in central north carolina 4 1 2 host model the percentage of variance explained by the host occurrence model has an iqr of 60 91 with an average of 78 where the seasonality component is responsible for on average 51 of variance r 2 iqr 0 42 0 63 with a median of 0 54 and the trend component 27 r 2 iqr 0 18 0 28 with a median of 0 22 fig 6 after category classification was applied based on the best fit decision threshold accuracy characteristics were calculated the cf model achieved the highest accuracy average of 74 8 while the ts model achieved the lowest average of 55 2 the highest recalls characterized the sf and cs models overall the f1 score was 0 45 for the cf model and 0 43 for the combined sloped model fig 6 regardless of model type most reached an accuracy between 70 and 90 fig 7 a group of nodes underperformed for models based on trend series only these models were characterized by an increased number of nodes with higher precision and lower recall values meaning that in general the models predicted more streamflow droughts than actually occurred most models were characterized by higher recall metrics than precision which corresponds to a greater percentage of accurate predictions compared to more frequent predictions which are not reflected in a natural occurrence pattern in most nodes precision and accuracy maintain a positive relationship with no model having high precision and low accuracy except a few nodes in ts model this property might be related to two issues 1 the nature of the event where most of the harmonic functions are interpreted as non drought periods or 2 the occurrence bias with respect to the second issue if multiple cases with a low number of days with dry conditions were consecutively included in the initialization time series contributing to lower classification thresholds and overestimation of drought reoccurrence further in time there could be an increased number of nodes with low accuracy for sloped models fig 7 that are more sensitive to changes in the occurrence distribution except for the tf model where a group of nodes is characterized by low accuracy and low recall the two characteristics remain in a strong negative relationship the correlation between the two is highest for the ts model with r 0 884 for combined models the average is r 0 765 the f1 score metric has an average correlation of r 0 925 and r 0 500 with precision and recall respectively the non combined models ts tf and sf reflect spatial relations similar to observations of raw harmonics with prolongation of function periods in the appalachian piedmont area as well as southern mississippi the seasonality periods span four years while the majority of the remaining area is characterized by an annual cycle the long term based functions indicate 8 12 year periods in the majority of the area with significant prolongation for more than 100 years in the piedmont area primarily in alabama the raw harmonics results presented earlier correspond to roughly 10 year cycles but the coverage area here extends over the entire study area fig 8 for the ts model the number of nodes with a positive slope value indicating an increase in occurrence in recent years 48 6 is nearly equal to the number of nodes with a negative slope indicating the disappearance of streamflow droughts 51 4 although there is no clear spatial pattern in the distribution of slope values most nodes with negative slopes are located in virginia and north carolina central georgia and southern mississippi and alabama in florida both types coexist in the same river systems confirming the high level of hydrologic complexity in these areas the best fitting model is characterized by the highest f1 score which reflects the best ratio between precision and accuracy the cf model was the best fitted model for the majority of nodes 37 039 nodes 61 2 of total about the same number of nodes had their distribution reflected in seasonal changes only sf model 11 559 nodes 19 1 of total and in a combined sloped model cs 10 897 nodes 18 0 of total only 333 0 55 of total nodes had ts as the best fitted model and 661 1 09 of total distributions were reflected in the sloped trend model there is no significant correlation between the best fit function type and stream order r 0 011 or any other function parameters rmax 0 057 in spatial terms however models generally perform better in all study regions besides the appalachian mountains coastal areas and florida fig 9 despite the lack of a clear spatial relationship between node locations for the best fit of seasonality models there is a difference in the performance of these types of harmonic functions in nodes affected by clear seasonal reoccurrence and with trend included fig 10 in these nodes seasonal models were on average more accurate by 19 6 than tf models 17 1 than ts models 7 1 than cs models and 0 9 than cf models 4 2 minimal flows 4 2 1 direct harmonics the assessment of the first five harmonic functions extracted from the nwm retrospective dataset reveals mostly short term behavior with periods in the first function of around 12 months this reflects the regional seasonal patterns in precipitation most of the nodes in the second function have periods of two to eight months the appalachian piedmont region is an exception with longer two to four year periods the area expands gradually with the addition of consecutive functions whereby with the fifth harmonical function included short periods are still present in the coastal regions of the carolinas and florida as well as in most small catchments in mississippi and georgia fig 11 the functions explain on average 12 3 of total variance with the first harmonic ranging from 1 7 to 45 9 and 31 7 with the first five harmonics from 9 4 to 92 6 fig 11 spatially the highest variance explained by models with the first five harmonics is for mississippi and alabama except for southern coastal areas and the appalachian piedmont through central georgia to virginia the lowest r 2 is observed in coastal area nodes as is the case with drought occurrence there is a moderate to low statistically significant correlation of function parameters and node order with offset being correlated at r 0 534 amplitude at r 0 427 and r 2 at r 0 325 for the first function these relations weaken with consecutive functions except for r 2 for which the mean correlation for all functions is r 0 308 4 2 2 host model functions based on decomposed data perform better than raw harmonic functions explaining a total of between 59 and 91 iqr of data variance with a mean r 2 0 76 the seasonal models explain a larger share with r 2 0 51 on average and iqr 0 41 0 64 median of 0 54 while trend models maintain r 2 0 27 and iqr 0 18 0 28 with a median of 0 22 fig 12 the kling gupta efficiency score used as a decision statistic to determine the best fit model varies significantly between the models raw host trend models generally have values between 5 and 3 and show no significant improvement similarly seasonality models alone have lower values with the first quartile starting at a score of 1200 this suggests that the stand alone models treated separately show no improvement of the modeled characteristic according to knoben et al 2019 values of kge greater than 0 41 indicate model improvement in the study area the combined models usually have values higher than this threshold fig 12 the rmse characteristics all had the same iqr with only the sf model having a 75th percentile higher than the other models the median for all models was at the same low level however for all the models a significant number of outliers higher than 1 5 iqr was observed these are related to the largest rivers in the study region as the highest rmse values occur in only eleven rivers the correlation between rmse and river order is statistically significant and exceeds r 0 53 for all models except tf where r 0 05 the highest correlation between raw flow data and the model predictions occurred with the cf and cs models the mean correlation for combined models was r 0 434 while the highest node specific values reached r 0 840 on the other hand the lowest correlation with flow values was observed in the tf model with rmean 0 197 and rmax 0 588 fig 12 spatially for trend models ts and tf the highest correlations occur in northern appalachia and the central and southern mississippi to georgia nodes the same can be said for seasonal models with the lowest correlation coefficients the majority of rivers are well represented by combined models with only a slight decrease in correlation for coastal nodes basic non combined models ts tf and sf show the same spatial pattern with lowest periods in nodes in southern alabama and georgia near the walter f george reservoir in this region harmonic models for trend reach periods shorter than 24 months and seasonal models shorter than 4 months these periods extend over 25 years for trend models and over 36 months for seasonal models in the area above the reservoir although not strictly in the upper catchment but rather in catchments to the northwest and northeast of the reservoir fig 13 highest periods are observed in southern mississippi over 100 years in the south central part and around 50 years in the coastal area for ts and tf models as well in northern florida seasonal model with a period of 24 36 months and in the appalachian piedmont in north carolina over 100 years for ts and tf and over 36 months for sf the slopes of the ts model present a defined spatial pattern with 38 4 of nodes identified with a negative slope and 61 6 with a positive negative slopes are present mainly in southern south carolina and eastern to southern georgia as well as in mississippi and central alabama increasing harmonic slopes for minimal flows are identified in virginia north carolina north eastern south carolina central georgia and florida except river systems originating in southern georgia within the study area the best fit models for qmin values are those that combine both long term trend and short seasonal changes lack of trend slope adaptation within the models provided the best results for 6 15 of study nodes 3723 nodes in these nodes the slope of the ts model was usually negligible and both the ts and tf models yielded the same results fig 14 a for the remainder the cs model was classified as best fitted fig 14b there is no spatial relation between cf model nodes which do not occur spatially or do not belong to specific order or catchment size rivers their spatial location appears to be random the spatial distribution of slopes in the ts model reveals three main patterns a negative slope decreasing qmin was found in 38 39 of study nodes located mainly in mississippi alabama southeastern georgia north florida and northwestern south carolina the remainder of the area 61 61 nodes was characterized by increasing slopes in ts models additionally in southern florida east to tampa and north to miami and northern south carolina central north carolina around charlotte greensboro and raleigh high trend slopes were found with extensions of function periods as indicated earlier fig 14c 4 3 time series length volatility the determined harmonical functions were based on the full 42 year long data series however when considering machine learning applications due to the need for a train test data split the volatility of the resulting models based on the input series length needs to be considered backpropagation shortening was used to shorten the studied series to cover most common train test splits the series were shortened up to 50 with steps of 5 which corresponds to about 2 years of data shortening and a mann whitney u test was used to compare values between the original full length harmonic and one determined based on the shortened series for occurrence models the binary classification results were compared and for minimal flows the direct model values were considered since the binary classification approach for the occurrence series is dependent on the decision threshold calculated as best fitted to the data the occurrence models maintain the ability to reduce the bias arising due to data length changes tested occurrence models maintain high resistance to differences of output and over 98 of all models are characterized by no significant differences between classification based on full length series and the series shortened up to 50 fig 15 minimal flow models are characterized by lower resistance to changes in data series length the combined models maintain over 80 of nodes with no statistically significant difference between the model trained for the entire data series and those trained by the shortened data series even by 50 fig 15 for this variable the cs model was characterized by higher resistance than the cf model for the trend models only about 50 60 of nodes had the same model when considering shortening by about nine years after this time the co dependence especially for ts models increases to over 80 this pattern then repeats after another 8 10 years fig 15 this corresponds to a long term change period found in the area and suggests that if the shortening is lower than the periodicity in long term relations it can lower the model s performance this behavior can however be predicted and controlled in the experiment design stage when assessing the periods of the third and fourth harmonics fig 11 5 discussion the occurrence of streamflow drought is highly variable in the southeastern united states dyer et al 2022 this can be seen when analyzing the variance explained by harmonic models the first harmonic explained only about 10 of the occurrence of streamflow drought and 12 of the variance in minimal flows the first five functions explain a total of 20 to 30 of the variance depending on the studied parameter while the seasonality and trends components of the host model explain an average of 51 and 27 of the variance respectively the main driver for streamflow distribution in this area is precipitation kam sheffield 2016 touma et al 2015 this can also be seen in the first harmonic which has roughly 12 month periods and reflects the climatic seasonal precipitation cycle this pattern can be seen in both the occurrence of drought and the distribution of minimal flows second and subsequent higher order harmonics indicate a prolongation of the water cycle in appalachian mountains piedmont catchments with extended function periods ranging from 5 to 10 years the function shape and subsequent occurrence information might indicate a multi annual or multi seasonal drought occurrence patterson et al 2013 which in turn suggests increased groundwater influence on streamflow sadri et al 2016 van loon van lanen 2012 the remaining areas particularly the coastal areas show no long term relationship in the first harmonic distribution with periods of about two months this finding reflects the observation from ford labosier 2014 that drought forecasting is difficult in the southeastern united states due to infrequent and generally weak seasonal persistence according to observations by chalise et al 2021 about 12 of seasonal streamflow and 6 of seasonal precipitation in this area is associated with tropical cyclones this could explain the weaker stability of flows in coastal areas especially in florida the carolinas and the gulf coast where tropical storm generated streamflow and precipitation are highest at 27 and 32 respectively chalise et al 2021 numerous studies confirm that streamflow in southeastern united states catchments is associated with large scale circulations like the el niño southern oscillation enso mourtzinis et al 2016 ryu et al 2010 sehgal sridhar 2018 especially during la nina events extremely dry conditions appear piechota dracup 1996 tootle et al 2005 this relationship might be reflected in the long term cycles found in the decomposed trends indicating a 4 8 year cycle depending on the location prolongation of this cycle is present in appalachian rivers with decreasing lengths toward the coasts seasonal streamflow distribution depends on local environmental conditions raczyński dyer 2020 2021 in the studied area changes in streamflow correspond to variations in meteorological factors kam sheffield 2016 sadri et al 2016 further intensified by long recovery times after dry conditions ahmadi et al 2019 agricultural practices poshtiri pal 2016 and storage variability apurv cai 2020 seasonal models generally follow annual changes with roughly 12 month periods however some nodes with shorter periods are present this might be related to two issues firstly the number of short and lower magnitude droughts have recently increased in number and spatial extent apurv cai 2020 brunner et al 2021 secondly due to changes in seasonal differences kam sheffield 2016 as well as quansah et al 2021 observed increases in inter annual and seasonal variability the presence of both of these issues might also explain why seasonal models were prone to significant changes in output with changes in data series length this also indicates the current limitation of the implemented method as it is unable to relate to changing lengths of intra seasonal periods indicating a possible further direction in host framework development in the study area seasonal reoccurrence is of higher importance than the occurrence of extreme drought events raczynski dyer 2022b therefore out of 60 750 studied nodes about 19 were pure seasonal models that fit best the remaining nodes had a combined best fit model accounting for both seasonal and long term cyclicity including 18 of nodes with a sloped harmonic component models were overall generally accurate having an average accuracy of about 75 with the lowest performance in complex hydrologic systems such as the appalachian mountains florida and atlantic and gulf coast regions studies performed over the southeastern united states confirm an increase in meteorological drought apurv cai 2021 and a decline in river streamflows engström et al 2021 lins slack 1999 sadeghi et al 2019 stephens bledsoe 2020 the decreasing trends could be attributed to the fact that the twentieth century was moist and scarce in severe droughts seager et al 2009 although statistical trend analysis is not carried out in this study the slope of trend models can provide a general overview of the long term tendency of drought frequency the occurrence data shows a nearly equal share of positive and negative sloped harmonics 48 6 and 51 4 respectively however the minimal flows have mostly positive slopes 60 with a general spatial relationship of increasing tendency to the east and decreasing tendency to the west of the studied area 6 conclusions because the decomposition phase was applied before finding harmonic functions the harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model framework proposed in this work is capable of capturing both seasonal and long term changes in the hydrologic data series the best fitting functions are usually the ones that combine both cycles observations show that directly applying a harmonic function to raw data representing the occurrence of streamflow drought has low explanatory power with the first harmonic explaining around 10 of the variance and the first five harmonics explaining 20 and thus cannot be used directly in modeling or forecasting the event s occurrence the decomposition step improves the quality of the harmonic function by allowing for the extraction of seasonality and trend patterns mean r 2 0 51 and r 2 0 27 respectively the mean accuracy of combined fitted models is 75 seasonal and combined models are usually not dependent on the series length with seasonality reflecting annual precipitation patterns long term trend models are stable in about half of the cases with the main differences occurring when shortening of the data split falls within the long term change period around eight years in the study period possibly related to enso but can be predicted when comparing the periods of the third and or fourth harmonic acquired from raw data the lengths of periods in established models indicate rhythms of streamflow with prolongation in the appalachian mountains and piedmont area and reduction in coastal regions the current model s limitations indicate future work directions such as the inability to reflect nonsymmetrical inter event periods caused by extending seasonal differences which could be addressed by implementing a periodic walked step calculation furthermore the current model implementation does not address vanishing events which could most likely be solved by implementing dumped harmonic functions the host model framework presented in this paper was tested on occurrence and minimal flow data the occurrence as a binary classification issue might introduce a source of bias in cases of low data aggregation times like annual or monthly aggregation with one day of occurrence this bias is to some extent controlled by decision threshold topological analysis however it will still be noticeable in cases of frequent reoccurrence of similar situations over an extended period the solution to this issue could be to include a magnitude based parameter which due to its dual type character continuous categorical could solve the occurrence length classification problem future work on improving the model framework should begin with the study of the possibility of introducing such a parameter into the host model the approach outlined in this work applies to studies focused on time series related analysis with the ability to perform analysis over the seasonality and reoccurrence patterns of the phenomenon additionally the tool allows for the description and observation of long term changes in the data initially masked by the randomness of the flow distribution and provides characteristics that can be applied to the spatial diversification of hydrological processes driving droughts in different regions overcoming framework limitations could improve the model and provide a complex time series analysis tool for modeling simulating and forecasting the occurrence of drought providing

1965,droughts due to their complex nature are difficult to predict however research is showing that there are often clearly defined patterns to their occurrence the temporal aspects are usually more apparent when comparing regions with defined climatic characteristics such as those with recognized wet or dry seasons but recognizing these patterns can help in defining and understanding the overall processes influencing drought occurrence especially in the context of climate change it is crucial to recognize temporal patterns and quantify them to help diagnose current and future event probabilities the objective of this work is to introduce a new tool for assessing temporal patterns of streamflow drought based on the harmonic oscillator theorem called the harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model the testing dataset consists of monthly minimal flows and drought occurrence information calculated based on daily flows from the national water model nwm retrospective v 2 1 dataset for the period 1979 2020 the model framework allows for trend and seasonality signal decomposition as well as the extraction of the first five harmonics by means of a fast fourier transform fft based machine learning algorithm the model framework enables the extraction and evaluation of five different harmonic models based on short and long range components as well as linear regression sloped harmonics the results show that the best fit models are based on two superimposed sinusoidal functions with an accuracy of around 70 90 for streamflow drought occurrence with different spatial parameters reflecting varied environmental conditions the models were able to capture two patterns 1 annual precipitation variation and 2 longer term inertia the latter of which is likely driven by large scale circulation with a roughly eight year period keywords host model harmonic oscillator streamflow drought seasonality trend stl decomposition data availability links are indicated in manuscript in data availability statement 1 introduction the severity of hydrological droughts is increasing as climate change progresses changes in precipitation amplify changes in streamflow affecting spatial and temporal distribution and shifting the duration and timing of high and low flow peaks byun et al 2019 gu et al 2018 tabari 2020 changes in streamflow toward more extreme conditions increase the risk of impacts to natural and man made systems due to prolonged droughts drought is expected to increase in the future regardless of the emission scenario ipcc 2022 cook et al 2020 fang et al 2018 grillakis 2019 gu et al 2018 with areas affected by extreme drought increasing more rapidly haile et al 2020 the direction of the changes in specific regions around the world is however unclear with some studies suggesting that dry regions will become drier and wet regions will accumulate more water dai 2011 haile et al 2020 marx et al 2018 theis pattern however was only detected in about 10 20 of regions around the world with a similar percentage of opposite dependence dry regions becoming wetter and wet regions drying yang et al 2019 greve et al 2014 the variation in this pattern results from the complexity of the natural environment including multiple characteristics contributing to the environmental water balance sheffield et al 2012 and affects water based economy sectors such as agriculture that are becoming more vulnerable to changing climate and therefore note year to year increasing losses arora 2019 ortiz bobea et al 2021 ray et al 2019 with further effects on gross domestic product gdp kompas et al 2018 as a result accurate forecasts of hydrological extremes become crucial for efficient planning of water management systems tabari 2021 the most important question has changed from will it occur to when will it occur an increasing number of scientific research shows evidence of cyclic reoccurrence of drought forootan et al 2019 marx et al 2018 mcmahon finlayson 2003 rad et al 2016 droughts are becoming more common in warm seasons marx et al 2018 vlach et al 2021 with precipitation and evaporation timing playing an important role in the propagation scheme apurv et al 2017 zhao et al 2019 as hydrologic regimes are observed to change toward rainfall dominance in rivers around the world future drought prolongation will change as a result brunner tallaksen 2019 in some regions of the world drought occurrence is related to the el nino southern oscillation enso chiew mcmahon 2002 2003 forootan et al 2019 piechota dracup 1996 ryu et al 2010 with streamflow correlation on interannual scales of two to eight years and maximum dryness coinciding with la nina abdelkader yerdelen 2022 the intensity direction and length of these reoccurrence periods depends on the region of the world and several local factors such as geology land cover and climatic conditions bormann pinter 2017 cervi et al 2017 dierauer et al 2018 guzha et al 2018 haslinger et al 2014 jenicek et al 2016 peña gallardo et al 2019 van loon et al 2019 wang et al 2019 additionally anthropogenic processes not only on climate change but also on streamflow as manifested in reservoir operations and intakes and outlets located in river channels has a direct impact on drought magnitudes marx et al 2018 yuan et al 2017 nevertheless the existing pattern seems to duplicate itself and persist at the moment we do not have enough observation lengths or tools to quantify the nature of cyclic hydrologic patterns or to determine whether the patterns are changing hao et al 2018 however we can observe changes in the intensity of the phenomenon manifested in the occurrence of statistically significant trends hammond et al 2022 peña angulo et al 2022 most studies agree that depending on the region of the world the intensity of hydrological extremes changes unfortunately the direction and intensity of change are not unambiguous and unified as the results of the research do not coincide for many regions of the world due to different definitions of drought or large differences across indicators of precipitation soil moisture runoff and vegetation health cook et al 2018 sometimes in the same region different studies indicate different directions of the development of the phenomenon predicting an increase or decrease in the intensity of hydrologic extremes such as drought piniewski et al 2017 the difference results most often from the different time periods used and the aforementioned cyclicality raczyński dyer 2020 in meteorological research a frequently used method to assess cyclicality is harmonic analysis harmonic analysis is often used to assess the impact of teleconnections e g enso on the seasonality of other meteorological characteristics like precipitation or the impact on streamflow around the world chiew et al 1998 chiew mcmahon 2003 garcia 2005 lee julien 2017 shrestha kostaschuk 2005 for example the first harmonic function of 24 month enso related signals in general reflects anomalies found in streamflow data chiew mcmahon 2002 2003 kahya dracup 1993 besides circulation studies harmonic analysis has successfully been used for assessment of short and long term periodic changes in precipitation or wind cycles bawiskar et al 1989 dabanlı et al 2017 mitchell et al 1979 used harmonic analysis to discover a 22 year cycle of solar activity while clark 1988 discovered the same length cycles in fire distribution kadιoğlu et al 1999 found that first and second harmonics explain over 90 of the climatological variations in turkey and similarly in jordan tarawneh kadıoğlu 2003 in saudi arabia tarawneh 2016 found around 70 of precipitation variance to be explained by the first two harmonics tase 1976 found that about 84 of precipitation variance over the upper great plains in the usa can be explained by the first three harmonics and most precipitation variance over iran by the first harmonic as found by sabziparvar et al 2015 besides water demand forecasts kozłowski et al 2018 harmonic analysis has not found wide applications in hydrology due to a rather poor goodness of fit for example abebe and foerch 2008 in their study of streamflow data over ethiopia found that the first two harmonics explain around 87 of the periodic mean variance but 17 of the total variance with a negligible portion explained by other harmonics in turkey kahya et al 2008 found that 50 of variance could be explained with applied harmonics in another study harmonics used for streamflow data reconstruction correlated weakly with streamflow data at about 14 20 young 1994 as harmonic analysis does show potential in defining hydrologic patterns especially in regions where streamflow patterns are associated with cyclic climatic conditions this paper presents a new approach to the analysis of hydrological drought using harmonics to address poor harmonic performance in general a data decomposition is performed prior to performing a harmonic fit to the data this step allows for the removal of the residuals representing random extremes and the extraction of short and long term changes in data the introduced classifier allows for the estimation of the range of the harmonic function corresponding to the occurrence of drought for minimal flow data forming a continuous dataset classical goodness of fit measures are applied the set of methods used in this study forms the harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model framework the purpose of this work is to introduce the host model framework in a hydrologic application and assess its performance in a study area the southeast united states with a range of hydrologic drivers 2 study area and data the developed methodology is verified over the southeastern part of the united states corresponding to us geological survey usgs region 3 south atlantic gulf region fig 1 this region which includes all rivers flowing to the atlantic ocean and the gulf of mexico between the james river catchment in virginia and the lower mississippi river in mississippi comprises a total area of around 724 000 km2 the research area represents a diverse landscape in terms of land use meteorological and hydrogeological conditions elevations vary between 25 and 1589 m a s l and affect regional accessibility to water with a dense river network in the north and northeast and sparse in the south the majority of streamflow comes from baseflow and only around 40 is contributed by runoff chen teegavarapu 2019 the climate is subtropical over a majority of the area with hot and humid summers and tropical characteristics in florida and along the coast of the gulf of mexico a k a the gulf coast the mean annual temperatures range between 14 c and 25 c joshi et al 2020 and annual precipitation ranges between 1000 and 2000 mm year 1 joshi et al 2020 sagarika et al 2015 the occurrence of la niña results in higher temperatures lower precipitation and stronger droughts mourtzinis et al 2016 with an increasing population growing agricultural needs and a changing climate the region faces serious water supply shortages and a substantial drought threat cook et al 2020 dai 2011 keellings engström 2019 marx et al 2018 the study data provided by the national water model nwm retrospective v2 1 dataset constitutes daily mean flows for 60 750 streamflow nodes fig 1 for the period 1 feb 1979 31 dec 2020 2 551 500 stream years the daily mean flows were calculated based on hourly mean flow values from 00 to 23 utc for each day the initial dataset contained 338 037 retrospective stream nodes hereafter nodes in the study area but the majority of these nodes had zero or null data therefore only nodes of strahler order 3 or higher with no more than 5 of missing values were considered in this study 3 methodology 3 1 streamflow drought identification a streamflow drought is a period of water levels below a specific threshold with the threshold level method tlm often used to determine the criteria value van loon 2015 for this study however an objective breakpoint approach raczyński dyer 2022a was used to estimate the low flow threshold for each node in this approach the unique shape of each node s flow duration curve fdc is considered which allows for the inclusion of environmental factors in the decision making process the fisher jenks natural breakpoint algorithm was used to objectively determine the specific flood threshold qobj the flow is considered low when its value reaches or falls below the value of qobj low flows occurring in a series forming an event are called streamflow drought van loon 2015 3 2 seasonal and trend decomposition seasonal trend decomposition using loess stl was used to decompose a single data series into three series representing trend seasonality and residuals decomposition allows for the presentation of data xt behavior on three scales describing low frequency variation in the data in conjunction with nonstationary patterns i e long term changes in data trend tt variations in data on short scales such as seasonal fluctuations seasonality st and the remaining components residuals rt that do not reflect any specific patterns and can be related for example with the occurrence of extreme events cleveland et al 1990 1 x t t t s t r t t 1 n extracted series present data behavior without distortions caused by interrelationships in the occurrence of short term and long term changes or extreme situations which in turn allows for insightful analysis of the patterns hidden in data that normally cannot be observed the stl approach allows for the extraction of nonlinear trend components changes in seasonal components over time and is robust in the presence of outliers cordeiro et al 2022 the stl decomposition method is widely used in the natural sciences as a reliable method for removing seasonal components from analyzed data series and is used to determine both seasonal and long term patterns in hydrogeological systems shamsudduha et al 2009 wunsch et al 2018 hydroclimatic studies bogning et al 2021 he et al 2022 papacharalampous et al 2021 zhou et al 2021 or flow simulation apaydin et al 2021 luo et al 2019 patidar et al 2019 xu et al 2022 zhang et al 2022 the detailed procedure for stl calculation is provided by cleveland et al 1990 3 3 harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model framework both direct flow data and decomposed data can be described using mathematical functions a special characteristic of this set is repeatability which results among others from seasonality and or large scale factors influencing water resources e g circulation and water supply from aquifers a harmonic oscillator generally described as a mechanical model with one degree of freedom can be used to describe repetitive variations in natural systems fernández guasti 2004 gitterman 2005 plebanski 1956 in terms of classical mechanics an oscillator is described by the following equation fan 2009 fernández guasti 2004 gitterman 2005 um et al 2002 2 a t ω 0 2 x t 0 where a t time dependent acceleration x t time dependent position ω0 the circular oscillation frequency of the oscillator pulsation meaning how quickly a given periodic phenomenon repeats pulsation is related to the frequency f and the period t by following relation 3 ω d θ dt 2 π t 2 π f where θ phase of oscillating motion frequency in turn describes the number of cycles of a periodic phenomenon per unit of time 4 f n t 1 β where n number of oscillations t time β period which in the case of a harmonic oscillator is equal to 5 β 2 π ω 0 on the basis of dependencies 4 and 5 it can be concluded that 6 f ω 0 2 π the commonly used solution for the harmonic oscillator equation 2 is ebaid 2010 fernández guasti 2004 gitterman 2005 7 x t a s i n ω 0 t φ with sin and cos occurring interchangeably depending on the interpretation where a amplitude represents the magnitude of the sine wave measured from center line to peak φ phase depending on the values and shifts in relation to the regular position of the sinusoid describing the motion fig 2 the final equation has the form 8 x t a s i n ω 0 t φ c where c offset a k a vertical shift representing value at which sine is concentrated after identifying the periods with streamflow drought the series were divided into two sets of data aggregated in monthly scales representing direct values of minimal flows qmin and occurrence of streamflow drought according to relation 9 occ 0 for n 0 o c c 1 for n 1 where occ occurrence of streamflow drought n number of streamflow drought episodes in aggregated period this approach assumes the occurrence of dry conditions without incorporating their magnitudes this might introduce a bias in the harmonic function depending on the resolution of the data used i e if monthly aggregated data are used the maximal difference might be 30 days 31 days of dry conditions vs one day occurrence however for weekly aggregated data the maximal difference will be only six days this bias is additionally controlled by the decision threshold applied over the function in order to transform its values according to binary classification fig 4 the oscillator form presented in 8 was used as the initial form of the function describing the behavior of variables in the analyzed period the function is then initialized over the set of its initial parameters a ω0 φ c and optimized using the fast fourier transform fft algorithm the algorithm was limited to 100 000 executable repetitions but in a few cases it was necessary to increase the limit to 500 000 repetitions for the optimized function to be correctly assigned due to the dominant character of periods without drought values of 0 constitute around 95 of data in the case of a non decomposed dataset the factors corresponding to long term and seasonal changes overlap so it may happen that the fitted oscillator function represents one of these factors for this reason a repetitive excluding fit approach was used consisting of the re fitting of the harmonic oscillator function x t 1 to the non decomposed dataset of x t reduced by the values of the matched function x t fig 4 for data series decomposed by the stl method the obtained trend can be either linear or non linear in the case of a linear trend its equation represents a simple relation 10 y α t c where α slope of the trend line in relation to the x axis c intercept with the y axis for nonlinear trends described by the harmonic oscillator function equation 8 is insufficient due to the occurrence of a factor related to the slope of the function fig 3 due to this fact the modification of equation 8 is necessary so that the linear trend is included in the equation 11 x t α t a s i n ω 0 t φ c the fit of the model to the data representing the decomposed trend was performed for the modified equation 11 if any of the model elements oscillator or linear trend were irrelevant their coefficients α or a can be zeroed resulting in the component being removed from the equation and consequently obtaining equation 8 or 10 the studied variable can be explained both by long term and seasonal changes but also by both processes simultaneously in this case the function describing the variable is the sum of the two oscillators determined for the trend and seasonality variables together with the possible factor of linear change according to the following 12 x t α trend t a trend s i n ω 0 t r e n d t φ trend a seasonality s i n ω 0 s e a s o n a l i t y t φ seasonality c this means that as a result five functions describing the examined characteristics are obtained these functions represent the following models trend data fitted model tf trend data sloped model ts seasonality data fitted model sf combined trend and seasonality fitted model cf and combined sloped trend and seasonality fitted model cs at the last stage fig 4 the values of the resulting functions are compared with the characteristics describing the original data set and the accuracy of the model is analyzed the ratio of the true model data to all observations problems at this stage may result from the interpretation of the harmonic oscillator curve representing a given model and the corresponding event characteristics does the specific function value represent the occurrence or absence of drought qmin can be considered a continuous variable while occurrence has a discrete distribution therefore these variables have to be compared to model outputs using different statistics occurrence should be considered a boolean classification problem therefore a set of accuracy statistics is used the occurrence of hydrological drought can be predicted using modeled harmonics at local maxima as well as a specific threshold value such as one that is greater than the function mean the implementation of topological analysis was introduced in walked threshold analysis fig 4 where in order to establish a threshold the values are iterated sequentially from highest to lowest at each iteration the boolean classification returns every value above the iterated threshold as an occurrence of drought bool true or 1 according to equation 9 and every value below the threshold as an absence of drought bool false or 0 according to equation 9 a set of accuracy parameters is returned precision a measure describing how many of the model predictions of occurrence are correct over all the model predictions 13 precision p 11 p 11 p 01 values of the metric range between 0 and 1 with 1 meaning that all the model predictions reflected occurrences in the raw data recall also known as sensitivity a measure describing how many of the model predictions of occurrence are correct over all occurrences in the raw data 14 recall p 11 p 11 p 10 values of the metric vary between 0 and 1 with 1 meaning that the model correctly classified all occurrences from the raw data accuracy a measure describing how many of the model s predictions of both occurrence and absence were correct 15 accuracy p 11 p 00 n values of the metric vary between 0 and 1 with 1 meaning that the model correctly classified all cases of occurrence as well as the absence of drought compared to the original data f1 score a harmonic mean of precision and recall 16 f 1 s c o r e 2 precision r e c a l l precision r e c a l l metric represents the balanced ratio between precision and recall with lower overall scores for models with one of the metrics considerably smaller than the other values range from 0 to 1 with higher values indicating a better fit of the model n is total number of values and p characteristics reflect the number of cases according to the contingency table table 1 the threshold characterized by the highest f1 score is classified as the best fit threshold for the model which minimizes the possible bias that arises due to the assessment of non magnitude drought occurrence the f1 score is then compared across all resultant models to determine which has the best fit minimal flows series qmin can be considered a continuous distribution with no threshold applied this value presents the lowest flow in a considered aggregation resolution and therefore no threshold value can assess whether the specific value represents dry or wet conditions as a result accuracy statistics are inadequate to compare the model output with qmin data the efficiency coefficient is applied in hydrological modeling widely applied measures are the nash sutcliffe efficiency nse and its modern alternative the kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 although both methods received some criticism in the literature there is still a gap in the improvement of the hydrologic decision metrics clark et al 2021 lamontagne et al 2020 liu 2020 pool et al 2018 ritter and muñoz carpena 2013 therefore for this study a modified version of the kling gupta efficiency was applied kling et al 2012 to test the differences between the model outputs relative to different lengths of the initial dataset and address the method performance under commonly used train test splits a mann whitney u test was performed the shortening was applied at every 5 step which corresponds to a 2 year reduction reducing the data series up to 50 of its original length the test null hypothesis states that the distributions of both populations are the same compared to the alternative hypothesis that the distributions are different the test u statistic described for the xi sample from the first distribution and the yj sample from the second distribution is defined as 17 u i 1 n j 1 m s x i y j where 18 s x y 1 if x y 1 2 if x y 0 if x y the full harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model framework is outlined in fig 4 all statistics were calculated using two sided α 0 05 4 results 4 1 occurrence 4 1 1 direct harmonics the first harmonic function extracted from the occurrence data series corresponds to a short change cycle with a period of around 10 12 months this period length reflects the annual occurrence of streamflow droughts in the warm season due to seasonal precipitation variations except in the appalachian mountains and coastal regions second and third harmonics reflect long term changes in 2 10 year cycles fig 5 this might be related to the groundwater cycle or general water circulation schemes in the area the long term change cycle is well visible in the appalachian piedmont area in all five extracted harmonic functions in the reminder of the area fourth and fifth harmonics presents random variability with a period between 2 and 8 months the functions fitting real data show weak correlation with most r 2 values below 0 1 the first harmonic function has the highest explained variance with a mean of 9 5 the second harmonic has a mean of r 2 0 035 and the residual has a mean of r 2 0 03 thus the first five harmonics explain on average around 21 4 of total variance ranging from 4 to 62 9 there is no correlation between function parameters and stream order with the correlation coefficient r ranging between 0 049 and 0 008 for the first function and 0 037 0 103 for the subsequent functions the correlations generally weaken with consecutive functions the lowest share of variance explained by the first five harmonics is found in coastal nodes as well as appalachian nodes reflecting the lowest fit of the hydrologic variability to cycles of harmonic functions the highest variance explained is observed in the western part of the study area in mississippi northwestern and central alabama and central georgia as well as partially in central north carolina 4 1 2 host model the percentage of variance explained by the host occurrence model has an iqr of 60 91 with an average of 78 where the seasonality component is responsible for on average 51 of variance r 2 iqr 0 42 0 63 with a median of 0 54 and the trend component 27 r 2 iqr 0 18 0 28 with a median of 0 22 fig 6 after category classification was applied based on the best fit decision threshold accuracy characteristics were calculated the cf model achieved the highest accuracy average of 74 8 while the ts model achieved the lowest average of 55 2 the highest recalls characterized the sf and cs models overall the f1 score was 0 45 for the cf model and 0 43 for the combined sloped model fig 6 regardless of model type most reached an accuracy between 70 and 90 fig 7 a group of nodes underperformed for models based on trend series only these models were characterized by an increased number of nodes with higher precision and lower recall values meaning that in general the models predicted more streamflow droughts than actually occurred most models were characterized by higher recall metrics than precision which corresponds to a greater percentage of accurate predictions compared to more frequent predictions which are not reflected in a natural occurrence pattern in most nodes precision and accuracy maintain a positive relationship with no model having high precision and low accuracy except a few nodes in ts model this property might be related to two issues 1 the nature of the event where most of the harmonic functions are interpreted as non drought periods or 2 the occurrence bias with respect to the second issue if multiple cases with a low number of days with dry conditions were consecutively included in the initialization time series contributing to lower classification thresholds and overestimation of drought reoccurrence further in time there could be an increased number of nodes with low accuracy for sloped models fig 7 that are more sensitive to changes in the occurrence distribution except for the tf model where a group of nodes is characterized by low accuracy and low recall the two characteristics remain in a strong negative relationship the correlation between the two is highest for the ts model with r 0 884 for combined models the average is r 0 765 the f1 score metric has an average correlation of r 0 925 and r 0 500 with precision and recall respectively the non combined models ts tf and sf reflect spatial relations similar to observations of raw harmonics with prolongation of function periods in the appalachian piedmont area as well as southern mississippi the seasonality periods span four years while the majority of the remaining area is characterized by an annual cycle the long term based functions indicate 8 12 year periods in the majority of the area with significant prolongation for more than 100 years in the piedmont area primarily in alabama the raw harmonics results presented earlier correspond to roughly 10 year cycles but the coverage area here extends over the entire study area fig 8 for the ts model the number of nodes with a positive slope value indicating an increase in occurrence in recent years 48 6 is nearly equal to the number of nodes with a negative slope indicating the disappearance of streamflow droughts 51 4 although there is no clear spatial pattern in the distribution of slope values most nodes with negative slopes are located in virginia and north carolina central georgia and southern mississippi and alabama in florida both types coexist in the same river systems confirming the high level of hydrologic complexity in these areas the best fitting model is characterized by the highest f1 score which reflects the best ratio between precision and accuracy the cf model was the best fitted model for the majority of nodes 37 039 nodes 61 2 of total about the same number of nodes had their distribution reflected in seasonal changes only sf model 11 559 nodes 19 1 of total and in a combined sloped model cs 10 897 nodes 18 0 of total only 333 0 55 of total nodes had ts as the best fitted model and 661 1 09 of total distributions were reflected in the sloped trend model there is no significant correlation between the best fit function type and stream order r 0 011 or any other function parameters rmax 0 057 in spatial terms however models generally perform better in all study regions besides the appalachian mountains coastal areas and florida fig 9 despite the lack of a clear spatial relationship between node locations for the best fit of seasonality models there is a difference in the performance of these types of harmonic functions in nodes affected by clear seasonal reoccurrence and with trend included fig 10 in these nodes seasonal models were on average more accurate by 19 6 than tf models 17 1 than ts models 7 1 than cs models and 0 9 than cf models 4 2 minimal flows 4 2 1 direct harmonics the assessment of the first five harmonic functions extracted from the nwm retrospective dataset reveals mostly short term behavior with periods in the first function of around 12 months this reflects the regional seasonal patterns in precipitation most of the nodes in the second function have periods of two to eight months the appalachian piedmont region is an exception with longer two to four year periods the area expands gradually with the addition of consecutive functions whereby with the fifth harmonical function included short periods are still present in the coastal regions of the carolinas and florida as well as in most small catchments in mississippi and georgia fig 11 the functions explain on average 12 3 of total variance with the first harmonic ranging from 1 7 to 45 9 and 31 7 with the first five harmonics from 9 4 to 92 6 fig 11 spatially the highest variance explained by models with the first five harmonics is for mississippi and alabama except for southern coastal areas and the appalachian piedmont through central georgia to virginia the lowest r 2 is observed in coastal area nodes as is the case with drought occurrence there is a moderate to low statistically significant correlation of function parameters and node order with offset being correlated at r 0 534 amplitude at r 0 427 and r 2 at r 0 325 for the first function these relations weaken with consecutive functions except for r 2 for which the mean correlation for all functions is r 0 308 4 2 2 host model functions based on decomposed data perform better than raw harmonic functions explaining a total of between 59 and 91 iqr of data variance with a mean r 2 0 76 the seasonal models explain a larger share with r 2 0 51 on average and iqr 0 41 0 64 median of 0 54 while trend models maintain r 2 0 27 and iqr 0 18 0 28 with a median of 0 22 fig 12 the kling gupta efficiency score used as a decision statistic to determine the best fit model varies significantly between the models raw host trend models generally have values between 5 and 3 and show no significant improvement similarly seasonality models alone have lower values with the first quartile starting at a score of 1200 this suggests that the stand alone models treated separately show no improvement of the modeled characteristic according to knoben et al 2019 values of kge greater than 0 41 indicate model improvement in the study area the combined models usually have values higher than this threshold fig 12 the rmse characteristics all had the same iqr with only the sf model having a 75th percentile higher than the other models the median for all models was at the same low level however for all the models a significant number of outliers higher than 1 5 iqr was observed these are related to the largest rivers in the study region as the highest rmse values occur in only eleven rivers the correlation between rmse and river order is statistically significant and exceeds r 0 53 for all models except tf where r 0 05 the highest correlation between raw flow data and the model predictions occurred with the cf and cs models the mean correlation for combined models was r 0 434 while the highest node specific values reached r 0 840 on the other hand the lowest correlation with flow values was observed in the tf model with rmean 0 197 and rmax 0 588 fig 12 spatially for trend models ts and tf the highest correlations occur in northern appalachia and the central and southern mississippi to georgia nodes the same can be said for seasonal models with the lowest correlation coefficients the majority of rivers are well represented by combined models with only a slight decrease in correlation for coastal nodes basic non combined models ts tf and sf show the same spatial pattern with lowest periods in nodes in southern alabama and georgia near the walter f george reservoir in this region harmonic models for trend reach periods shorter than 24 months and seasonal models shorter than 4 months these periods extend over 25 years for trend models and over 36 months for seasonal models in the area above the reservoir although not strictly in the upper catchment but rather in catchments to the northwest and northeast of the reservoir fig 13 highest periods are observed in southern mississippi over 100 years in the south central part and around 50 years in the coastal area for ts and tf models as well in northern florida seasonal model with a period of 24 36 months and in the appalachian piedmont in north carolina over 100 years for ts and tf and over 36 months for sf the slopes of the ts model present a defined spatial pattern with 38 4 of nodes identified with a negative slope and 61 6 with a positive negative slopes are present mainly in southern south carolina and eastern to southern georgia as well as in mississippi and central alabama increasing harmonic slopes for minimal flows are identified in virginia north carolina north eastern south carolina central georgia and florida except river systems originating in southern georgia within the study area the best fit models for qmin values are those that combine both long term trend and short seasonal changes lack of trend slope adaptation within the models provided the best results for 6 15 of study nodes 3723 nodes in these nodes the slope of the ts model was usually negligible and both the ts and tf models yielded the same results fig 14 a for the remainder the cs model was classified as best fitted fig 14b there is no spatial relation between cf model nodes which do not occur spatially or do not belong to specific order or catchment size rivers their spatial location appears to be random the spatial distribution of slopes in the ts model reveals three main patterns a negative slope decreasing qmin was found in 38 39 of study nodes located mainly in mississippi alabama southeastern georgia north florida and northwestern south carolina the remainder of the area 61 61 nodes was characterized by increasing slopes in ts models additionally in southern florida east to tampa and north to miami and northern south carolina central north carolina around charlotte greensboro and raleigh high trend slopes were found with extensions of function periods as indicated earlier fig 14c 4 3 time series length volatility the determined harmonical functions were based on the full 42 year long data series however when considering machine learning applications due to the need for a train test data split the volatility of the resulting models based on the input series length needs to be considered backpropagation shortening was used to shorten the studied series to cover most common train test splits the series were shortened up to 50 with steps of 5 which corresponds to about 2 years of data shortening and a mann whitney u test was used to compare values between the original full length harmonic and one determined based on the shortened series for occurrence models the binary classification results were compared and for minimal flows the direct model values were considered since the binary classification approach for the occurrence series is dependent on the decision threshold calculated as best fitted to the data the occurrence models maintain the ability to reduce the bias arising due to data length changes tested occurrence models maintain high resistance to differences of output and over 98 of all models are characterized by no significant differences between classification based on full length series and the series shortened up to 50 fig 15 minimal flow models are characterized by lower resistance to changes in data series length the combined models maintain over 80 of nodes with no statistically significant difference between the model trained for the entire data series and those trained by the shortened data series even by 50 fig 15 for this variable the cs model was characterized by higher resistance than the cf model for the trend models only about 50 60 of nodes had the same model when considering shortening by about nine years after this time the co dependence especially for ts models increases to over 80 this pattern then repeats after another 8 10 years fig 15 this corresponds to a long term change period found in the area and suggests that if the shortening is lower than the periodicity in long term relations it can lower the model s performance this behavior can however be predicted and controlled in the experiment design stage when assessing the periods of the third and fourth harmonics fig 11 5 discussion the occurrence of streamflow drought is highly variable in the southeastern united states dyer et al 2022 this can be seen when analyzing the variance explained by harmonic models the first harmonic explained only about 10 of the occurrence of streamflow drought and 12 of the variance in minimal flows the first five functions explain a total of 20 to 30 of the variance depending on the studied parameter while the seasonality and trends components of the host model explain an average of 51 and 27 of the variance respectively the main driver for streamflow distribution in this area is precipitation kam sheffield 2016 touma et al 2015 this can also be seen in the first harmonic which has roughly 12 month periods and reflects the climatic seasonal precipitation cycle this pattern can be seen in both the occurrence of drought and the distribution of minimal flows second and subsequent higher order harmonics indicate a prolongation of the water cycle in appalachian mountains piedmont catchments with extended function periods ranging from 5 to 10 years the function shape and subsequent occurrence information might indicate a multi annual or multi seasonal drought occurrence patterson et al 2013 which in turn suggests increased groundwater influence on streamflow sadri et al 2016 van loon van lanen 2012 the remaining areas particularly the coastal areas show no long term relationship in the first harmonic distribution with periods of about two months this finding reflects the observation from ford labosier 2014 that drought forecasting is difficult in the southeastern united states due to infrequent and generally weak seasonal persistence according to observations by chalise et al 2021 about 12 of seasonal streamflow and 6 of seasonal precipitation in this area is associated with tropical cyclones this could explain the weaker stability of flows in coastal areas especially in florida the carolinas and the gulf coast where tropical storm generated streamflow and precipitation are highest at 27 and 32 respectively chalise et al 2021 numerous studies confirm that streamflow in southeastern united states catchments is associated with large scale circulations like the el niño southern oscillation enso mourtzinis et al 2016 ryu et al 2010 sehgal sridhar 2018 especially during la nina events extremely dry conditions appear piechota dracup 1996 tootle et al 2005 this relationship might be reflected in the long term cycles found in the decomposed trends indicating a 4 8 year cycle depending on the location prolongation of this cycle is present in appalachian rivers with decreasing lengths toward the coasts seasonal streamflow distribution depends on local environmental conditions raczyński dyer 2020 2021 in the studied area changes in streamflow correspond to variations in meteorological factors kam sheffield 2016 sadri et al 2016 further intensified by long recovery times after dry conditions ahmadi et al 2019 agricultural practices poshtiri pal 2016 and storage variability apurv cai 2020 seasonal models generally follow annual changes with roughly 12 month periods however some nodes with shorter periods are present this might be related to two issues firstly the number of short and lower magnitude droughts have recently increased in number and spatial extent apurv cai 2020 brunner et al 2021 secondly due to changes in seasonal differences kam sheffield 2016 as well as quansah et al 2021 observed increases in inter annual and seasonal variability the presence of both of these issues might also explain why seasonal models were prone to significant changes in output with changes in data series length this also indicates the current limitation of the implemented method as it is unable to relate to changing lengths of intra seasonal periods indicating a possible further direction in host framework development in the study area seasonal reoccurrence is of higher importance than the occurrence of extreme drought events raczynski dyer 2022b therefore out of 60 750 studied nodes about 19 were pure seasonal models that fit best the remaining nodes had a combined best fit model accounting for both seasonal and long term cyclicity including 18 of nodes with a sloped harmonic component models were overall generally accurate having an average accuracy of about 75 with the lowest performance in complex hydrologic systems such as the appalachian mountains florida and atlantic and gulf coast regions studies performed over the southeastern united states confirm an increase in meteorological drought apurv cai 2021 and a decline in river streamflows engström et al 2021 lins slack 1999 sadeghi et al 2019 stephens bledsoe 2020 the decreasing trends could be attributed to the fact that the twentieth century was moist and scarce in severe droughts seager et al 2009 although statistical trend analysis is not carried out in this study the slope of trend models can provide a general overview of the long term tendency of drought frequency the occurrence data shows a nearly equal share of positive and negative sloped harmonics 48 6 and 51 4 respectively however the minimal flows have mostly positive slopes 60 with a general spatial relationship of increasing tendency to the east and decreasing tendency to the west of the studied area 6 conclusions because the decomposition phase was applied before finding harmonic functions the harmonic oscillator seasonal trend host model framework proposed in this work is capable of capturing both seasonal and long term changes in the hydrologic data series the best fitting functions are usually the ones that combine both cycles observations show that directly applying a harmonic function to raw data representing the occurrence of streamflow drought has low explanatory power with the first harmonic explaining around 10 of the variance and the first five harmonics explaining 20 and thus cannot be used directly in modeling or forecasting the event s occurrence the decomposition step improves the quality of the harmonic function by allowing for the extraction of seasonality and trend patterns mean r 2 0 51 and r 2 0 27 respectively the mean accuracy of combined fitted models is 75 seasonal and combined models are usually not dependent on the series length with seasonality reflecting annual precipitation patterns long term trend models are stable in about half of the cases with the main differences occurring when shortening of the data split falls within the long term change period around eight years in the study period possibly related to enso but can be predicted when comparing the periods of the third and or fourth harmonic acquired from raw data the lengths of periods in established models indicate rhythms of streamflow with prolongation in the appalachian mountains and piedmont area and reduction in coastal regions the current model s limitations indicate future work directions such as the inability to reflect nonsymmetrical inter event periods caused by extending seasonal differences which could be addressed by implementing a periodic walked step calculation furthermore the current model implementation does not address vanishing events which could most likely be solved by implementing dumped harmonic functions the host model framework presented in this paper was tested on occurrence and minimal flow data the occurrence as a binary classification issue might introduce a source of bias in cases of low data aggregation times like annual or monthly aggregation with one day of occurrence this bias is to some extent controlled by decision threshold topological analysis however it will still be noticeable in cases of frequent reoccurrence of similar situations over an extended period the solution to this issue could be to include a magnitude based parameter which due to its dual type character continuous categorical could solve the occurrence length classification problem future work on improving the model framework should begin with the study of the possibility of introducing such a parameter into the host model the approach outlined in this work applies to studies focused on time series related analysis with the ability to perform analysis over the seasonality and reoccurrence patterns of the phenomenon additionally the tool allows for the description and observation of long term changes in the data initially masked by the randomness of the flow distribution and provides characteristics that can be applied to the spatial diversification of hydrological processes driving droughts in different regions overcoming framework limitations could improve the model and provide a complex time series analysis tool for modeling simulating and forecasting the occurrence of drought providing

1966,land atmosphere energy and moisture exchanges exert great impacts on local and regional climate however high uncertainties exist in the recent land atmosphere interactions due to scarce observations and difficulties in modeling at high elevations and cold regions this study applied multiple high resolution reanalysis products era5 land gldas noah and clsm products and one regional climate model regcm4 to diagnose the interaction pattern and strength of seasonal soil moisture and hydroclimate on the tibetan plateau tp using a conditional correlation coefficient method and the global land atmosphere coupling experimental modeling approach a compound aggregation method is applied to recognize hot spots with strong soil moisture hydroclimate interactions among multiple data as a result the changtang plateau in the inner tp the sources of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and lancang rivers and part of the brahmaputra river basin in the south southeastern tp are diagnosed with strong land atmosphere interactions in most seasons in summer the coupling strength is stronger and the covered area is much wider and spatially continuous as the climate turns warm all applied data indicate a positive dominant soil moisture precipitation feedback and a negative soil moisture temperature feedback at the hot spots meanwhile the soil moisture runoff feedback is strong and positive at most parts of the tp especially at the hot spots and in summer evapotranspiration acts as a positive linkage in the soil moisture precipitation temperature interactions while the nexus of soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff is complicated this study contributes to understanding local land hydroclimate interactions in the high elevation and cold climate of the tp additionally the found the proposed compound aggregation method efficient for compound studies keywords tibetan plateau land atmosphere interaction soil moisture hydroclimate numerical modeling compound feedback

amsterdam methodology gleam was downloaded from https www gleam eu 1 introduction the tibetan plateau tp has been recognized as the third pole and the asian water tower it functions as the source of more than ten large rivers of asia with about one third of the world s population depending on its water the tp is experiencing a rapidly warming climate gao et al 2015 liu and chen 2000 niu et al 2004 and currently the warmest period in the past 2 000 years yao et al 2019 this warming over the tp has resulted in a chain of significant impacts on the variations of local and adjacent regional hydroclimate cycles the solid state water snow ice glacier and permafrost over tp has decreased combined with a progressively increasing active layer of permafrost and melting water gao et al 2018 you et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2013 the changes in the tp s land characteristics e g soil moisture sm temperature snow cover land use may impact the subsequent hydroclimate on daily to seasonal time scales according to the mechanisms of land atmosphere interactions koster et al 2006 liu et al 2020 seneviratne et al 2013 sun et al 2020 yao et al 2015 liu et al 2020 indicated that the thermal forcing over the tp interacts strongly with that over the iranian plateau thereby forming a coupled heating system that elevates the tropopause generates a monsoonal meridional circulation over south asia and creates conditions of large scale ascent that are favorable for asian summer monsoon development recently the land atmosphere interactions over the tp have been a hot topic in the climate science community koster et al 2006 seneviratne et al 2013 sun et al 2020 yao et al 2019 sm is an important component of the land surface and plays a vital role in land atmosphere interactions by controlling water and energy transfers in the earth system koster et al 2017 koster et al 2006 liu et al 2014 santanello jr et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2013 generally sm is measured using the volumetric soil water content by mm3 mm3 climate warming over the tp has influenced sm bai et al 2019 li et al 2020 melati et al 2019 which in turn impacts the subsequent hydroclimate cycle through evapotranspiration et liu et al 2014 talib et al 2021 yang et al 2011 yao et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 exploring sm atmosphere interactions over the tp is of great significance for advancing our understanding of the influence of the tp s warming on the regional and global hydroclimate in land atmosphere interactions the sm air temperature feedback is well understood while the impact of land surface on precipitation p is complicated as it involves hydrological processes over land and dynamic and thermodynamic processes in the atmosphere koster et al 2017 koster et al 2006 may et al 2017 santanello jr et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2013 both observations and numerical modeling indicate a negative sm air temperature feedback specifically higher sm results in higher et and therefore larger evaporative cooling leading to a lower air temperature response a framework of sm p feedback was set up by seneviratne et al 2010 which divided the process into three links the relationship of sm anomalies with the subsequent et anomalies sm et the et anomalies with the subsequent p anomalies et p and the p anomalies with the subsequent sm anomalies p sm the first two links constitute sm p coupling while all three links complement the sm p feedback where et acts as the linkage dirmeyer 2011 guo et al 2006 liu et al 2017a liu et al 2014 mei and wang 2012 the sm et link is generally positive especially at the climatic transitional zones between dry and wet koster et al 2006 guo et al 2006 liu et al 2014 the p sm link is also positive but includes some exceptions due to the rainfall runoff rof mechanisms bras 1990 hillel 1998 for example in areas with wet and saturated soil increased p leads to surface rof rather than sm in cases with intense p that exceeds the infiltration rate it would result in surface rof instead of sm as well bras 1990 under extreme drought conditions when the soil cracked p may infiltrate and bypass the surface zone hillel 1998 therefore a relationship between sm and rof exists in the p sm link liu et al 2017a and xiao et al 2020a indicate a positive sm rof relationship the et p connection is the most complicated and contains uncertainties due to the complex physical processes including changes in albedo net radiation latent heat flux sensible heat flux boundary layer height and moist static energy density mei and wang 2012 liu et al 2014 santanello jr et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 a positive sm p feedback scenario diminishes the capability of a system to regulate its moisture content and vice versa in the negative scenario therefore convective p is more likely to develop in an area with negative sm p feedback when the soils are dry alessi et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 several studies have been carried out to investigate the mechanism and strength of land atmosphere interaction over the tp based on in situ measurements remote sensing images and numerical simulations chen et al 2019 koster et al 2006 li et al 2017 ma et al 2009 seneviratne et al 2013 sun et al 2021 sun et al 2020 tang et al 2020 yang et al 2011 zhong et al 2019 most studies indicate positive sm et sun et al 2020 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 and p sm relationships bai et al 2019 li et al 2020 melati et al 2019 however sm p coupling and feedback is complicated and the findings over the tp are not conclusive for example the typical global land atmosphere coupling experiment glace koster et al 2006 and glace cmip5 seneviratne et al 2013 diagnosed the tp as a hot spot with strong positive land atmosphere coupling in summer sun et al 2020 stated that the increased sm would lead to an increase in et while decreasing the maximum daytime planetary boundary layer pbl height resulted in increased cloudiness and decreased cloud water content at the special underlying surface in the central tp according to a local land atmosphere feedback framework defined by santanello jr et al 2011 sun et al 2020 also found that the spatial distributions of monthly mean pbl energy budgets over the tp are strongly influenced by sm in the rainy season during which the relatively dry soil is more favorable for the formation of convective clouds than wetter soil conditions talib et al 2021 highlighted the importance of intraseasonal sm dynamics on the tp they indicated that the decreased sm during a regional dry event would increase surface sensible heat flux leading to a deepening of the pbl and the development of a heat low these studies provide some knowledge about land atmosphere interactions on the tp however two main problems were raised in these studies the first and most important one is that the existing hydroclimate stations over the tp are biased and sparsely distributed due to the harsh environmental conditions high elevations complex topography and heterogeneous surfaces ma et al 2009 sun et al 2021 yang et al 2011 currently the observed data are not enough to diagnose the land atmosphere feedbacks on a spatial scale moreover the predictive power of land surface and global climate models for the tp is hampered gu et al 2020 qiu 2013 therefore the land atmosphere coupling patterns and strength over the tp are not conclusive secondly most of the existed studies focused on only one or two processes of the local land atmosphere interaction such as the spatial distribution and temporal evolutions of sm and surface fluxes ma et al 2009 yang et al 2011 zhong et al 2019 or the possible influence of soil conditions on the pbl cloud and p under special weather conditions chen et al 2019 li et al 2017 sun et al 2021 sun et al 2020 tang et al 2020 several studies have indicated the importance of initial sm conditions on the partitioning of p into rof liu et al 2017a xiao et al 2020a xiao et al 2020b the impact of land atmosphere interaction on the subsequent surface and subsurface hydrological cycle such as the interaction between sm and rof have rarely been investigated therefore a comprehensive recognition of the local sm hydroclimate interaction regime is required on the tp with the development of remote sensing data assimilation and numerical modeling techniques multiple high resolution reanalysis data have been produced and are available online for land atmosphere interaction research such as the era5 land reanalysis data munoz sabater et al 2021 https cds climate copernicus eu and the nasa global land data assimilation system gldas products https disc gsfc nasa gov rodell et al 2004 era5 land is a reanalysis product that provides a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared with era5 munoz sabater et al 2021 the spatial and temporal resolutions of era5 land are 0 1 degree and 1 h respectively gldas data can provide optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes with advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 the newly published gldas versions 2 0 and 2 1 have finer spatial resolution 0 25 degree and selectable temporal resolutions including 3 hourly daily and monthly both era5 land and gldas products have been widely used in hydrometeorological studies since their release jiao et al 2021 li et al 2022b liu et al 2017a liu et al 2015 qi et al 2018 xin et al 2022 xin et al 2021 yang et al 2021 however they have rarely been compared and applied in land atmosphere interaction studies in high elevation and cold climate areas this study investigates the compound sm hydroclimate interaction regime over tp at the seasonal time scale by applying the recently published era5 land the new version of gldas and one regional climate model regcm version 4 developed by the abdus salam international center for theoretical physics ictp giorgi et al 2012 two different approaches are applied first the statistical conditional correlation coefficient method proposed by mei and wang 2011 2012 and later improved in liu et al 2014 is applied to all the reanalysis data and the regcm4 model simulation secondly the typical glace designed by koster et al 2006 is reconstructed based on the regcm4 model a common compound aggregation method is suggested to diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength among the applied multiple data based on statistical conditional correlation coefficient metrics three objectives are pursued 1 evaluate the performance of the applied reanalysis data era5 land and gldas products and the regional climate model simulation over the tp 2 diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength over the tp on the sub seasonal to seasonal time scales 3 identify the hot spots with strong sm hydroclimate interaction this study suggests a novel

southern xinjiang and western sichuan the average elevation exceeds 4000 m above sea level land use mainly consists of short grass to evergreen needleleaf or deciduous needleleaf trees at the southeast tp along the sources of the huanghe also called yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra river basins and part of the southeast changtang plateau semi desert characterizes the land use in the remaining changtang plateau the upper indus river basin and part of the south tarim basin land use is defined as desert in the north along the kunlun mountains and qaidam basin low air temperatures high diurnal temperature range and low seasonal temperature variations are the main climate characteristics of the tp xie and zhu 2013 westerlies and asian monsoons are the two dominant factors that influence the local climate and environment over the tp deng and zhang 2018 as a special climate unit the tp exerts a profound impact on the asian monsoon and the global climate due to its huge terrain and strong thermal effects on land atmosphere ocean interactions liu et al 2020 yao et al 2015 yang et al 2011 divides the tp region into four climate zones according to the mean annual p amount arid with p lower than 200 mm semi arid with p within 200 400 mm semi humid with p within 400 800 mm and humid with p above 800 mm as a result the southeast is recognized as the humid zone while the northwest is the arid zone and the remaining inner tp as semi humid and semi arid zones based on the observed annual total p amount at china meteorological administration stations to better recognize the sm hydroclimate interaction at tp the study area is divided into nine sub regions fig 1 and table 1 2 2 model and data description due to the lack of observed data one regional

et and root zone sm to evaluate the reanalysis data and model simulations 3 methodologies 3 1 conditional correlation coefficient method the probability density function pdf of the conditioned correlation coefficient method promoted by mei and wang 2011 2012 and later improved by liu et al 2014 is applied to diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength over the tp the advantage of this method is that it can examine different segments the terrestrial segment for the sm et link the atmospheric segment for the sm p sm t2m link and the internal segment for the sm rof link in addition this method is suitable to diagnose the coupling strength at intrinsic time scales ranging from days to weeks and can focus on extreme conditions divided by normal medium or abnormal too much or too little total p at different time scales as stated in previous literature liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017b mei and wang 2011 2012 mei and wang 2011 land atmosphere coupling is much stronger during years with larger p anomalies this study addresses the sm hydroclimate interaction under extreme p conditions by dividing the time series of the whole study period into the outer and inner quantiles based on the total seasonal p in each year the conditional correlation during the whole study period is also investigated to better understand coupling over the tp the 1 day sm and the subsequent 21 day average of climate variables p t2m et rof derived from each data set i e era5 land noah clsm regcm4 simulation were paired up in the conditional correlation analysis to accommodate potential comparison of results with those of previous studies findell and eltahir 1997 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017b mei and wang 2012 mei and wang 2011 according to liu et al 2014 and mei and wang 2011 2012 the conditional correlation coefficient related metrics can be calculated according to the following steps initially the raw gridded data for the whole study period are preprocessed by the following three steps first the daily p t2m et and rof in each data set i e era5 land noah clsm regcm4 simulation are accumulated into the 21 day average means of each variable to pair with the corresponding antecedent 1 day lagged sm for example for the sm on june 1 the paired corresponding 21 day p is accumulated between june 2 and june 22 secondly both the 1 day sm and the 21 day accumulated climate variables i e p t2m et rof are normalized using the mean and standard deviation corresponding to the time of the year to remove the seasonal cycle third the time series of the paired data in each season during the study period are divided into different categories whole outer and inner using the grid based seasonal p as the criterion to rank the years the whole ensemble contains all the data without categorization the outer category contains the years during which the total seasonal p ranked in the first and fourth quartiles while the inner category contains the remaining years in the second and third quartiles in this study the whole study period is 30 years during 1980 2010 therefore in the whole data pool the total number of data pairs e g 1 day sm and subsequent 21 day p is 92 30 in spring mam march april and may and summer jja june july august 91 30 in autumn son september october november and 90 30 in winter djf december january february while in the outer and inner category the total number of data pairs are 92 15 in spring and summer 91 15 in autumn and 90 15 in winter following these preprocesses the pdf of the conditional correlation between 1 day sm and the subsequent 21 day climate variables is estimated in each category and for each grid cell for one correlation value estimation 32 data pairs are randomly selected without replacement from each category whole outer inner with a constraint to exclude the temporal overlapping of climate variables between any two data pairs for example in the outer category in summer if the pair of data with sm on june 2 and p during june 3 to june 23 in some year is drawn the closest neighboring data pair that can be potentially drawn is on june 23 with p during june 24 to july 14 in the same year these 32 data pairs are used to calculate a corresponding correlation between 1 day sm and subsequent 21 day p this procedure is repeated 10 000 times to produce the pdf of the conditional correlation the correlation coefficient at the peak probability density abbreviated as pc is selected to represent the sm hydroclimate interaction strength one index named si defined as the probability of the correlation coefficient being negative positive when the pc value is positive negative is selected to indicate the significance of the pc value in this study for each grid cell the pc values with si lower than 0 1 are considered significant positive pc values indicate positive feedback between sm and the selected hydroclimate variable i e p et t2m rof while negative indicates negative feedback the magnitude of pc values indicates the strength of coupling between sm and the related hydroclimate variable as illustrated by liu et al 2017b the correlation coefficient metric cannot represent the physical causality between sm and the hydroclimate variables the feedback here only indicates the possible association between them for sm p coupling positive feedback potentially implies that the increased decreased antecedent sm may lead to the increasing decreasing of p on the subsequent sub seasonal to seasonal time scales as indicated in previous literature koster et al 2017 koster et al 2006 santanello jr et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2013 talib et al 2021 yang et al 2011 yao et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 et acts as a potential link for the coupling between sm and hydroclimate variables the index p c e t σ e t proposed by liu et al 2014 is used to evaluate the strength of the terrestrial segment in land atmosphere coupling where p c e t measures the impact of sm on et and σ e t measures the range of et variation according to previous literature guo et al 2006 dirmeyer 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 sun et al 2020 sm majorly influences the climate is through its impact on et which then influences the atmospheric boundary layer and convective processes therefore for strong sm atmospheric interaction both p c e t and σ e t should be suitably large which leads to large p c e t σ e t in this study σ e t is derived from the same conditional quartiles as p c e t for consistency with the other pc index i e p c p p c t p c r o f for each grid cell when the si for the p c e t is lower than 0 1 the sm et feedback is considered significant based on the p c e t σ e t index 3 2 compound aggregation method description a common aggregation method is proposed to diagnose compound sm hydroclimate interaction among multiple datasets based on the conditional correlation coefficient method using the grid based pc value and si the compound feedback indices abbreviated as cfi including interacting pattern abbreviated as ip consistent indicator abbreviated as ci compound coupling pattern abbreviated as ccp and compound coupling strength abbreviated as ccs characterize the sm hydroclimate interaction regime according to the pc values in each dataset ip has three different members positive negative and nan the sign function sgn is applied to categorize the characteristics of the sm hydroclimate interaction ip ci aggregates the consistency of pc signals among the applied data the schematic framework to derive the compound coupling pattern and strength among the applied data is presented in fig 2 and briefly described as follows first the ip signals of sm x at ith grid cell from the jth dataset are categorized using equation 2 then the ci x i are calculated using equation 3 and the ratio of positive signals r p 1 x i negative signals r p 2 x i and nan signals r p 3 x i respectively using equation 4 the grid based total ratio should equal 1 according to equation 5 among the applied multi data sources next equation 6 is used to categorize the ccp and equation 7 is used to calculate the ccs 2 ip x i j s g n

p c x i j at the ith grid cell among all the applied data r p 1 to r p 3 represent the ratio of positive negative and nan signal of x at the ith grid cell in this study four different data set are applied to investigate the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength the area with continuous ccp positive or negative is considered as a hot spot while the coupling strength is reflected by the ccs the significance of ccp and ccs is measured using the si index the ip index is recalculated using equation 8 to distinguish the ip index from the nonsignificant ip the significant ip is abbreviated as ips in equation 8 the significant ccp and ccs are then recalculated using equation 3 through equation 7 by substituting ip with ips in these equations 8 ips x i j s g n p c x i j 1 pc x

regcm4 conducted by liu et al 2014 is summarized here to better illustrate sm hydroclimate interaction in different seasons on the tp the purpose of glace 1 type experiment is to separate the impact of land surface conditions on the subsequent synoptic to seasonal hydroclimate variables this experiment includes two ensembles w and s which each contain 16 ensemble members the 16 year period during 1986 2001 was used to initialize the corresponding experiments in w w1 w2 w16 and s s1 s2 s16 in each season with the initial atmospheric conditions generated by the control run at the beginning of each season the lateral boundary forcing from nnrp and gisst sea surface temperature forcing from the year 1994 are adopted as the lateral boundary conditions the year 1994 is chosen because it is neither an el niño nor a la niña year the sm at each soil layer from one w ensemble named w1 is abstracted at each step and then prescribed as the input for each step of each season for each s ensemble the year 1986 was selected randomly as the w1 ensemble the diagnostic metric ω defined by koster et al 2002 was adopted to measure the intra ensemble similarity of variables of interest i e p temperature rof and et the difference δ ω v between s and w ensembles is used to quantify the sm impact on the atmospheric variable v the simulated data at the first week of each ensemble member in each season were discarded to avoid problems associated with initial shocks to the modeled atmosphere the initial glace was designed to examine the sm s control on synoptic scale hydrometeorological variables which lasts about one week the remaining data were aggregated into time series of six days a new summation method of slack overlapping time series was applied to obtain the time series of six day totals instead of the strict non overlapped method used by liu et al 2014 for example for the summer season june july and august with a total of 92 days the first 8 days are discarded as the spin up days the remaining days from june 9 to august 31 are used to aggregate the six day totals the first six day total is the summation from june 9 to june 14 while the second six day total is the summation from june 10 to june 15 which differs from the old method that totaled from june 15 to june 20 therefore in the new summation method the time series of six day totals expanded from the original 14 to 79 for each member each ensemble w or s has 16 such time series similar to the conditional correlation coefficient the pdf method was applied to obtain the peak glace metric δ ω v for each grid cell the procedure to produce δ ω v is described as follows first 14 data pairs the maximum amount of data without overlapping from the 79 data pairs in each member in the w and s ensemble each having 16 members were randomly selected without replacement with a constraint to exclude the temporal overlapping of climate variables between any two data pairs these 14 16 data pairs are used to calculate one δ ω v metric using equation 9 and equation 10 this procedure is repeated 10 000 times to determine the pdf of δ ω v for each grid cell then δ ω v at the peak probability density is selected to present the sm hydroclimate coupling meanwhile the si defined as the ratio of the peak δ ω v being negative positive when the peak δ ω v is positive negative is promoted to indicate the significance of sm hydroclimate 9 ω v 16 σ v 2 σ v 2 15 σ v 2 10 δ ω v ω v s ω v w in equation 9 the ω v index is estimated to quantify the similarity of the 16 time series within each ensemble σ v 2 is the variance of the ensemble averaged time series for the variable v which is estimated based on a time series of 14 six day totals each representing the average across the 16 members and σ v 2 is the variance of all the 14 16 six day totals as such the difference of δ ω v in the ω v index between the w and s ensembles measures the degree to which sm controls the temporal variation of the climate variable for consistency with the conditional correlation metric pc and compound coupling analysis the glace index derived from the 21 day totals is also considered in which the total time series in each ensemble w and s is 64 16 while 4 16 data pairs from each ensemble were randomly selected to get one δ ω v here four is the maximum number of data pairs that can be selected from one member in each ensemble with the constraint to exclude the temporal overlapping of climate variables at the 21 day timescale in each season 4 conditional correlation coefficient results analysis 4 1 overview of soil moisture hydroclimate interaction in the study area the sm within 1 m depth from the era5 land gldas noah and clsm products as well as the regcm4 simulation is used to analyze the pattern and strength of sm hydroclimate interactions over the tp using the conditional correlation coefficient method the empirical cumulative distribution cdf and histogram are applied to overview the sm hydroclimate interactions in the whole study area over the tp while the ratio of the pc index at specific constraints is used to further diagnose the sm hydroclimate interactions in the nine sub regions fig 1 according to the cdf and histogram of the pc index fig 3 and fig 4 sm hydroclimate interactions in the whole study area are dominated by positive sm p feedback combined with negative sm t2m feedback positive sm rof and sm et feedback in most seasons and in most data sets in the outer quartile such interaction is slightly strengthened in summer and weakened in winter according to the increased decreased ratio of positive sm p feedback in summer winter combined with an increased decreased ratio of negative sm t2m feedback and an increased ratio of positive sm rof and sm et feedback as stated in previous literature mei and wang 2012 guo et al 2006 koster et al 2006 2011 the land atmosphere interaction would be enhanced in the warm season while weakened in the cold season due to the different sm et coupling strengths in different climate regimes among the applied data era5 land presents a slightly higher ratio of positive sm p feedback in summer and negative sm t2m and sm et feedback in summer and autumn the regcm4 simulation implies a lower ratio of positive sm p feedback in spring but slightly higher ratio in winter meanwhile it indicates a positive dominated sm t2m feedback in most seasons especially in spring and winter and a slightly higher ratio of positive stronger sm rof feedback in most seasons except spring the clsm indicates slightly stronger positive sm et feedback in each season especially in summer and autumn and the ratio for the magnitude of p c e t σ e t above 0 5 is close to 80 the si index is applied to indicate the significance of sm hydroclimate interactions in the study area as defined in the methodology the pc value with si lower than 0 1 is considered significant as shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the ratio for the sm p and sm t2m feedback with si lower than 0 1 is slightly lower compared to that of sm rof and sm et feedback in each season from each data set specifically most data sets indicate over 30 of the grid cells showed significant positive sm p feedback in each season the ratio of pc p with si lower than 0 1 is above 50 based on era5 land in spring and summer or based on clsm in spring for the sm t2m feedback the ratio of significant negative pc t with si lower than 0 1 is above 40 in each season based on era5 land clsm and noah while within 20 30 based on the regcm4 simulation in spring summer and autumn for the sm rof and sm et feedbacks over 50 of the grid cells passed the 0 1si test especially in summer and autumn where the ratio of si lower than 0 1 is above 80 for the sm rof feedback from most data sets compared with the outer quartile the sm hydroclimate interaction in the inner quartile or the whole data pool is slightly weakened especially for sm p and the sm t2m coupling according to the cdf figure s11 and figure s12 in the supplementary materials and histogram figure s13 and figure s14 in the supplementary materials as shown the cdf for the sm p coupling in the inner quartile figure s11 or the whole data pool figure s12 is slightly shifted to be negative with a decreased ratio of positive feedback in each season from each data set while the cdf for the sm t2m coupling is shifted to be positive in each season for most data sets with a decreased ratio of negative feedback the sm rof and sm et coupling is still dominated by positive feedback in most seasons for most data sets but with a slightly weakened ratio of high magnitude the cdf for the si index further demonstrates the weakened sm hydroclimate interactions in the inner and whole data pool according to the decreased ratio of pc values with si lower than 0 1 the histogram also indicates similar weakened sm hydroclimate interaction in the inner quartile figure s13 or the whole data pool figure s14 in each season the pc values for the sm p and sm t2m coupling shown in the histogram are more concentrated in the zones around zero while the zones for the sm rof and sm et coupling are slightly shifted to the left side of zero with a decreased ratio of positive feedback meanwhile the number of grid cells with si lower than 0 1 for the sm hydroclimate interaction in the inner quartile or whole data pool is clearly decreased especially for sm p and sm t2m coupling consistent with the findings stated in previous literature mei and wang 2012 liu et al 2014 sm hydroclimate interactions over the tp is also enhanced in extreme climate conditions i e too much or too little p the ratio of the pc index categorized by specific constraints table s1 1 to table s3 4 in the supplementary in the nine sub regions also indicate positive sm hydroclimate interaction including positive sm et p rof feedback and negative sm t2m feedback in the outer quartile in most seasons fig 5 such positive interaction is weakened in the inner quartile figure s15 or the whole data pool figure s16 especially the sm p and sm t2m feedbacks the spatial distribution of the pc index with si lower than 0 1 in each season from each data set in the outer quartile fig 6 to fig 9 inner quartile and whole data pool figure s17 to figure s20 in the supplementary further demonstrates these findings therefore in the following we focus on the sm hydroclimate interaction regime in the outer quartile 4 2 soil moisture hydroclimate interacting regime comparison according to the distribution of the pc index with si lower than 0 1 fig 6 to fig 9 and its ratio in the nine sub regions fig 5 table s1 1 to s1 4 in the supplementary the sm hydroclimate interactions in the study area are dominated by significant positive sm et sm p and sm rof feedback and negative sm t2m feedback however the coupling is spatially and temporally heterogeneous from different data sets in different seasons the comparison and discussion for each coupling is provided as follows a sm p and sm t2m feedback sm p and sm t2m coupling from the era5 land fig 6 is much more spatially continuous and stronger in spring summer and autumn when compared with the gldas products noah fig 7 clsm fig 8 and the regcm4 simulation fig 9 most of hot spots are located at the semi humid to semi arid i e changtang plateau or humid to semi humid mid sources of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins climate transition zones specifically the hot spot with strong positive sm p feedback detected by the era5 land product is located on the changtang plateau and part of mid sources of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins in spring this coupling strength is enhanced in summer in the midwestern tp including the changtang plateau tarim basin and brahmaputra river basin while slightly weakened at the sources of mid river basins however as the climate turns colder in autumn and winter the sm p feedback tends to be weak and scattered the only positive hot spot observed in autumn is located in part of the changtang plateau while the feedback at the whole study area is not significant or even negative in winter the sm t2m feedback is dominantly negative in spring summer and autumn its hot spot is located in part of the changtang plateau in spring and autumn while located in most of the midwestern tp including the changtang plateau tarim qaidam basin and brahmaputra river basin in summer there are also some positive sm t2m feedbacks shown in spring and winter at some places which may be caused by the local climate regimes in cold climates the interaction between soil surface and the atmospheric processes through direct soil evaporation may be interrupted by snow cover or glaciers the main interaction takes place through the impact of sm on transpiration of evergreen trees the hot spot with significant positive sm p feedback or negative sm t2m feedback almost overlaps with the area with strong positive sm et feedback this successfully illustrates the linkage of et in land atmosphere interactions the hot spot with positive sm p feedback based on the noah data is mainly located in the mid changtang plateau in spring and summer and parts of the lower sources of the mekong and salween river basins in summer and autumn while the hot spot with strong negative sm t2m feedback is located at part of the middle to lower brahmaputra and salween river basins in spring summer and autumn and part of the western qaidam basin in summer clsm indicates some hot spots of positive sm p feedback on the changtang plateau and part of northern tarim basin in spring and some scattered signals at the yangtze mekong and salween river basins and the changtang plateau in summer the hot spots with negative sm t2m feedback based on clsm almost agree with those based on noah for each season compared to the reanalysis products the sm p feedback based on the regcm4 simulation is spatially scattered and the sm t2m feedback is quite weak and mixed with both positive and negative signals over most of the tp the hot spot with positive significant sm p feedback is located mainly over part of the changtang plateau and the upper source of yellow river basin in summer and over the mid changtang plateau to part of the southern tarim basin in autumn while over the northern tp within the tarim and qaidam basins in winter b sm rof feedback positive dominated sm rof feedback is observed over the tp in each season from all the applied data fig 6 to fig 9 compared with the sm p and sm t2m feedback the sm rof feedback from each data set is much more spatially continuous and stronger according to the pc values especially in summer and autumn the pc rof is above 0 5 in most parts of the tp in summer and autumn according to most applied data sets except clsm which shows slightly weaker coupling strength with the pc values within 0 25 0 5 in most areas the sm rof coupling is slightly weakened in spring and winter when the climate turns cold the hot spot with positive sm rof feedback based on the era5 land data is located mainly on the changtang plateau and the southern periphery of the tp along the brahmaputra river basin in spring while located in the south southeastern tp along the brahmaputra and the lower sources of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins in winter the signal based on noah is weak in spring and winter with the only hot spot located at part of the upper source of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins and part of the southeastern periphery of the tp in spring and autumn clsm indicates positive sm rof feedback in most of the tp in spring but with less strength correlation within 0 25 0 5 while presenting some strong feedback in the south southeastern periphery of the tp along the brahmaputra and the lower sources of yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins in winter the sm rof coupling strength is strong in winter based on the regcm4 simulation which is above 0 5 in most parts of the tp except part of the upper sources of the yangtze and lancang river basins c sm et feedback positive dominated sm et feedback is observed over the tp in each season from each applied data the hot spot with strong positive sm et feedback based on era5 land data fig 6 is located mainly on the changtang plateau and part of the tarim qaidam basin in spring summer and autumn while the signals in winter tend to be weak or even negative meanwhile the hot spot with positive sm et feedback based on gldas noah data fig 7 in summer and autumn is more spatially continuous than that based on era5 land covering most parts of the tp while the signals in spring and winter share similar spatial patterns with those of era5 land gldas clsm presents even stronger sm et feedback in each season according to its spatially continuous positive and higher magnitude pc values above 0 5 over the whole tp fig 8 the sm et feedback based on the regcm4 simulation is also dominantly positive with the hot spots located mainly at the changtang plateau and tarim and qaidam basins in each season fig 9 additionally the sm et feedback from most applied data era5 land gldas noah regcm4 simulation tends to be weakly positive or even negative in the southeastern tp along the mid to lower reaches of the brahmaputra salween and mekong river basins in most seasons especially in summer this phenomenon may be caused by the local environmental and climatic conditions as well as the vegetation type the results found that most of the area with weak sm et feedback is within the wet area which has a total annual p above 25 mm month with most of the p occurring in summer with the average amount above 100 mm month figure s2 in the supplementary materials in addition the land and vegetation type in most of this area is covered with tundra and ice caps or glaciers and short grass which may influence the local sm et feedback according to previous literature berg and sheffield 2019 krakauer et al 2010 yang et al 2018 zou et al 2018 sm et feedback is complex and nonlinear and may be impacted by the local environmental and climatic conditions yang et al 2018 indicated that the change in et is limited by sm in the dry regions while limited by energy in the wet regions the non negligible negative sm p feedback physically depends on the complex sm et correlation in the dry and wet regions and the cause varies based on the environmental and climatic conditions li et al 2014 found that on the loess plateau et is very sensitive to surface sm where the temporal persistence of et has a higher positive correlation 0 537 with surface sm temporal persistence under dry conditions but a higher negative correlation 0 621 under wet conditions krakauer et al 2010 confirmed that the synoptic variations in sm have a substantial impact on the mean climate state owing to the nonlinearity of the dependence of et on sm berg and sheffield 2019 fan et al 2020 pu and dickinson 2014 and zou et al 2018 indicated that vegetation is also a major component of the climate system owing to its controls on the energy and water balance over land as stated by berg and sheffield 2019 canopy interception contributes a positive term to the sm et coupling reflecting the noncausal rainfall forced positive correlation between sm and canopy interception fan et al 2020 stated that the sensitivity of air temperature to sm varies greatly in different vegetation coverage areas d mechanism of evapotranspiration in land atmosphere interaction as discussed previously sm hydroclimate coupling in winter is spatially scattered and weak compared to other seasons due to the cold climate regime this finding is consistent with previous literature mei and wang 2012 guo et al 2006 koster et al 2006 2011 which stated that land atmosphere interactions are slightly stronger in warm climate conditions due to strong sm et coupling in land atmosphere interactions et acts as a linkage between the land and the atmosphere for sm t2m coupling the higher sm results in higher evaporation and larger evaporative cooling leading to a negative relationship between sm and surface temperature for sm p coupling most studies indicate a positive relationship between sm and p koster et al 2006 guo et al 2006 liu et al 2014 sun et al 2020 the higher sm causes decreased albedo and increased net radiation leading to an increasing of latent heat flux decreasing of sensible heat flux and therefore decreasing pbl height finally resulting in increased moist static energy and total p sun et al 2020 evaluated the interactions between sm surface fluxes pbl growth and the formations of convective clouds and p at one local land atmosphere interaction observation site bj nagqu 31 37 degreesn 91 9 degreese on the tp and found that the increased initial sm increased the mean et increased latent heat but decreased sensible heat and decreased the maximum daytime pbl height however some studies i e cook et al 2006 also indicate that the shift of surface fluxes from sensible to latent heat and the resulting decrease of the boundary layer depth would inhibit p by increasing atmospheric stability and reducing moist convergence in this study most data imply positive sm p feedback and negative sm t2m feedback in spring summer and autumn the area with strong sm p and sm t2m feedback almost overlaps with the area with strong positive sm et feedback fig 6 to fig 9 demonstrating the linkage of et in local land atmosphere interactions et also plays a vital role in the local and adjacent hydrological cycle which exerts significant impact on local rof according to the hydrological cycle rof can be approximately calculated with the equation rof p sm et therefore the relationships among rof sm and et are complicated a negative relationship may exist between rof and et in this study fig 6 to fig 9 the hot spot with strong positive sm rof feedback from each applied data are more spatially continuous than the area with positive sm et feedback especially in summer and autumn the areas with weak positive or even negative sm et feedback also reflect strong positive sm rof feedback from each dataset i e the southeastern tp in summer and autumn in the budyko hypothesis the changes in rof are assumed to be sensitive to the changes in p and et budyko 1974 additionally the changes in rof are also sensitive to the soil conditions i e sm soil cracks and soil temperature and other hydroclimate variables e g surface air temperature solar radiation specific humidity and wind speed huang et al 2016 liu et al 2017a yang and yang 2011 liu et al 2017a indicated that the initial sm can impact the subsequent sub seasonal to seasonal rof over asia rof is more sensitive to p compared to the other hydroclimatic variables et t2m solar radiation specific humidity and wind speed especially in the semi humid to humid climate transition zones a positive sm rof feedback was detected over the tp where the initial wet dry sm anomalies would lead to an increase decrease of rof in the subsequent 1 month to 4 month time koster and suarez 1999 indicated the possibility of land atmosphere feedback in the complex relationship among rof p and et based on the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 therefore increased p leads to a positive relationship with rof in this notation et may exert a positive relationship on p which would lead to a positive relationship to rof the positive sm rof correlation over most parts of the study area in each season is reasonable according to the storage of sm and the strong land atmosphere interactions over these regions the area with positive sm p feedback always presents positive sm rof feedback such phenomena also indicate the importance of sm in the partitioning of p into rof and et 4 3 compound soil moisture hydroclimate interacting regime diagnosis according to the pc index the strength of sm hydroclimate interactions based on different data are spatially heterogenous in each season to better recognize sm hydroclimate interactions over the tp the ccp and ccs are defined to characterize the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength among multiple data sources under different conditions the ccp and ccs of the inner quartile figure s21 in the supplementary and the whole data set figure s22 in the supplementary consistently reflect weak and less spatially continuous hot spots compared to those of the outer quartile fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the land atmosphere interaction over the tp is dominated with positive sm p sm rof and sm et feedback combined with negative sm t2m feedback in most seasons the sm p and sm t2m feedbacks are insignificant in most parts of the tp while the sm rof and sm et feedbacks passed the 0 1si significance test at most hot spots with strong positive signals by comparison the sm p coupling strength is stronger in spring and summer with the hot spot mainly located at the changtang plateau such coupling is weakened in autumn and winter when the climate turns colder similar to sm p coupling sm t2m coupling strength is also stronger in spring and summer the hot spot is located mainly at the changtang plateau in spring and shifts to the north northwestern tarim basin and to the south southeastern brahmaputra and lower sources of the yangtze mekong and lancang river basins in summer sm t2m coupling is mixed with both positive and negative feedback in autumn and winter due to the cold climate regime sm rof coupling is dominantly positive over most parts of the tp especially in summer and autumn sm et is diagnosed with positive feedback over most parts of the tp in each season with some exceptions at the southeastern tp in summer the area with strong positive sm p or negative sm t2m feedback is within the strong positive sm et feedback area the changtang plateau in the inner tp and southeastern tp along the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins is recognized as the area with strong sm hydroclimate interactions in most seasons especially in spring and summer within this area the sm p feedback is primarily positive combined with negative sm t2m and positive sm et feedback 5 land atmosphere coupling experimental results analysis the pc index and the ccp and ccs metrics provide a statistical method to evaluate the land hydroclimate interaction regimes physically based models may explore the mechanisms of sm hydroclimate interactions deeper the typical glace offers a unique widely used framework to quantify the land atmosphere coupling strength at weekly to seasonal timescales koster et al 2004 this study revisits the glace approach using the regcm4 model established by liu et al 2014 to further diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength over the tp as the conditional correlation method explores the land hydroclimate coupling at the 21 day timescale in each season the glace related index is also derived based on the 21 day totals the sm response on the synoptic six day scale is shown in figure s23 in the supplementary materials for comparison the applied anomalies of sm between the s ensemble and the w ensemble is quantified using the same peak probability density method as that for p δ ω p t2m δ ω t and rof δ ω rof the index δ ω et σ et proposed by liu et al 2014 is used to evaluate the strength of the sm et link where δ ω et is the glace index for et and σ et is the standard deviation of et from the w ensembles due to the weak sm hydroclimate interaction in the cold winter environment only the results in spring summer and autumn are investigated in comparison the peak value for the glace related index δ ω sm δ ω p δ ω t δ ω rof and δ ω et at the 21 day timescale fig 11 presents a similar spatial pattern with those at the synoptic scale figure s23 but resembles slightly higher magnitude i e δ ω sm δ ω rof and δ ω p at some regions and times such as the changtang plateau in summer and autumn the cdf for the peak glace related index and si metric at different timescales figure s24 as well as the ratio of peak glace index categorized by different constraints in the nine sub regions table s4 1 table s4 2 figure s25 further demonstrate the similar sm hydroclimate interaction at the two different time scales in the following we focus on the 21 day timescale as shown in fig 11 the response of sm between the s and the w ensemble is positive in each studied season the hot spot is located mainly over parts of the tarim basin qaidam basin changtang plateau in spring summer and autumn while at most part of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and lower reaches of the brahmaputra river basins in summer consistent with the conditional correlation method the glace related sm hydroclimate interaction is spatiotemporally heterogenous especially for sm p and sm t2m coupling the sm p and sm t2m coupling is primarily positive in spring and autumn while mixed with positive and negative signals in summer specifically the hot spot with significant positive sm p feedback is mainly located over parts of qaidam basin in spring sources of yellow yangtze mekong salween river basins and middle to lower reaches brahmaputra river basin in spring summer autumn and changtang plateau in spring and summer the sm t2m coupling is significant positive in spring and autumn over most parts of the study area the hot spot with negative sm t2m feedback is located mainly over parts of tarim basin lower sources of yangtze mekong salween river basins and middle to lower reaches of brahmaputra river basin in summer and southwestern changtang plateau in autumn the sm rof coupling is dominated by strong significant positive feedback in each season especially in summer and autumn the sm et coupling is primarily positive in each season especially in spring and summer in the nine sub regions table s4 2 and figure s25 the ratio of pc and si index also indicate a positive sm p and sm t2m coupling in most of the sub regions in spring and autumn while mixed positive and negative sm p and sm t2m coupling were observed in summer consistent with the spatial distribution the sm p feedback is insignificant in most sub regions according to the low ratio below 30 of pc values with si lower than 0 1 while the sm t2m coupling is significant in some subregions according to the high ratio above 30 of positive pc values and si lower than 0 1 in comparison most sub regions indicate positive sm p and sm t2m feedback in spring i e sub regions s1 s2 s5 s8 and autumn i e sub regions s1 s5 s7 and s8 while indicate negative sm p feedback and positive sm t2m feedback in summer i e sub regions s1 s4 s5 s7 and s8 all sub regions indicate significant positive sm rof feedback in each season except qaidam basin sub region s5 in spring the sm et coupling is significant positive in most sub regions in spring while only significant in sub regions s5 to s7 changtang plateau tarim and qaidam basin in summer and in sub regions s1 s2 s5 and s6 east and north tp in autumn specifically the sub regions s3 s4 and s9 in the upper sources of the yellow yangtze upper area mekong and salween river basins and middle to lower reaches of the brahmaputra river basin in spring the sub regions s1 s4 s5 and s7 in the qaidam basin changtang plateau the upper sources of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins in summer and the sub region s6 in the tarim basin in autumn stand out as the areas with negative sm hydroclimate interactions which present positive sm et t2m rof feedback and negative sm p feedback as illustrated in previous literature i e alessi et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 the negative sm p feedback scenario may increase the capability of a system to regulate its moisture content therefore convective p is more likely to develop in the area with negative sm p feedback when the soils are dry the spatiotemporal distribution of the glace metric fig 11 table s4 2 and the pc index fig 9 table s1 4 based on the regcm4 simulation are in good agreement especially for sm rof and sm et coupling both methods indicate strong significant positive sm rof and sm et feedback in most parts of the study area in each season the sm p and sm t2m coupling with si lower than 0 1 is spatially scattered however both methods indicate that parts of the changtang plateau tarim basin and the yellow river basin in spring and autumn stand out as hot spots with positive sm p feedback while lower reaches of sources of yangtze mekong and salween river basins in summer and middle to lower reaches of the brahmaputra river basin in summer and autumn stand out as the hot spots with negative sm t2m feedback compared to the pc index based on the reanalysis data era5 land noah and clsm fig 6 to fig 8 the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength based on the regcm4 model both glace and conditional correlation method fig 9 and fig 11 is detected with some obvious differences especially in sm p and sm t2m coupling this may be due to the applied model dynamic system the pc index based on the regcm4 simulation is weak and spatially scattered under the same conditions as the applied reanalysis data i e era5 land and gldas products in addition the hydroclimate variables p t2m et sm rof from the regcm4 simulation figure s1 to figure s5 also present some obvious bias with the reanalysis data on the seasonal timescale especially for the sm simulations however compared to the compound result fig 11 both methods indicate mixed positive and negative sm hydroclimate interactions in spring summer and autumn fig 10 and fig 11 the hot spots with positive sm p feedback are mainly located at parts of changtang plateau yellow yangtze river basin in spring summer and autumn mekong and salween river basin in spring and autumn and brahmaputra river basin in autumn the hot spots with negative sm t2m feedback are mainly located at parts of tarim basin middle to lower reaches of brahmaputra river basin and lower sources of yangtze mekong salween river basin in summer both methods indicate significant positive sm rof and sm et feedback at most parts of the study area especially in summer and autumn this study provides a method to diagnose the land atmosphere interaction patterns and strength using limited available high resolution reanalysis data and one typical regional climate model the results may contain some uncertainties due to the uncertainty of applied data in the study area and the physical parameters from different models more effort and caution should be taken to further investigate the land atmosphere interactions over the tp in the future 6 conclusions the tp is an important climate unit in the earth s climate system and its response to climate change is much faster than in other areas land use changes may significantly impact subsequent hydroclimate situations at sub seasonal and seasonal timescales according to the mechanisms of local land atmosphere interactions under climate change due to the harsh environmental conditions high elevations complex topography and heterogeneous surfaces the meteorological stations over the tp are biased and sparsely distributed which limits the recognition of local land atmosphere interactions this study adopted the newly published high resolution reanalysis data era5 land gldas noah and clsm products and regcm4 model to diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction patterns and strength at seasonal timescales using two traditional approaches the conditional correlation coefficient and glace type experimental modeling a common aggregation method is suggested to recognize the compound hot spots with strong sm hydroclimate interaction among multiple data sources the major findings are concluded as follows 1 in the land atmosphere interaction over the tp sm p coupling is observed to be dominantly positive in most seasons the hot spot is mainly located on the changtang plateau in spring and summer sm p coupling is weakened in autumn and winter when the climate turns cold meanwhile sm t2m coupling is primarily negative with the hot spot located mainly on the changtang plateau in spring and shifting to the north northwestern tarim basin and the south southeastern brahmaputra and lower sources of the yangtze mekong and lancang river basins in summer 2 et acts as a vital linkage in sm p t2m coupling only areas with strong positive sm et coupling have the potential to exhibit strong positive sm p feedback and negative sm t2m feedback the area with strong sm p and or sm t2m coupling is found to overlap with the area with strong positive sm et coupling in each season 3 sm plays an important role in influencing the local rof in each season sm rof coupling is strong and dominantly positive in each season especially in summer in most part of the tp the nexus of sm et rof interaction is complex sm rof coupling is typically stronger in areas with strong positive sm p feedback and weak or negative sm et feedback 4 the sm hydroclimate interaction is stronger under extreme climate conditions when the variability of seasonal p is larger in this study the sm hydroclimate interaction was stronger in years with significantly high or low total p 5 the sm hydroclimate interaction based on glace is spatially heterogeneous in spring summer and autumn however both glace and the conditional correlation method diagnosed the hot spot of sm hydroclimate interaction sm p t2m located mainly on the changtang plateau at the inner tp and the southeastern tp within the sources of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra river basins in the studied seasons meanwhile sm rof coupling is strong and positive in most parts of the tp interactions are stronger in the summer and autumn seasons as presented in this study the local land atmosphere interaction over the tp is spatially and temporally heterogeneous based on different reanalysis products and model simulations high resolution data especially the land state data are still the main barrier in studying land atmosphere interactions over the tp this study contributes to the recognition of land atmosphere coupling at seasonal timescales over the tp additionally new methodology is also required to determine the main interactions among multiple data sources the compound aggregation method is proven to be efficient in recognizing land atmosphere coupling among multiple data sources this method may also be applied

1966,land atmosphere energy and moisture exchanges exert great impacts on local and regional climate however high uncertainties exist in the recent land atmosphere interactions due to scarce observations and difficulties in modeling at high elevations and cold regions this study applied multiple high resolution reanalysis products era5 land gldas noah and clsm products and one regional climate model regcm4 to diagnose the interaction pattern and strength of seasonal soil moisture and hydroclimate on the tibetan plateau tp using a conditional correlation coefficient method and the global land atmosphere coupling experimental modeling approach a compound aggregation method is applied to recognize hot spots with strong soil moisture hydroclimate interactions among multiple data as a result the changtang plateau in the inner tp the sources of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and lancang rivers and part of the brahmaputra river basin in the south southeastern tp are diagnosed with strong land atmosphere interactions in most seasons in summer the coupling strength is stronger and the covered area is much wider and spatially continuous as the climate turns warm all applied data indicate a positive dominant soil moisture precipitation feedback and a negative soil moisture temperature feedback at the hot spots meanwhile the soil moisture runoff feedback is strong and positive at most parts of the tp especially at the hot spots and in summer evapotranspiration acts as a positive linkage in the soil moisture precipitation temperature interactions while the nexus of soil moisture evapotranspiration and runoff is complicated this study contributes to understanding local land hydroclimate interactions in the high elevation and cold climate of the tp additionally

more than ten large rivers of asia with about one third of the world s population depending on its water the tp is experiencing a rapidly warming climate gao et al 2015 liu and chen 2000 niu et al 2004 and currently the warmest period in the past 2 000 years yao et al 2019 this warming over the tp has resulted in a chain of significant impacts on the variations of local and adjacent regional hydroclimate cycles the solid state water snow ice glacier and permafrost over tp has decreased combined with a progressively increasing active layer of permafrost and melting water gao et al 2018 you et al 2017 zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2013 the changes in the tp s land characteristics e g soil moisture sm temperature snow cover land use may impact the subsequent hydroclimate on daily to seasonal time scales according to the mechanisms of land atmosphere interactions koster et al 2006 liu et al 2020 seneviratne et al 2013 sun et al 2020 yao et al 2015 liu et al 2020 indicated that the thermal forcing over the tp interacts strongly with that over the iranian plateau thereby forming a coupled heating system that elevates the tropopause generates a monsoonal meridional circulation over south asia and creates conditions of large scale ascent that are favorable for asian summer monsoon development recently the land atmosphere interactions over the tp have been a hot topic in the climate science community koster et al 2006 seneviratne et al 2013 sun et al 2020 yao et al 2019 sm is an important component of the land surface and plays a vital role in land atmosphere interactions by controlling water and energy transfers in the earth system koster et al 2017 koster et al 2006 liu et al 2014 santanello jr et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2013 generally sm is measured using the volumetric soil water content by mm3 mm3 climate warming over the tp has influenced sm bai et al 2019 li et al 2020 melati et al 2019 which in turn impacts the subsequent hydroclimate cycle through evapotranspiration et liu et al 2014 talib et al 2021 yang et al 2011 yao et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 exploring sm atmosphere interactions over the tp is of great significance for advancing our understanding of the influence of the tp s warming on the regional and global hydroclimate in land atmosphere interactions the sm air temperature feedback is well understood while the impact of land surface on precipitation p is complicated as it involves hydrological processes over land and dynamic and thermodynamic processes in the atmosphere koster et al 2017 koster et al 2006 may et al 2017 santanello jr et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2013 both observations and numerical modeling indicate a negative sm air temperature feedback specifically higher sm results in higher et and therefore larger evaporative cooling leading to a lower air temperature response a framework of sm p feedback was set up by seneviratne et al 2010 which divided the process into three links the relationship of sm anomalies with the subsequent et anomalies sm et the et anomalies with the subsequent p anomalies et p and the p anomalies with the subsequent sm anomalies p sm the first two links constitute sm p coupling while all three links complement the sm p feedback where et acts as the linkage dirmeyer 2011 guo et al 2006 liu et al 2017a liu et al 2014 mei and wang 2012 the sm et link is generally positive especially at the climatic transitional zones between dry and wet koster et al 2006 guo et al 2006 liu et al 2014 the p sm link is also positive but includes some exceptions due to the rainfall runoff rof mechanisms bras 1990 hillel 1998 for example in areas with wet and saturated soil increased p leads to surface rof rather than sm in cases with intense p that exceeds the infiltration rate it would result in surface rof instead of sm as well bras 1990 under extreme drought conditions when the soil cracked p may infiltrate and bypass the surface zone hillel 1998 therefore a relationship between sm and rof exists in the p sm link liu et al 2017a and xiao et al 2020a indicate a positive sm rof relationship the et p connection is the most complicated and contains uncertainties due to the complex physical processes including changes in albedo net radiation latent heat flux sensible heat flux boundary layer height and moist static energy density mei and wang 2012 liu et al 2014 santanello jr et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 a positive sm p feedback scenario diminishes the capability of a system to regulate its moisture content and vice versa in the negative scenario therefore convective p is more likely to develop in an area with negative sm p feedback when the soils are dry alessi et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 several studies have been carried out to investigate the mechanism and strength of land atmosphere interaction over the tp based on in situ measurements remote sensing images and numerical simulations chen et al 2019 koster et al 2006 li et al 2017 ma et al 2009 seneviratne et al 2013 sun et al 2021 sun et al 2020 tang et al 2020 yang et al 2011 zhong et al 2019 most studies indicate positive sm et sun et al 2020 yang et al 2011 zhang et al 2018 and p sm relationships bai et al 2019 li et al 2020 melati et al 2019 however sm p coupling and feedback is complicated and the findings over the tp are not conclusive for example the typical global land atmosphere coupling experiment glace koster et al 2006 and glace cmip5 seneviratne et al 2013 diagnosed the tp as a hot spot with strong positive land atmosphere coupling in summer sun et al 2020 stated that the increased sm would lead to an increase in et while decreasing the maximum daytime planetary boundary layer pbl height resulted in increased cloudiness and decreased cloud water content at the special underlying surface in the central tp according to a local land atmosphere feedback framework defined by santanello jr et al 2011 sun et al 2020 also found that the spatial distributions of monthly mean pbl energy budgets over the tp are strongly influenced by sm in the rainy season during which the relatively dry soil is more favorable for the formation of convective clouds than wetter soil conditions talib et al 2021 highlighted the importance of intraseasonal sm dynamics on the tp they indicated that the decreased sm during a regional dry event would increase surface sensible heat flux leading to a deepening of the pbl and the development of a heat low these studies provide some knowledge about land atmosphere interactions on the tp however two main problems were raised in these studies the first and most important one is that the existing hydroclimate stations over the tp are biased and sparsely distributed due to the harsh environmental conditions high elevations complex topography and heterogeneous surfaces ma et al 2009 sun et al 2021 yang et al 2011 currently the observed data are not enough to diagnose the land atmosphere feedbacks on a spatial scale moreover the predictive power of land surface and global climate models for the tp is hampered gu et al 2020 qiu 2013 therefore the land atmosphere coupling patterns and strength over the tp are not conclusive secondly most of the existed studies focused on only one or two processes of the local land atmosphere interaction such as the spatial distribution and temporal evolutions of sm and surface fluxes ma et al 2009 yang et al 2011 zhong et al 2019 or the possible influence of soil conditions on the pbl cloud and p under special weather conditions chen et al 2019 li et al 2017 sun et al 2021 sun et al 2020 tang et al 2020 several studies have indicated the importance of initial sm conditions on the partitioning of p into rof liu et al 2017a xiao et al 2020a xiao et al 2020b the impact of land atmosphere interaction on the subsequent surface and subsurface hydrological cycle such as the interaction between sm and rof have rarely been investigated therefore a comprehensive recognition of the local sm hydroclimate interaction regime is required on the tp with the development of remote sensing data assimilation and numerical modeling techniques multiple high resolution reanalysis data have been produced and are available online for land atmosphere interaction research such as the era5 land reanalysis data munoz sabater et

consistent view of the evolution of land variables over several decades at an enhanced resolution compared with era5 munoz sabater et al 2021 the spatial and temporal resolutions of era5 land are 0 1 degree and 1 h respectively gldas data can provide optimal fields of land surface states and fluxes with advanced land surface modeling and data assimilation techniques rodell et al 2004 the newly published gldas versions 2 0 and 2 1 have finer spatial resolution 0 25 degree and selectable temporal resolutions including 3 hourly daily and monthly both era5 land and gldas products have been widely used in hydrometeorological studies since their release jiao et al 2021 li et al 2022b liu et al 2017a liu et al 2015 qi et al 2018 xin et al 2022 xin et al 2021 yang et al 2021 however they have rarely been compared and applied in land atmosphere interaction studies in high elevation and cold climate areas this study investigates the compound sm hydroclimate interaction regime over tp at the seasonal time scale by applying the recently published era5 land the new version of gldas and one regional climate model regcm version 4 developed by the abdus salam international center for theoretical physics ictp giorgi et al 2012 two different approaches are applied first the statistical conditional correlation coefficient method proposed by mei and wang 2011 2012 and later improved in liu et al 2014 is applied to all the reanalysis data and the regcm4 model simulation secondly the typical glace designed by koster et al 2006 is reconstructed based on the regcm4 model a common compound aggregation method is suggested to diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength among the applied multiple data based on statistical conditional correlation coefficient metrics three objectives are pursued 1 evaluate the performance of the applied reanalysis data era5 land and gldas products and the regional climate model simulation over the tp 2 diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength over the tp on the sub seasonal to seasonal time scales 3 identify the hot spots with strong sm hydroclimate interaction this study suggests a novel compound aggregation method and provides a brief calculation process with detailed equations to diagnose the interaction pattern and strength between multiple data these findings may contribute to the recognition of local land atmosphere interactions in high elevation cold climate areas additionally the findings may advance our understanding of the impact of land use on the subsequent changes of hydroclimate variables at sub seasonal and seasonal time scales furthermore the results could benefit the mitigation of local climate change and extreme related natural hazards at tp the paper s

southeast tp along the sources of the huanghe also called yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra river basins and part of the southeast changtang plateau semi desert characterizes the land use in the remaining changtang plateau the upper indus river basin and part of the south tarim basin land use is defined as desert in the north along the kunlun mountains and qaidam basin low air temperatures high diurnal temperature range and low seasonal temperature variations are the main climate characteristics of the tp xie and zhu 2013 westerlies and asian monsoons are the two dominant factors that influence the local climate and environment over the tp deng and zhang 2018 as a special climate unit the tp exerts a profound impact on the asian monsoon and the global climate due to its huge terrain and strong thermal effects on land atmosphere ocean interactions liu et al 2020 yao et al 2015 yang et al 2011 divides the tp region into four climate zones according to the mean annual p amount arid with p lower than 200 mm semi arid with p within 200 400 mm semi humid with p within 400 800 mm and humid with p above 800 mm as a result the southeast is recognized as the humid zone while the northwest is the arid zone and the remaining inner tp as semi humid and semi arid zones based on the observed annual total p amount at china meteorological administration stations to better recognize the sm hydroclimate interaction at tp the study area is divided into nine sub regions fig 1 and table 1 2 2 model and data description due to the lack of observed data one regional

set of algorithms that separately estimate the different components of land et which includes transpiration bare soil evaporation interception loss open water evaporation and sublimation on the global

et and root zone sm to evaluate the reanalysis data and model simulations 3 methodologies 3 1 conditional correlation coefficient method the probability density function pdf of the conditioned correlation coefficient method promoted by mei and wang 2011 2012 and later improved by liu et al 2014 is applied to diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength over the tp the advantage of this method is that it can examine different segments the terrestrial segment for the sm et link the atmospheric segment for the sm p sm t2m link and the internal segment for the sm rof link in addition this method is suitable to diagnose the coupling strength at intrinsic time scales ranging from days to weeks and can focus on extreme conditions divided by normal medium or abnormal too much or too little total p at different time scales as stated in previous literature liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017b mei and wang 2011 2012 mei and wang 2011 land atmosphere coupling is much stronger during years with larger p anomalies this study addresses the sm hydroclimate interaction under extreme p conditions by dividing the time series of the whole study period into the outer and inner quantiles based on the total seasonal p in each year the conditional correlation during the whole study period is also investigated to better understand coupling over the tp the 1 day sm and the subsequent 21 day average of climate variables p t2m et rof derived from each data set i e era5 land noah clsm regcm4 simulation were paired up in the conditional correlation analysis to accommodate potential comparison of results with those of previous studies findell and eltahir 1997 liu et al 2014 liu et al 2017b mei and wang 2012 mei and wang 2011 according to liu et al 2014 and mei and wang 2011 2012 the conditional correlation coefficient related metrics can be calculated according to the following steps initially the raw gridded data for the whole study period are preprocessed by the following three steps first the daily p t2m et and rof in each data set i e era5 land noah clsm regcm4 simulation are accumulated into the 21 day average means of each variable to pair with the corresponding antecedent 1 day lagged sm for example for the sm on june 1 the paired corresponding 21 day p is accumulated between june 2 and june 22 secondly both the 1 day sm and the 21 day accumulated climate variables i e p t2m et rof are normalized using the mean and standard deviation corresponding to the time of the year to remove the seasonal cycle third the time series of the paired data in each season during the study period are divided into different categories whole outer and inner using the grid based seasonal p as the criterion to rank the years the whole ensemble contains all the data without categorization the outer category contains the years during which the total seasonal p ranked in the first and fourth quartiles while the inner category contains the remaining years in the second and third quartiles in this study the whole study period is 30 years during 1980 2010 therefore in the whole data pool the total number of data pairs e g 1 day sm and subsequent 21 day p is 92 30 in spring mam march april and may and summer jja june july august 91 30 in autumn son september october november and 90 30 in winter djf december january february while in the outer and inner category the total number of data pairs are 92 15 in spring and summer 91 15 in autumn and 90 15 in winter following these preprocesses the pdf of the conditional correlation between 1 day sm and the subsequent 21 day climate variables is estimated in each category and for each grid cell for one correlation value estimation 32 data pairs are randomly selected without replacement from each category whole outer inner with a constraint to exclude the temporal overlapping of climate variables between any two data pairs for example in the outer category in summer if the pair of data with sm on june 2 and p during june 3 to june 23 in some year is drawn the closest neighboring data pair that can be potentially drawn is on june 23 with p during june 24 to july 14 in the same year these 32 data pairs are used to calculate a corresponding correlation between 1 day sm and subsequent 21 day p this procedure is repeated 10 000 times to produce the pdf of the conditional correlation the correlation coefficient at the peak probability density abbreviated as pc is selected to represent the sm hydroclimate interaction strength one index named si defined as the probability of the correlation coefficient being negative positive when the pc value is positive negative is selected to indicate the significance of the pc value in this study for each grid cell the pc values with si lower than 0 1 are considered significant positive pc values indicate positive feedback between sm and the selected hydroclimate variable i e p et t2m rof while negative indicates negative feedback the magnitude of pc values indicates the strength of coupling between sm and the related hydroclimate variable as illustrated by liu et al 2017b the correlation coefficient metric cannot represent the physical causality between sm and the hydroclimate variables the feedback here only indicates the possible association between them for sm p coupling positive feedback potentially implies that the increased decreased antecedent sm may lead to the increasing decreasing of p on the subsequent sub seasonal to seasonal time scales as indicated in previous literature koster et al 2017 koster et al 2006 santanello jr et al 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 seneviratne et al 2013 talib et al 2021 yang et al 2011 yao et al 2019 yuan et al 2021 zhang et al 2018 et acts as a potential link for the coupling between sm and hydroclimate variables the index p c e t σ e t proposed by liu et al 2014 is used to evaluate the strength of the terrestrial segment in land atmosphere coupling where p c e t measures the impact of sm on et and σ e t measures the range of et variation according to previous literature guo et al 2006 dirmeyer 2011 seneviratne et al 2010 sun et al 2020 sm majorly influences the climate is through its impact on et which then influences the atmospheric boundary layer and convective processes therefore for strong sm atmospheric interaction both p c e t and σ e t should be suitably large which leads to large p c e t σ e t in this study σ e t is derived from the same conditional quartiles as p c e t for consistency with the other pc index i e p c p p c t p c r o f for each grid cell when the si for the p c e t is lower than 0 1 the sm et feedback is considered significant based on the p c e t σ e t index 3 2 compound aggregation method description a common aggregation method is proposed to diagnose compound sm hydroclimate interaction among multiple datasets based on the conditional correlation coefficient method using the grid based pc value and si the compound feedback indices abbreviated as cfi including interacting pattern abbreviated as ip consistent indicator abbreviated as ci compound coupling pattern abbreviated as ccp and compound coupling strength abbreviated as ccs characterize the sm hydroclimate interaction regime according to the pc values in each dataset ip has three different members positive negative and nan the sign function sgn is applied to categorize the characteristics of the sm hydroclimate interaction ip ci aggregates the consistency of pc signals among the applied data the schematic framework to derive the compound coupling pattern and strength among the applied data is presented in fig 2 and briefly described as follows first the ip signals of sm x at ith grid cell from the jth dataset are categorized using equation 2 then the ci x i are calculated using equation 3 and the ratio of positive signals r p 1 x i negative signals r p 2 x i and nan signals r p 3 x i respectively using equation 4 the grid based total ratio should equal 1 according to equation 5 among the applied multi data sources next equation 6 is used to categorize the ccp and equation 7 is used to calculate the ccs 2 ip x i j s g n

p c x i j at the ith grid cell among all the applied data r p 1 to r p 3 represent the ratio of positive negative and nan signal of x at the ith grid cell in this study four different data set are applied to investigate the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength the area with continuous ccp positive or negative is considered as a hot spot while the coupling strength is reflected by the ccs the significance of ccp and ccs is measured using the si index the ip index is recalculated using equation 8 to distinguish the ip index from the nonsignificant ip the significant ip is abbreviated as ips in equation 8 the significant ccp and ccs are then recalculated using equation 3 through equation 7 by substituting ip with ips in these equations 8 ips x i j s g n p c x i j 1 pc x

regcm4 conducted by liu et al 2014 is summarized here to better illustrate sm hydroclimate interaction in different seasons on the tp the purpose of glace 1 type experiment is to separate the impact of land surface conditions on the subsequent synoptic to seasonal hydroclimate variables this experiment includes two ensembles w and s which each contain 16 ensemble members the 16 year period during 1986 2001 was used to initialize the corresponding experiments in w w1 w2 w16 and s s1 s2 s16 in each season with the initial atmospheric conditions generated by the control run at the beginning of each season the lateral boundary forcing from nnrp and gisst sea surface temperature forcing from the year 1994 are adopted as the lateral boundary conditions the year 1994 is chosen because it is neither an el niño nor a la niña year the sm at each soil layer from one w ensemble named w1 is abstracted at each step and then prescribed as the input for each step of each season for each s ensemble the year 1986 was selected randomly as the w1 ensemble the diagnostic metric ω defined by koster et al 2002 was adopted to measure the intra ensemble similarity of variables of interest i e p temperature rof and et the difference δ ω v between s and w ensembles is used to quantify the sm impact on the atmospheric variable v the simulated data at the first week of each ensemble member in each season were discarded to avoid problems associated with initial shocks to the modeled atmosphere the initial glace was designed to examine the sm s control on synoptic scale hydrometeorological variables which lasts about one week the remaining data were aggregated into time series of six days a new summation method of slack overlapping time series was applied to obtain the time series of six day totals instead of the strict non overlapped method used by liu et al 2014 for example for the summer season june july and august with a total of 92 days the first 8 days are discarded as the spin up days the remaining days from june 9 to august 31 are used to aggregate the six day totals the first six day total is the summation from june 9 to june 14 while the second six day total is the summation from june 10 to june 15 which differs from the old method that totaled from june 15 to june 20 therefore in the new summation method the time series of six day totals expanded from the original 14 to 79 for each member each ensemble w or s has 16 such time series similar to the conditional correlation coefficient the pdf method was applied to obtain the peak glace metric δ ω v for each grid cell the procedure to produce δ ω v is described as follows first 14 data pairs the maximum amount of data without overlapping from the 79 data pairs in each member in the w and s ensemble each having 16 members were randomly selected without replacement with a constraint to exclude the temporal overlapping of climate variables between any two data pairs these 14 16 data pairs are used to calculate one δ ω v metric using equation 9 and equation 10 this procedure is repeated 10 000 times to determine the pdf of δ ω v for each grid cell then δ ω v at the peak probability density is selected to present the sm hydroclimate coupling meanwhile the si defined as the ratio of the peak δ ω v being negative positive when the peak δ ω v is positive negative is promoted to indicate the significance of sm hydroclimate 9 ω v 16 σ v 2 σ v 2 15 σ v 2 10 δ ω v ω v s ω v w in equation 9 the ω v index is estimated to quantify the similarity of the 16 time series within each ensemble σ v 2 is the variance of the ensemble averaged time series for the variable v which is estimated based on a time series of 14 six day totals each representing the average across the 16 members and σ v 2 is the variance of all the 14 16 six day totals as such the difference of δ ω v in the ω v index between the w and s ensembles measures the degree to which sm controls the temporal variation of the climate variable for consistency with the conditional correlation metric pc and compound coupling analysis the glace index derived from the 21 day totals is also considered in which the total time series in each ensemble w and s is 64 16 while 4 16 data pairs from each ensemble were randomly selected to get one δ ω v here four is the maximum number of data pairs that can be selected from one member in each ensemble with the constraint to exclude the temporal overlapping of climate variables at the 21 day timescale in each season 4 conditional correlation coefficient results analysis 4 1 overview of soil moisture hydroclimate interaction in the study area the sm within 1 m depth from the era5 land gldas noah and clsm products as well as the regcm4 simulation is used to analyze the pattern and strength of sm hydroclimate interactions over the tp using the conditional correlation coefficient method the empirical cumulative distribution cdf and histogram are applied to overview the sm hydroclimate interactions in the whole study area over the tp while the ratio of the pc index at specific constraints is used to further diagnose the sm hydroclimate interactions in the nine sub regions fig 1 according to the cdf and histogram of the pc index fig 3 and fig 4 sm hydroclimate interactions in the whole study area are dominated by positive sm p feedback combined with negative sm t2m feedback positive sm rof and sm et feedback in most seasons and in most data sets in the outer quartile such interaction is slightly strengthened in summer and weakened in winter according to the increased decreased ratio of positive sm p feedback in summer winter combined with an increased decreased ratio of negative sm t2m feedback and an increased ratio of positive sm rof and sm et feedback as stated in previous literature mei and wang 2012 guo et al 2006 koster et al 2006 2011 the land atmosphere interaction would be enhanced in the warm season while weakened in the cold season due to the different sm et coupling strengths in different climate regimes among the applied data era5 land presents a slightly higher ratio of positive sm p feedback in summer and negative sm t2m and sm et feedback in summer and autumn the regcm4 simulation implies a lower ratio of positive sm p feedback in spring but slightly higher ratio in winter meanwhile it indicates a positive dominated sm t2m feedback in most seasons especially in spring and winter and a slightly higher ratio of positive stronger sm rof feedback in most seasons except spring the clsm indicates slightly stronger positive sm et feedback in each season especially in summer and autumn and the ratio for the magnitude of p c e t σ e t above 0 5 is close to 80 the si index is applied to indicate the significance of sm hydroclimate interactions in the study area as defined in the methodology the pc value with si lower than 0 1 is considered significant as shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the ratio for the sm p and sm t2m feedback with si lower than 0 1 is slightly lower compared to that of sm rof and sm et feedback in each season from each data set specifically most data sets indicate over 30 of the grid cells showed significant positive sm p feedback in each season the ratio of pc p with si lower than 0 1 is above 50 based on era5 land in spring and summer or based on clsm in spring for the sm t2m feedback the ratio of significant negative pc t with si lower than 0 1 is above 40 in each season based on era5 land clsm and noah while within 20 30 based on the regcm4 simulation in spring summer and autumn for the sm rof and sm et feedbacks over 50 of the grid cells passed the 0 1si test especially in summer and autumn where the ratio of si lower than 0 1 is above 80 for the sm rof feedback from most data sets compared with the outer quartile the sm hydroclimate interaction in the inner quartile or the whole data pool is slightly weakened especially for sm p and the sm t2m coupling according to the cdf figure s11 and figure s12 in the supplementary materials and histogram figure s13 and figure s14 in the supplementary materials as shown the cdf for the sm p coupling in the inner quartile figure s11 or the whole data pool figure s12 is slightly shifted to be negative with a decreased ratio of positive feedback in each season from each data set while the cdf for the sm t2m coupling is shifted to be positive in each season for most data sets with a decreased ratio of negative feedback the sm rof and sm et coupling is still dominated by positive feedback in most seasons for most data sets but with a slightly weakened ratio of high magnitude the cdf for the si index further demonstrates the weakened sm hydroclimate interactions in the inner and whole data pool according to the decreased ratio of pc values with si lower than 0 1 the histogram also indicates similar weakened sm hydroclimate interaction in the inner quartile figure s13 or the whole data pool figure s14 in each season the pc values for the sm p and sm t2m coupling shown in the histogram are more concentrated in the zones around zero while the zones for the sm rof and sm et coupling are slightly shifted to the left side of zero with a decreased ratio of positive feedback meanwhile the number of grid cells with si lower than 0 1 for the sm hydroclimate interaction in the inner quartile or whole data pool is clearly decreased especially for sm p and sm t2m coupling consistent with the findings stated in previous literature mei and wang 2012 liu et al 2014 sm hydroclimate interactions over the tp is also enhanced in extreme climate conditions i e too much or too little p the ratio of the pc index categorized by specific constraints table s1 1 to table s3 4 in the supplementary in the nine sub regions also indicate positive sm hydroclimate interaction including positive sm et p rof feedback and negative sm t2m feedback in the outer quartile in most seasons fig 5 such positive interaction is weakened in the inner quartile figure s15 or the whole data pool figure s16 especially the sm p and sm t2m feedbacks the spatial distribution of the pc index with si lower than 0 1 in each season from each data set in the outer quartile fig 6 to fig 9 inner quartile and whole data pool figure s17 to figure s20 in the supplementary further demonstrates these findings therefore in the following we focus on the sm hydroclimate interaction regime in the outer quartile 4 2 soil moisture hydroclimate interacting regime comparison according to the distribution of the pc index with si lower than 0 1 fig 6 to fig 9 and its ratio in the nine sub regions fig 5 table s1 1 to s1 4 in the supplementary the sm hydroclimate interactions in the study area are dominated by significant positive sm et sm p and sm rof feedback and negative sm t2m feedback however the coupling is spatially and temporally heterogeneous from different data sets in different seasons the comparison and discussion for each coupling is provided as follows a sm p and sm t2m feedback sm p and sm t2m coupling from the era5 land fig 6 is much more spatially continuous and stronger in spring summer and autumn when compared with the gldas products noah fig 7 clsm fig 8 and the regcm4 simulation fig 9 most of hot spots are located at the semi humid to semi arid i e changtang plateau or humid to semi humid mid sources of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins climate transition zones specifically the hot spot with strong positive sm p feedback detected by the era5 land product is located on the changtang plateau and part of mid sources of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins in spring this coupling strength is enhanced in summer in the midwestern tp including the changtang plateau tarim basin and brahmaputra river basin while slightly weakened at the sources of mid river basins however as the climate turns colder in autumn and winter the sm p feedback tends to be weak and scattered the only positive hot spot observed in autumn is located in part of the changtang plateau while the feedback at the whole study area is not significant or even negative in winter the sm t2m feedback is dominantly negative in spring summer and autumn its hot spot is located in part of the changtang plateau in spring and autumn while located in most of the midwestern tp including the changtang plateau tarim qaidam basin and brahmaputra river basin in summer there are also some positive sm t2m feedbacks shown in spring and winter at some places which may be caused by the local climate regimes in cold climates the interaction between soil surface and the atmospheric processes through direct soil evaporation may be interrupted by snow cover or glaciers the main interaction takes place through the impact of sm on transpiration of evergreen trees the hot spot with significant positive sm p feedback or negative sm t2m feedback almost overlaps with the area with strong positive sm et feedback this successfully illustrates the linkage of et in land atmosphere interactions the hot spot with positive sm p feedback based on the noah data is mainly located in the mid changtang plateau in spring and summer and parts of the lower sources of the mekong and salween river basins in summer and autumn while the hot spot with strong negative sm t2m feedback is located at part of the middle to lower brahmaputra and salween river basins in spring summer and autumn and part of the western qaidam basin in summer clsm indicates some hot spots of positive sm p feedback on the changtang plateau and part of northern tarim basin in spring and some scattered signals at the yangtze mekong and salween river basins and the changtang plateau in summer the hot spots with negative sm t2m feedback based on clsm almost agree with those based on noah for each season compared to the reanalysis products the sm p feedback based on the regcm4 simulation is spatially scattered and the sm t2m feedback is quite weak and mixed with both positive and negative signals over most of the tp the hot spot with positive significant sm p feedback is located mainly over part of the changtang plateau and the upper source of yellow river basin in summer and over the mid changtang plateau to part of the southern tarim basin in autumn while over the northern tp within the tarim and qaidam basins in winter b sm rof feedback positive dominated sm rof feedback is observed over the tp in each season from all the applied data fig 6 to fig 9 compared with the sm p and sm t2m feedback the sm rof feedback from each data set is much more spatially continuous and stronger according to the pc values especially in summer and autumn the pc rof is above 0 5 in most parts of the tp in summer and autumn according to most applied data sets except clsm which shows slightly weaker coupling strength with the pc values within 0 25 0 5 in most areas the sm rof coupling is slightly weakened in spring and winter when the climate turns cold the hot spot with positive sm rof feedback based on the era5 land data is located mainly on the changtang plateau and the southern periphery of the tp along the brahmaputra river basin in spring while located in the south southeastern tp along the brahmaputra and the lower sources of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins in winter the signal based on noah is weak in spring and winter with the only hot spot located at part of the upper source of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins and part of the southeastern periphery of the tp in spring and autumn clsm indicates positive sm rof feedback in most of the tp in spring but with less strength correlation within 0 25 0 5 while presenting some strong feedback in the south southeastern periphery of the tp along the brahmaputra and the lower sources of yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins in winter the sm rof coupling strength is strong in winter based on the regcm4 simulation which is above 0 5 in most parts of the tp except part of the upper sources of the yangtze and lancang river basins c sm et feedback positive dominated sm et feedback is observed over the tp in each season from each applied data the hot spot with strong positive sm et feedback based on era5 land data fig 6 is located mainly on the changtang plateau and part of the tarim qaidam basin in spring summer and autumn while the signals in winter tend to be weak or even negative meanwhile the hot spot with positive sm et feedback based on gldas noah data fig 7 in summer and autumn is more spatially continuous than that based on era5 land covering most parts of the tp while the signals in spring and winter share similar spatial patterns with those of era5 land gldas clsm presents even stronger sm et feedback in each season according to its spatially continuous positive and higher magnitude pc values above 0 5 over the whole tp fig 8 the sm et feedback based on the regcm4 simulation is also dominantly positive with the hot spots located mainly at the changtang plateau and tarim and qaidam basins in each season fig 9 additionally the sm et feedback from most applied data era5 land gldas noah regcm4 simulation tends to be weakly positive or even negative in the southeastern tp along the mid to lower reaches of the brahmaputra salween and mekong river basins in most seasons especially in summer this phenomenon may be caused by the local environmental and climatic conditions as well as the vegetation type the results found that most of the area with weak sm et feedback is within the wet area which has a total annual p above 25 mm month with most of the p occurring in summer with the average amount above 100 mm month figure s2 in the supplementary materials in addition the land and vegetation type in most of this area is covered with tundra and ice caps or glaciers and short grass which may influence the local sm et feedback according to previous literature berg and sheffield 2019 krakauer et al 2010 yang et al 2018 zou et al 2018 sm et feedback is complex and nonlinear and may be impacted by the local environmental and climatic conditions yang et al 2018 indicated that the change in et is limited by sm in the dry regions while limited by energy in the wet regions the non negligible negative sm p feedback physically depends on the complex sm et correlation in the dry and wet regions and the cause varies based on the environmental and climatic conditions li et al 2014 found that on the loess plateau et is very sensitive to surface sm where the temporal persistence of et has a higher positive correlation 0 537 with surface sm temporal persistence under dry conditions but a higher negative correlation 0 621 under wet conditions krakauer et al 2010 confirmed that the synoptic variations in sm have a substantial impact on the mean climate state owing to the nonlinearity of the dependence of et on sm berg and sheffield 2019 fan et al 2020 pu and dickinson 2014 and zou et al 2018 indicated that vegetation is also a major component of the climate system owing to its controls on the energy and water balance over land as stated by berg and sheffield 2019 canopy interception contributes a positive term to the sm et coupling reflecting the noncausal rainfall forced positive correlation between sm and canopy interception fan et al 2020 stated that the sensitivity of air temperature to sm varies greatly in different vegetation coverage areas d mechanism of evapotranspiration in land atmosphere interaction as discussed previously sm hydroclimate coupling in winter is spatially scattered and weak compared to other seasons due to the cold climate regime this finding is consistent with previous literature mei and wang 2012 guo et al 2006 koster et al 2006 2011 which stated that land atmosphere interactions are slightly stronger in warm climate conditions due to strong sm et coupling in land atmosphere interactions et acts as a linkage between the land and the atmosphere for sm t2m coupling the higher sm results in higher evaporation and larger evaporative cooling leading to a negative relationship between sm and surface temperature for sm p coupling most studies indicate a positive relationship between sm and p koster et al 2006 guo et al 2006 liu et al 2014 sun et al 2020 the higher sm causes decreased albedo and increased net radiation leading to an increasing of latent heat flux decreasing of sensible heat flux and therefore decreasing pbl height finally resulting in increased moist static energy and total p sun et al 2020 evaluated the interactions between sm surface fluxes pbl growth and the formations of convective clouds and p at one local land atmosphere interaction observation site bj nagqu 31 37 degreesn 91 9 degreese on the tp and found that the increased initial sm increased the mean et increased latent heat but decreased sensible heat and decreased the maximum daytime pbl height however some studies i e cook et al 2006 also indicate that the shift of surface fluxes from sensible to latent heat and the resulting decrease of the boundary layer depth would inhibit p by increasing atmospheric stability and reducing moist convergence in this study most data imply positive sm p feedback and negative sm t2m feedback in spring summer and autumn the area with strong sm p and sm t2m feedback almost overlaps with the area with strong positive sm et feedback fig 6 to fig 9 demonstrating the linkage of et in local land atmosphere interactions et also plays a vital role in the local and adjacent hydrological cycle which exerts significant impact on local rof according to the hydrological cycle rof can be approximately calculated with the equation rof p sm et therefore the relationships among rof sm and et are complicated a negative relationship may exist between rof and et in this study fig 6 to fig 9 the hot spot with strong positive sm rof feedback from each applied data are more spatially continuous than the area with positive sm et feedback especially in summer and autumn the areas with weak positive or even negative sm et feedback also reflect strong positive sm rof feedback from each dataset i e the southeastern tp in summer and autumn in the budyko hypothesis the changes in rof are assumed to be sensitive to the changes in p and et budyko 1974 additionally the changes in rof are also sensitive to the soil conditions i e sm soil cracks and soil temperature and other hydroclimate variables e g surface air temperature solar radiation specific humidity and wind speed huang et al 2016 liu et al 2017a yang and yang 2011 liu et al 2017a indicated that the initial sm can impact the subsequent sub seasonal to seasonal rof over asia rof is more sensitive to p compared to the other hydroclimatic variables et t2m solar radiation specific humidity and wind speed especially in the semi humid to humid climate transition zones a positive sm rof feedback was detected over the tp where the initial wet dry sm anomalies would lead to an increase decrease of rof in the subsequent 1 month to 4 month time koster and suarez 1999 indicated the possibility of land atmosphere feedback in the complex relationship among rof p and et based on the budyko hypothesis budyko 1974 therefore increased p leads to a positive relationship with rof in this notation et may exert a positive relationship on p which would lead to a positive relationship to rof the positive sm rof correlation over most parts of the study area in each season is reasonable according to the storage of sm and the strong land atmosphere interactions over these regions the area with positive sm p feedback always presents positive sm rof feedback such phenomena also indicate the importance of sm in the partitioning of p into rof and et 4 3 compound soil moisture hydroclimate interacting regime diagnosis according to the pc index the strength of sm hydroclimate interactions based on different data are spatially heterogenous in each season to better recognize sm hydroclimate interactions over the tp the ccp and ccs are defined to characterize the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength among multiple data sources under different conditions the ccp and ccs of the inner quartile figure s21 in the supplementary and the whole data set figure s22 in the supplementary consistently reflect weak and less spatially continuous hot spots compared to those of the outer quartile fig 10 as shown in fig 10 the land atmosphere interaction over the tp is dominated with positive sm p sm rof and sm et feedback combined with negative sm t2m feedback in most seasons the sm p and sm t2m feedbacks are insignificant in most parts of the tp while the sm rof and sm et feedbacks passed the 0 1si significance test at most hot spots with strong positive signals by comparison the sm p coupling strength is stronger in spring and summer with the hot spot mainly located at the changtang plateau such coupling is weakened in autumn and winter when the climate turns colder similar to sm p coupling sm t2m coupling strength is also stronger in spring and summer the hot spot is located mainly at the changtang plateau in spring and shifts to the north northwestern tarim basin and to the south southeastern brahmaputra and lower sources of the yangtze mekong and lancang river basins in summer sm t2m coupling is mixed with both positive and negative feedback in autumn and winter due to the cold climate regime sm rof coupling is dominantly positive over most parts of the tp especially in summer and autumn sm et is diagnosed with positive feedback over most parts of the tp in each season with some exceptions at the southeastern tp in summer the area with strong positive sm p or negative sm t2m feedback is within the strong positive sm et feedback area the changtang plateau in the inner tp and southeastern tp along the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins is recognized as the area with strong sm hydroclimate interactions in most seasons especially in spring and summer within this area the sm p feedback is primarily positive combined with negative sm t2m and positive sm et feedback 5 land atmosphere coupling experimental results analysis the pc index and the ccp and ccs metrics provide a statistical method to evaluate the land hydroclimate interaction regimes physically based models may explore the mechanisms of sm hydroclimate interactions deeper the typical glace offers a unique widely used framework to quantify the land atmosphere coupling strength at weekly to seasonal timescales koster et al 2004 this study revisits the glace approach using the regcm4 model established by liu et al 2014 to further diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength over the tp as the conditional correlation method explores the land hydroclimate coupling at the 21 day timescale in each season the glace related index is also derived based on the 21 day totals the sm response on the synoptic six day scale is shown in figure s23 in the supplementary materials for comparison the applied anomalies of sm between the s ensemble and the w ensemble is quantified using the same peak probability density method as that for p δ ω p t2m δ ω t and rof δ ω rof the index δ ω et σ et proposed by liu et al 2014 is used to evaluate the strength of the sm et link where δ ω et is the glace index for et and σ et is the standard deviation of et from the w ensembles due to the weak sm hydroclimate interaction in the cold winter environment only the results in spring summer and autumn are investigated in comparison the peak value for the glace related index δ ω sm δ ω p δ ω t δ ω rof and δ ω et at the 21 day timescale fig 11 presents a similar spatial pattern with those at the synoptic scale figure s23 but resembles slightly higher magnitude i e δ ω sm δ ω rof and δ ω p at some regions and times such as the changtang plateau in summer and autumn the cdf for the peak glace related index and si metric at different timescales figure s24 as well as the ratio of peak glace index categorized by different constraints in the nine sub regions table s4 1 table s4 2 figure s25 further demonstrate the similar sm hydroclimate interaction at the two different time scales in the following we focus on the 21 day timescale as shown in fig 11 the response of sm between the s and the w ensemble is positive in each studied season the hot spot is located mainly over parts of the tarim basin qaidam basin changtang plateau in spring summer and autumn while at most part of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and lower reaches of the brahmaputra river basins in summer consistent with the conditional correlation method the glace related sm hydroclimate interaction is spatiotemporally heterogenous especially for sm p and sm t2m coupling the sm p and sm t2m coupling is primarily positive in spring and autumn while mixed with positive and negative signals in summer specifically the hot spot with significant positive sm p feedback is mainly located over parts of qaidam basin in spring sources of yellow yangtze mekong salween river basins and middle to lower reaches brahmaputra river basin in spring summer autumn and changtang plateau in spring and summer the sm t2m coupling is significant positive in spring and autumn over most parts of the study area the hot spot with negative sm t2m feedback is located mainly over parts of tarim basin lower sources of yangtze mekong salween river basins and middle to lower reaches of brahmaputra river basin in summer and southwestern changtang plateau in autumn the sm rof coupling is dominated by strong significant positive feedback in each season especially in summer and autumn the sm et coupling is primarily positive in each season especially in spring and summer in the nine sub regions table s4 2 and figure s25 the ratio of pc and si index also indicate a positive sm p and sm t2m coupling in most of the sub regions in spring and autumn while mixed positive and negative sm p and sm t2m coupling were observed in summer consistent with the spatial distribution the sm p feedback is insignificant in most sub regions according to the low ratio below 30 of pc values with si lower than 0 1 while the sm t2m coupling is significant in some subregions according to the high ratio above 30 of positive pc values and si lower than 0 1 in comparison most sub regions indicate positive sm p and sm t2m feedback in spring i e sub regions s1 s2 s5 s8 and autumn i e sub regions s1 s5 s7 and s8 while indicate negative sm p feedback and positive sm t2m feedback in summer i e sub regions s1 s4 s5 s7 and s8 all sub regions indicate significant positive sm rof feedback in each season except qaidam basin sub region s5 in spring the sm et coupling is significant positive in most sub regions in spring while only significant in sub regions s5 to s7 changtang plateau tarim and qaidam basin in summer and in sub regions s1 s2 s5 and s6 east and north tp in autumn specifically the sub regions s3 s4 and s9 in the upper sources of the yellow yangtze upper area mekong and salween river basins and middle to lower reaches of the brahmaputra river basin in spring the sub regions s1 s4 s5 and s7 in the qaidam basin changtang plateau the upper sources of the yellow yangtze mekong and salween river basins in summer and the sub region s6 in the tarim basin in autumn stand out as the areas with negative sm hydroclimate interactions which present positive sm et t2m rof feedback and negative sm p feedback as illustrated in previous literature i e alessi et al 2022 zhou et al 2019 the negative sm p feedback scenario may increase the capability of a system to regulate its moisture content therefore convective p is more likely to develop in the area with negative sm p feedback when the soils are dry the spatiotemporal distribution of the glace metric fig 11 table s4 2 and the pc index fig 9 table s1 4 based on the regcm4 simulation are in good agreement especially for sm rof and sm et coupling both methods indicate strong significant positive sm rof and sm et feedback in most parts of the study area in each season the sm p and sm t2m coupling with si lower than 0 1 is spatially scattered however both methods indicate that parts of the changtang plateau tarim basin and the yellow river basin in spring and autumn stand out as hot spots with positive sm p feedback while lower reaches of sources of yangtze mekong and salween river basins in summer and middle to lower reaches of the brahmaputra river basin in summer and autumn stand out as the hot spots with negative sm t2m feedback compared to the pc index based on the reanalysis data era5 land noah and clsm fig 6 to fig 8 the sm hydroclimate interaction pattern and strength based on the regcm4 model both glace and conditional correlation method fig 9 and fig 11 is detected with some obvious differences especially in sm p and sm t2m coupling this may be due to the applied model dynamic system the pc index based on the regcm4 simulation is weak and spatially scattered under the same conditions as the applied reanalysis data i e era5 land and gldas products in addition the hydroclimate variables p t2m et sm rof from the regcm4 simulation figure s1 to figure s5 also present some obvious bias with the reanalysis data on the seasonal timescale especially for the sm simulations however compared to the compound result fig 11 both methods indicate mixed positive and negative sm hydroclimate interactions in spring summer and autumn fig 10 and fig 11 the hot spots with positive sm p feedback are mainly located at parts of changtang plateau yellow yangtze river basin in spring summer and autumn mekong and salween river basin in spring and autumn and brahmaputra river basin in autumn the hot spots with negative sm t2m feedback are mainly located at parts of tarim basin middle to lower reaches of brahmaputra river basin and lower sources of yangtze mekong salween river basin in summer both methods indicate significant positive sm rof and sm et feedback at most parts of the study area especially in summer and autumn this study provides a method to diagnose the land atmosphere interaction patterns and strength using limited available high resolution reanalysis data and one typical regional climate model the results may contain some uncertainties due to the uncertainty of applied data in the study area and the physical parameters from different models more effort and caution should be taken to further investigate the land atmosphere interactions over the tp in the future 6 conclusions the tp is an important climate unit in the earth s climate system and its response to climate change is much faster than in other areas land use changes may significantly impact subsequent hydroclimate situations at sub seasonal and seasonal timescales according to the mechanisms of local land atmosphere interactions under climate change due to the harsh environmental conditions high elevations complex topography and heterogeneous surfaces the meteorological stations over the tp are biased and sparsely distributed which limits the recognition of local land atmosphere interactions this study adopted the newly published high resolution reanalysis data era5 land gldas noah and clsm products and regcm4 model to diagnose the sm hydroclimate interaction patterns and strength at seasonal timescales using two traditional approaches the conditional correlation coefficient and glace type experimental modeling a common aggregation method is suggested to recognize the compound hot spots with strong sm hydroclimate interaction among multiple data sources the major findings are concluded as follows 1 in the land atmosphere interaction over the tp sm p coupling is observed to be dominantly positive in most seasons the hot spot is mainly located on the changtang plateau in spring and summer sm p coupling is weakened in autumn and winter when the climate turns cold meanwhile sm t2m coupling is primarily negative with the hot spot located mainly on the changtang plateau in spring and shifting to the north northwestern tarim basin and the south southeastern brahmaputra and lower sources of the yangtze mekong and lancang river basins in summer 2 et acts as a vital linkage in sm p t2m coupling only areas with strong positive sm et coupling have the potential to exhibit strong positive sm p feedback and negative sm t2m feedback the area with strong sm p and or sm t2m coupling is found to overlap with the area with strong positive sm et coupling in each season 3 sm plays an important role in influencing the local rof in each season sm rof coupling is strong and dominantly positive in each season especially in summer in most part of the tp the nexus of sm et rof interaction is complex sm rof coupling is typically stronger in areas with strong positive sm p feedback and weak or negative sm et feedback 4 the sm hydroclimate interaction is stronger under extreme climate conditions when the variability of seasonal p is larger in this study the sm hydroclimate interaction was stronger in years with significantly high or low total p 5 the sm hydroclimate interaction based on glace is spatially heterogeneous in spring summer and autumn however both glace and the conditional correlation method diagnosed the hot spot of sm hydroclimate interaction sm p t2m located mainly on the changtang plateau at the inner tp and the southeastern tp within the sources of the yellow yangtze mekong salween and brahmaputra river basins in the studied seasons meanwhile sm rof coupling is strong and positive in most parts of the tp interactions are stronger in the summer and autumn seasons as presented in this study the local land atmosphere interaction over the tp is spatially and temporally heterogeneous based on different reanalysis products and model simulations high resolution data especially the land state data are still the main barrier in studying land atmosphere interactions over the tp this study contributes to the recognition of land atmosphere coupling at seasonal timescales over the tp additionally new methodology is also required to determine the main interactions among multiple data sources the compound aggregation method is proven to be efficient in recognizing land atmosphere coupling among multiple data sources this method may also be applied

1967,gas leakage may occur in pipelines or subsurface storage sites the appearance of a new gas phase in the geological subsurface can impede groundwater flow and increase total media compressibility with both effects increasing with larger gas phase volumes in near surface aquifers these changes can be assessed by determining changes in hydraulic conductivity and specific storage using conventional pumping tests these allow an observer to detect and delineate the occurrence of a new gas phase in this study this idea was tested using methane gas and hydrogen gas injection experiments which were conducted at the testum field site in germany a series of multi level cross well and depth oriented pumping tests were conducted before and after injection of the hydrogen and methane gas phases the results show a significant decrease of hydraulic conductivity and a significant increase of specific storage estimated from the drawdown data due to the presence of the gas phases hydraulic conductivity and specific storage were found to vary by up to 86 and 65 900 respectively after gas phase injection while repeated baseline tests yielded a variation of less than 28 and 340 prior to gas phase injection these changes are correlated and their occurrence and magnitude can be used to roughly locate the gas phases as only standard hydrogeological field equipment and evaluation techniques are required this approach represents a new monitoring option to detect an intruding gas phase in near surface aquifers keywords cross well multilevel pumping test field investigation methane and hydrogen injection experiment analytical solution time lapse hydraulic properties data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction detection and monitoring of the occurrence of a gas phase is required when it is introduced into the subsurface in particular the saturation of the gas phase and thus the spatial extent needs to be characterized which also serves as a basis for assessing the concentrations of the dissolved gas and the chemical reactions potentially induced gas phases may be newly introduced due to leakage from gas pipelines or from gas stored in deeper formations as well as due to degassing caused by temperature changes such leakages could potentially occur during subsurface storage of hydrogen synthetic methane or compressed air e g gasanzade et al 2021 ozarslan 2012 pfeiffer et al 2017 wang and bauer 2017 required for the transition to fluctuating renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power bauer et al 2017 2013 a gas phase can be directly measured in boreholes using specific instruments e g bartholmai et al 2013 ko et al 2020 such as moisture sensors which can detect the presence or absence of water changes in the chemical composition of groundwater samples can also be used to infer the presence of a gas phase by measuring the appearance of the dissolved gas components in the water samples e g cahill et al 2017 dafflon et al 2013 a method well known from contaminated site investigations however these measurements provide only point information which requires a large number of adequately placed sensors to spatially map the gas phase depending on the spatial density and detailed location of the measurement points the spatial interpolation of the point measurements may allow for only a partial mapping of the gas phase distribution as well as miss the high saturation areas geophysical methods such as surface or cross hole seismic surveys e g hagrey et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 as well as electrical resistance tomography ert e g schmidt hattenberger et al 2016 and gravity monitoring e g alnes et al 2011 sugihara et al 2013 have been used to identify the hydrostratigraphic setting of the gas phase and characterize its temporal evolution by tracking the changes of the corresponding geophysical parameters these approaches have also been shown to be applicable to large scale deep gas reservoirs for the purposes of geological carbon dioxide sequestration e g benisch et al 2015 or energy storage e g bauer et al 2017 pfeiffer et al 2016 such geophysical methods allow for a spatially continuous investigation in the subsurface although their indirect nature means that identifying the relevant flow properties and petrophysical relationships remains a challenge furthermore a high contrast or change of the geophysical parameters used by the monitoring method must be induced by the presence of the gas phase in order to obtain signals clear enough to detect also small volumes of gas phase hu et al 2017 benisch et al 2015 an alternative to these geophysical methods is pressure based methods conventional single and multi well tests have long been proven to provide single phase flow parameters from the laboratory scale to scales of up to several kilometres e g theis 1935 schad and teutsch 1994 butler et al 1999 liu et al 2007 ni et al 2011 and are applicable to both porous and fracture media e g bernard et al 2006 brauchler et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zha et al 2014 the scale of pressure tests mainly depends on the pumping or injection rate and duration productivity or injectivity of the test well transmissivity and compressibility of the aquifer the hydraulic boundaries as well as the accuracy of the measuring equipment if wells are available with good hydraulic connection to the aquifer monitoring pressure fluctuations using modern sample devices e g gunning et al 2020 can be accurate and inexpensive with the presence of the gas phase the flow properties vary with the volume and occurrence of the gas and these variations directly affect the pressure response when conducting hydraulic tests in a time lapse manner hu et al 2015 feasibility of applying time lapse hydraulic or pressure tests to detect and monitor gas phases was mainly studied previously in large and deep reservoirs e g birkholzer et al 2015 jung et al 2013 jackson et al 2021 however so far no study has been reported in the literature which investigates this monitoring option for near surface aquifer conditions the detection and monitoring of a gas phase in a near surface aquifer by time lapse hydraulic tests seems feasible especially because a higher number of wells and thus positions for both sender and receiver are possible and typically more information on the geologic and hydrogeologic setting are available compared to deeper settings of a few tens to hundreds of meters this study therefore investigates the feasibility of time lapse pumping tests for gas phase detection in near surface aquifers based on standard hydrogeological methods for this study we conducted a series of interference pumping tests in a shallow aquifer before and after an injection of a gas phase in order to explore its potential as a new monitoring method the key issue addressed here is the detectability of any changes of the flow properties in the shallow aquifer due to the occurrence of a gas phase and whether these changes can be inferred from pumping tests by using conventional analytical fitting methods cross well multilevel configurations were used to characterize the baseline hydraulic properties of the aquifer prior to gas injection and for repeated surveys after the injection of methane and hydrogen hydraulic parameters were estimated before and after the gas injections using standard analytical solutions the results were compared systematically in order to investigate the repeatability and reproducibility of this method and to identify the gas phase induced changes of the hydraulic parameters 2 field site field test sites offer a unique opportunity to collect data and test both characterization and monitoring methods on a scale relevant to later applications the testum field site https www testum aquifer de was established to investigate processes induced by heat or gas storage as well as their subsequent environmental impacts the testum site is located near the town of wittstock in north eastern germany fig 1 a and is jointly operated by kiel university and the helmholz centre for environmental research ufz it contains sub sites used to study the effects of injections of heat using high temperature water at about 80 c heldt et al 2021a 2021b and the gases methane and hydrogen as well as induced geochemical lüders et al 2021 and biological keller et al 2021 processes the field site has previously been used to study carbon dioxide in a near surface aquifer peter et al 2012 and is currently being used for methane and hydrogen injection experiments fig 1a the field work for this paper was performed at the methane and hydrogen subsites within the testum aquifer project the regional geological conditions consist of glaciofluvial deposits formed from the saale and vistula glacial stages electrical resistivity tomography ert surveys were carried out from 2010 to 2011 to obtain the primary stratigraphic information from the near subsurface complemented by electrical conductivity ec and hydraulic profiling tool hpt logs collected using the direct push technique dietrich and leven 2006 mccall and christy 2020 these yielded indications of spatial distribution of permeability as well as the presence of aquifers and confining units using this information an aquifer with a confining unit above and an aquiclude below could be identified starting at a depth of approximately 10 m below surface with aquifer thickness of about 8 5 m at w3 and about 9 0 m at w4 the aquifer material consists of saalian sand coarse to fine and gravel medium and fine with a small portion of silt two inch observation wells for groundwater monitoring and pressure observations were installed each with three screens of one meter length located at 12 13 m 14 15 m and 16 17 m depth at the methane site and at 11 12 m 14 15 m and 17 18 m depth at the hydrogen site depending on the local lithography the top and middle screens of w4 2z u05 and w4 2z u07 in the hydrogen subsite see fig 1c were located 1 and 2 m deeper than the other wells respectively table b1 three continuous multichannel tubing system cmt wells were installed and used for gas injection at each subsite einarson and cherry 2002 each well features an open section of 20 cm length at 17 m and 18 m depth respectively the location of the cmt injection wells is marked in red in fig 1b and 1c measured groundwater levels in the boreholes are about 3 m below the land surface indicating confined groundwater conditions the flow direction of the regional groundwater is generally from the northeast to the southwest towards the river dosse which is about 800 m west of the site from previous investigations heldt et al 2021a lamert et al 2012 löffler et al 2022 the hydraulic gradient and estimated groundwater flow velocity vary from 0 001 to 0 005 and 0 07 m d to 0 3 m d over the entire test site respectively 3 time lapse pumping tests in order to determine the change in hydraulic properties due to the injection of the methane gas or hydrogen gas cross well multilevel pumping tests were conducted before and after gas injection from the measurements prior to gas injection regarded here as a baseline measurement the hydraulic properties of the aquifer can be determined each pumping test was performed in a section of a two inch well at the same time pumping induced pressure changes were monitored at up to three other two inch wells using pressure sensors in up to three sections each fig 1c and 1d illustrate the detailed test configurations used at the individual subsites the pumping section was isolated from the other two sections using two connected packers between which a submersible pump grundfos mp1 or whale electric galley pump gp1352 was placed together with a pressure sensor solinst levellogger edge m30 to record the pressure changes in the pumping section see fig 1e all three screens of a well were pumped consecutively and the packers were moved within the well vertically to the pumped section in the observation wells a double packer system was also employed to hydraulically isolate the three screen sections with three pressure sensors solinst levellogger edge m20 placed at each screen to record the pressure responses individually this packer system did not change position during the tests a barometric pressure sensor solinst barologger edge m5 was used to record atmospheric pressure at the site and to correct the measured water pressure data using this configuration the pressure response induced by pumping at one screen could be recorded at up to 10 locations as drawdown curves baseline pumping tests at the two gas sites were conducted from 24 october 2018 to 3 november 2018 at the methane site w3 and 10 december 2019 to 12 december 2019 at the hydrogen site w4 according to the measurements from the monitoring wells the pressure increase caused by the gas injection recovered soon i e within hours after the end of the injection this implies that the gas phase was spreading rapidly during the injection and for a few hours to days after injection ends with the gas then being residually trapped and stable a residually trapped gas phase cannot be mobilized by moving the adjacent water furthermore pumping rates used were on the order of 4 l min which corresponds to a total water extraction of about 120 l and a water movement of about 6 mm in a distance of 1 m to the pumping well therefore for this work it is assumed that the gas phase is immobile this small pumping rate is also intended to minimize the volume of pumped water and the movement of the gas plume as well as the impacts on concentrations of chemical substances each pumping test lasted for approximately 50 min at w3 and 10 30 min at w4 followed by a pressure recovery back to the initial status repeated baseline pumping tests were conducted for some wells at the hydrogen site in november 2019 and january 2020 fig 1d dashed lines in order to evaluate the repeatability of the pumping tests based on the measured groundwater level at approximately 66 m asl and the location of the well screens see table b1 and fig 1d as well as the location of the test aquifer figs a1 and a2 the pumping tests were conducted under confined conditions also as found from the other field work performed at this site the confining unit seems to extend horizontally as it was also identified at the other sub test sites in peter et al 2012 or heldt et al 2021a a total of 34 kg of methane and 12 kg of hydrogen were injected at the bottom of the aquifer through cmt wells starting on 14 may 2019 and 28 january 2020 respectively because hydrogen gas has a lower density and a higher mobility under near surface conditions as compared to methane a smaller mass of hydrogen is required to achieve a gas impacted volume similar to that of methane both gas injections lasted less than three days with varying injection rates to enhance the spatial distribution of the gas phase following the gas injection process the cross well multilevel pumping tests were repeated seven days afterwards at both sites using the same configuration as for the baseline measurements post injection 1 at the methane site a second set of pumping tests was conducted 56 days after the injection post injection 2 all tests were conducted using similar durations and pumping rates as part of the chemical sampling campaigns to minimize effects on the in situ gas phase distribution or disturbance of the geochemical signals at the methane site the bottom screens of a number of the two inch wells could not be used for pumping as they were clogged by sand a likely reason for this is that the filter gauze used during the well construction was too coarse to prevent the inflow of local fine grained sediments in some of the bottom screens less clogging occurred at post injection 2 probably due to sediment removal during the geochemical sampling activities as the local hydrogeologic setting represents confined groundwater with partially penetrating well screens the analytical solution by dougherty babu dougherty and babu 1984 was used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer assuming homogeneous and isotropic conditions since this work focuses on aquifer properties only the late time drawdown data from the observation wells are fitted well skin and well storage effects in the pumping well are thus not considered because they do not correlate with the late response to pumping at an observation well fitting was performed using aqtesolv pro 4 5 duffield 2007 to estimate hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss for each pumping observation well section pair separately detailed information on aquifer and well parameters and the positions of the well screens used are listed in tables a1 and b1 4 results 4 1 comparison of the scaled drawdown curves on the basis of the pumping configurations presented in fig 1b and 1d a total of 109 drawdown curves were obtained prior to the methane injection experiments including 12 from the test wells and 97 from the observation wells pressure data obtained at the pumping wells showed well skin effects and thus could not be quantitatively used in the further analysis furthermore another 10 pressure curves had to be excluded due to experimental failures which were caused by leaking packers or data shifting due to vertical movements of the data loggers detailed explanations are provided in the supplementary material s2 and s3 thus a total of 87 baseline as well as 49 post injection 1 and 66 post injection 2 drawdown curves respectively are available for evaluation for better comparison all measured drawdown data were linearly scaled e g chen et al 2019 le coz et al 2017 to a constant pumping rate of 5 l min figs s2 and s3 which is possible because drawdown depends linearly on the pumping rate as a representative example fig 2 depicts the scaled drawdown curves from observation well w3 2z u12 while w3 2z u07 was used as a pumping well the drawdown observed at the top section of the observation well after the gas injection is significantly larger than in the baseline data for all three pumping depths indicating a decrease of the hydraulic conductivity k for these pairs of pumping well and observation well sections referred to in this work as an array furthermore the time lapse drawdown curves for some arrays show a delay to the pressure response of the post injection pressure curve relative to the baseline curve for example for the top section of the pumping well to the bottom section of the observation well indicating an increase of the storage coefficient the remaining post injection drawdowns exhibit a similar behaviour as the baseline drawdown indicating only very small alterations of the hydraulic properties due to the presence of a small amount of gas phase or measurement errors in these arrays for example for the bottom section pumping well to the bottom section of the observation well at the hydrogen site for the first baseline test before the gas injection baseline 1 100 drawdown curves were measured at the observation wells from the repeated baseline tests baseline 2 at wells w4 2z d01 d10 and d18 42 drawdown curves were obtained in total while 99 drawdown curves were obtained seven days after the hydrogen injection post injection all available drawdown measurements were scaled as described for the methane site and are plotted in fig s2 after filtering for sensor shifts and packer failures in fig 3 time lapse drawdown curves measured at observation well w4 2z d06 while pumping at well w4 2z d18 at the hydrogen injection site are shown due to the greater distance between the well pair drawdown is only about 1 cm and thus a lower signal to noise ratio is achieved than at the methane site most of the drawdowns from the two baseline tests show very similar behaviour concerning drawdown magnitude and time indicating a good reproducibility quantified later on measured post injection drawdowns generally show a time delay for the pressure signal but no clear change in drawdown amplitude as for the methane site changes are more pronounced in the upper part of the aquifer 4 2 repeatability of the baseline pumping tests before gas injection before drawdown curve fitting to derive k and ss for each pumping observation array high frequency fluctuations see fig c1 for an illustrative example were filtered out of the data from the hydrogen site using wavelet denoising e g yang et al 2020 fig 4 a shows the obtained k values for baseline 2 versus the values from baseline 1 i e before the gas injection a clear correlation of the values is obtained showing a good repeatability of the test with larger errors for larger hydraulic conductivities this indicates that the errors are linearly distributed and two linear functions can be derived to delimit the error region because k values are linearly related to the late time drawdowns the slope of the linear functions was determined by using the maximum variation of k a good correlation between the two baseline measurements is also found for ss the error seems to increase linearly only at lower values of ss with smaller relative errors for a larger ss the smaller ss values are more sensitive to the early drawdown data and are thus more strongly affected by well effects and measurement errors the error region in this case is therefore delimited by two linear functions and their inverse functions as shown in fig 4b these error regions will be used to identify the relevant changes of k and ss due to gas injection and are shown again in fig 7 in the case where the fitted k or ss values from the post injection fall within the error region any variation in k or ss is considered to be a measurement error and is not clearly caused by the presence of the gas phase fig 4 also shows that the error region for k is much narrower than for s s indicating a better reproducibility the reason for this is that ss is mainly determined by the early time drawdown data which can be more susceptible to wellbore storage measurement errors or experimental procedures such as unstable pumping rates or inertia effects while k is more closely related to the late time drawdown data usually recorded after a steady state discharge rate has been established 4 3 changes in hydraulic conductivity and specific storage due to gas injection k and ss were obtained by analytical fitting of the drawdown data for both investigated sites for the baseline as well as the post injection measurements for a better overview of the results the distribution of the k and ss values is illustrated in fig 5 using violin plots a violin plot is a combination of a box plot and a kernel density estimation depicting the statistical distribution of the samples as well as the mean and quartile values hintze and nelson 1998 the kernel density is obtained by the sum of the estimated probability density functions pdf at each sampling point it is a nonparametric method for obtaining smooth and continuous data distributions based on finite data samples even if only sparse samples are available hintze and nelson 1998 a normal distribution was assumed to define the shape of the individual pdfs the density trace was calculated using the kernel density function of matlab bechtold 2016 additionally the median arithmetic mean and standard deviation of all data sets were calculated and summarized in the appendix in tables d1 and d2 fig 5a shows the violin plots of the k values estimated from the time lapse drawdown data the mean k values from the baseline measurements for the methane and hydrogen sites are 3 5 10 4 m s and 7 9 10 4 m s respectively showing that the hydrogen site is on average more hydraulically permeable as can be seen from the larger spread of the fitted values the hydrogen site exhibits a higher degree of heterogeneity than the methane site as the spread of hydraulic conductivity values is lower in general after the gas injections the fitted k values for the two sites are smaller than the baseline value at the methane site mean k for post injection 1 and 2 decreases by a factor of 0 59 and 0 60 relative to the baseline i e to about 60 of the baseline value for the arrays indicating the presence of methane only minor changes can be discerned between post injection 1 and post injection 2 indicating that movement of the gas phase was mostly completed at the time of the post injection 1 measurement moreover the k values show an approximately normal distribution for the baseline and post injection 1 values while the distribution for post injection 2 is skewed towards larger values comparison between the density trace of the two post injections also shows that a slight increase in median k is found for post injection 2 as well as a decrease of the lowest identified k values a possible reason for this is that the amount of gas phase trapped in the monitoring network slightly decreases with time while at the same time redistributing and accumulating at the aquifer top therefore some smaller values were found in the post injection 2 i e the tail part in the trace likewise for the hydrogen site the mean k value from the post injection decreases by a factor of 0 612 as the sample size and the noise level of drawdowns from the two campaigns are comparable the different shape of the traces and the reduced spread of the post injection k values reflects the spatially non uniform gas saturations fig 5b shows the violin plots of the ss values the mean ss values estimated from the baseline for the methane and hydrogen sites are 3 41 10 5 1 m and 9 40 10 5 1 m respectively with a large spread over several orders of magnitude for both sites these values are representative for unconsolidated sediments under near surface conditions e g freeze and cherry 1979 hu 2011 zhao and illman 2018 the larger values found in the hydrogen site may be due to the difference in particle size distribution and material compressibility between the test and observation wells specifically several very small ss values were derived from the baseline at the methane site which are considered to be due to the low storativity at certain arrays e g pumping at w3 2z u03 with observations at w3 2z d12 and u12 rather than measurement outliers after the methane injection mean ss increases by a factor of 2 93 and 2 42 for the post injection measurements relative to the baseline the spread of the ss values becomes significantly smaller than for the baseline this can be mainly due to the smaller sample number from the post injections the distribution of ss at post injection 1 shows a more obvious skew towards the larger values than post injection 2 indicating the gas phase decreased between the two post injections however unlike k the maximum values of ss from the two post injections are quite similar information about the redistribution of the gas phase might be concealed by the measurement error at the hydrogen site the time lapse measurements yield a similar result as for the methane site showing an increase in mean ss by factors of 2 8 all these findings at the two sites are in accordance with the generally expected effect which is that fitted hydraulic conductivity should decrease due to the presence of an injected gas phase while the fitted storage coefficient should increase the gas phase can partially occupy the pore space and reduce the flow paths for the water phase hence the relative permeability of the water phase decreases leading to a smaller hydraulic conductivity on the other hand both methane and hydrogen have a relatively large compressibility in the near subsurface which can significantly increase the storativity of the entire flow system fig 6 depicts the post injection k and ss values for the pumping observation arrays versus the baseline values also shown are the error regions as derived from the repeating baseline tests values within the error regions cannot be clearly attributed to the gas injection as they might also stem from experimental errors and are thus printed in lighter colours as a result 42 and 95 pairs of k and ss values at the methane and hydrogen sites respectively show significant changes outside the error region and can thus be attributed to the gas phase injection this demonstrates that the local hydraulic properties in the aquifer volume between the pumping and the observation well have changed significantly due to the presence of the injected gas phase for the methane site gas phase induced changes in k and ss were more pronounced than at the hydrogen site with nearly all fitted k values showing a significant change due to the gas phase for both post injection 1 and 2 furthermore changes are most pronounced near the three north eastern wells w3 2z u03 u07 and u12 indicating that a significant part of the gas phase has moved there for the hydrogen site the same principal findings can be derived both imply that the gas phase moved preferentially to the regions of high kpre and low ss pre these regions cannot be directly correlated to the geological information obtained from borehole measurements or cores as these indicate homogeneous conditions throughout the area covered by the gas injection and pumping tests however due to the higher level of noise in the data a larger fraction of the fitted k values is inside the error region as compared with the methane site the ss values are consistent with k values indicating that the strongest changes occurred near w4 2z d01 and d18 towards the west for both sites fitted k yields more values outside the error region which can be clearly attributed to the injected gas phase due to its better repeatability identified in the baseline measurements some of the ss values inside but close to the boundaries of the error region may also be caused by the injected gas phases but may be obscured by the noise as shown in fig 6 clear changes due to gas phase injection of k and ss were identified from the data even when accounting for the measurement errors as determined from the repeated baseline tests this finding indicates that the movement of water was generally restricted and bulk compressibility increased due to the presence of a gas phase as the injected gas phase is the common reason for these changes in k and ss so the effects might be correlated this is investigated in fig 7 which displays d s s s s p o s t s s p r e versus dk k post k pre for the two sites for the values both inside and outside the error regions the black dots indicate the significant changes due to the gas phase while the grey dots represent changes considered to be caused by measurement errors for the methane site the maximum decrease and maximum increase in dk and dss are 0 4 and 659 respectively when considering only the significant changes for the hydrogen site these values are 0 14 and 430 respectively this shows that k is reduced more strongly at the hydrogen site while the ss increases more at the methane site a possible explanation for this could be that the correlation between the dk and dss for these two gases is different as they have different fluid properties such as density viscosity or compressibility a comparison of hydrogen and methane gas density viscosity and compressibility at pressure and temperature conditions at the field site shows that compressibility and viscosity have similar values but that density differs by a factor of about 8 thus hydrogen gas will be more mobile in the aquifer showing a stronger buoyant rise within the aquifer as well as penetrating into smaller pores than methane both effects may contribute to the different size of changes for hydrogen and methane identified in fig 7 overall a general trend between dk and dss can be found with larger changes of dk being accompanied by larger changes in dss however no clear correlation of dk and dss can be derived from fig 7 as the reasons for the individual changes seem to depend on local hydrological factors and the small scale distribution of the gas phase as well for all three campaigns the variation of ss was much larger than the variation of k the pumping observation well arrays which exhibit significant changes in fitted k and ss can be used to infer information on the gas phase distribution in the aquifer in fig 8 dimensional plots of all tested arrays are shown while arrays with significant changes of dk and dss are shown using bold lines the dimensional plots of the methane site fig 8a and 8b indicate that the methane gas phase is mainly present in the north western part of the monitoring network as already found from fig 6 towards the east even close distances to the eastern injection well no significant changes were detected changes over the full aquifer thickness occur only at some measurement arrays due to sanding in some of the lowest screen sections the post injection pumping tests could not be repeated at all bottom screens however from the measurements obtained it is clear that the methane gas phase was present in larger quantities at the lower and the western parts of the aquifer in post injection 1 than for post injection 2 between post injection 1 and post injection 2 therefore the volume of the methane gas phase seems to have reduced in the lower and in the eastern part probably due to an upward migration and a lateral movement in a westward direction in addition the reduced gas phase distribution may also be caused by dissolution of gas in the groundwater fig 8c shows the equivalent figure for the hydrogen site indicating that the injected hydrogen gas mainly migrated towards the south western part of the monitoring network as significant changes in dk and dss are only found there while the north eastern part near well w4 2z u05 shows no indication of a gas phase as significant changes are identified in all depth levels the hydrogen gas seems to be distributed over the total aquifer thickness this spatial distribution is likely due to the low density and high mobility of hydrogen compared to water 5 discussion this work is to the authors best knowledge the first test of applying cross well multilevel pumping tests at a real field site for detecting hydraulic changes induced by methane and hydrogen gas injection experiments a three dimensional cross well multilevel configuration was designed using a set of partially screened wells in combination with packer systems as analogues of many time lapse methods the repeatability of the pumping tests was explored by repeating baseline pumping tests prior to gas injection the k and ss values for each individual drawdown curve were estimated by an analytical solution that adequately represented the experimental set up and aquifer conditions the fitting results indicate that k has a better reproducibility than ss as values fitted to the repeated baseline tests are very similar and show a narrower error region than values for ss this is consistent with the findings from a study on the reproducibility of low flow rate pumping tests by robbins et al 2009 the higher the reproducibility the more clearly that the variations in k and ss caused by the introduction of a gas phase can be distinguished from data noise experience from depth integrated pumping tests at the same field site supplementary material s4 indicates that a higher reproducibility could be obtained when using larger and temporally highly stable pumping rates of about 20 l min a higher temporal resolution of the measured drawdown data would also improve the parameter estimation as also found by naderi and gupta 2020 drawdown measured during the post injection pumping tests can show a significant time shift as well as change of drawdown for some tomographic arrays thus indicating changes to the flow regime between the sender and receiver sections of the pumping test the post injection hydraulic conductivity shows a clear overall decrease due to the injected gas phase given the high reproducibility of k found in the baseline measurements however the baseline specific storage values present a higher variability as they are more sensitive to the heterogeneity between the test and observation wells as well as the measurement errors this is consistent with the findings of wu et al 2005 for example as the determination of k is sensitive to a larger aquifer volume than ss which can be strongly influenced by the hydraulic heterogeneity between the test and observation wells due to the large compressibility of methane and hydrogen as compared with water a strong increase in the specific storage can be observed therefore although the error range detected in the repeated baseline tests is rather large clear changes and trends can still be identified from the post injection pumping tests correlation between the changes of k and ss varies for the different gases as it depends not only on the gas saturation but also on the density viscosity compressibility and mobility of the individual gases the potential distribution of the gas phase as indicated by this method can be compared and verified with the field data such as on the concentration plume of the dissolved gas or the saturation measurements at certain locations although these require a large number of monitoring points spatially integrated methods such as cross hole seismic surveys or tomography may therefore be more suitable as they have a similar investigation scale as the cross well pumping tests applied here the method as presented uses a dense array of pumping and observation well sections which leads to a large number of pumping tests and observation data e g hu et al 2011 depending on the investigation scale required and the number and location of wells available the three dimensional configuration could be reduced to a two dimensional set up especially in cases where the aquifer thickness is smaller than the diameter of the investigated area this two dimensional approach would vastly reduce the field work required e g zha et al 2015 if the aim is the detection of changes only a possible reduced set up might also consist of a vertical cross section with at least two multilevel wells another option for reducing the monitoring efforts for gas phase occurrence would be to test only parts of the arrays for any individual time lapse and conduct the full survey only if these exemplary measurements indicate significant changes time lapse pumping tests pt can thus be used for spatial and temporal monitoring of gas phases due for example to leakages from the deeper subsurface or gas pipelines as only standard hydrogeological methods are required for the field investigations as well as evaluation based on the analytical solution outlined it is easy to use applicable with low conceptual hurdles and does not require major investment in expensive field equipment this time lapse pt method may thus provide a preliminary screening tool aimed at detection of the gas phase occurrence in near surface aquifers the downside is that this approach does not provide for a detailed spatial distribution of the gas phase as the cause for the changes in observed k and ss cannot be localized accurately however changes induced by the gas phase can still be approximately located when constructing the tomographic arrays therefore by using the time lapse pt those changes can be detected and roughly located and may thus be used to guide further investigations for example by indicating areas to be investigated using direct methods for the presence of a gas phase a direct observation of a gas phase using techniques such as soil gas measurements or direct push probes e g a membrane interface probe would thus be supported which might be required anyway due to regulations a better localization of the gas phase in the subsurface from time lapse pt data would require the use of appropriate inversion algorithms as well as the derivation of material models to unambiguously connect the changes in k and ss to a local gas saturation 6 conclusions this work investigates the changes induced by the occurrence of a gas phase in a near surface aquifer using standard hydrogeological methods for the field tests methane as well as hydrogen gas were injected into a near surface confined aquifer prior to as well as about one week after the injection a set of multi level multi well pumping tests were conducted using pumping and observation locations outside the gas affected area the recorded measurements were evaluated using standard pumping test evaluation methods it is found that the occurrence of the gas phases can be identified from these measurements as both the hydraulic conductivity as well as the storage coefficient derived from these pumping tests change significantly due to the presence of the gas phase it is also found that the occurrence of a methane or hydrogen gas phase in a shallow aquifer decreases the hydraulic conductivity and increase the specific storage as determined by the pumping tests both changes are in line with qualitative considerations of the multiphase flow behaviour the injected gas is more compressible than the groundwater which increases the specific storage but takes up pore space which limits the movement of groundwater and thus reduces the hydraulic conductivity with larger changes corresponding to larger gas saturations the changes are significant and found to be much larger than the measurement errors hydraulic conductivity is found to show a higher reproducibility than specific storage which is partly compensated by the higher changes of specific storage due to the high compressibility of the gas phase repeating pumping tests in shallow aquifers thus provides a potential monitoring method to identify changes in the spatial distribution of a gas phase as well as to detect the new occurrence of a gas phase such as by leakage from a nearby storage facility the drawdowns measured in the repeated pumping tests can be evaluated using conventional analytical fitting methods in order to estimate the changes in hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient therefore this monitoring method is easy to use as standard field and evaluation methods are usually available at institutes or companies working in hydrogeology the decrease in hydraulic conductivity and the increase in specific storage could provide a rough indication of the gas phase distribution if the entire gas phase is covered with pumping observation well arrays at a sufficient number of locations this would allow not only to detect but also to estimate the volume of a gas leakage into a shallow aquifer in practise the spatial scales of the investigation are expected to be larger than in this work which can be addressed by using larger pumping rates and longer pumping times to induce sufficiently large drawdowns credit authorship contribution statement linwei hu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft data

1967,gas leakage may occur in pipelines or subsurface storage sites the appearance of a new gas phase in the geological subsurface can impede groundwater flow and increase total media compressibility with both effects increasing with larger gas phase volumes in near surface aquifers these changes can be assessed by determining changes in hydraulic conductivity and specific storage using conventional pumping tests these allow an observer to detect and delineate the occurrence of a new gas phase in this study this idea was tested using methane gas and hydrogen gas injection experiments which were conducted at the testum field site in germany a series of multi level cross well and depth oriented pumping tests were conducted before and after injection of the hydrogen and methane gas phases the results show a significant decrease of hydraulic conductivity and a significant increase of specific storage estimated from the drawdown data due to the presence of the gas phases hydraulic conductivity and specific storage were found to vary by up to 86 and 65 900 respectively after gas phase injection while repeated baseline tests yielded a variation of less than 28 and 340 prior to gas phase injection these changes are correlated and their occurrence and magnitude can be used to roughly locate the gas phases as only standard hydrogeological field equipment and evaluation techniques are required this approach represents a new monitoring option to detect an intruding gas phase in near surface aquifers keywords cross well multilevel pumping test field investigation methane and hydrogen injection experiment analytical solution time lapse hydraulic properties data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction detection and monitoring of the occurrence of a gas phase is required when it is introduced into the subsurface in particular the saturation of the gas phase and thus the spatial extent needs to be characterized which also serves as a basis for assessing the concentrations of the dissolved gas and the chemical reactions potentially induced gas phases may be newly introduced due to leakage from gas pipelines or from gas stored in deeper formations as well as due to degassing caused by temperature changes such leakages could potentially occur during subsurface storage of hydrogen synthetic methane or compressed air e g gasanzade et al 2021 ozarslan 2012 pfeiffer et al 2017 wang and bauer 2017 required for the transition to fluctuating renewable energy sources such as wind or solar power bauer et al 2017 2013 a gas phase can be directly measured in boreholes using specific instruments e g bartholmai et al 2013 ko et al 2020 such as moisture sensors which can detect the presence or absence of water changes in the chemical composition of groundwater samples can also be used to infer the presence of a gas phase by measuring the appearance of the dissolved gas components in the water samples e g cahill et al 2017 dafflon et al 2013 a method well known from contaminated site investigations however these measurements provide only point information which requires a large number of adequately placed sensors to spatially map the gas phase depending on the spatial density and detailed location of the measurement points the spatial interpolation of the point measurements may allow for only a partial mapping of the gas phase distribution as well as miss the high saturation areas geophysical methods such as surface or cross hole seismic surveys e g hagrey et al 2014 zhang et al 2012 as well as electrical resistance tomography ert e g schmidt hattenberger et al 2016 and gravity monitoring e g alnes et al 2011 sugihara et al 2013 have been used to identify the hydrostratigraphic setting of the gas phase and characterize its temporal evolution by tracking the changes of the corresponding geophysical parameters these approaches have also been shown to be applicable to large scale deep gas reservoirs for the purposes of geological carbon dioxide sequestration e g benisch et al 2015 or energy storage e g bauer et al 2017 pfeiffer et al 2016 such geophysical methods allow for a spatially continuous investigation in the subsurface although their indirect nature means that identifying the relevant flow properties and petrophysical relationships remains a challenge furthermore a high contrast or change of the geophysical parameters used by the monitoring method must be induced by the presence of the gas phase in order to obtain signals clear enough to detect also small volumes of gas phase hu et al 2017 benisch et al 2015 an alternative to these geophysical methods is pressure based methods conventional single and multi well tests have long been proven to provide single phase flow parameters from the laboratory scale to scales of up to several kilometres e g theis 1935 schad and teutsch 1994 butler et al 1999 liu et al 2007 ni et al 2011 and are applicable to both porous and fracture media e g bernard et al 2006 brauchler et al 2013 wang et al 2017 zha et al 2014 the scale of pressure tests mainly depends on the pumping or injection rate and duration productivity or injectivity of the test well transmissivity and compressibility of the aquifer the hydraulic boundaries as well as the accuracy of the measuring equipment if wells are available with good hydraulic connection to the aquifer monitoring pressure fluctuations using modern sample devices e g gunning et al 2020 can be accurate and inexpensive with the presence of the gas phase the flow properties vary with the volume and occurrence of the gas and these variations directly affect the pressure response when conducting hydraulic tests in a time lapse manner hu et al 2015 feasibility of applying time lapse hydraulic or pressure tests to detect and monitor gas phases was mainly studied previously in large and deep reservoirs e g birkholzer et al 2015 jung et al 2013 jackson et al 2021 however so far no study has been reported in the literature which investigates this monitoring option for near surface aquifer conditions the detection and monitoring of a gas phase in a near surface aquifer by time lapse hydraulic tests seems feasible especially because a higher number of wells and thus positions for both sender and receiver are possible and typically more information on the geologic and hydrogeologic setting are available compared to deeper settings of a few tens to hundreds of meters this study therefore investigates the feasibility of time lapse pumping tests for gas phase detection in near surface aquifers based on standard hydrogeological methods for this study we conducted a series of interference pumping tests in a shallow aquifer before and after an injection of a gas phase in order to explore its potential as a new monitoring method the key issue addressed here is the detectability of any changes of the flow properties in the shallow aquifer due to the occurrence of a gas phase and whether these changes can be inferred from pumping tests by using conventional analytical fitting methods cross well multilevel configurations were used to characterize the baseline hydraulic properties of the aquifer prior to gas injection and for repeated surveys after the injection of methane and hydrogen hydraulic parameters were estimated before and after the gas injections using standard analytical solutions the results were compared systematically in order to investigate the repeatability and reproducibility of this method and to identify the gas phase induced changes of the hydraulic parameters 2 field site field test sites offer a unique opportunity to collect data and test both characterization and monitoring methods on a scale relevant to later applications the testum field site https www testum aquifer de was established to investigate processes induced by heat or gas storage as well as their subsequent environmental impacts the testum site is located near the town of wittstock in north eastern germany fig 1 a and is jointly operated by kiel university and the helmholz centre for environmental research ufz it contains sub sites used to study the effects of injections of heat using high temperature water at about 80 c heldt et al 2021a 2021b and the gases methane and hydrogen as well as induced geochemical lüders et al 2021 and biological keller et al 2021 processes the field site has previously been used to study carbon dioxide in a near surface aquifer peter et al 2012 and is currently being used for methane and hydrogen injection experiments fig 1a the field work for this paper was performed at the methane and hydrogen subsites within the testum aquifer project the regional geological conditions consist of glaciofluvial deposits formed from the saale and vistula glacial stages electrical resistivity tomography ert surveys were carried out from 2010 to 2011 to obtain the primary stratigraphic information from the near subsurface complemented by electrical conductivity ec and hydraulic profiling tool hpt logs collected using the direct push technique dietrich and leven 2006 mccall and christy 2020 these yielded indications of spatial distribution of permeability as well as the presence of aquifers and confining units using this information an aquifer with a confining unit above and an aquiclude below could be identified starting at a depth of approximately 10 m below surface with aquifer thickness of about 8 5 m at w3 and about 9 0 m at w4 the aquifer material consists of saalian sand coarse to fine and gravel medium and fine with a small portion of silt two inch observation wells for groundwater monitoring and pressure observations were installed each with three screens of one meter length located at 12 13 m 14 15 m and 16 17 m depth at the methane site and at 11 12 m 14 15 m and 17 18 m depth at the hydrogen site depending on the local lithography the top and middle screens of w4 2z u05 and w4 2z u07 in the hydrogen subsite see fig 1c were located 1 and 2 m deeper than the other wells respectively table b1 three continuous multichannel tubing system cmt wells were installed and used for gas injection at each subsite einarson and cherry 2002 each well features an open section of 20 cm length at 17 m and 18 m depth respectively the location of the cmt injection wells is marked in red in fig 1b and 1c measured groundwater levels in the boreholes are about 3 m below the land surface indicating confined groundwater conditions the flow direction of the regional groundwater is generally from the northeast to the southwest towards the river dosse which is about 800 m west of the site from previous investigations heldt et al 2021a lamert et al 2012 löffler et al 2022 the hydraulic gradient and estimated groundwater flow velocity vary from 0 001 to 0 005 and 0 07 m d to 0 3 m d over the entire test site respectively 3 time lapse pumping tests in order to determine the change in hydraulic properties due to the injection of the methane gas or hydrogen gas cross well multilevel pumping tests were conducted before and after gas injection from the measurements prior to gas injection regarded here as a baseline measurement the hydraulic properties of the aquifer can be determined each pumping test was performed in a section of a two inch well at the same time pumping induced pressure changes were monitored at up to three other two inch wells using pressure sensors in up to three sections each fig 1c and 1d illustrate the detailed test configurations used at the individual subsites the pumping section was isolated from the other two sections using two connected packers between which a submersible pump grundfos mp1 or whale electric galley pump gp1352 was placed together with a pressure sensor solinst levellogger edge m30 to record the pressure changes in the pumping section see fig 1e all three screens of a well were pumped consecutively and the packers were moved within the well vertically to the pumped section in the observation wells a double packer system was also employed to hydraulically isolate the three screen sections with three pressure sensors solinst levellogger edge m20 placed at each screen to record the pressure responses individually this packer system did not change position during the tests a barometric pressure sensor solinst barologger edge m5 was used to record atmospheric pressure at the site and to correct the measured water pressure data using this configuration the pressure response induced by pumping at one screen could be recorded at up to 10 locations as drawdown curves baseline pumping tests at the two gas sites were conducted from 24 october 2018 to 3 november 2018 at the methane site w3 and 10 december 2019 to 12 december 2019 at the hydrogen site w4 according to the measurements from the monitoring wells the pressure increase caused by the gas injection recovered soon i e within hours after the end of the injection this implies that the gas phase was spreading rapidly during the injection and for a few hours to days after injection ends with the gas then being residually trapped and stable a residually trapped gas phase cannot be mobilized by moving the adjacent water furthermore pumping rates used were on the order of 4 l min which corresponds to a total water extraction of about 120 l and a water movement of about 6 mm in a distance of 1 m to the pumping well therefore for this work it is assumed that the gas phase is immobile this small pumping rate is also intended to minimize the volume of pumped water and the movement of the gas plume as well as the impacts on concentrations of chemical substances each pumping test lasted for approximately 50 min at w3 and 10 30 min at w4 followed by a pressure recovery back to the initial status repeated baseline pumping tests were conducted for some wells at the hydrogen site in november 2019 and january 2020 fig 1d dashed lines in order to evaluate the repeatability of the pumping tests based on the measured groundwater level at approximately 66 m asl and the location of the well screens see table b1 and fig 1d as well as the location of the test aquifer figs a1 and a2 the pumping tests were conducted under confined conditions also as found from the other field work performed at this site the confining unit seems to extend horizontally as it was also identified at the other sub test sites in peter et al 2012 or heldt et al 2021a a total of 34 kg of methane and 12 kg of hydrogen were injected at the bottom of the aquifer through cmt wells starting on 14 may 2019 and 28 january 2020 respectively because hydrogen gas has a lower density and a higher mobility under near surface conditions as compared to methane a smaller mass of hydrogen is required to achieve a gas impacted volume similar to that of methane both gas injections lasted less than three days with varying injection rates to enhance the spatial distribution of the gas phase following the gas injection process the cross well multilevel pumping tests were repeated seven days afterwards at both sites using the same configuration as for the baseline measurements post injection 1 at the methane site a second set of pumping tests was conducted 56 days after the injection post injection 2 all tests were conducted using similar durations and pumping rates as part of the chemical sampling campaigns to minimize effects on the in situ gas phase distribution or disturbance of the geochemical signals at the methane site the bottom screens of a number of the two inch wells could not be used for pumping as they were clogged by sand a likely reason for this is that the filter gauze used during the well construction was too coarse to prevent the inflow of local fine grained sediments in some of the bottom screens less clogging occurred at post injection 2 probably due to sediment removal during the geochemical sampling activities as the local hydrogeologic setting represents confined groundwater with partially penetrating well screens the analytical solution by dougherty babu dougherty and babu 1984 was used to estimate the hydraulic parameters of the aquifer assuming homogeneous and isotropic conditions since this work focuses on aquifer properties only the late time drawdown data from the observation wells are fitted well skin and well storage effects in the pumping well are thus not considered because they do not correlate with the late response to pumping at an observation well fitting was performed using aqtesolv pro 4 5 duffield 2007 to estimate hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage ss for each pumping observation well section pair separately detailed information on aquifer and well parameters and the positions of the well screens used are listed in tables a1 and b1 4 results 4 1 comparison of the scaled drawdown curves on the basis of the pumping configurations presented in fig 1b and 1d a total of 109 drawdown curves were obtained prior to the methane injection experiments including 12 from the test wells and 97 from the observation wells pressure data obtained at the pumping wells showed well skin effects and thus could not be quantitatively used in the further analysis furthermore another 10 pressure curves had to be excluded due to experimental failures which were caused by leaking packers or data shifting due to vertical movements of the data loggers detailed explanations are provided in the supplementary material s2 and s3 thus a total of 87 baseline as well as 49 post injection 1 and 66 post injection 2 drawdown curves respectively are available for evaluation for better comparison all measured drawdown data were linearly scaled e g chen et al 2019 le coz et al 2017 to a constant pumping rate of 5 l min figs s2 and s3 which is possible because drawdown depends linearly on the pumping rate as a representative example fig 2 depicts the scaled drawdown curves from observation well w3 2z u12 while w3 2z u07 was used as a pumping well the drawdown observed at the top section of the observation well after the gas injection is significantly larger than in the baseline data for all three pumping depths indicating a decrease of the hydraulic conductivity k for these pairs of pumping well and observation well sections referred to in this work as an array furthermore the time lapse drawdown curves for some arrays show a delay to the pressure response of the post injection pressure curve relative to the baseline curve for example for the top section of the pumping well to the bottom section of the observation well indicating an increase of the storage coefficient the remaining post injection drawdowns exhibit a similar behaviour as the baseline drawdown indicating only very small alterations of the hydraulic properties due to the presence of a small amount of gas phase or measurement errors in these arrays for example for the bottom section pumping well to the bottom section of the observation well at the hydrogen site for the first baseline test before the gas injection baseline 1 100 drawdown curves were measured at the observation wells from the repeated baseline tests baseline 2 at wells w4 2z d01 d10 and d18 42 drawdown curves were obtained in total while 99 drawdown curves were obtained seven days after the hydrogen injection post injection all available drawdown measurements were scaled as described for the methane site and are plotted in fig s2 after filtering for sensor shifts and packer failures in fig 3 time lapse drawdown curves measured at observation well w4 2z d06 while pumping at well w4 2z d18 at the hydrogen injection site are shown due to the greater distance between the well pair drawdown is only about 1 cm and thus a lower signal to noise ratio is achieved than at the methane site most of the drawdowns from the two baseline tests show very similar behaviour concerning drawdown magnitude and time indicating a good reproducibility quantified later on measured post injection drawdowns generally show a time delay for the pressure signal but no clear change in drawdown amplitude as for the methane site changes are more pronounced in the upper part of the aquifer 4 2 repeatability of the baseline pumping tests before gas injection before drawdown curve fitting to derive k and ss for each pumping observation array high frequency fluctuations see fig c1 for an illustrative example were filtered out of the data from the hydrogen site using wavelet denoising e g yang et al 2020 fig 4 a shows the obtained k values for baseline 2 versus the values from baseline 1 i e before the gas injection a clear correlation of the values is obtained showing a good repeatability of the test with larger errors for larger hydraulic conductivities this indicates that the errors are linearly distributed and two linear functions can be derived to delimit the error region because k values are linearly related to the late time drawdowns the slope of the linear functions was determined by using the maximum variation of k a good correlation between the two baseline measurements is also found for ss the error seems to increase linearly only at lower values of ss with smaller relative errors for a larger ss the smaller ss values are more sensitive to the early drawdown data and are thus more strongly affected by well effects and measurement errors the error region in this case is therefore delimited by two linear functions and their inverse functions as shown in fig 4b these error regions will be used to identify the relevant changes of k and ss due to gas injection and are shown again in fig 7 in the case where the fitted k or ss values from the post injection fall within the error region any variation in k or ss is considered to be a measurement error and is not clearly caused by the presence of the gas phase fig 4 also shows that the error region for k is much narrower than for s s indicating a better reproducibility the reason for this is that ss is mainly determined by the early time drawdown data which can be more susceptible to wellbore storage measurement errors or experimental procedures such as unstable pumping rates or inertia effects while k is more closely related to the late time drawdown data usually recorded after a steady state discharge rate has been established 4 3 changes in hydraulic conductivity and specific storage due to gas injection k and ss were obtained by analytical fitting of the drawdown data for both investigated sites for the baseline as well as the post injection measurements for a better overview of the results the distribution of the k and ss values is illustrated in fig 5 using violin plots a violin plot is a combination of a box plot and a kernel density estimation depicting the statistical distribution of the samples as well as the mean and quartile values hintze and nelson 1998 the kernel density is obtained by the sum of the estimated probability density functions pdf at each sampling point it is a nonparametric method for obtaining smooth and continuous data distributions based on finite data samples even if only sparse samples are available hintze and nelson 1998 a normal distribution was assumed to define the shape of the individual pdfs the density trace was calculated using the kernel density function of matlab bechtold 2016 additionally the median arithmetic mean and standard deviation of all data sets were calculated and summarized in the appendix in tables d1 and d2 fig 5a shows the violin plots of the k values estimated from the time lapse drawdown data the mean k values from the baseline measurements for the methane and hydrogen sites are 3 5 10 4 m s and 7 9 10 4 m s respectively showing that the hydrogen site is on average more hydraulically permeable as can be seen from the larger spread of the fitted values the hydrogen site exhibits a higher degree of heterogeneity than the methane site as the spread of hydraulic conductivity values is lower in general after the gas injections the fitted k values for the two sites are smaller than the baseline value at the methane site mean k for post injection 1 and 2 decreases by a factor of 0 59 and 0 60 relative to the baseline i e to about 60 of the baseline value for the arrays indicating the presence of methane only minor changes can be discerned between post injection 1 and post injection 2 indicating that movement of the gas phase was mostly completed at the time of the post injection 1 measurement moreover the k values show an approximately normal distribution for the baseline and post injection 1 values while the distribution for post injection 2 is skewed towards larger values comparison between the density trace of the two post injections also shows that a slight increase in median k is found for post injection 2 as well as a decrease of the lowest identified k values a possible reason for this is that the amount of gas phase trapped in the monitoring network slightly decreases with time while at the same time redistributing and accumulating at the aquifer top therefore some smaller values were found in the post injection 2 i e the tail part in the trace likewise for the hydrogen site the mean k value from the post injection decreases by a factor of 0 612 as the sample size and the noise level of drawdowns from the two campaigns are comparable the different shape of the traces and the reduced spread of the post injection k values reflects the spatially non uniform gas saturations fig 5b shows the violin plots of the ss values the mean ss values estimated from the baseline for the methane and hydrogen sites are 3 41 10 5 1 m and 9 40 10 5 1 m respectively with a large spread over several orders of magnitude for both sites these values are representative for unconsolidated sediments under near surface conditions e g freeze and cherry 1979 hu 2011 zhao and illman 2018 the larger values found in the hydrogen site may be due to the difference in particle size distribution and material compressibility between the test and observation wells specifically several very small ss values were derived from the baseline at the methane site which are considered to be due to the low storativity at certain arrays e g pumping at w3 2z u03 with observations at w3 2z d12 and u12 rather than measurement outliers after the methane injection mean ss increases by a factor of 2 93 and 2 42 for the post injection measurements relative to the baseline the spread of the ss values becomes significantly smaller than for the baseline this can be mainly due to the smaller sample number from the post injections the distribution of ss at post injection 1 shows a more obvious skew towards the larger values than post injection 2 indicating the gas phase decreased between the two post injections however unlike k the maximum values of ss from the two post injections are quite similar information about the redistribution of the gas phase might be concealed by the measurement error at the hydrogen site the time lapse measurements yield a similar result as for the methane site showing an increase in mean ss by factors of 2 8 all these findings at the two sites are in accordance with the generally expected effect which is that fitted hydraulic conductivity should decrease due to the presence of an injected gas phase while the fitted storage coefficient should increase the gas phase can partially occupy the pore space and reduce the flow paths for the water phase hence the relative permeability of the water phase decreases leading to a smaller hydraulic conductivity on the other hand both methane and hydrogen have a relatively large compressibility in the near subsurface which can significantly increase the storativity of the entire flow system fig 6 depicts the post injection k and ss values for the pumping observation arrays versus the baseline values also shown are the error regions as derived from the repeating baseline tests values within the error regions cannot be clearly attributed to the gas injection as they might also stem from experimental errors and are thus printed in lighter colours as a result 42 and 95 pairs of k and ss values at the methane and hydrogen sites respectively show significant changes outside the error region and can thus be attributed to the gas phase injection this demonstrates that the local hydraulic properties in the aquifer volume between the pumping and the observation well have changed significantly due to the presence of the injected gas phase for the methane site gas phase induced changes in k and ss were more pronounced than at the hydrogen site with nearly all fitted k values showing a significant change due to the gas phase for both post injection 1 and 2 furthermore changes are most pronounced near the three north eastern wells w3 2z u03 u07 and u12 indicating that a significant part of the gas phase has moved there for the hydrogen site the same principal findings can be derived both imply that the gas phase moved preferentially to the regions of high kpre and low ss pre these regions cannot be directly correlated to the geological information obtained from borehole measurements or cores as these indicate homogeneous conditions throughout the area covered by the gas injection and pumping tests however due to the higher level of noise in the data a larger fraction of the fitted k values is inside the error region as compared with the methane site the ss values are consistent with k values indicating that the strongest changes occurred near w4 2z d01 and d18 towards the west for both sites fitted k yields more values outside the error region which can be clearly attributed to the injected gas phase due to its better repeatability identified in the baseline measurements some of the ss values inside but close to the boundaries of the error region may also be caused by the injected gas phases but may be obscured by the noise as shown in fig 6 clear changes due to gas phase injection of k and ss were identified from the data even when accounting for the measurement errors as determined from the repeated baseline tests this finding indicates that the movement of water was generally restricted and bulk compressibility increased due to the presence of a gas phase as the injected gas phase is the common reason for these changes in k and ss so the effects might be correlated this is investigated in fig 7 which displays d s s s s p o s t s s p r e versus dk k post k pre for the two sites for the values both inside and outside the error regions the black dots indicate the significant changes due to the gas phase while the grey dots represent changes considered to be caused by measurement errors for the methane site the maximum decrease and maximum increase in dk and dss are 0 4 and 659 respectively when considering only the significant changes for the hydrogen site these values are 0 14 and 430 respectively this shows that k is reduced more strongly at the hydrogen site while the ss increases more at the methane site a possible explanation for this could be that the correlation between the dk and dss for these two gases is different as they have different fluid properties such as density viscosity or compressibility a comparison of hydrogen and methane gas density viscosity and compressibility at pressure and temperature conditions at the field site shows that compressibility and viscosity have similar values but that density differs by a factor of about 8 thus hydrogen gas will be more mobile in the aquifer showing a stronger buoyant rise within the aquifer as well as penetrating into smaller pores than methane both effects may contribute to the different size of changes for hydrogen and methane identified in fig 7 overall a general trend between dk and dss can be found with larger changes of dk being accompanied by larger changes in dss however no clear correlation of dk and dss can be derived from fig 7 as the reasons for the individual changes seem to depend on local hydrological factors and the small scale distribution of the gas phase as well for all three campaigns the variation of ss was much larger than the variation of k the pumping observation well arrays which exhibit significant changes in fitted k and ss can be used to infer information on the gas phase distribution in the aquifer in fig 8 dimensional plots of all tested arrays are shown while arrays with significant changes of dk and dss are shown using bold lines the dimensional plots of the methane site fig 8a and 8b indicate that the methane gas phase is mainly present in the north western part of the monitoring network as already found from fig 6 towards the east even close distances to the eastern injection well no significant changes were detected changes over the full aquifer thickness occur only at some measurement arrays due to sanding in some of the lowest screen sections the post injection pumping tests could not be repeated at all bottom screens however from the measurements obtained it is clear that the methane gas phase was present in larger quantities at the lower and the western parts of the aquifer in post injection 1 than for post injection 2 between post injection 1 and post injection 2 therefore the volume of the methane gas phase seems to have reduced in the lower and in the eastern part probably due to an upward migration and a lateral movement in a westward direction in addition the reduced gas phase distribution may also be caused by dissolution of gas in the groundwater fig 8c shows the equivalent figure for the hydrogen site indicating that the injected hydrogen gas mainly migrated towards the south western part of the monitoring network as significant changes in dk and dss are only found there while the north eastern part near well w4 2z u05 shows no indication of a gas phase as significant changes are identified in all depth levels the hydrogen gas seems to be distributed over the total aquifer thickness this spatial distribution is likely due to the low density and high mobility of hydrogen compared to water 5 discussion this work is to the authors best knowledge the first test of applying cross well multilevel pumping tests at a real field site for detecting hydraulic changes induced by methane and hydrogen gas injection experiments a three dimensional cross well multilevel configuration was designed using a set of partially screened wells in combination with packer systems as analogues of many time lapse methods the repeatability of the pumping tests was explored by repeating baseline pumping tests prior to gas injection the k and ss values for each individual drawdown curve were estimated by an analytical solution that adequately represented the experimental set up and aquifer conditions the fitting results indicate that k has a better reproducibility than ss as values fitted to the repeated baseline tests are very similar and show a narrower error region than values for ss this is consistent with the findings from a study on the reproducibility of low flow rate pumping tests by robbins et al 2009 the higher the reproducibility the more clearly that the variations in k and ss caused by the introduction of a gas phase can be distinguished from data noise experience from depth integrated pumping tests at the same field site supplementary material s4 indicates that a higher reproducibility could be obtained when using larger and temporally highly stable pumping rates of about 20 l min a higher temporal resolution of the measured drawdown data would also improve the parameter estimation as also found by naderi and gupta 2020 drawdown measured during the post injection pumping tests can show a significant time shift as well as change of drawdown for some tomographic arrays thus indicating changes to the flow regime between the sender and receiver sections of the pumping test the post injection hydraulic conductivity shows a clear overall decrease due to the injected gas phase given the high reproducibility of k found in the baseline measurements however the baseline specific storage values present a higher variability as they are more sensitive to the heterogeneity between the test and observation wells as well as the measurement errors this is consistent with the findings of wu et al 2005 for example as the determination of k is sensitive to a larger aquifer volume than ss which can be strongly influenced by the hydraulic heterogeneity between the test and observation wells due to the large compressibility of methane and hydrogen as compared with water a strong increase in the specific storage can be observed therefore although the error range detected in the repeated baseline tests is rather large clear changes and trends can still be identified from the post injection pumping tests correlation between the changes of k and ss varies for the different gases as it depends not only on the gas saturation but also on the density viscosity compressibility and mobility of the individual gases the potential distribution of the gas phase as indicated by this method can be compared and verified with the field data such as on the concentration plume of the dissolved gas or the saturation measurements at certain locations although these require a large number of monitoring points spatially integrated methods such as cross hole seismic surveys or tomography may therefore be more suitable as they have a similar investigation scale as the cross well pumping tests applied here the method as presented uses a dense array of pumping and observation well sections which leads to a large number of pumping tests and observation data e g hu et al 2011 depending on the investigation scale required and the number and location of wells available the three dimensional configuration could be reduced to a two dimensional set up especially in cases where the aquifer thickness is smaller than the diameter of the investigated area this two dimensional approach would vastly reduce the field work required e g zha et al 2015 if the aim is the detection of changes only a possible reduced set up might also consist of a vertical cross section with at least two multilevel wells another option for reducing the monitoring efforts for gas phase occurrence would be to test only parts of the arrays for any individual time lapse and conduct the full survey only if these exemplary measurements indicate significant changes time lapse pumping tests pt can thus be used for spatial and temporal monitoring of gas phases due for example to leakages from the deeper subsurface or gas pipelines as only standard hydrogeological methods are required for the field investigations as well as evaluation based on the analytical solution outlined it is easy to use applicable with low conceptual hurdles and does not require major investment in expensive field equipment this time lapse pt method may thus provide a preliminary screening tool aimed at detection of the gas phase occurrence in near surface aquifers the downside is that this approach does not provide for a detailed spatial distribution of the gas phase as the cause for the changes in observed k and ss cannot be localized accurately however changes induced by the gas phase can still be approximately located when constructing the tomographic arrays therefore by using the time lapse pt those changes can be detected and roughly located and may thus be used to guide further investigations for example by indicating areas to be investigated using direct methods for the presence of a gas phase a direct observation of a gas phase using techniques such as soil gas measurements or direct push probes e g a membrane interface probe would thus be supported which might be required anyway due to regulations a better localization of the gas phase in the subsurface from time lapse pt data would require the use of appropriate inversion algorithms as well as the derivation of material models to unambiguously connect the changes in k and ss to a local gas saturation 6 conclusions this work investigates the changes induced by the occurrence of a gas phase in a near surface aquifer using standard hydrogeological methods for the field tests methane as well as hydrogen gas were injected into a near surface confined aquifer prior to as well as about one week after the injection a set of multi level multi well pumping tests were conducted using pumping and observation locations outside the gas affected area the recorded measurements were evaluated using standard pumping test evaluation methods it is found that the occurrence of the gas phases can be identified from these measurements as both the hydraulic conductivity as well as the storage coefficient derived from these pumping tests change significantly due to the presence of the gas phase it is also found that the occurrence of a methane or hydrogen gas phase in a shallow aquifer decreases the hydraulic conductivity and increase the specific storage as determined by the pumping tests both changes are in line with qualitative considerations of the multiphase flow behaviour the injected gas is more compressible than the groundwater which increases the specific storage but takes up pore space which limits the movement of groundwater and thus reduces the hydraulic conductivity with larger changes corresponding to larger gas saturations the changes are significant and found to be much larger than the measurement errors hydraulic conductivity is found to show a higher reproducibility than specific storage which is partly compensated by the higher changes of specific storage due to the high compressibility of the gas phase repeating pumping tests in shallow aquifers thus provides a potential monitoring method to identify changes in the spatial distribution of a gas phase as well as to detect the new occurrence of a gas phase such as by leakage from a nearby storage facility the drawdowns measured in the repeated pumping tests can be evaluated using conventional analytical fitting methods in order to estimate the changes in hydraulic conductivity and storage coefficient therefore this monitoring method is easy to use as standard field and evaluation methods are usually available at institutes or companies working in hydrogeology the decrease in hydraulic conductivity and the increase in specific storage could provide a rough indication of the gas phase distribution if the entire gas phase is covered with pumping observation well arrays at a sufficient number of locations this would allow not only to detect but also to estimate the volume of a gas leakage into a shallow aquifer in practise the spatial scales of the investigation are expected to be larger than in this work which can be addressed by using larger pumping rates and longer pumping times to induce sufficiently large drawdowns credit authorship contribution statement linwei hu conceptualization methodology software formal analysis writing original draft data

in which 1 hr artificial rainfall with varying intensities 30 mm hr 1 to 100 mm hr 1 were conducted the result showed that runoff volume peak flow discharge rate and overland flow velocity were not remarkably different between the panel slope and the control slope although the soil surface under the pv panel was rougher than the surface of the control slope however the slope with the pv panel produced 27 63 less sediment flux at the outlet than the control slope especially under heavy rainfall this was attributed to the weakened splash erosion on the slope section under the pv panel due to the rainfall interception by the panel which indicated that the key impact of the pv panel was preventing soil detachment by raindrop impacts the pv panel delayed runoff start time under rainfall with heavy rainfall intensities 80 and 100 mm hr 1 due to the overland flow attenuation of the depression beneath the lower edge of the pv panel these findings implied that pv panels on hillslopes may have the potential to retain soil organic matter in top soil layers and to improve soil structure e g soil sealing control and soil aggregate protection which may benefit to hillslope soil conservation and

hillslope hydrology including rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes is a major concern in many areas such as soil and water conservation flood forecasting and agricultural sustainability development jia et al 2013 li and pan 2018 morbidelli et al 2018 land use plays an important role in hillslope hydrological processes birch et al 2021 gao et al 2018b recently there is a new type of land use the photovoltaic pv power plants hernandez et al 2015 which may largely affect the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes but has not been fully understood in hillslope hydrology shobe 2022 among renewable energy recourses the facility of solar energy usually possesses long lifespan and low life circle carbon emission and it has a great potential to meet the future energy demand and to mitigate the anthropogenic impact on climate change creutzig et al 2017 martinopoulos and tsalikis 2018 in recent years solar pv technologies which convert light directly to electricity have been one of the fastest growing energy technologies because of technological advancements and policy supports dinesh and pearce 2016 hu et al 2016 tawalbeh et al 2021 the global cumulative solar pv capacity reached 602 gw in 2019 which had doubled in three years iea 2021 in china the pv markets are expending very fast and the cumulative installed pv capacity had a triple growth from 77 4 gw in 2016 to 205 2 gw in 2019 iea 2021 and will reach 600 gw before 2030 wang et al 2021b some researchers estimate that around 250000 km2 of land will be transformed in the next 30 years if all pv panel arrays are ground mounted under an optimistic scenario for global solar energy deployment by 2050 8500 gw choi et al 2020 particularly the pv power plants in the chinese loess plateau are growing fast since 2013 for instance the total area of the pv power plants in ningxia province which mostly located in the loess plateau was estimated at 134 6 km2 by the year of 2019 nearly tripled compared to 2013 from remote sensing data xia et al 2022 most of these power plants are over 10 km2 and located in sparse grasslands and aridlands kruitwagen et al 2021 xia et al 2022 however pv power plants require large areas due to the low density of solar energy wang et al 2021a hillslope areas contain a large portion of land which is suitable for large scale pv installations fig 1 kim and park 2021 yang et al 2019 and there is a wide range of acceptable slopes for pv power plant installation from 5 to 11 3 anwarzai and nagasaka 2017 charabi and gastli 2011 irena 2013 yushchenko et al 2018 furthermore yang et al 2019 estimated the large scale pv power generation potential in china using a gis based model and indicated that the large scale pv power plants should be planned in areas with slope lower than 20 due to the structure of pv arrays solar radiation and rainfall can be intercepted to a great extent by pv panels elamri et al 2018 yue et al 2021 many studies focused on the solar radiation reduction of pv panels which has direct impacts on evaporation wind speed air temperature and soil temperature armstrong et al 2016 barron gafford et al 2019 lambert et al 2021 liu et al 2019 on the other hand rainfall interception due to pv panels which can be vital to rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes in hillslopes is not comprehensively investigated by now the raindrops intercepted by pv panels during rainfall will concentrate along the lower edges of pv panels and fall onto ground surface causing heterogeneous spatial distribution of rainfall barron gafford et al 2019 jahanfar et al 2019 some researches indicated that runoff in slopes or hillslopes can be increased by pv panels jahanfar et al 2019 conducted a long term study comparing the discharge between the green roofs with or without pv panels and the results indicated that the pv panels increased the cumulative discharge about 30 and the peak discharge over 50 in rainfall events pisinaras et al 2014 quantified the hydrological budget constituents of pv power plants using swat model they found that annual surface runoff was increased at the catchment scale as the land use changed from agriculture to pv power plants however from another perspective the interception of raindrops by the pv panels could dramatically reduce the areas where rain splash erosion occurs elamri et al 2018 the reduction of splash erosion may not only decrease hillslope soil erosion darvishan et al 2014 but also reduce soil surface sealing which may lead to higher surface hydraulic conductivity infiltration and less runoff armenise et al 2018 assouline 2004 besides cook and mccuen 2013 adapted numerical models to analyze runoff from solar panel sites under pre and post development conditions they found that the pv panels did not have a significant effect on runoff volumes peak discharges or time to peak discharge the influence of pv panels on hillslope runoff is complicated and unclear as some researchers think pv panels increase hillslope runoff while others believe pv panels have negative or negligible effect on hillslope runoff also it can be inferred that the impact of pv panels on hillslope soil erosion process which may cause large environmental and economic consequences such as soil loss and land degradation alewell et al 2019 prosdocimi et al 2016 is complicated because it is susceptible to hillslope runoff process generally there is a lack of comprehensive researches focusing on the mechanisms of pv panel impacts on hydrological and sediment processes especially on hillslope soil erosion process which have not been studied yet to the authors knowledge by field experiments as pv power plants have been widely installed in hillslopes in arid and semi arid regions there is a concern that hillslope erosion might be enhanced due to the rainfall redistribution of pv panels rainfall simulation is extensively used as a research tool in studies on overland flow and soil erosion e g di prima et al 2018 shi et al 2012 as well as studies on their responses to the changes of land use and soil property e g fang et al 2015 keesstra et al 2019 by

plot scale rainfall simulation experiments allow the accurate measurements of overland flow rate soil sediment flux microtopography change etc which usually help to find principal mechanisms in rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes e g runoff generation dynamics of erosion and deposition han et al 2021 martínez murillo et al 2013 ran et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 with the fast growth of pv power industry the knowledge of the hydrological effects of pv panels in hillslopes is essential for the plans of pv power plant construction especially in arid and semi arid regions in this study rainfall simulation experiments on slopes were conducted to investigate how a pv panel impacts rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes in a slope which may provide guidance for siting pv plants and evaluating the hydrological effects of pv power plants 2 methodology 2 1 slope experiment set up this experimental study was conducted at a study plot located near the hancheng city shannxi china 35 31 n 110 39 e and the plot had a natural land surface which had very sparse grass on it two 4 m 1 m slopes i e a test slope with a pv panel coving the middle of the slope and a control slope with no covering in the plot were set up and the two slopes were divided by 0 7 m high plastic plates fig 2 the plastic plates which were to delimit the experimental slopes were vertically and carefully inserted into the soil with minimized disturbance to the soil the slope gradient of the experiment slopes is about 8 7 which is within the range of normal slope for pv power plants anwarzai and nagasaka 2017 irena 2013 yushchenko et al 2018 the soil of the experimental plot was silt loam with 14 clay 67 silt and 19 sand and the porosity and bulk density of the soil were 0 48 and 1 24 g cm 3 respectively the sparse grass cover of the two slopes was carefully pulled out and removed one week before the rainfall experiment in order to minimize the ground surface difference between the test slope and control slope the study plot was surrounded by 0 2 m high plastic plates to prevent possible water loss due to splashing out two runoff collectors were set at the outlets of the test and control slopes which directed overland flow into containers for measurement a downslope facing pv panel was placed in the middle of the test slope fig 2c it has a size of 1650 mm length 950 mm width 40 mm thickness which is commonly adopted in pv power plants the fixed mounting pv system was chosen and the lower edge of the pv panel was 0 5 m above the ground with the panel having a 30 angle with the ground surface these setups of the pv panel were according to typical pv power plants in the north of china please note that these pv panel settings are not representative of many modern pv arrays which tilt dynamically to track the sun the rainfall simulator consisted of a water tank a pressure regulating pump two spray nozzles a flow meter a steel bracket and pipelines fig 2b the spray nozzles that generated raindrops in experiment were 1 4 hh fulljet model from spraying systems co which had a spray angle of 60 the nozzles of the fulljet model have been applied for rainfall simulation in many experimental studies e g abrantes et al 2018 loiola et al 2019 and it well simulated natural rainfall in these studies the position and direction of the spray nozzles are shown in fig 2b the height of the nozzle was 3 5 m above the slope allowing the water drops to reach their settling velocity before hitting the panel and ground the mean size of the simulated raindrops was 1 7 mm diameter having a range of 0 5 3 5 mm which was measured in rainfall experiment with the filter paper method best 1950 this indicated that the simulated rainfall was similar to the natural one in mean raindrop size best 1950 the rainfall intensity was precisely controlled by the pressure regulating pump and the rainfall intensity and spatial uniformity was calibrated and tested before the experiment after using a large plastic sheet to cover the two slopes the rainfall intensity was determined with 10 rain gauges each with 15 cm inner diameter and 20 cm height which were distributed uniformly above the two slopes the rainfall spatial uniformity is calculated using the coefficient of uniformity cuc defined by christiansen 1941 1 cuc 1 1 n x i x n x in which x i is the rainfall amount in each rain gauge x is the average amount of rainfall and n is the total number of the rain gauges placed over the plot to collect rainfall after the test the simulated rainfall had the cucs higher than 0 8 for all the rainfall intensities used in the experiment indicating that the simulated rainfall can be considered spatially uniform aksoy et al 2012 2 2 experiment design in this study four rainfall scenarios were considered in the rainfall experiment which fell into two rainfall intensity ranges table 1 according to the rainfall frequencies in the south of the chinese loess plateau ran et al 2020 the scenarios with 30 mm hr 1 and 50 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities represented moderate rainfall and the scenarios with 80 mm hr 1 and 100 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities represented typical storms table 1 under all these rainfall intensities infiltration excess overland flow dominated during the rainfall experiments the rainfall duration of each scenario run is 1 h there was an around 10 day interval between each two successive rainfall scenarios achieving similar initial soil water content from 25 to 27 in the 0 5 cm top soil layer before each rainfall simulation run the daily rainfall and air temperature of the study site was shown in fig 3 four days before the first experiment a rainfall run with 20 mm hr 1 intensity and 10 min duration were conducted on the study plot the reasons of this pretreatment rainfall were firstly make the surface soil reach a high moisture level which is close to that during rainy season at the loess plateau as most rainfall and soil erosion occurs in rainy season in this semi arid region secondly as the soil surface was a little bit disturbed due to the removal of the very sparse grass the water penetration during the short and light artificial rainfall can help smooth the soil surface and diminish the small impact of the grass removal in this study no extra replication of each rainfall scenario was conducted this was because this experimental study was conducted in a field study site with natural land surface the microtopography of the slopes was changed after each rainfall experiment due to soil erosion e g the development of rill and gully which may considerably influence surface flow process due to these alterations replication under identical rainfall intensity is not possible because there is no way to restore the pre existing surface microtopography at the same time the runoff and soil erosion differences between the pv panel slope and the control one was the key observable in this study hence the comparisons of the runoff and soil erosion results of the two slopes and whether these comparison results were consistent under varying rainfall intensities were important in this study in each scenario run overland flow and sediment samples were taken in every minute at the two outlets of the slopes during the first 15 min after runoff generated then the sampling interval was extended to 3 5 min as overland flow became stable the sediment samples from the collector were dried at 110 c for more than 24 hr and then weighed and recorded each slope was divided into 4 sections with equal spacing with each section measuring 1 m 1 m fig 2a the mean overland flow velocity in each section was determined by using the kmno4 dye tracer method abrahams et al 1986 zhang et al 2010 3 results 3 1 runoff in the rainfall experiments the runoff started 16 6 and 4 0 earlier in pv panel slope than that in the control slope under the 30 mm hr 1 and 50 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities respectively but the start times were delayed 88 7 and 178 8 by the pv panel under the 80 mm hr 1 and 100 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities fig 4 and table 2 respectively under different rainfall intensities the total runoff of the pv panel slope was 0 7 4 0 lower than that of the control slope table 2 the hydrographs of the two slopes were also quite close see fig 5 the differences in peak discharge rates between the two slopes were lower than 3 5 table 2 for the runs under the 30 mm hr 1 and 50 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities the runoff rate kept increasing until the rainfall stopped while for the runs under the 80 mm hr 1 and 100 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities the runoff rate quickly increased with time approaching steady state about 5 8 min after rainfall started 3 2 soil erosion contrary to the runoff results there were large differences between the soil erosion results of the two slopes the soil erosion mass and average sediment concentration of the pv panel slope were 27 63 lower than those of the control slope table 2 for instance under the 80 mm hr 1 rainfall the pv panel slope only produced 37 soil erosion mass and 38 average sediment concentration of the control slope for an individual event the soil erosion rate increased quickly in the first 10 15 min and then fluctuated in a range between 65 and 100 of the peak erosion rate fig 5 as rainfall continued the differences between the soil erosion rates of the pv panel slope and the control slope became greater for example under the 50 mm h 1 rainfall differences between the soil erosion rates of the pv panel slope and the control slope increased from 23 on average in the first 15 min to 45 on average in the last 20 min 3 3 slope micro relief and overland flow velocity the pv panel on the slope resisted a part of the raindrops and created concentrated water drops at its lower edge which had an influence on the slope micro relief a depression had been created under the lower edge of the pv panel by water drops since the first rainfall experiment run fig 6 b compared with the relative smooth soil surface of the control slope fig 6a the soil surface under the pv panel was rougher for example under the 80 mm hr 1 rainfall a big part of the ground surface under the pv panel did not have soil surface seal see the red square in fig 6b although there was obvious difference in micro relief between the two slopes the mean overland flow velocities of the two slopes only have 1 5 4 0 difference fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of pv panel on overland flow the rainfall experiment results showed that the pv panel did not have remarkable influence on runoff volume and peak discharge rate at the slope outlet although the pv panel on the slope blocked part of the raindrops during rainfall and created concentrated water drops at the lower edge of the panel previously a modelling study conducted by cook and mccuen 2013 also indicated that the installation of pv panels over a grassy field did not have considerable effect on the volume of runoff the peak discharge and the time to peak in this study the probable reasons were on one hand the interception of raindrops by the pv panel reduced the land surface area of infiltration leading to the increase of runoff on the other hand the interception of raindrops also greatly reduced the soil surface sealing under the pv panel fig 6b so that more surface water infiltrate into area under the panel compared with the control slope due to the higher hydraulic conductivity of unsealed top soil layer in consequence the combined effect of the pv panel on infiltration may result in no large difference in runoff between the two slopes this finding was inconsistent with some previous studies which indicated that the runoff volume and peak discharge rate of the pv panel hillslope may largely increase jahanfar et al 2019 the experimental plots with around 3 slope gradient used in jahanfar et al 2019 were quite permeable on green roofs in which saturation excess overland flow seemed to be the dominate runoff generation mechanism and soil sealing should be highly limited for their one year experiment the shading effect of pv panels can reduce evapotranspiration rate and largely increase the soil moisture content of the plots compared with the control plot probably resulting in increase of runoff volume and peak discharge rate thus unlike our study plot which dominated by infiltration excess overland flow changing in infiltration process did not affect runoff volume and peak too much in their study this comparison implied that different runoff generation mechanisms may lead to different impacts of pv panels on rainfall runoff process which may need further investigation using swat model pisinaras et al 2014 found that the land use change from agriculture to pv power plants can lead to increase in annual surface runoff and percolation potential which seemed to be not parallel with the result of this study this may be because that their modelling study area was over 100 km2 and the time scale was many years 5 to 90 years so their research scales were very different from those of this study which focused on plot scale rainfall runoff events under their much larger time and spatial scales the impact of land use change from agriculture to pv power plants on land surface hydrology was the decrease of annual evaporation and the increase of soil water content of their study catchment however in this plot scale study the result above indicated that there was no large impact of the pv panel on infiltration in the short time rainfall experiments in which the evaporation difference of the two slopes can be ignored under the moderate rainfall with the 30 mm hr 1 or 50 mm hr 1 intensity the runoff start time of the pv panel slope was shorter than the control one because the pv panel quickly concentrated rain water at downslope area the runoff started faster on the pv panel slope while the runoff generated slowly on the control slope due to the moderate rainfall intensity on the contrary under heavy rainfall with 80 mm hr 1 or 100 mm hr 1 intensity the runoff start time of the pv panel slope was later than the control slope the rain water quickly filled the depressions and converged into overland flow on the control slope however in the pv panel slope the small depression beneath the lower edge of the panel partly intercepted rain water at the beginning of rainfall so it took longer to generate overland flow at the outlet than the control slope in general the mean overland flow velocity was not affected by the pv panel fig 7 it seemed that the rough soil surface beneath the pv panel did not considerably influence the mean overland flow velocity this may be because even though the soil surface under the pv panel was rougher than the control slope fig 6 the most surface water from upslope flowed in the rills so the mean flow velocity was close to that on the control slope 4 2 the effect of pv panel on slope soil erosion process the pv panel slope produced much less soil erosion than the control slope especially under heavy rainfall as there were restricted differences in the mean overland flow velocities on the two slopes and the discharge rates at the two outlets it could be inferred that for the two slopes the sediment transport capacities of the slope section downslope from the position under the pv panel are close to the sediment transport capacities of the corresponding slope section of the control slope thus the main reason for the decrease in soil erosion beneath the pv panel was most likely attributed to the fact that pv protected the soil surface from direct exposure to rainfall for the pv panel slope the splash erosion on the slope section under the pv panel was effectively prevented due to the rainfall interception of the pv panel raindrop splash is important in the detachment and transport of soil particles during soil erosion process on slope chaplot and poesen 2012 many previous studies focusing on hillslope erosion pointed out that attenuating raindrop impact can decrease soil erosion on slopes by adapting metal or nylon meshes above the test slopes to minimize splash erosion researchers found that soil erosion on slope decreased 10 0 86 8 lu et al 2016 vaezi et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 thus the interception of raindrops by the pv panel largely reduced the splash erosion in the slope on the other hand although the pv panel also limited the formation of soil surface seal which normally reduces soil surface erodibility and controls soil erosion e g lu et al 2017 luk et al 1993 under the pv panel because of the absence of raindrops armenise et al 2018 assouline 2004 the lack of this soil surface seal did not increase soil erosion in the experiments this is because the soil erosion process in the slope section under the pv panel was mainly rill erosion and the interrill erosion was restricted see fig 6 as sheet flow was mitigated due to raindrops blocking note that the surface area which rill erosion can directly impact is much smaller than that of interrill erosion which is driven by sheet flow hence the lack of soil surface seal resulted in limited impact on soil erosion in the pv panel slope during the rainfall experiments at the same time overland flow from upslope area which was the upstream area of the depression in the pv panel slope was much less than that of the control slope because of the pv panel s rainfall interception less overland flow of the pv panel slope can only transport less sediment from the upslope area than the control slope although the overland flow velocities were similar for both the slopes see fig 7 besides the erosivity of water drops from the lower edge of the pv panel was greatly attenuated during the most time of each rainfall by the water pond which was created by the water drops from the pv panel in the early stage of each rainfall event even with their terminal velocities the waterdrops normally lose their impact on the soil surface when they drop into depressions that deeper than 3 times of their diameters engel 1967 hartley and alonso 1991 kinnell 2012 in this experiment the diameters of water drops running off pv panels were shorter than 10 mm and their terminal velocities would not be arrived with 0 5 m height to the ground the water pond which reached a depth over 15 mm less than 3 min after rainfall started and absorbed most of the kinetic energy of the water drops therefore the pv panel reduced the splash erosion under it and the absence of structural soil seal under the panel did not considerably affect the erosion process the energy of the concentrated water drops or falls from the panel during rainfall did not did not have a meaningful impact on erosion and sediment transportation it should be noted that the 80 mm hr 1 scenario had much larger soil erosion rate than the 100 mm hr 1 one this may be because that the 80 mm hr 1 scenario was conducted on 25th nov 2021 table 1and fig 3 when the air temperature was below 0 at night and above 0 during the daytime so the freeze thaw action may make the top layer soil easier to be eroded sun et al 2021a wang et al 2017 4 3 limitations of the experiment as a preliminary experimental study at the plot scale the spatial scale of the result has not yet matched the larger scales of pv applications e g big pv panel arrays or solar farms with multiple pv panels or arrays above larger land surface the impact of them on the runoff and soil erosion processes would be more complicated at these larger scales taking a hillslope with a pv panel array in the chinese loess plateau as an example here the experiment result above indicated that a single pv panel reduced soil erosion and did not meaningfully change the total runoff amount during rainfalls but there are many land surface patches without the cover of pv panels among covered patches in the hillslope hence there would be concerns that whether these uncovered patches would be vulnerable to soil erosion and on the other side whether the covered patches lacking soil surface seal would be vulnerable to soil erosion given that our study shows that pv panels do not inhibit runoff generation if these are true the positive effect of single pv panels on soil erosion reduction which was found in this study would be offset however in our opinion these two offset effects would not be large first for the uncovered patches given the topography and soil erosion features of hillslopes in arid and semi arid regions such as the chinese loess plateau the development of widespread and complex rill and gully system in hillslope is fast and effective during rainfall runoff processes hofer et al 2012 poesen et al 2003 and thus the path length of sheet flow is usually not very long this normally induces that sheet flow concentration may not large enough to transport much sediment in these uncovered patches in fact over 60 total erosion are derived to rill and gully erosion in the loess plateau shen et al 2016 sun et al 2021b then for the covered patches precipitation is intercepted by the pv panels during rainfall which further mitigates sheet flow and its erodibility in the hillslope thus the concerns of soil erosion reduction offset would not be fully realized definitely this issue depends on the topography of the hillslope with the pv panel array and needs further field experiments to be dealt with however the results of this pilot study may have a potential of being upscaled to help these investigations at larger scales based on the results experiments with a pv panel block consists of 2 or more panels and further with large pv panel arrays can be purposefully designed and conducted in the next steps e g to deal with the example raised above the findings of these next step works and this study would then improve the modelling of solar farm impact on runoff and erosion at the catchment scale which will help to build new modules representing the mechanisms of pv panel impacts found in the experiments in catchment hydrological models meanwhile the observations of runoff and sediment variations before and after a solar farm construction can be analyzed from the perspective provided by this experimental study to support the development and management of the solar farm the settings of the pv panel in the experiment including the specific height and angle of panel was according to the typical pv panel installations in northern china also similar to some installations in other arid and semi arid regions but this may be not representative of some modern pv panel setups which allow the panels to dynamically track the sun at the same time a water pond 15 mm depth under the lower edge of the pv panel was created after the rainfall experiments in this study it is worried about that if a pv panel is higher and steeper than the one in this study this type of plunge pool would be much larger and bring additional risk of severe soil erosion although in some real cases higher or steeper pv panels can enlarge the dropping velocity of the water running off the panels which may lead to deeper and larger depressions on the ground this will cause larger water depth in the depressions which can effectively attenuate the erodibility of the dropping water normally waterdrops with their terminal velocities can have meaningful impact within the range of 3 times of their diameters when they drop into water surface engel 1967 hartley and alonso 1991 kinnell 2012 the diameters of water drops running off pv panels have little chance to be longer than 10 mm and their terminal velocities would not be reached with small heights from ground the heights of most pv panels in application are less than 3 m which means that the depressions may not be deeper than 30 mm thus this depression formation is a self limited process and would not bring large additional soil erosion finally it should be noted that in this study the land surface of the pair slopes was bare and the pv panel was not set to be very high and steep which may be favorable to the soil erosion difference between the two slopes this mitigation effect of real case application of a single pv panel may be changed depending on the conditions of it 4 4 the potential benefits of pv panels for vegetation restoration and flood delay the experiment results indicated that the pv panel can greatly reduce soil erosion in the slope especially under heavy rainfall which implied that in natural hillslope in arid or semi arid regions pv panels may lead to retain organic matter from plant litter in the top soil layer under the pv panels this organic matter retaining may be favorable to vegetation restoration under the pv panels in arid and semi arid regions as pv panels nowadays normally have long lifespans over 25 years xu et al 2018 their long term positive effect on soil conservation and vegetation restoration may be considerable and worthy further studies for instance in the chinese loess plateau which suffered from the severe loss of soil and organic matter xin et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 and the lack of precipitation gao et al 2018a pv panels which have been generally considered to reduce evapotranspiration rate and increase soil moisture in hillslopes due to sunlight blocking jahanfar et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 may help the vegetation restoration on the land surface under the panels in hillslopes due to this organic matter retaining effect meanwhile as soil structure is important for soil functions rabot et al 2018 rain drop interception of pv panels which can lead to prevention of soil surface sealing and preservation of surface soil aggregates under pv panels may attenuate soil function deterioration under the pv panels and promoted vegetation restoration certainly all these benefits to vegetation restoration are contingent on pv panels aiding or at least not reducing the health of vegetation under pv panels which needs more investigations to be fully verified furthermore as the overland flow generated more slowly on the pv panel slope under heavy rainfall than the control slope it may be inferred that pv power plants which can cover large area of a catchment may delay the catchment flood start time or even the time to flood peak this might bring potential benefit of flood delay in arid and semi arid regions hence the impacts of pv power plants on hydrological processes need to be explored at larger scales in the future 5 conclusions in this study a series of rainfall simulation experiments were conducted at a bare loess soil plot to investigate the impact of a pv panel on runoff and soil erosion processes in a plot scale slope the rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes of a slope with a pv panel above the middle of it and a control slope with no cover were observed and compared the result indicated that the pv panel did not have considerable effect on runoff volume peak flow discharge and overland flow velocity it may be due to the absence of structural soil seal under the pv panel causing more infiltration there which offset the reduction of infiltration due to the interception of raindrops by the pv panel however the pv panel largely reduced slope soil erosion by 27 63 this is because of the weakened splash erosion on the slope section under the pv panel due to the rainfall interception by the panel this finding indicated that the key impact of the pv panel is preventing soil detachment by raindrop impacts under heavy rainfall a delay of overland flow generation was observed which plausibly suggested that pv panels in hillslopes may have the potential to delay flood start time in this experimental study it should be noted that the pv panel was set not very high and steep and the study slopes were bare which may be favorable to the soil erosion difference between the two slopes in real case application of a single pv panel the soil erosion mitigation effect of the panel may be changed under varying conditions in arid and semi arid regions hillslopes with sparse vegetation which suffer severe soil erosion are quite common our findings implied that pv power plants in these hillslopes may lead to retaining of soil organic matter and improving of soil structure which may benefit to hillslope soil conservation and vegetation restoration in long term in the future studies the advantage of pv panels on water and soil conservation

1968,photovoltaic pv power plants are fast growing worldwide due to the environmental benefit of solar power generation and the development of photovoltaic technology however the impacts of pv panels on rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes in hillslope are not well understood this study quantitatively investigated these impacts on a plot scale slope through rainfall simulation experiments a bare plot with in situ loess soil in the chinese loess plateau was divided to two 4 m 1 m slopes i e a test slope with a pv panel above its middle and a control slope without cover as the study site in which 1 hr artificial rainfall with varying intensities 30 mm hr 1 to 100 mm hr 1 were conducted the result showed that runoff volume peak flow discharge rate and overland flow velocity were not remarkably different between the panel slope and the control slope although the soil surface under the pv panel was rougher than the surface of the control slope however the slope with the pv panel produced 27 63 less sediment flux at the outlet than the control slope especially under heavy rainfall this was attributed to the weakened splash erosion on the slope section under the pv panel due to the rainfall interception by the panel which indicated that the key impact of the pv panel was preventing soil detachment by raindrop impacts the pv panel delayed runoff start time under rainfall with heavy rainfall intensities 80 and 100 mm hr 1 due to the overland flow attenuation of the depression beneath the lower edge of the pv panel these findings implied that pv panels on hillslopes may have the potential to retain soil organic matter in top soil layers and to improve soil structure e g soil sealing control and soil aggregate protection which may benefit to hillslope soil conservation and

hillslope hydrology including rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes is a major concern in many areas such as soil and water conservation flood forecasting and agricultural sustainability development jia et al 2013 li and pan 2018 morbidelli et al 2018 land use plays an important role in hillslope hydrological processes birch et al 2021 gao et al 2018b recently there is a new type of land use the photovoltaic pv power plants hernandez et al 2015 which may largely affect the hillslope rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes but has not been fully understood in hillslope hydrology shobe 2022 among renewable energy recourses the facility of solar energy usually possesses long lifespan and low life circle carbon emission and it has a great potential to meet the future energy demand and to mitigate the anthropogenic impact on climate change creutzig et al 2017 martinopoulos and tsalikis 2018 in recent years solar pv technologies which convert light directly to electricity have been one of the fastest growing energy technologies because of technological advancements and policy supports dinesh and pearce 2016 hu et al 2016 tawalbeh et al 2021 the global cumulative solar pv capacity reached 602 gw in 2019 which had doubled in three years iea 2021 in china the pv markets are expending very fast and the cumulative installed pv capacity had a triple growth from 77 4 gw in 2016 to 205 2 gw in 2019 iea 2021 and will reach 600 gw before 2030 wang et al 2021b some researchers estimate that around 250000 km2 of land will be transformed in the next 30 years if all pv panel arrays are ground mounted under an optimistic scenario for global solar energy deployment by 2050 8500 gw choi et al 2020 particularly the pv power plants in the chinese loess plateau are growing fast since 2013 for instance the total area of the pv power plants in ningxia province which mostly located in the loess plateau was estimated at 134 6 km2 by the year of 2019 nearly tripled compared to 2013 from remote sensing data xia et al 2022 most of these power plants are over 10 km2 and located in sparse grasslands and aridlands kruitwagen et al 2021 xia et al 2022 however pv power plants require large areas due to the low density of solar energy wang et al 2021a hillslope areas contain a large portion of land which is suitable for large scale pv installations fig 1 kim and park 2021 yang et al 2019 and there is a wide range of acceptable slopes for pv power plant installation from 5 to 11 3 anwarzai and nagasaka 2017 charabi and gastli 2011 irena 2013 yushchenko et al 2018 furthermore yang et al 2019 estimated the large scale pv power generation potential in china using a gis based model and indicated that the large scale pv power plants should be planned in areas with slope lower than 20 due to the structure of pv arrays solar radiation and rainfall can be intercepted to a great extent by pv panels elamri et al 2018 yue et al 2021 many studies focused on the solar radiation reduction of pv panels which has direct impacts on evaporation wind speed air temperature and soil temperature armstrong et al 2016 barron gafford et al 2019 lambert et al 2021 liu et al 2019 on the other hand rainfall interception due to pv panels which can be vital to rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes in hillslopes is not comprehensively investigated by now the raindrops intercepted by pv panels during rainfall will concentrate along the lower edges of pv panels and fall onto ground surface causing heterogeneous spatial distribution of rainfall barron gafford et al 2019 jahanfar et al 2019 some researches indicated that runoff in slopes or hillslopes can be increased by pv panels jahanfar et al 2019 conducted a long term study comparing the discharge between the green roofs with or without pv panels and the results indicated that the pv panels increased the cumulative discharge about 30 and the peak discharge over 50 in rainfall events pisinaras et al 2014 quantified the hydrological budget constituents of pv power plants using swat model they found that annual surface runoff was increased at the catchment scale as the land use changed from agriculture to pv power plants however from another perspective the interception of raindrops by the pv panels could dramatically reduce the areas where rain splash erosion occurs elamri et al 2018 the reduction of splash erosion may not only decrease hillslope soil erosion darvishan et al 2014 but also reduce soil surface sealing which may lead to higher surface hydraulic conductivity infiltration and less runoff armenise et al 2018 assouline 2004 besides cook and mccuen 2013 adapted numerical models to analyze runoff from solar panel sites under pre and post development conditions they found that the pv panels did not have a significant effect on runoff volumes peak discharges or time to peak discharge the influence of pv panels on hillslope runoff is complicated and unclear as some researchers think pv panels increase hillslope runoff while others believe pv panels have negative or negligible effect on hillslope runoff also it can be inferred that the impact of pv panels on hillslope soil erosion process which may cause large environmental and economic consequences such as soil loss and land degradation alewell et al 2019 prosdocimi et al 2016 is complicated because it is susceptible to hillslope runoff process generally there is a lack of comprehensive researches focusing on the mechanisms of pv panel impacts on hydrological and sediment processes especially on hillslope soil erosion process which have not been studied yet to the authors knowledge by field experiments as pv power plants have been widely installed in hillslopes in arid and semi arid regions there is a concern that hillslope erosion might be enhanced due to the rainfall redistribution of pv panels rainfall simulation is extensively used as a research tool in studies

plot scale rainfall simulation experiments allow the accurate measurements of overland flow rate soil sediment flux microtopography change etc which usually help to find principal mechanisms in rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes e g runoff generation dynamics of erosion and deposition han et al 2021 martínez murillo et al 2013 ran et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 with the fast growth of pv power industry the knowledge of the hydrological effects of pv panels in hillslopes is essential for the plans of pv power plant construction especially in arid and semi arid regions in this study rainfall simulation experiments on slopes were conducted to investigate how a pv panel impacts rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes in a slope which may provide guidance for siting pv plants and evaluating the hydrological effects of pv power plants 2 methodology 2 1 slope experiment set up this experimental study was conducted at a study plot located near the hancheng city shannxi china 35 31 n 110 39 e and the plot had a natural land surface which had very sparse grass on it two 4 m 1 m slopes i e a test slope with a pv panel coving the middle of the slope and a control slope with no covering in the plot were set up and the two slopes were divided by 0 7 m high plastic plates fig 2 the plastic plates which were to delimit the experimental slopes were vertically and carefully inserted into the soil with minimized disturbance to the soil the slope gradient of the experiment slopes is about 8 7 which is within the range of normal slope for pv power plants anwarzai and nagasaka 2017 irena 2013 yushchenko et al 2018 the soil of the experimental plot was silt loam with 14 clay 67 silt and 19 sand and the porosity and bulk density of the soil were 0 48 and 1 24 g cm 3 respectively the sparse grass cover of the two slopes was carefully pulled out and removed one week before the rainfall experiment in order to minimize the ground surface difference between the test slope and control slope the study plot was surrounded by 0 2 m high plastic plates to prevent possible water loss due to splashing out two runoff collectors were set at the outlets of the test and control slopes which directed overland flow into containers for measurement a downslope facing pv panel was placed in the middle of the test slope fig 2c it has a size of 1650 mm length 950 mm width 40 mm thickness which is commonly adopted in pv power plants the fixed mounting pv system was chosen and the lower edge of the pv panel was 0 5 m above the ground with the panel having a 30 angle with the ground surface these setups of the pv panel were according to typical pv power plants in the north of china please note that these pv panel settings are not representative of many modern pv arrays which tilt dynamically to track the sun the rainfall simulator consisted of a water tank a pressure regulating pump two spray nozzles a flow meter a steel bracket and pipelines fig 2b the spray nozzles that generated raindrops in experiment were 1 4 hh fulljet model from spraying systems co which had a spray angle of 60 the nozzles of the fulljet model have been applied for rainfall simulation in many experimental studies e g abrantes et al 2018 loiola et al 2019 and it well simulated natural rainfall in these studies the position and direction of the spray nozzles are shown in fig 2b the height of the nozzle was 3 5 m above the slope allowing the water drops to reach their settling velocity before hitting the panel and ground the mean size of the simulated raindrops was 1 7 mm diameter having a range of 0 5 3 5 mm which was measured in rainfall experiment with the filter paper method best 1950 this indicated that the simulated rainfall was similar to the natural one in mean raindrop size best 1950 the rainfall intensity was precisely controlled by the pressure regulating pump and the rainfall intensity and spatial uniformity was calibrated and tested before the experiment after using a large plastic sheet to cover the two slopes the rainfall intensity was determined with 10 rain gauges each with 15 cm inner diameter and 20 cm height which were distributed uniformly above the two slopes the rainfall spatial uniformity is calculated using the coefficient of uniformity cuc defined by christiansen 1941 1 cuc 1 1 n x i x n x in which x i is the rainfall amount in each rain gauge x is the average amount of rainfall and n is the total number of the rain gauges placed over the plot to collect rainfall after the test the simulated rainfall had the cucs higher than 0 8 for all the rainfall intensities used in the experiment indicating that the simulated rainfall can be considered spatially uniform aksoy et al 2012 2 2 experiment design in this study four rainfall scenarios were considered in the rainfall experiment which fell into two rainfall intensity ranges table 1 according to the rainfall frequencies in the south of the chinese loess plateau ran et al 2020 the scenarios with 30 mm hr 1 and 50 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities represented moderate rainfall and the scenarios with 80 mm hr 1 and 100 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities represented typical storms table 1 under all these rainfall intensities infiltration excess overland flow dominated during the rainfall experiments the rainfall duration of each scenario run is 1 h there was an around 10 day interval between each two successive rainfall scenarios achieving similar initial soil water content from 25 to 27 in the 0 5 cm top soil layer before each rainfall simulation run the daily rainfall and air temperature of the study site was shown in fig 3 four days before the first experiment a rainfall run with 20 mm hr 1 intensity and 10 min duration were conducted on the study plot the reasons of this pretreatment rainfall were firstly make the surface soil reach a high moisture level which is close to that during rainy season at the loess plateau as most rainfall and soil erosion occurs in rainy season in this semi arid region secondly as the soil surface was a little bit disturbed due to the removal of the very sparse grass the water penetration during the short and light artificial rainfall can help smooth the soil surface and diminish the small impact of the grass removal in this study no extra replication of each rainfall scenario was conducted this was because this experimental study was conducted in a field study site with natural land surface the microtopography of the slopes was changed after each rainfall experiment due to soil erosion e g the development of rill and gully which may considerably influence surface flow process due to these alterations replication under identical rainfall intensity is not possible because there is no way to restore the pre existing surface microtopography at the same time the runoff and soil erosion differences between the pv panel slope and the control one was the key observable in this study hence the comparisons of the runoff and soil erosion results of the two slopes and whether these comparison results were consistent under varying rainfall intensities were important in this study in each scenario run overland flow and sediment samples were taken in every minute at the two outlets of the slopes during the first 15 min after runoff generated then the sampling interval was extended to 3 5 min as overland flow became stable the sediment samples from the collector were dried at 110 c for more than 24 hr and then weighed and recorded each slope was divided into 4 sections with equal spacing with each section measuring 1 m 1 m fig 2a the mean overland flow velocity in each section was determined by using the kmno4 dye tracer method abrahams et al 1986 zhang et al 2010 3 results 3 1 runoff in the rainfall experiments the runoff started 16 6 and 4 0 earlier in pv panel slope than that in the control slope under the 30 mm hr 1 and 50 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities respectively but the start times were delayed 88 7 and 178 8 by the pv panel under the 80 mm hr 1 and 100 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities fig 4 and table 2 respectively under different rainfall intensities the total runoff of the pv panel slope was 0 7 4 0 lower than that of the control slope table 2 the hydrographs of the two slopes were also quite close see fig 5 the differences in peak discharge rates between the two slopes were lower than 3 5 table 2 for the runs under the 30 mm hr 1 and 50 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities the runoff rate kept increasing until the rainfall stopped while for the runs under the 80 mm hr 1 and 100 mm hr 1 rainfall intensities the runoff rate quickly increased with time approaching steady state about 5 8 min after rainfall started 3 2 soil erosion contrary to the runoff results there were large differences between the soil erosion results of the two slopes the soil erosion mass and average sediment concentration of the pv panel slope were 27 63 lower than those of the control slope table 2 for instance under the 80 mm hr 1 rainfall the pv panel slope only produced 37 soil erosion mass and 38 average sediment concentration of the control slope for an individual event the soil erosion rate increased quickly in the first 10 15 min and then fluctuated in a range between 65 and 100 of the peak erosion rate fig 5 as rainfall continued the differences between the soil erosion rates of the pv panel slope and the control slope became greater for example under the 50 mm h 1 rainfall differences between the soil erosion rates of the pv panel slope and the control slope increased from 23 on average in the first 15 min to 45 on average in the last 20 min 3 3 slope micro relief and overland flow velocity the pv panel on the slope resisted a part of the raindrops and created concentrated water drops at its lower edge which had an influence on the slope micro relief a depression had been created under the lower edge of the pv panel by water drops since the first rainfall experiment run fig 6 b compared with the relative smooth soil surface of the control slope fig 6a the soil surface under the pv panel was rougher for example under the 80 mm hr 1 rainfall a big part of the ground surface under the pv panel did not have soil surface seal see the red square in fig 6b although there was obvious difference in micro relief between the two slopes the mean overland flow velocities of the two slopes only have 1 5 4 0 difference fig 7 4 discussion 4 1 the effect of pv panel on overland flow the rainfall experiment results showed that the pv panel did not have remarkable influence on runoff volume and peak discharge rate at the slope outlet although the pv panel on the slope blocked part of the raindrops during rainfall and created concentrated water drops at the lower edge of the panel previously a modelling study conducted by cook and mccuen 2013 also indicated that the installation of pv panels over a grassy field did not have considerable effect on the volume of runoff the peak discharge and the time to peak in this study the probable reasons were on one hand the interception of raindrops by the pv panel reduced the land surface area of infiltration leading to the increase of runoff on the other hand the interception of raindrops also greatly reduced the soil surface sealing under the pv panel fig 6b so that more surface water infiltrate into area under the panel compared with the control slope due to the higher hydraulic conductivity of unsealed top soil layer in consequence the combined effect of the pv panel on infiltration may result in no large difference in runoff between the two slopes this finding was inconsistent with some previous studies which indicated that the runoff volume and peak discharge rate of the pv panel hillslope may largely increase jahanfar et al 2019 the experimental plots with around 3 slope gradient used in jahanfar et al 2019 were quite permeable on green roofs in which saturation excess overland flow seemed to be the dominate runoff generation mechanism and soil sealing should be highly limited for their one year experiment the shading effect of pv panels can reduce evapotranspiration rate and largely increase the soil moisture content of the plots compared with the control plot probably resulting in increase of runoff volume and peak discharge rate thus unlike our study plot which dominated by infiltration excess overland flow changing in infiltration process did not affect runoff volume and peak too much in their study this comparison implied that different runoff generation mechanisms may lead to different impacts of pv panels on rainfall runoff process which may need further investigation using swat model pisinaras et al 2014 found that the land use change from agriculture to pv power plants can lead to increase in annual surface runoff and percolation potential which seemed to be not parallel with the result of this study this may be because that their modelling study area was over 100 km2 and the time scale was many years 5 to 90 years so their research scales were very different from those of this study which focused on plot scale rainfall runoff events under their much larger time and spatial scales the impact of land use change from agriculture to pv power plants on land surface hydrology was the decrease of annual evaporation and the increase of soil water content of their study catchment however in this plot scale study the result above indicated that there was no large impact of the pv panel on infiltration in the short time rainfall experiments in which the evaporation difference of the two slopes can be ignored under the moderate rainfall with the 30 mm hr 1 or 50 mm hr 1 intensity the runoff start time of the pv panel slope was shorter than the control one because the pv panel quickly concentrated rain water at downslope area the runoff started faster on the pv panel slope while the runoff generated slowly on the control slope due to the moderate rainfall intensity on the contrary under heavy rainfall with 80 mm hr 1 or 100 mm hr 1 intensity the runoff start time of the pv panel slope was later than the control slope the rain water quickly filled the depressions and converged into overland flow on the control slope however in the pv panel slope the small depression beneath the lower edge of the panel partly intercepted rain water at the beginning of rainfall so it took longer to generate overland flow at the outlet than the control slope in general the mean overland flow velocity was not affected by the pv panel fig 7 it seemed that the rough soil surface beneath the pv panel did not considerably influence the mean overland flow velocity this may be because even though the soil surface under the pv panel was rougher than the control slope fig 6 the most surface water from upslope flowed in the rills so the mean flow velocity was close to that on the control slope 4 2 the effect of pv panel on slope soil erosion process the pv panel slope produced much less soil erosion than the control slope especially under heavy rainfall as there were restricted differences in the mean overland flow velocities on the two slopes and the discharge rates at the two outlets it could be inferred that for the two slopes the sediment transport capacities of the slope section downslope from the position under the pv panel are close to the sediment transport capacities of the corresponding slope section of the control slope thus the main reason for the decrease in soil erosion beneath the pv panel was most likely attributed to the fact that pv protected the soil surface from direct exposure to rainfall for the pv panel slope the splash erosion on the slope section under the pv panel was effectively prevented due to the rainfall interception of the pv panel raindrop splash is important in the detachment and transport of soil particles during soil erosion process on slope chaplot and poesen 2012 many previous studies focusing on hillslope erosion pointed out that attenuating raindrop impact can decrease soil erosion on slopes by adapting metal or nylon meshes above the test slopes to minimize splash erosion researchers found that soil erosion on slope decreased 10 0 86 8 lu et al 2016 vaezi et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 thus the interception of raindrops by the pv panel largely reduced the splash erosion in the slope on the other hand although the pv panel also limited the formation of soil surface seal which normally reduces soil surface erodibility and controls soil erosion e g lu et al 2017 luk et al 1993 under the pv panel because of the absence of raindrops armenise et al 2018 assouline 2004 the lack of this soil surface seal did not increase soil erosion in the experiments this is because the soil erosion process in the slope section under the pv panel was mainly rill erosion and the interrill erosion was restricted see fig 6 as sheet flow was mitigated due to raindrops blocking note that the surface area which rill erosion can directly impact is much smaller than that of interrill erosion which is driven by sheet flow hence the lack of soil surface seal resulted in limited impact on soil erosion in the pv panel slope during the rainfall experiments at the same time overland flow from upslope area which was the upstream area of the depression in the pv panel slope was much less than that of the control slope because of the pv panel s rainfall interception less overland flow of the pv panel slope can only transport less sediment from the upslope area than the control slope although the overland flow velocities were similar for both the slopes see fig 7 besides the erosivity of water drops from the lower edge of the pv panel was greatly attenuated during the most time of each rainfall by the water pond which was created by the water drops from the pv panel in the early stage of each rainfall event even with their terminal velocities the waterdrops normally lose their impact on the soil surface when they drop into depressions that deeper than 3 times of their diameters engel 1967 hartley and alonso 1991 kinnell 2012 in this experiment the diameters of water drops running off pv panels were shorter than 10 mm and their terminal velocities would not be arrived with 0 5 m height to the ground the water pond which reached a depth over 15 mm less than 3 min after rainfall started and absorbed most of the kinetic energy of the water drops therefore the pv panel reduced the splash erosion under it and the absence of structural soil seal under the panel did not considerably affect the erosion process the energy of the concentrated water drops or falls from the panel during rainfall did not did not have a meaningful impact on erosion and sediment transportation it should be noted that the 80 mm hr 1 scenario had much larger soil erosion rate than the 100 mm hr 1 one this may be because that the 80 mm hr 1 scenario was conducted on 25th nov 2021 table 1and fig 3 when the air temperature was below 0 at night and above 0 during the daytime so the freeze thaw action may make the top layer soil easier to be eroded sun et al 2021a wang et al 2017 4 3 limitations of the experiment as a preliminary experimental study at the plot scale the spatial scale of the result has not yet matched the larger scales of pv applications e g big pv panel arrays or solar farms with multiple pv panels or arrays above larger land surface the impact of them on the runoff and soil erosion processes would be more complicated at these larger scales taking a hillslope with a pv panel array in the chinese loess plateau as an example here the experiment result above indicated that a single pv panel reduced soil erosion and did not meaningfully change the total runoff amount during rainfalls but there are many land surface patches without the cover of pv panels among covered patches in the hillslope hence there would be concerns that whether these uncovered patches would be vulnerable to soil erosion and on the other side whether the covered patches lacking soil surface seal would be vulnerable to soil erosion given that our study shows that pv panels do not inhibit runoff generation if these are true the positive effect of single pv panels on soil erosion reduction which was found in this study would be offset however in our opinion these two offset effects would not be large first for the uncovered patches given the topography and soil erosion features of hillslopes in arid and semi arid regions such as the chinese loess plateau the development of widespread and complex rill and gully system in hillslope is fast and effective during rainfall runoff processes hofer et al 2012 poesen et al 2003 and thus the path length of sheet flow is usually not very long this normally induces that sheet flow concentration may not large enough to transport much sediment in these uncovered patches in fact over 60 total erosion are derived to rill and gully erosion in the loess plateau shen et al 2016 sun et al 2021b then for the covered patches precipitation is intercepted by the pv panels during rainfall which further mitigates sheet flow and its erodibility in the hillslope thus the concerns of soil erosion reduction offset would not be fully realized definitely this issue depends on the topography of the hillslope with the pv panel array and needs further field experiments to be dealt with however the results of this pilot study may have a potential of being upscaled to help these investigations at larger scales based on the results experiments with a pv panel block consists of 2 or more panels and further with large pv panel arrays can be purposefully designed and conducted in the next steps e g to deal with the example raised above the findings of these next step works and this study would then improve the modelling of solar farm impact on runoff and erosion at the catchment scale which will help to build new modules representing the mechanisms of pv panel impacts found in the experiments in catchment hydrological models meanwhile the observations of runoff and sediment variations before and after a solar farm construction can be analyzed from the perspective provided by this experimental study to support the development and management of the solar farm the settings of the pv panel in the experiment including the specific height and angle of panel was according to the typical pv panel installations in northern china also similar to some installations in other arid and semi arid regions but this may be not representative of some modern pv panel setups which allow the panels to dynamically track the sun at the same time a water pond 15 mm depth under the lower edge of the pv panel was created after the rainfall experiments in this study it is worried about that if a pv panel is higher and steeper than the one in this study this type of plunge pool would be much larger and bring additional risk of severe soil erosion although in some real cases higher or steeper pv panels can enlarge the dropping velocity of the water running off the panels which may lead to deeper and larger depressions on the ground this will cause larger water depth in the depressions which can effectively attenuate the erodibility of the dropping water normally waterdrops with their terminal velocities can have meaningful impact within the range of 3 times of their diameters when they drop into water surface engel 1967 hartley and alonso 1991 kinnell 2012 the diameters of water drops running off pv panels have little chance to be longer than 10 mm and their terminal velocities would not be reached with small heights from ground the heights of most pv panels in application are less than 3 m which means that the depressions may not be deeper than 30 mm thus this depression formation is a self limited process and would not bring large additional soil erosion finally it should be noted that in this study the land surface of the pair slopes was bare and the pv panel was not set to be very high and steep which may be favorable to the soil erosion difference between the two slopes this mitigation effect of real case application of a single pv panel may be changed depending on the conditions of it 4 4 the potential benefits of pv panels for vegetation restoration and flood delay the experiment results indicated that the pv panel can greatly reduce soil erosion in the slope especially under heavy rainfall which implied that in natural hillslope in arid or semi arid regions pv panels may lead to retain organic matter from plant litter in the top soil layer under the pv panels this organic matter retaining may be favorable to vegetation restoration under the pv panels in arid and semi arid regions as pv panels nowadays normally have long lifespans over 25 years xu et al 2018 their long term positive effect on soil conservation and vegetation restoration may be considerable and worthy further studies for instance in the chinese loess plateau which suffered from the severe loss of soil and organic matter xin et al 2011 zhao et al 2015 and the lack of precipitation gao et al 2018a pv panels which have been generally considered to reduce evapotranspiration rate and increase soil moisture in hillslopes due to sunlight blocking jahanfar et al 2020 jiang et al 2022 may help the vegetation restoration on the land surface under the panels in hillslopes due to this organic matter retaining effect meanwhile as soil structure is important for soil functions rabot et al 2018 rain drop interception of pv panels which can lead to prevention of soil surface sealing and preservation of surface soil aggregates under pv panels may attenuate soil function deterioration under the pv panels and promoted vegetation restoration certainly all these benefits to vegetation restoration are contingent on pv panels aiding or at least not reducing the health of vegetation under pv panels which needs more investigations to be fully verified furthermore as the overland flow generated more slowly on the pv panel slope under heavy rainfall than the control slope it may be inferred that pv power plants which can cover large area of a catchment may delay the catchment flood start time or even the time to flood peak this might bring potential benefit of flood delay in arid and semi arid regions hence the impacts of pv power plants on hydrological processes need to be explored at larger scales in the future 5 conclusions in this study a series of rainfall simulation experiments were conducted at a bare loess soil plot to investigate the impact of a pv panel on runoff and soil erosion processes in a plot scale slope the rainfall runoff and soil erosion processes of a slope with a pv panel above the middle of it and a control slope with no cover were observed and compared the result indicated that the pv panel did not have considerable effect on runoff volume peak flow discharge and overland flow velocity it may be due to the absence of structural soil seal under the pv panel causing more infiltration there which offset the reduction of infiltration due to the interception of raindrops by the pv panel however the pv panel largely reduced slope soil erosion by 27 63 this is because of the weakened splash erosion on the slope section under the pv panel due to the rainfall interception by the panel this finding indicated that the key impact of the pv panel is preventing soil detachment by raindrop impacts under heavy rainfall a delay of overland flow generation was observed which plausibly suggested that pv panels in hillslopes may have the potential to delay flood start time in this experimental study it should be noted that the pv panel was set not very high and steep and the study slopes were bare which may be favorable to the soil erosion difference between the two slopes in real case application of a single pv panel the soil erosion mitigation effect of the panel may be changed under varying conditions in arid and semi arid regions hillslopes with sparse vegetation which suffer severe soil erosion are quite common our findings implied that pv power plants in these hillslopes may lead to retaining of soil organic matter and improving of soil structure which may benefit to hillslope soil conservation and vegetation restoration in long term in the future studies the advantage of pv panels on water and soil conservation

1969,over the past several decades hydrologic models have advanced from independent models of the surface and subsurface to integrated models that can capture the terrestrial hydrologic cycle within one framework in recent years these coupled frameworks have seen the inclusion of biogeochemical processes ecohydrology sedimentation and erosion cold region hydrology anthropogenic activities and atmospheric processes this expansion is the result of increased computational data and modeling capabilities and capacities as well as improved understanding of the processes that drive these integrated systems here we review these recent advances to integrate new processes and systems into existing terrestrial hydrologic models and highlight the significant challenges and opportunities that remain we identify that with so many models currently available and in development selecting the most appropriate model is difficult and we suggest a path for new or novice modelers to find the most appropriate code based on their needs in addition data required to parameterize and calibrate these models can often constrain their applicability and usefulness however advances in environmental sensors and measurement technology in addition to data assimilation of non traditional data e g remote sensing qualitative data are providing new ways of addressing this issue as we expand hydrologic models to integrate more processes and systems our computational demands also increase recent and emerging advances in computational platforms including cloud and quantum computing in addition to the use of machine learning to capture some processes will continue to support the use of increasingly larger and more complex process based models finally we highlight that it is critical to develop state of the science models that are accessible to all model users not just those applied for research and development we encourage continued development of diverse modeling platforms considering the user needs data availability and computational resources data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is an integral part of all systems and processes in our natural and anthropogenic environments water sustains life and supports our quality of life and maintaining both requires the ability to quantify simulate and predict water resources and the impact of water management strategies into the future early efforts to simulate and predict the distribution and quality of water resources were compartmentalized into components of the hydrologic cycle e g surface water groundwater snow and evapotranspiration and or processes e g geochemical reactions precipitation dissolution overland flow vegetation water use and response to water availability with increased understanding of terrestrial hydrologic processes and computational capacity recent efforts have integrated many of these components and processes in a single computational modeling framework to improve representation of the hydrologic cycle one such advance is the integration of surface and subsurface hydrologic flow and transport processes which improved representation of the terrestrial water cycle these physically based integrated models can take many different forms but generally couple a representation of richards equation for variably saturated subsurface flow with a version of the st venant s equation for surface flow aquanty inc 2018 brunner simmons 2012 kollet et al 2017 kollet maxwell 2008 maxwell et al 2014 these equations are then coupled or integrated using one of several different techniques in general the term fully integrated is used to differentiate those models that allow for simultaneous solution of the surface and subsurface equations whereas the terms integrated or coupled is used to indicate models that iterate between solutions of the surface and subsurface furman 2008 the connection between the surface and subsurface can also take many forms including a first order exchange flux term that is similar to the darcy flux and the common or equilibrium based approach where the surface and subsurface nodes that connect the two regimes are identical aquanty inc 2018 liggett et al 2012 due to the integration of discrete surface and subsurface flow equations these models also require spin up simulations to provide initial conditions that can be appropriately solved during further calibration or simulation runs ajami et al 2014 several reviews and model intercomparison studies of these integrated hydrologic models have been completed in recent years e g fan et al 2019 maxwell et al 2014 and the use of these models has evolved to applications that include informing policy and management decisions and guiding remediation and preventative efforts e g brookfield gnau 2016 brookfield layzell 2019 thatch et al 2020 here we build upon these reviews and comparisons reviewing recent expansion from the integrated hydrologic models representing the surface subsurface hydrologic system to include biogeochemistry erosion and sediment transport ecohydrology anthropogenic activities cold region hydrology and atmospheric processes that influence the global hydrologic cycle fig 1 specifically we focus this review on the expansion of integrated hydrologic models that include 1 biogeochemistry moving beyond basic solute transport to include representation of reactive processes such as complexation precipitation and dissolution redox processes microbial processes and isotopic fractionation 2 sediment and erosion inclusion of some or all of the sediment budget within study regions such as fluvial erosion streambank stability and depositional processes 3 ecohydrology representation of vegetation dynamics including growth and mortality and disturbances including wildfire and invasive species that influence water and energy fluxes 4 anthropogenic activities inclusion of human activities that directly impact the hydrologic system such as reservoir and dam operation groundwater extraction surface water diversion and irrigation 5 cold region hydrology representation of processes and systems related to snow and ice including accumulation vapor loss melt and permafrost 6 atmospheric processes expanding representation of the hydrologic cycle beyond the terrestrial system including interactions between surface and subsurface hydrologic conditions to local and regional weather patterns and climate due to the prolific development of modeling approaches and applications it is not possible to comprehensively include all specific modeling frameworks and advances in these areas the goal is to present examples of emerging concepts and techniques in order to provide a broad and robust overview of the expansion of integrated hydrologic models and an assessment of ongoing challenges and future directions for further development we expand on the ongoing challenge of model selection which was recently highlighted by melsen 2022 to discuss selecting a model based on a particular objective and data availability the scope of this work includes a review of the recent expansion of existing integrated hydrologic models to include domains beyond surface water and groundwater systems as well as innovations in application of these tools for water resources management it is equally important to develop methods of identifying what simplifications can be made for any particular application to increase the efficiency and useability as it is to develop complex models capable of simulating more processes and systems while this work focuses on recent advances made with process based numerical models we highlight ongoing and emerging research using machine learning approaches in conjunction with process based models leading to the development of hybrid models 2 recent expansion of integrated hydrologic models as previously discussed significant advances in integrated hydrologic models that simulate the terrestrial water system have been made in recent years including expansion beyond water and solute movement across the surface and subsurface here we identify and review this expansion of integrated hydrologic models into other domains fig 1 2 1 chemistry biochemistry geochemistry a myriad of biogeochemical processes control the production fate and transport of solutes and carbon from watersheds tracking how land cover climate and disturbance impacts solute production and mobility has important implications for water security and critical zone function the critical zone stretches from the top of the canopy down to the depths of circulating groundwater anderson et al 2007 brantley et al 2007 condon et al 2020 council 2000 and is intricately intertwined with the terrestrial hydrologic cycle singha navarre sitchler 2022 sullivan et al in revision reactive transport models rtms are numerical representations of biogeochemical reaction processes such as respiration or carbonate weathering that allow us to understand how external drivers e g meteoric precipitation interact with the internal structure of the critical zone duffy et al 2014 li 2019 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b li et al 2021 sullivan et al 2020 given the numerous processes that may be represented the dimensionality required to capture these interactions e g 1d 3d and the timescales of interest a diversity of rtms have emerged over the recent decades with varying degrees of integration with hydrologic models at the most basic level is the one way coupling between either complex physically based spatially explicit hydrologic models e g flux pihm bao et al 2017 or simpler lumped parameter models hbv bergström 1995 bergström lindström 2015 to geochemical box models e g witch weathering at the catchment scale goddéris et al 2006 here the hydrologic model passes soil moisture and water fluxes to the rtm to simulate biogeochemical reactions and thus processes such as mineral dissolution precipitation and solute generation and transport e g sullivan et al 2019 one advantage of this approach is it simplifies the computational demand for tuning the rtm and allows the end user to focus on the degree of reaction complexity that they will choose to include if the goal of the numerical simulations is to understand how changes in the solid phase let say the dissolution of minerals impact the generation of porosity and augments the permeability then fully integrated models are needed crunchtope or crunchflow steefel 2009 is a widely used rt code that solves for saturated flow i e darcy flux while allowing reactions to influence the solid phase crunchtope is capable of representing a detailed distribution of soil and rock properties in the subsurface and has been used to simulate the long term evolution of the subsurface under averaged hydroclimatic conditions wen et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 moving out of solely saturated conditions there are codes such as min3p and pflowtran that can solve for variably saturated conditions in the 3 d tetrahedral mesh lichtner et al 2015 mayer et al 2002 su et al 2021 and even include processes such as dynamic root architecture thus our ability to represent critical zone processes and numerically explore how it responds to the shifts in the hydrologic cycle is strengthening one limitation in rtms is their integration into spatially explicit watershed scale hydrologic models while some models do exist the lack of spatially explicit information on soil mineralogy and biotic processes limits the degree to which these models can be applied one such watershed scale model is biort flux pihm which can simulate interactions between land surface watershed hydrology and reactive transport at a variety of temporal scales bao et al 2017 these watershed scale models integrate watershed characteristics such as topography vegetation and temporal hydroclimatic variations and have some representation of subsurface structure to allow for predictions of precipitation dissolution reactions in addition to carbon dynamics li 2019 xu et al 2022 zhi et al 2019 2022 but unlike the capabilities in crunchtope that can update the solid phase distribution and thus porosity and permeability these spatially explicit models must first be paused and new parameters assigned to understand how changes in the subsurface could alter hydrologic and therefore biogeochemical fluxes to this end some integrated hydrologic models have begun to include reactive transport moulton et al 2015 usman munir frei 2021 z xu et al 2022 while these developments have limited reaction pathways and or the limited hydrologic conditions e g saturated vs variably saturated they are one manner by which rtms are growing to be more fully integrated in large watershed and even regional scale models recent advances in rtms allow for the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the critical zone to be better represented in numerical experiments for example geologic heterogeneity can lead to complex and variable fluid flow dynamics and thus solute transport creating challenges in our ability to predict geochemical processes e g navarre sitchler jung 2017 wen li 2017 efforts are underway to understand the discrepancies between laboratory and field based dissolution rates that arise from differences in physical heterogeneity by providing correction factors to linear transition state theory hyman et al 2022 elucidating the propagation of reaction fronts through fracture networks andrews navarre sitchler 2021 and developing rate laws that account for the overall degree of spatial heterogeneity in the domain wen li 2017 2018 advances in our understanding of isotope chemistry are now emerging as reaction capabilities within rtms particularly crunchtope here the isotopic composition of both fluid and solid phase shed light on the dominant controls of reactions e g spatial variability in microbial growth order of rate laws and dominance of kinetic vs equilibrium fractionation druhan et al 2012 druhan et al 2013 druhan et al 2014 modeled isotopic signatures are improving our understanding of the interaction between critical zone structure and function for example 1 multiple fractionation pathways and flexible transit time distributions are necessary to capture intra site variability in silica stream water concentrations fernandez et al 2022 2 a fairly rapid supply of fresh bedrock is required to reproduce the parabolic shape between dissolved lithium and weathering intensity observed in global data winnick et al 2022 and 3 unraveling the critical zone s past e g changes in climate and vegetation recorded in speleothems is possible through the modeling of stable and radio carbon isotope data druhan et al 2021 by including root exudation processes into crunchtope rewtcrunch roque malo et al 2022 it is now also possible to vertically resolve root soil microbe water interaction and their influence on solute fluxes at a daily time scale overall the development of rtms allows us to explore both the impacts of the anthropocene on critical zone function kumar et al 2018 sullivan et al 2022 and to elucidate how long term changes in earth s atmosphere has controlled weathering rates goddéris et al 2010 maher et al 2009 moore et al 2012 we can now explore how changes in land cover influence stream water chemistry wen et al 2021 how variations and hydrologic connectivity influence the export of dissolved organic carbon to streams wen et al 2020 and the impact of changing climate on solute export across environments of varying subsurface heterogeneity wen et al 2022 2 2 sediment and erosion accurate representation of streamflow generation processes and near surface hydrologic dynamics impact the overall sediment budget of a catchment and are important for understanding sediment transport processes heppner et al 2006 huang niemann 2008 many empirical and physically based models have been developed to simulate erosion and sediment transport processes with various levels of complexity and data requirement merritt et al 2003 while application of empirical models such as the universal soil loss equation is preferred due to a smaller number of parameters these models assume that watershed properties are stationary zi et al 2019 physically based models implement various formulations to represent detachment transport and deposition processes and use different model structures for representing hydrologic processes with the exception of few models such as geotopsed zi et al 2016 tribs ofm kim et al 2012 and inhm heppner et al 2006 many erosion and sediment transport models simplify representation of subsurface hydrologic processes due to differences in temporal and spatial scales of the phenomena and computational demand of solving surface water groundwater equations simultaneously francipane et al 2012 existing coupled surface water groundwater sediment transport models either simplify surface water groundwater coupling by using the first order exchange coefficient approach e g integrated hydrology model inhm heppner et al 2006 reducing subsurface heterogeneity by using soil classes and geological layers parallel to bedrock e g geotopsed zi et al 2016 or simplifying vadose zone and groundwater processes by using a gravity dominated formulation and the boussinesq s equation under the dupuit forchheimer assumptions respectively e g tribs ofm kim et al 2012 and tribs erosion francipane et al 2012 physically based integrated hydrologic models such as parflow clm kollet maxwell 2008 maxwell miller 2005 that simulate the terrestrial hydrologic cycle as a continuous system by solving the 3d richards equation over the entire subsurface and has a fully integrated overland flow simulator and a land surface model clm 3 0 dai et al 2003 to solve water and energy budgets at the land surface are valuable tools for integrating erosion and sediment transport processes the integrated hydrologic model hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2018 brunner simmons 2012 hwang et al 2014 which also simulates the terrestrial hydrologic cycle as a continuous system has been coupled to surface water operations model oasis hydrologics 2009 and was developed to solve for fluvial erosion using the excess shear stress approach brookfield layzell 2019 and is linked to a streambank stability module wei 2022 despite these advances inclusion or integration of sedimentation and or erosion processes into integrated hydrologic models remains limited and computationally challenging as changes in land surface elevation due to erosion or deposition processes can lead to numerical instability for continuous simulations 2 3 ecohydrology transpiration accounts for roughly 70 of precipitated water although this proportion varies dramatically with space and time jasechko et al 2013 given the importance of transpiration most hydrologic models consider the direct impact of vegetation on evapotranspiration in simple conceptual hydrologic models vegetation may be implicitly represented as a parameter but in some integrated hydrologic models vegetation is explicitly represented via a combination of parameters and submodels fatichi et al 2016a that can include transpiration partitioning maxwell condon 2016 these submodels generally account for vegetation s direct control on transpiration and indirect influences on evaporation soil moisture and snow accumulation and melt via canopy interception and shading but vary substantially in terms of the inclusion of other coupled ecological processes see reviews in brewer et al 2018 fatichi et al 2016a climate change is expected to alter not only vegetation function water use but to accelerate changes to vegetation composition and structure size density rooting depths heights etc hauser et al 2021 mcdowell et al 2022 as well as disturbances e g fire disease seidl et al 2017 disturbance driven changes in species are also expected to intensify with climate change e g serra diaz et al 2018 these changes to vegetation structure and function will have substantial hydrologic impacts e g mankin et al 2019 and thus there is a growing need to represent vegetation growth mortality community change and response to disturbances including fire in many integrated hydrologic model applications models of ecohydrology vary along several dimensions fatichi et al 2016a the realism of the relationship between vegetation structure and radiative forcing varies from simple submodels such as beer s law with a leaf area index to complex submodels where tree spacing and gaps height overstory understory and or sunlit and shade leaves are accounted for in estimates of the radiative forcing of plant transpiration bonan et al 2021 plant hydraulics or how plants mediate the flux of water from soil to atmosphere similarly vary from simple models of stomatal conductance to models that track vertical and horizontal root distributions stem conductance and more complex stomatal physiology e g javaux et al 2008 2013 lin et al 2019 trugman et al 2019 ecohydrology models also vary in how they account for changes in vegetation structure and composition through time including changes that are coupled with hydrologic conditions e g declines in leaf area with drought e g garcia et al 2016 ecohydrology models that couple hydrologic models with carbon and nutrient cycling to grow vegetation have been available for decades and used within the land surface submodels in general circulation models gcms or earth system models these coupled carbon hydrology models represent incremental changes to parameters that are relevant to hydrology such as height root depth and leaf area with variation in the availability of light water and nutrients arora 2002 more recently coupled models that represent disturbances such as fire and disease are available seidl et al 2017 these models can account for how climate drivers including drought alter the probability and severity of disturbances such as fire and disease that have dramatic consequences for vegetation e g hanan et al 2021 and ultimately hydrology e g ren et al 2021 similarly several recent terrestrial biosphere models account for shifts in species distributions with climate fisher et al 2022 although the representation of hydrologic processes in these models remains limited considering not only species differences but also between species interactions can have important hydrologic consequences pretzsch et al 2015 but this level of plant ecosystem complexity is rarely included in hydrologic models for hydrologic models that resolve channel flow ecohydrology includes the impact of riparian vegetation on hydrodynamics e g effects of vegetation on fluid flow and morphodynamics including vegetation impacts on change in channel structure itself camporeale et al 2013 marjoribanks et al 2014 the representation of vegetation change in hydrodynamic models is generally less well developed relative to coupled ecohydrology models used in the terrestrial environments approaches for accounting for in stream vegetation impacts range from simple roughness parameters to models that represent changes in riparian vegetation communities as a function of hydrologic conditions camporeale et al 2013 similarly modeling within channel biogeochemistry including hyporheic flow and exchanges has advanced in recent years but these models of within stream and river ecological processes are rarely included in models that account for both upland and within river flows jan et al 2021 finally the impact of human intervention on vegetation can be significant both simple and complex ecohydrology models typically represent human intervention as an external forcing e g prescribed land cover change irrigation fuel treatments etc wagner et al 2019 yalew et al 2018 2 4 anthropogenic activities humans modify the terrestrial hydrologic cycle in numerous ways including construction and operation of dams and reservoirs surface water diversions groundwater extraction irrigation and land use change including urbanization within the last millennium 75 of earth s land surface has been modified by human activities luyssaert et al 2014 these modifications can substantially alter infiltration capacity via impermeable surfaces and changes in evapotranspiration by altering the type density and distribution of vegetation some processes related to these modifications have been included in hydrologic models for decades including groundwater pumping and land use change yet challenges remain for groundwater pumping the inclusion of numerous discrete groundwater wells and variable pumping rates common in agricultural regions remains numerically challenging the representation of land use change is challenged by the variety of ways it can impact the hydrologic system including changes to evapotranspiration due to changes in vegetation see ecohydrology and local scale routing of water in urban environments due to the construction of impermeable surfaces and water collection and distribution systems e g storm water management integrated hydrologic models that simulate the terrestrial water cycle e g parflow kollet maxwell 2006 hgs aquanty inc 2018 gsflow markstrom et al 2008 were originally developed to simulate natural hydrologic systems with limited abilities to incorporate anthropogenic activities almost all watersheds have anthropogenic activities and impacts therefore including these processes is critical for proper representation of the hydrologic conditions in addition these models are increasingly being used for integrated water management planning which also requires inclusion of the anthropogenic water uses and management infrastructure for proper assessment in response integrated hydrologic models have advanced to better include the interactions between humans and the terrestrial water system however one of the biggest challenges in integrated hydrologic model application is limited data availability of human water use e g groundwater pumping canal deliveries more recently a number of packages have been integrated into hydrologic models to capture anthropogenic activities building upon existing frameworks that capture groundwater and surface water pumping modules were developed to capture irrigation application including variability in evapotranspiration and infiltration often termed irrigation return flow due to irrigation strategy e g flood irrigation center pivot subsurface drip and water rights structure e g kitlasten et al 2021 these modules include specific agricultural packages for gsflow niswonger 2020 and processes integrated directly into the integrated hydrologic modeling codes such as parflow and hydrogeosphere aquanty inc 2018 condon maxwell 2013 hydrologic modeling in urban settings is particularly challenging due to the high resolution and spatial complexity of urban land cover salvadore et al 2015 flow networks in urban environments are also complex and hydrologic models applied to urban areas e g swmm niazi et al 2017 include submodels that integrate storm sewer networks green infrastructure and stormwater control measures scms and differentiate between connected and disconnected impervious areas e g bell et al 2019 high resolution data is increasingly available for urban areas and assimilation of this data is expected to improve hydrologic modeling hutchins et al 2017 the high spatial resolution required to account for these changes to flow networks can be a barrier for regional scale ihms application golden hoghooghi 2018 however fine scale hydrologic model applications can be used to derive parameters based on land use classification e g high density urban suburban to support larger scale application e g shields tague 2015 many codes are modified to include methods of integrating reservoirs canals pipe networks and other water storage and distribution systems into the hydrologic models while natural processes and physical conditions can constrain operation of these engineered structures the distribution of water is dictated by human decisions regulations and policies integrating these non physics based operations into an integrated hydrologic modeling framework often requires coupling to other existing models that use rule based optimization strategies e g brookfield et al 2017 morway et al 2016 or incorporating often inflexible boundary conditions based on historic operations a significant drawback of the latter approach is that operations cannot be easily adapted for future scenarios as opposed to the former which has operational structures built into the coupled model 2 5 cold region processes snow dominated headwaters provide water resources to 1 6th the world s population barnett et al 2005 and support ecologic and social economic services immerzeel et al 2021 cold regions are considered especially vulnerable to climate change milly dunne 2020 portner et al 2019 with low land dependence on these snow water resources expected to increase in the near future viviroli et al 2020 the amount and timing of snow and glacial melt are critical to hydrologic processes related to transpiration knowles et al 2018 parida buermann 2014 recharge carroll et al 2019 godsey et al 2014 meixner et al 2016 and streamflow generation hammond et al 2018 d li et al 2017a millan et al 2022 likewise snow and ice loss and permafrost degradation have important implications on biogeochemical reactions trace gas release and riverine export of organic matter inorganic nutrients and major ions broadbent et al 2021 frey mcclelland 2009 jafarov et al 2018 milner et al 2017 miner et al 2021 pongracz et al 2021 snow and ice cover also play an important role in weather and climate through surface albedo sublimation sensible heat exchange with the lower atmosphere and insulation of soil by snow clark serreze 2000 lo clark 2002 l xu dirmeyer 2011 the interactions of snow and ice across atmospheric hydrologic ecologic and biogeochemical subcomponents is further complicated by the scale dependence of snow processes bales et al 2006 broxton et al 2015 clark et al 2011 deems et al 2006 mott et al 2018 tennant et al 2017 as a result representation of snow and ice dynamics in integrated hydrologic models remains a major challenge as a consequence classic representations of snow processes in hydrologic models have relied on relatively simple temperature index approaches that correlate snowmelt to air temperature e g martinec 1975 these empirical relationships are most often associated with glacial applications snowmelt in open sites and operational forecasting kumar et al 2014 with recent models incorporating wind speed vapor pressure and radiation into the approach li williams 2008 more accurate representation of cold region hydrology must describe the distributed water and energy balance between the atmosphere and land surface clark et al 2015 shrestha et al 2015 modeling approaches that account for water and energy distributions across space tend to also account for their vertical distribution in the snowpack some integrated hydrologic models use only two snowpack layers to account for radiant convective and conductive exchanges e g gsflow while others are more finely resolved e g parflow clm these modeling approaches are largely based on the parameterization of individual processes related to albedo snow compaction turbulent and radiant energy transfer chen et al 2014 kumar et al 2013 magnusson et al 2015 representation of wind redistribution e g liston elder 2006 remains a significant challenge zhou et al 2021 and is rarely included directly in integrated hydrologic models due to computational expense and lack of process understanding however the redistribution of snow is potentially important in capturing the amount and timing of snowmelt with significant ramifications on the water budget as a consequence several hydrological studies have corrected precipitation inputs to account for preferential distribution using airborne lidar mapping of snowpack carroll et al 2019 lahmers et al 2022 satellite derived data assimilation strategies bennett et al 2019 or accounting for topographic effects on gravitational and wind transport of snow freudiger et al 2017 representation of permafrost processes in earth system models have advanced in recent years but there remains significant uncertainty and variation in how model representations account for freeze thaw processes and how released melt water moves through the subsurface to rivers andresen et al 2020 more detailed representations of permafrost hydrology are available and these approaches provide more accurate estimates of permafrost change on river flow and chemistry e g cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm pomeroy et al 2007 advance terrestrial simulator ats painter et al 2016 however strategies are needed to integrate learning from these data intensive permafrost models into integrated hydrologic models krogh pomeroy 2021 2 6 atmospheric processes atmospheric processes control the weather short term conditions and climate long term conditions and are critical drivers of the hydrologic cycle governing the hydrologic and energy fluxes between the air and land surface most hydrologic models include weather related parameters such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in early hydrologic models the weather conditions were included as a boundary condition with prescribed precipitation and potential evapotranspiration these models advanced to include algorithms and models that calculated actual evapotranspiration based on both weather and hydrologic conditions and subsequently to actual weather and climate models that provided one way and two way feedback to the hydrologic model davison et al 2015 2018 maxwell et al 2007 maxwell condon 2016 sorooshian et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 the treatment of atmospheric conditions varied between surface water and groundwater models where the direct link to weather was included earlier in the surface water models e g benoit et al 2000 walko et al 2000 compared to groundwater models e g york et al 2002 groundwater models traditionally prescribed recharge fluxes that are often indirectly attributable to mean weather conditions e g maxey eakin 1949 this is likely due to the direct connection between the land and atmosphere compared to a more in direct connection to the subsurface in the frameworks that integrate atmospheric and hydrologic models computational difficulties arise from the complexity of the processes included and the mismatch between the spatio temporal resolution and scales between the two model types davison et al 2018 fatichi et al 2016b maxwell et al 2011 the domain required to simulate weather climate is significantly larger than that required for terrestrial hydrology and associated cell sizes also have significant mismatch this is driven by the relatively fast rates of atmospheric processes in comparison to slower rates of the surface water domain and even slower rates of the groundwater domain approaches to address these issues include coupling existing models of each system such as in the terrestrial systems modeling platform terrsysmp shrestha et al 2014 this approach uses an external coupler to couple three independent models an atmospheric model consortium for small scale modeling cosmo a land surface model the ncar community land model version 3 5 clm3 5 and parflow with different spatial and temporal resolutions in an integrated framework results show explicit representation of groundwater processes in terrsysmp reproduce observed heat waves statistics compared to regional climate models furusho percot et al 2022 3 challenges and future directions while the continued development of integrated hydrologic models including those that have expanded to include the domains described above provide new capabilities and opportunities for application it also continues to face and develop new challenges for their use these challenges include those related to process based representation such as the ability to upscale parameters and constitutive equations and represent spatial heterogeneities however detailing these challenges for all the processes reviewed here is beyond the scope of this paper and can be independent review papers in each discipline here we aim to discuss and reiterate some of the challenges related to the expansion of integrated hydrologic models into these other domains and bringing together models and methods from across traditional discipline boundaries and to propose potential solutions 3 1 model selection with the number of available modeling frameworks expanding the first challenge often faced by model users is selection of modeling frameworks despite the expectation that the best model for the job should be selected recent research indicates that technical considerations often do not determine what model is used instead more social aspects including familiarity with the model and interactions with others who have used the model previously are considered melsen 2022 a challenge remains to balance these social aspects of model selection with a less biased assessment of what model would best meet the objectives of the project in the supplemental document to this paper we suggest a model selection pathway that we feel balances these aspects which can provide more novice model users with guidance on model selection see supplemental information several of the aspects and challenges discussed in reference to model selection such as data availability and computational resources are further discussed in this section 3 2 data sources of uncertainty in integrated hydrologic models include uncertainty in model inputs structure parameters and observations used to constrain model parameter sets liu gupta 2007 moges et al 2021 while there are variety of techniques to address model uncertainty including approaches for calibration sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification widespread adoption of these approaches within the integrated hydrologic models remains challenging due to computational demand of methods such as the bayesian inference herrera et al 2022 kavetski et al 2006 mcmillan et al 2018 community standards training in the application of these core techniques and the development of easy to use well documented tools are still needed particularly within the integrated hydrologic model context where a one size fits all approach to model parameterization and calibration is rarely appropriate for all sub models mcmillan et al 2018 moges et al 2021 further existing uncertainty analysis techniques do not typically explicitly address structural uncertainty blöschl et al 2019 the exponential increase in and accessibility of earth system science datasets including remote sensing data distributed networked sensors and new innovations in geophysics are both an opportunity and a challenge for integrated hydrologic models on one hand integrated hydrologic models benefit from new data for assimilation parameterization and calibration e g hutchins et al 2017 as integrated hydrologic models account for multiple processes and have the ability to incorporate multiple data sets the diversity of data sets within differing spatial temporal scales and a wide range of accuracy presents a challenge however for assimilation community cyberinfrastructure and training for ensuring appropriate techniques are used for disparate datasets will be needed fer et al 2021 recent studies showed that variability in the magnitude and resolution of commonly used gridded precipitation and air temperature products for forcing integrated hydrologic models results in large uncertainty in simulated water budget in a mountainous catchment schreiner mcgraw ajami 2020 2022 therefore development of data fusion strategies are needed to create accurate climate products particularly in regions with large topographic gradients 3 3 computational needs the computational needs of integrated hydrologic models can vary significantly with model size resolution and complexity the challenges related to computing in hydrologic modeling are not new and research is constantly striving to simultaneously increase the complexity of the models and develop methods to reduce the computational demand gan et al 2018 ghorbanidehno et al 2020 zhang et al 2009 this challenge remains for integrated hydrologic models particularly as we continue to develop more complex and more integrated models to address this challenge an additional hurdle emerges the ability to modify existing models to use new computational platforms such as the recent transition to cloud computing and prior to that the transition to parallel computing this transition often requires changes to the model and solver structure which requires some expertise in computer science many groups developing the leading edge advances in integrated hydrologic models include researchers with diverse expertise required to make these transitions and it is critical to maintain this diversity as new computing capabilities and platforms emerge another method of addressing computational challenges is integration with other methods such as machine learning methods we can identify 5 potential synergies in the application of machine learning ml and integrated hydrologic models 1 integrated hydrologic models can help to identify the underlying mechanisms that give rise to patterns revealed by machine learning in observational data sets 2 patterns identified by ml can be used to parameterize calibrate and evaluate integrated hydrologic models e g kim et al 2019 tsai et al 2021 using patterns or behaviour for calibration rather than calibrating with observations directly can improve hydrologic model reliability schaefli et al 2011 3 ml can reveal patterns within integrated hydrologic model outputs many integrated hydrologic models can estimate 1000 s of variables at multiple time scales ml can be used to simplify this output e g burke et al 2021 4 ml can be used to construct emulators of computationally intensive integrated hydrologic models which can substantially expand sensitivity analysis e g fer et al 2018 5 physical theory from integrated hydrologic models can be incorporated into ml methods jiang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 sometimes referred to as physics informed ml or hybrid modeling there are many emerging approaches for augmenting physically based models with ml or using theory to guide the ml models bergen et al 2019 3 4 applicability accessibility and ease of use applicability accessibility and ease of use are intricately linked complex models that require extensive expertise and have intensive data and computational requirements are able to be used in research applications but are not often accessible beyond those in the research realm their results may be accessible but the interpretation of their results may still require extensive hydrologic knowledge recent work has pushed towards more accessible applications of the complex integrated hydrologic models including frameworks that allow for limited manipulation by users for engagement and decision making e g ewing et al 2022 jadidoleslam et al 2020 and teaching tools that simplify the hydrologic system e g gallagher et al 2021 gannon mcguire 2022 examples of these applications are limited and a challenge remains in incorporating advanced tools and state of knowledge into frameworks that are applicable and useful across the spectrum of potential users we need to work towards accessibility of state of the science to all users identifying the technical background and knowledge of the intended users and the computational and data resources required it is important to note that any one modeling framework does not have to meet the needs of all users nor do variations of every modeling framework need to be made but clear intention about the purpose of framework development is needed broadly the spectrum of models that need to be available include research focused models that are more complex and difficult to use have high computational and data requirements but will move the fundamental science and understanding forwards this includes developing models in addition to methods of incorporating different information and data types e g remotely sensed qualitative and using a variety of computational resources e g cloud parallel processing and quantum computing application based models that are used by the broader hydrologic community to address ongoing societal issues these are often commercial or open source models that still require expertise but are not as complex and intensive as research focused models to develop and run these models lag behind the research focused models but aim to keep users e g consulting government etc as up to date on proven approaches as possible teaching focused models that are simple to use and modify and computationally inexpensive with results that are easy to interpret these models focus on tools that can inform students shareholders general public anyone with an interest but limited expertise these models that are critical to effective communication and stakeholder involvement in the modeling process have shown to increase identification of interventions and model outcomes maskrey et al 2016 these models are also valuable for training and adoption of advances in hydrologic models e g gallagher et al 2021 we have not listed specific models in the categories defined above because often the same modeling framework can be applied in multiple categories depending on how they are implemented for example while parflow is a research focused model e g kollet and maxwell 2008 condon and maxwell 2013 it has also been used in teaching focused applications including the sandbox model gallagher et al 2021 in addition different variations of the same base model e g modflow harbaugh 2005 which is used extensively in application and teaching focused purposes are also used for predominantly research e g gsflow niswonger 2020 while some modeling frameworks are mostly used in one focus area such as rt flux pihm bao et al 2017 zhi et al 2022 and hydrogeosphere aquanty 2018 they are beginning to see use in other applications as these advances become more established 4 conclusions numerical models in hydrology have advanced significantly in recent decades from simplistic models of one process and component of the hydrologic cycle to advanced models integrating across several processes and components there are a wide variety of models and model combinations under development that provide the diversity of frameworks needed to cover the wide range of environments and applications to which they are applied consistent with this continued model development should seek to not converge upon one modeling approach or framework but remain diverse to meet the needs across the spectrum of users sites and objectives the challenges currently faced in model development some of which were discussed here also present opportunities to continue diverse model development through the pursuit of different paths to overcome the challenges we encourage taking this diverse approach to model advancement across three main components of development model data and platform fig 3 to advance our understanding of the processes and systems included in each model it is important to investigate them using many different modeling approaches this includes the processes included in the modeling framework model development in fig 3 and the approach of the model itself whether that is deterministic statistical etc much like the integration of different processes within one model framework we also believe that the recent advances integrating different approaches e g tsai et al 2021 are an ideal path forwards towards not only improving our understanding of the inherently complex systems we seek to represent but also improving the efficiency of the models themselves as we increase the processes and approaches used in integrated hydrologic models the data required to parameterize and calibrate them also changes in addition recent advances in sensor technology provide an opportunity to use non traditional data and data types in our model design and development this requires continued advancements in our data assimilation methods to integrate these new data types into modeling frameworks research has demonstrated that the careful integration of different data in situ and remotely sensed products into our modeling development provides significant improvements in model skill stisen et al 2011 tang et al 2019 and we believe that there is significant potential to improve them further computational resources and platforms used for integrated hydrologic models continue to advance and evolve the accessibility of these resources from cloud to high performance and quantum computing provides opportunities across the spectrum of model users for example for educational and training purposes web based models can be used to allow users to modify model scenarios and experiment with the model and results yet are readily accessible and can be easy to use conversely while high performance computing systems are not readily available and accessible to most users the large scale complex models developed for research purposes are often best developed using these platforms for efficiency developing a diversity of modeling frameworks that operate across the spectrum of computational resources will help advance hydrologic sciences for all users we feel inclusion and diversity is the future of integrated hydrologic modeling not only in developing new modeling frameworks but also in the developers and users of these models there is room for a multitude of modeling frameworks including those not currently in use in hydrologic science and by diversifying the model data and computational platforms we are allowing for the greatest opportunities for advancement in

1969,over the past several decades hydrologic models have advanced from independent models of the surface and subsurface to integrated models that can capture the terrestrial hydrologic cycle within one framework in recent years these coupled frameworks have seen the inclusion of biogeochemical processes ecohydrology sedimentation and erosion cold region hydrology anthropogenic activities and atmospheric processes this expansion is the result of increased computational data and modeling capabilities and capacities as well as improved understanding of the processes that drive these integrated systems here we review these recent advances to integrate new processes and systems into existing terrestrial hydrologic models and highlight the significant challenges and opportunities that remain we identify that with so many models currently available and in development selecting the most appropriate model is difficult and we suggest a path for new or novice modelers to find the most appropriate code based on their needs in addition data required to parameterize and calibrate these models can often constrain their applicability and usefulness however advances in environmental sensors and measurement technology in addition to data assimilation of non traditional data e g remote sensing qualitative data are providing new ways of addressing this issue as we expand hydrologic models to integrate more processes and systems our computational demands also increase recent and emerging advances in computational platforms including cloud and quantum computing in addition to the use of machine learning to capture some processes will continue to support the use of increasingly larger and more complex process based models finally we highlight that it is critical to develop state of the science models that are accessible to all model users not just those applied for research and development we encourage continued development of diverse modeling platforms considering the user needs data availability and computational resources data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water is an integral part of all systems and processes in our natural and anthropogenic environments water sustains life and supports our quality of life and maintaining both requires the ability to quantify simulate and predict water resources and the impact of water management strategies into the future early efforts to simulate and predict the distribution and quality of water resources were compartmentalized into components of the hydrologic cycle e g surface water groundwater snow and evapotranspiration and or processes e g geochemical reactions precipitation dissolution overland flow vegetation water use and response to water availability with increased understanding of terrestrial hydrologic processes and computational capacity recent efforts have integrated many of these components and processes in a single computational modeling framework to improve representation of the hydrologic cycle one such advance is the integration of surface and subsurface hydrologic flow and transport processes which improved representation of the terrestrial water cycle these physically based integrated models can take many different forms but generally couple a representation of richards equation for variably saturated subsurface flow with a version of the st venant s equation for surface flow aquanty inc 2018 brunner simmons 2012 kollet et al 2017 kollet maxwell 2008 maxwell et al 2014 these equations are then coupled or integrated using one of several different techniques in general the term fully integrated is used to differentiate those models that allow for simultaneous solution of the surface and subsurface equations whereas the terms integrated or coupled is used to indicate models that iterate between solutions of the surface and subsurface furman 2008 the connection between the surface and subsurface can also take many forms including a first order exchange flux term that is similar to the darcy flux and the common or equilibrium based approach where the surface and subsurface nodes that connect the two regimes are identical aquanty inc 2018 liggett et al 2012 due to the integration of discrete surface and subsurface flow equations these models also require spin up simulations to provide initial conditions that can be appropriately solved during further calibration or simulation runs ajami et al 2014 several reviews and model intercomparison studies of these integrated hydrologic models have been completed in recent years e g fan et al 2019 maxwell et al 2014 and the use of these models has evolved to applications that include informing policy and management decisions and guiding remediation and preventative efforts e g brookfield gnau 2016 brookfield layzell 2019 thatch et al 2020 here we build upon these reviews and comparisons reviewing recent expansion from the integrated hydrologic models representing the surface subsurface hydrologic system to include biogeochemistry erosion and sediment transport ecohydrology anthropogenic activities cold region hydrology and atmospheric processes that influence the global hydrologic cycle fig 1 specifically we focus this review on the expansion of integrated hydrologic models that include 1 biogeochemistry moving beyond basic solute transport to include representation of reactive processes such as complexation precipitation and dissolution redox processes microbial processes and isotopic fractionation 2 sediment and erosion inclusion of some or all of the sediment budget within study regions such as fluvial erosion streambank stability and depositional processes 3 ecohydrology representation of vegetation dynamics including growth and mortality and disturbances including wildfire and invasive species that influence water and energy fluxes 4 anthropogenic activities inclusion of human activities that directly impact the hydrologic system such as reservoir and dam operation groundwater extraction surface water diversion and irrigation 5 cold region hydrology representation of processes and systems related to snow and ice including accumulation vapor loss melt and permafrost 6 atmospheric processes expanding representation of the hydrologic cycle beyond the terrestrial system including interactions between surface and subsurface hydrologic conditions to local and regional weather patterns and climate due to the prolific development of modeling approaches and applications it is not possible to comprehensively include all specific modeling frameworks and advances in these areas the goal is to present examples of emerging concepts and techniques in order to provide a broad and robust overview of the expansion of integrated hydrologic models and an assessment of ongoing challenges and future directions for further development we expand on the ongoing challenge of model selection which was recently highlighted by melsen 2022 to discuss selecting a model based on a particular objective and data availability the scope of this work includes a review of the recent expansion of existing integrated hydrologic models to include domains beyond surface water and groundwater systems as well as innovations in application of these tools for water resources management it is equally important to develop methods of identifying what simplifications can be made for any particular application to increase the efficiency and useability as it is to develop complex models capable of simulating more processes and systems while this work focuses on recent advances made with process based numerical models we highlight ongoing and emerging research using machine learning approaches in conjunction with process based models leading to the development of hybrid models 2 recent expansion of integrated hydrologic models as previously discussed significant advances in integrated hydrologic models that simulate the terrestrial water system have been made in recent years including expansion beyond water and solute movement across the surface and subsurface here we identify and review this expansion of integrated hydrologic models into other domains fig 1 2 1 chemistry biochemistry geochemistry a myriad of biogeochemical processes control the production fate and transport of solutes and carbon from watersheds tracking how land cover climate and disturbance impacts solute production and mobility has important implications for water security and critical zone function the critical zone stretches from the top of the canopy down to the depths of circulating groundwater anderson et al 2007 brantley et al 2007 condon et al 2020 council 2000 and is intricately intertwined with the terrestrial hydrologic cycle singha navarre sitchler 2022 sullivan et al in revision reactive transport models rtms are numerical representations of biogeochemical reaction processes such as respiration or carbonate weathering that allow us to understand how external drivers e g meteoric precipitation interact with the internal structure of the critical zone duffy et al 2014 li 2019 li et al 2017a li et al 2017b li et al 2021 sullivan et al 2020 given the numerous processes that may be represented the dimensionality required to capture these interactions e g 1d 3d and the timescales of interest a diversity of rtms have emerged over the recent decades with varying degrees of integration with hydrologic models at the most basic level is the one way coupling between either complex physically based spatially explicit hydrologic models e g flux pihm bao et al 2017 or simpler lumped parameter models hbv bergström 1995 bergström lindström 2015 to geochemical box models e g witch weathering at the catchment scale goddéris et al 2006 here the hydrologic model passes soil moisture and water fluxes to the rtm to simulate biogeochemical reactions and thus processes such as mineral dissolution precipitation and solute generation and transport e g sullivan et al 2019 one advantage of this approach is it simplifies the computational demand for tuning the rtm and allows the end user to focus on the degree of reaction complexity that they will choose to include if the goal of the numerical simulations is to understand how changes in the solid phase let say the dissolution of minerals impact the generation of porosity and augments the permeability then fully integrated models are needed crunchtope or crunchflow steefel 2009 is a widely used rt code that solves for saturated flow i e darcy flux while allowing reactions to influence the solid phase crunchtope is capable of representing a detailed distribution of soil and rock properties in the subsurface and has been used to simulate the long term evolution of the subsurface under averaged hydroclimatic conditions wen et al 2021 xiao et al 2021 moving out of solely saturated conditions there are codes such as min3p and pflowtran that can solve for variably saturated conditions in the 3 d tetrahedral mesh lichtner et al 2015 mayer et al 2002 su et al 2021 and even include processes such as dynamic root architecture thus our ability to represent critical zone processes and numerically explore how it responds to the shifts in the hydrologic cycle is strengthening one limitation in rtms is their integration into spatially explicit watershed scale hydrologic models while some models do exist the lack of spatially explicit information on soil mineralogy and biotic processes limits the degree to which these models can be applied one such watershed scale model is biort flux pihm which can simulate interactions between land surface watershed hydrology and reactive transport at a variety of temporal scales bao et al 2017 these watershed scale models integrate watershed characteristics such as topography vegetation and temporal hydroclimatic variations and have some representation of subsurface structure to allow for predictions of precipitation dissolution reactions in addition to carbon dynamics li 2019 xu et al 2022 zhi et al 2019 2022 but unlike the capabilities in crunchtope that can update the solid phase distribution and thus porosity and permeability these spatially explicit models must first be paused and new parameters assigned to understand how changes in the subsurface could alter hydrologic and therefore biogeochemical fluxes to this end some integrated hydrologic models have begun to include reactive transport moulton et al 2015 usman munir frei 2021 z xu et al 2022 while these developments have limited reaction pathways and or the limited hydrologic conditions e g saturated vs variably saturated they are one manner by which rtms are growing to be more fully integrated in large watershed and even regional scale models recent advances in rtms allow for the heterogeneous and dynamic nature of the critical zone to be better represented in numerical experiments for example geologic heterogeneity can lead to complex and variable fluid flow dynamics and thus solute transport creating challenges in our ability to predict geochemical processes e g navarre sitchler jung 2017 wen li 2017 efforts are underway to understand the discrepancies between laboratory and field based dissolution rates that arise from differences in physical heterogeneity by providing correction factors to linear transition state theory hyman et al 2022 elucidating the propagation of reaction fronts through fracture networks andrews navarre sitchler 2021 and developing rate laws that account for the overall degree of spatial heterogeneity in the domain wen li 2017 2018 advances in our understanding of isotope chemistry are now emerging as reaction capabilities within rtms particularly crunchtope here the isotopic composition of both fluid and solid phase shed light on the dominant controls of reactions e g spatial variability in microbial growth order of rate laws and dominance of kinetic vs equilibrium fractionation druhan et al 2012 druhan et al 2013 druhan et al 2014 modeled isotopic signatures are improving our understanding of the interaction between critical zone structure and function for example 1 multiple fractionation pathways and flexible transit time distributions are necessary to capture intra site variability in silica stream water concentrations fernandez et al 2022 2 a fairly rapid supply of fresh bedrock is required to reproduce the parabolic shape between dissolved lithium and weathering intensity observed in global data winnick et al 2022 and 3 unraveling the critical zone s past e g changes in climate and vegetation recorded in speleothems is possible through the modeling of stable and radio carbon isotope data druhan et al 2021 by including root exudation processes into crunchtope rewtcrunch roque malo et al 2022 it is now also possible to vertically resolve root soil microbe water interaction and their influence on solute fluxes at a daily time scale overall the development of rtms allows us to explore both the impacts of the anthropocene on critical zone function kumar et al 2018 sullivan et al 2022 and to elucidate how long term changes in earth s atmosphere has controlled weathering rates goddéris et al 2010 maher et al 2009 moore et al 2012 we can now explore how changes in land cover influence stream water chemistry wen et al 2021 how variations and hydrologic connectivity influence the export of dissolved organic carbon to streams wen et al 2020 and the impact of changing climate on solute export across environments of varying subsurface heterogeneity wen et al 2022 2 2 sediment and erosion accurate representation of streamflow generation processes and near surface hydrologic dynamics impact the overall sediment budget of a catchment and are important for understanding sediment transport processes heppner et al 2006 huang niemann 2008 many empirical and physically based models have been developed to simulate erosion and sediment transport processes with various levels of complexity and data requirement merritt et al 2003 while application of empirical models such as the universal soil loss equation is preferred due to a smaller number of parameters these models assume that watershed properties are stationary zi et al 2019 physically based models implement various formulations to represent detachment transport and deposition processes and use different model structures for representing hydrologic processes with the exception of few models such as geotopsed zi et al 2016 tribs ofm kim et al 2012 and inhm heppner et al 2006 many erosion and sediment transport models simplify representation of subsurface hydrologic processes due to differences in temporal and spatial scales of the phenomena and computational demand of solving surface water groundwater equations simultaneously francipane et al 2012 existing coupled surface water groundwater sediment transport models either simplify surface water groundwater coupling by using the first order exchange coefficient approach e g integrated hydrology model inhm heppner et al 2006 reducing subsurface heterogeneity by using soil classes and geological layers parallel to bedrock e g geotopsed zi et al 2016 or simplifying vadose zone and groundwater processes by using a gravity dominated formulation and the boussinesq s equation under the dupuit forchheimer assumptions respectively e g tribs ofm kim et al 2012 and tribs erosion francipane et al 2012 physically based integrated hydrologic models such as parflow clm kollet maxwell 2008 maxwell miller 2005 that simulate the terrestrial hydrologic cycle as a continuous system by solving the 3d richards equation over the entire subsurface and has a fully integrated overland flow simulator and a land surface model clm 3 0 dai et al 2003 to solve water and energy budgets at the land surface are valuable tools for integrating erosion and sediment transport processes the integrated hydrologic model hydrogeosphere hgs aquanty inc 2018 brunner simmons 2012 hwang et al 2014 which also simulates the terrestrial hydrologic cycle as a continuous system has been coupled to surface water operations model oasis hydrologics 2009 and was developed to solve for fluvial erosion using the excess shear stress approach brookfield layzell 2019 and is linked to a streambank stability module wei 2022 despite these advances inclusion or integration of sedimentation and or erosion processes into integrated hydrologic models remains limited and computationally challenging as changes in land surface elevation due to erosion or deposition processes can lead to numerical instability for continuous simulations 2 3 ecohydrology transpiration accounts for roughly 70 of precipitated water although this proportion varies dramatically with space and time jasechko et al 2013 given the importance of transpiration most hydrologic models consider the direct impact of vegetation on evapotranspiration in simple conceptual hydrologic models vegetation may be implicitly represented as a parameter but in some integrated hydrologic models vegetation is explicitly represented via a combination of parameters and submodels fatichi et al 2016a that can include transpiration partitioning maxwell condon 2016 these submodels generally account for vegetation s direct control on transpiration and indirect influences on evaporation soil moisture and snow accumulation and melt via canopy interception and shading but vary substantially in terms of the inclusion of other coupled ecological processes see reviews in brewer et al 2018 fatichi et al 2016a climate change is expected to alter not only vegetation function water use but to accelerate changes to vegetation composition and structure size density rooting depths heights etc hauser et al 2021 mcdowell et al 2022 as well as disturbances e g fire disease seidl et al 2017 disturbance driven changes in species are also expected to intensify with climate change e g serra diaz et al 2018 these changes to vegetation structure and function will have substantial hydrologic impacts e g mankin et al 2019 and thus there is a growing need to represent vegetation growth mortality community change and response to disturbances including fire in many integrated hydrologic model applications models of ecohydrology vary along several dimensions fatichi et al 2016a the realism of the relationship between vegetation structure and radiative forcing varies from simple submodels such as beer s law with a leaf area index to complex submodels where tree spacing and gaps height overstory understory and or sunlit and shade leaves are accounted for in estimates of the radiative forcing of plant transpiration bonan et al 2021 plant hydraulics or how plants mediate the flux of water from soil to atmosphere similarly vary from simple models of stomatal conductance to models that track vertical and horizontal root distributions stem conductance and more complex stomatal physiology e g javaux et al 2008 2013 lin et al 2019 trugman et al 2019 ecohydrology models also vary in how they account for changes in vegetation structure and composition through time including changes that are coupled with hydrologic conditions e g declines in leaf area with drought e g garcia et al 2016 ecohydrology models that couple hydrologic models with carbon and nutrient cycling to grow vegetation have been available for decades and used within the land surface submodels in general circulation models gcms or earth system models these coupled carbon hydrology models represent incremental changes to parameters that are relevant to hydrology such as height root depth and leaf area with variation in the availability of light water and nutrients arora 2002 more recently coupled models that represent disturbances such as fire and disease are available seidl et al 2017 these models can account for how climate drivers including drought alter the probability and severity of disturbances such as fire and disease that have dramatic consequences for vegetation e g hanan et al 2021 and ultimately hydrology e g ren et al 2021 similarly several recent terrestrial biosphere models account for shifts in species distributions with climate fisher et al 2022 although the representation of hydrologic processes in these models remains limited considering not only species differences but also between species interactions can have important hydrologic consequences pretzsch et al 2015 but this level of plant ecosystem complexity is rarely included in hydrologic models for hydrologic models that resolve channel flow ecohydrology includes the impact of riparian vegetation on hydrodynamics e g effects of vegetation on fluid flow and morphodynamics including vegetation impacts on change in channel structure itself camporeale et al 2013 marjoribanks et al 2014 the representation of vegetation change in hydrodynamic models is generally less well developed relative to coupled ecohydrology models used in the terrestrial environments approaches for accounting for in stream vegetation impacts range from simple roughness parameters to models that represent changes in riparian vegetation communities as a function of hydrologic conditions camporeale et al 2013 similarly modeling within channel biogeochemistry including hyporheic flow and exchanges has advanced in recent years but these models of within stream and river ecological processes are rarely included in models that account for both upland and within river flows jan et al 2021 finally the impact of human intervention on vegetation can be significant both simple and complex ecohydrology models typically represent human intervention as an external forcing e g prescribed land cover change irrigation fuel treatments etc wagner et al 2019 yalew et al 2018 2 4 anthropogenic activities humans modify the terrestrial hydrologic cycle in numerous ways including construction and operation of dams and reservoirs surface water diversions groundwater extraction irrigation and land use change including urbanization within the last millennium 75 of earth s land surface has been modified by human activities luyssaert et al 2014 these modifications can substantially alter infiltration capacity via impermeable surfaces and changes in evapotranspiration by altering the type density and distribution of vegetation some processes related to these modifications have been included in hydrologic models for decades including groundwater pumping and land use change yet challenges remain for groundwater pumping the inclusion of numerous discrete groundwater wells and variable pumping rates common in agricultural regions remains numerically challenging the representation of land use change is challenged by the variety of ways it can impact the hydrologic system including changes to evapotranspiration due to changes in vegetation see ecohydrology and local scale routing of water in urban environments due to the construction of impermeable surfaces and water collection and distribution systems e g storm water management integrated hydrologic models that simulate the terrestrial water cycle e g parflow kollet maxwell 2006 hgs aquanty inc 2018 gsflow markstrom et al 2008 were originally developed to simulate natural hydrologic systems with limited abilities to incorporate anthropogenic activities almost all watersheds have anthropogenic activities and impacts therefore including these processes is critical for proper representation of the hydrologic conditions in addition these models are increasingly being used for integrated water management planning which also requires inclusion of the anthropogenic water uses and management infrastructure for proper assessment in response integrated hydrologic models have advanced to better include the interactions between humans and the terrestrial water system however one of the biggest challenges in integrated hydrologic model application is limited data availability of human water use e g groundwater pumping canal deliveries more recently a number of packages have been integrated into hydrologic models to capture anthropogenic activities building upon existing frameworks that capture groundwater and surface water pumping modules were developed to capture irrigation application including variability in evapotranspiration and infiltration often termed irrigation return flow due to irrigation strategy e g flood irrigation center pivot subsurface drip and water rights structure e g kitlasten et al 2021 these modules include specific agricultural packages for gsflow niswonger 2020 and processes integrated directly into the integrated hydrologic modeling codes such as parflow and hydrogeosphere aquanty inc 2018 condon maxwell 2013 hydrologic modeling in urban settings is particularly challenging due to the high resolution and spatial complexity of urban land cover salvadore et al 2015 flow networks in urban environments are also complex and hydrologic models applied to urban areas e g swmm niazi et al 2017 include submodels that integrate storm sewer networks green infrastructure and stormwater control measures scms and differentiate between connected and disconnected impervious areas e g bell et al 2019 high resolution data is increasingly available for urban areas and assimilation of this data is expected to improve hydrologic modeling hutchins et al 2017 the high spatial resolution required to account for these changes to flow networks can be a barrier for regional scale ihms application golden hoghooghi 2018 however fine scale hydrologic model applications can be used to derive parameters based on land use classification e g high density urban suburban to support larger scale application e g shields tague 2015 many codes are modified to include methods of integrating reservoirs canals pipe networks and other water storage and distribution systems into the hydrologic models while natural processes and physical conditions can constrain operation of these engineered structures the distribution of water is dictated by human decisions regulations and policies integrating these non physics based operations into an integrated hydrologic modeling framework often requires coupling to other existing models that use rule based optimization strategies e g brookfield et al 2017 morway et al 2016 or incorporating often inflexible boundary conditions based on historic operations a significant drawback of the latter approach is that operations cannot be easily adapted for future scenarios as opposed to the former which has operational structures built into the coupled model 2 5 cold region processes snow dominated headwaters provide water resources to 1 6th the world s population barnett et al 2005 and support ecologic and social economic services immerzeel et al 2021 cold regions are considered especially vulnerable to climate change milly dunne 2020 portner et al 2019 with low land dependence on these snow water resources expected to increase in the near future viviroli et al 2020 the amount and timing of snow and glacial melt are critical to hydrologic processes related to transpiration knowles et al 2018 parida buermann 2014 recharge carroll et al 2019 godsey et al 2014 meixner et al 2016 and streamflow generation hammond et al 2018 d li et al 2017a millan et al 2022 likewise snow and ice loss and permafrost degradation have important implications on biogeochemical reactions trace gas release and riverine export of organic matter inorganic nutrients and major ions broadbent et al 2021 frey mcclelland 2009 jafarov et al 2018 milner et al 2017 miner et al 2021 pongracz et al 2021 snow and ice cover also play an important role in weather and climate through surface albedo sublimation sensible heat exchange with the lower atmosphere and insulation of soil by snow clark serreze 2000 lo clark 2002 l xu dirmeyer 2011 the interactions of snow and ice across atmospheric hydrologic ecologic and biogeochemical subcomponents is further complicated by the scale dependence of snow processes bales et al 2006 broxton et al 2015 clark et al 2011 deems et al 2006 mott et al 2018 tennant et al 2017 as a result representation of snow and ice dynamics in integrated hydrologic models remains a major challenge as a consequence classic representations of snow processes in hydrologic models have relied on relatively simple temperature index approaches that correlate snowmelt to air temperature e g martinec 1975 these empirical relationships are most often associated with glacial applications snowmelt in open sites and operational forecasting kumar et al 2014 with recent models incorporating wind speed vapor pressure and radiation into the approach li williams 2008 more accurate representation of cold region hydrology must describe the distributed water and energy balance between the atmosphere and land surface clark et al 2015 shrestha et al 2015 modeling approaches that account for water and energy distributions across space tend to also account for their vertical distribution in the snowpack some integrated hydrologic models use only two snowpack layers to account for radiant convective and conductive exchanges e g gsflow while others are more finely resolved e g parflow clm these modeling approaches are largely based on the parameterization of individual processes related to albedo snow compaction turbulent and radiant energy transfer chen et al 2014 kumar et al 2013 magnusson et al 2015 representation of wind redistribution e g liston elder 2006 remains a significant challenge zhou et al 2021 and is rarely included directly in integrated hydrologic models due to computational expense and lack of process understanding however the redistribution of snow is potentially important in capturing the amount and timing of snowmelt with significant ramifications on the water budget as a consequence several hydrological studies have corrected precipitation inputs to account for preferential distribution using airborne lidar mapping of snowpack carroll et al 2019 lahmers et al 2022 satellite derived data assimilation strategies bennett et al 2019 or accounting for topographic effects on gravitational and wind transport of snow freudiger et al 2017 representation of permafrost processes in earth system models have advanced in recent years but there remains significant uncertainty and variation in how model representations account for freeze thaw processes and how released melt water moves through the subsurface to rivers andresen et al 2020 more detailed representations of permafrost hydrology are available and these approaches provide more accurate estimates of permafrost change on river flow and chemistry e g cold regions hydrological modelling platform crhm pomeroy et al 2007 advance terrestrial simulator ats painter et al 2016 however strategies are needed to integrate learning from these data intensive permafrost models into integrated hydrologic models krogh pomeroy 2021 2 6 atmospheric processes atmospheric processes control the weather short term conditions and climate long term conditions and are critical drivers of the hydrologic cycle governing the hydrologic and energy fluxes between the air and land surface most hydrologic models include weather related parameters such as precipitation and potential evapotranspiration in early hydrologic models the weather conditions were included as a boundary condition with prescribed precipitation and potential evapotranspiration these models advanced to include algorithms and models that calculated actual evapotranspiration based on both weather and hydrologic conditions and subsequently to actual weather and climate models that provided one way and two way feedback to the hydrologic model davison et al 2015 2018 maxwell et al 2007 maxwell condon 2016 sorooshian et al 2008 zhang et al 2009 the treatment of atmospheric conditions varied between surface water and groundwater models where the direct link to weather was included earlier in the surface water models e g benoit et al 2000 walko et al 2000 compared to groundwater models e g york et al 2002 groundwater models traditionally prescribed recharge fluxes that are often indirectly attributable to mean weather conditions e g maxey eakin 1949 this is likely due to the direct connection between the land and atmosphere compared to a more in direct connection to the subsurface in the frameworks that integrate atmospheric and hydrologic models computational difficulties arise from the complexity of the processes included and the mismatch between the spatio temporal resolution and scales between the two model types davison et al 2018 fatichi et al 2016b maxwell et al 2011 the domain required to simulate weather climate is significantly larger than that required for terrestrial hydrology and associated cell sizes also have significant mismatch this is driven by the relatively fast rates of atmospheric processes in comparison to slower rates of the surface water domain and even slower rates of the groundwater domain approaches to address these issues include coupling existing models of each system such as in the terrestrial systems modeling platform terrsysmp shrestha et al 2014 this approach uses an external coupler to couple three independent models an atmospheric model consortium for small scale modeling cosmo a land surface model the ncar community land model version 3 5 clm3 5 and parflow with different spatial and temporal resolutions in an integrated framework results show explicit representation of groundwater processes in terrsysmp reproduce observed heat waves statistics compared to regional climate models furusho percot et al 2022 3 challenges and future directions while the continued development of integrated hydrologic models including those that have expanded to include the domains described above provide new capabilities and opportunities for application it also continues to face and develop new challenges for their use these challenges include those related to process based representation such as the ability to upscale parameters and constitutive equations and represent spatial heterogeneities however detailing these challenges for all the processes reviewed here is beyond the scope of this paper and can be independent review papers in each discipline here we aim to discuss and reiterate some of the challenges related to the expansion of integrated hydrologic models into these other domains and bringing together models and methods from across traditional discipline boundaries and to propose potential solutions 3 1 model selection with the number of available modeling frameworks expanding the first challenge often faced by model users is selection of modeling frameworks despite the expectation that the best model for the job should be selected recent research indicates that technical considerations often do not determine what model is used instead more social aspects including familiarity with the model and interactions with others who have used the model previously are considered melsen 2022 a challenge remains to balance these social aspects of model selection with a less biased assessment of what model would best meet the objectives of the project in the supplemental document to this paper we suggest a model selection pathway that we feel balances these aspects which can provide more novice model users with guidance on model selection see supplemental information several of the aspects and challenges discussed in reference to model selection such as data availability and computational resources are further discussed in this section 3 2 data sources of uncertainty in integrated hydrologic models include uncertainty in model inputs structure parameters and observations used to constrain model parameter sets liu gupta 2007 moges et al 2021 while there are variety of techniques to address model uncertainty including approaches for calibration sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification widespread adoption of these approaches within the integrated hydrologic models remains challenging due to computational demand of methods such as the bayesian inference herrera et al 2022 kavetski et al 2006 mcmillan et al 2018 community standards training in the application of these core techniques and the development of easy to use well documented tools are still needed particularly within the integrated hydrologic model context where a one size fits all approach to model parameterization and calibration is rarely appropriate for all sub models mcmillan et al 2018 moges et al 2021 further existing uncertainty analysis techniques do not typically explicitly address structural uncertainty blöschl et al 2019 the exponential increase in and accessibility of earth system science datasets including remote sensing data distributed networked sensors and new innovations in geophysics are both an opportunity and a challenge for integrated hydrologic models on one hand integrated hydrologic models benefit from new data for assimilation parameterization and calibration e g hutchins et al 2017 as integrated hydrologic models account for multiple processes and have the ability to incorporate multiple data sets the diversity of data sets within differing spatial temporal scales and a wide range of accuracy presents a challenge however for assimilation community cyberinfrastructure and training for ensuring appropriate techniques are used for disparate datasets will be needed fer et al 2021 recent studies showed that variability in the magnitude and resolution of commonly used gridded precipitation and air temperature products for forcing integrated hydrologic models results in large uncertainty in simulated water budget in a mountainous catchment schreiner mcgraw ajami 2020 2022 therefore development of data fusion strategies are needed to create accurate climate products particularly in regions with large topographic gradients 3 3 computational needs the computational needs of integrated hydrologic models can vary significantly with model size resolution and complexity the challenges related to computing in hydrologic modeling are not new and research is constantly striving to simultaneously increase the complexity of the models and develop methods to reduce the computational demand gan et al 2018 ghorbanidehno et al 2020 zhang et al 2009 this challenge remains for integrated hydrologic models particularly as we continue to develop more complex and more integrated models to address this challenge an additional hurdle emerges the ability to modify existing models to use new computational platforms such as the recent transition to cloud computing and prior to that the transition to parallel computing this transition often requires changes to the model and solver structure which requires some expertise in computer science many groups developing the leading edge advances in integrated hydrologic models include researchers with diverse expertise required to make these transitions and it is critical to maintain this diversity as new computing capabilities and platforms emerge another method of addressing computational challenges is integration with other methods such as machine learning methods we can identify 5 potential synergies in the application of machine learning ml and integrated hydrologic models 1 integrated hydrologic models can help to identify the underlying mechanisms that give rise to patterns revealed by machine learning in observational data sets 2 patterns identified by ml can be used to parameterize calibrate and evaluate integrated hydrologic models e g kim et al 2019 tsai et al 2021 using patterns or behaviour for calibration rather than calibrating with observations directly can improve hydrologic model reliability schaefli et al 2011 3 ml can reveal patterns within integrated hydrologic model outputs many integrated hydrologic models can estimate 1000 s of variables at multiple time scales ml can be used to simplify this output e g burke et al 2021 4 ml can be used to construct emulators of computationally intensive integrated hydrologic models which can substantially expand sensitivity analysis e g fer et al 2018 5 physical theory from integrated hydrologic models can be incorporated into ml methods jiang et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 sometimes referred to as physics informed ml or hybrid modeling there are many emerging approaches for augmenting physically based models with ml or using theory to guide the ml models bergen et al 2019 3 4 applicability accessibility and ease of use applicability accessibility and ease of use are intricately linked complex models that require extensive expertise and have intensive data and computational requirements are able to be used in research applications but are not often accessible beyond those in the research realm their results may be accessible but the interpretation of their results may still require extensive hydrologic knowledge recent work has pushed towards more accessible applications of the complex integrated hydrologic models including frameworks that allow for limited manipulation by users for engagement and decision making e g ewing et al 2022 jadidoleslam et al 2020 and teaching tools that simplify the hydrologic system e g gallagher et al 2021 gannon mcguire 2022 examples of these applications are limited and a challenge remains in incorporating advanced tools and state of knowledge into frameworks that are applicable and useful across the spectrum of potential users we need to work towards accessibility of state of the science to all users identifying the technical background and knowledge of the intended users and the computational and data resources required it is important to note that any one modeling framework does not have to meet the needs of all users nor do variations of every modeling framework need to be made but clear intention about the purpose of framework development is needed broadly the spectrum of models that need to be available include research focused models that are more complex and difficult to use have high computational and data requirements but will move the fundamental science and understanding forwards this includes developing models in addition to methods of incorporating different information and data types e g remotely sensed qualitative and using a variety of computational resources e g cloud parallel processing and quantum computing application based models that are used by the broader hydrologic community to address ongoing societal issues these are often commercial or open source models that still require expertise but are not as complex and intensive as research focused models to develop and run these models lag behind the research focused models but aim to keep users e g consulting government etc as up to date on proven approaches as possible teaching focused models that are simple to use and modify and computationally inexpensive with results that are easy to interpret these models focus on tools that can inform students shareholders general public anyone with an interest but limited expertise these models that are critical to effective communication and stakeholder involvement in the modeling process have shown to increase identification of interventions and model outcomes maskrey et al 2016 these models are also valuable for training and adoption of advances in hydrologic models e g gallagher et al 2021 we have not listed specific models in the categories defined above because often the same modeling framework can be applied in multiple categories depending on how they are implemented for example while parflow is a research focused model e g kollet and maxwell 2008 condon and maxwell 2013 it has also been used in teaching focused applications including the sandbox model gallagher et al 2021 in addition different variations of the same base model e g modflow harbaugh 2005 which is used extensively in application and teaching focused purposes are also used for predominantly research e g gsflow niswonger 2020 while some modeling frameworks are mostly used in one focus area such as rt flux pihm bao et al 2017 zhi et al 2022 and hydrogeosphere aquanty 2018 they are beginning to see use in other applications as these advances become more established 4 conclusions numerical models in hydrology have advanced significantly in recent decades from simplistic models of one process and component of the hydrologic cycle to advanced models integrating across several processes and components there are a wide variety of models and model combinations under development that provide the diversity of frameworks needed to cover the wide range of environments and applications to which they are applied consistent with this continued model development should seek to not converge upon one modeling approach or framework but remain diverse to meet the needs across the spectrum of users sites and objectives the challenges currently faced in model development some of which were discussed here also present opportunities to continue diverse model development through the pursuit of different paths to overcome the challenges we encourage taking this diverse approach to model advancement across three main components of development model data and platform fig 3 to advance our understanding of the processes and systems included in each model it is important to investigate them using many different modeling approaches this includes the processes included in the modeling framework model development in fig 3 and the approach of the model itself whether that is deterministic statistical etc much like the integration of different processes within one model framework we also believe that the recent advances integrating different approaches e g tsai et al 2021 are an ideal path forwards towards not only improving our understanding of the inherently complex systems we seek to represent but also improving the efficiency of the models themselves as we increase the processes and approaches used in integrated hydrologic models the data required to parameterize and calibrate them also changes in addition recent advances in sensor technology provide an opportunity to use non traditional data and data types in our model design and development this requires continued advancements in our data assimilation methods to integrate these new data types into modeling frameworks research has demonstrated that the careful integration of different data in situ and remotely sensed products into our modeling development provides significant improvements in model skill stisen et al 2011 tang et al 2019 and we believe that there is significant potential to improve them further computational resources and platforms used for integrated hydrologic models continue to advance and evolve the accessibility of these resources from cloud to high performance and quantum computing provides opportunities across the spectrum of model users for example for educational and training purposes web based models can be used to allow users to modify model scenarios and experiment with the model and results yet are readily accessible and can be easy to use conversely while high performance computing systems are not readily available and accessible to most users the large scale complex models developed for research purposes are often best developed using these platforms for efficiency developing a diversity of modeling frameworks that operate across the spectrum of computational resources will help advance hydrologic sciences for all users we feel inclusion and diversity is the future of integrated hydrologic modeling not only in developing new modeling frameworks but also in the developers and users of these models there is room for a multitude of modeling frameworks including those not currently in use in hydrologic science and by diversifying the model data and computational platforms we are allowing for the greatest opportunities for advancement in
