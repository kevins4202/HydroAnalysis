3975,increasing urban flood posed serious threat to urban safety and sustainable development and resulted in great loss and damage it was significant and indispensable to master the potential change of urban flood for flood risk mitigation and adaption floods not merely caused the physical losses but also led to potential damage and harm during flood risk propagation studies have mainly focused on the physical features of flood risk and post disaster reconstruction while few have discussed the potential risk consequence considering flood risk propagation therefore this study analyzed flood risk propagation based on modified susceptible infected recovered sir model we performed flood simulation and modelling mapped urban flood risk in consideration of flood risk propagation and estimated flood losses in nanjing with flood return periods of 5 10 20 50 and 100 years results indicated that inundated area occupied 517 19 654 11 657 92 834 49 and 1045 80 km2 with return periods from 5 to 100 years respectively jianye district showed high flood risk and it was suggested to protect people s lives and assets to reduce susceptibility and vulnerability and enhance urban drainage capacity for recovery improvement moreover total economic losses reached 27 85 30 89 32 91 35 50 and 38 55 billion and led to the 14 38 15 94 15 94 18 32 and 19 90 gdp loss rate respectively this study could support the effective flood risk mitigation practice for adaptive urban development keyword urban flood risk flood risk propagation susceptible infected recovered model flood simulation and modelling flood losses estimation 1 introduction flood disasters become one of the most common natural disasters and pose the serious threat around the world mai et al 2020 over the last twenty years flood events have shown significant increase in frequency and intensity de koning et al 2019 kotzee and reyers 2016 thanvisitthpon et al 2020 and account for 47 in natural disasters rios 2015 severe urban flood not only causes the casualty and deterioration in human society but also leads to considerable losses guo et al 2020 with population and asset mainly concentrated on urban areas the inevitable urban flood badly affects both developed and developing countries bertilsson et al 2019 due to climate change cities are becoming more exposed to flood and losses caused by floods are expected to greatly increase in urban areas de silva and kawasaki 2020 furthermore disaster projection indicates that flood of a given return period within historical reference interval would be likely more frequent and intense in the future especially in china kundzewicz et al 2019 therefore it is indispensable to comprehend how to live with urban flood and mitigate flood risk for sustainable development in cities laeni et al 2019 future evolution of urban flood remains an unresolved issue wu et al 2017 to predict and understand the change flood simulation and modelling are incorporated in urban flood risk management as an effective tool and provide helpful information about local floods characteristics which have developed rapidly in the field of hydrology wang et al 2019 flood simulation and modelling could be classified based on dimensionality spatial extent and mathematical complexity though there is no homogeneity in classification approach nkwunonwo et al 2020 in dimensionality flood simulation and modelling include one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d and three dimensional flood 3d model despite the simplest and simplified 1d flood with high computational speed low cost and data requirements lian et al 2013 such as swmm mike 11 and hec ras model it could not fit in the complex terrain and provide the detailed information wu et al 2017 meanwhile 2d flood models tuflow mike 21 caddies etc establish two dimensional hydrodynamic mathematical model to simulate flood and are applied on small scales such as urban streets roads and buildings chen et al 2018 advances in remote sensing technology and higher computing power further promote the popularity of 2d models in flood simulation recently nkwunonwo et al 2020 3d flood model shows more accurate information on flood flow and spatial characteristics of water flow dynamically rong et al 2020 although 2d and 3d flood model provide accurate flood depth and inundation area they require higher spatial resolution computation time and data requirement rong et al 2020 further some of these models have been developed for commercial use nkwunonwo et al 2020 not available for open source and with relatively expensive cost these factors limit the widespread use especially in developing countries of asia and africa flood modelling based on spatial extent such as 1k dhm 1 km distributed hydrological model would be not widely applied in practice tanaka et al 2020 for flood models based on mathematical complexity most are simplified 2d models or complexity reduced flood model nkwunonwo et al 2020 such as geographic information system gis performance of flood simulation could be conducted by gis based models and combined with decision making to achieve flood control and protection measures hossain and meng 2020 current flood simulation methods mainly consist of numerical simulation rainfall data estimation remote sensing and flood simulation by geographic information system gis wang et al 2019 combining the spatial analysis techniques by gis with historical flood data would be an effective way to effectively reduce uncertainty and simplify and solve urban flood modelling in flood simulation de silva and kawasaki 2020 zeng et al 2019 despite the unexpected floods that cause great impact flood simulation and modelling benefits to the grasp of urban flood change and support efforts to reduce and mitigate flood risk in most countries da silva et al 2020 risk consists of two fundamental aspects hazard and consequence hemmati et al 2020 hazard refers to an event that causes harm to people and property possibly consequence gets characterized by the interaction of potential threat and impact based on flood simulation flood model captures physical feature of urban flood and supports the identification of area distribution prone to floods but interconnectivity in urban areas increases the complexity of flood risk and urban networks make urban system more vulnerable to flooding serre and heinzlef 2018 for instance electric system potentially resulted in short circuit due to heavy rainfall and seriously affected urban transportation and communication system during flood events damage to road and traffic paralysis would get worse because of floods that spread from one area to another through rivers yusuf et al 2019 and flood impacts deteriorated owing to flood risk propagation with urban infrastructure breaking down fekete 2020 although floods brought the uncertainty and led to great losses in the process of flood risk propagation kundzewicz et al 2019 current research designed to map urban flood hazard mainly focused on physical feature of flood risk such as flood scope and depth and rarely considered the potential consequences of flood risk propagation mai et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 it is gradually conscious that dynamics complexity and propagation characteristic of flood risk dong et al 2020a b hossain and meng 2020 but most studies government policy and measure for reducing flood risk primarily fasten on post disaster response after floods and the propagation characteristic of flood risk deserves to much attention surminski and thieken 2017 propagation characteristic of flood risk benefits to comprehensive understanding of risk definition and makes flood risk assessment more useful for flood protection measures moreover flood losses estimation played the basic role in flood risk analysis heinzlef et al 2019 xu et al 2020 flood losses assessment included historical and empirical data method and input output method historical and empirical data method usually used indicators about floods to establish the relationship with historical flood losses such as depth damage function and closely associated with gis and remote sensing technology guo et al 2020 huizinga de moel and szewczyk 2017 developed globally database of depth damage curves to eliminate geographical differences in the relationship between flood depth and damage chinh et al 2017 expected annual flood damage to private households of us 3340 thousand for flood risk assessment by multi variable loss model approximately 2 5 of total annual household income meanwhile input output method economically evaluated physical damage and production shortfall caused by disasters mendoza tinoco et al 2020 such as input output io and computable general equilibrium cge model vamvakeridou lyroudia et al 2020 put forward cge model to assess direct and indirect flood economic losses and solved the uncertainty caused by flood in regional economy tanoue et al 2020 used cge model to estimate the indirect economic losses after a long inundation period in 2011 thailand flood but input output methods generally required much basic data and calculation demand greater accuracy from the data and have lower calculation value guo et al 2020 after flood recovery from structural damage and return to normal functioning generally accompanied by considerable economic losses and burdens sohn et al 2020 flood losses estimation could provide necessary basis for optimizing flood risk management and making decisions about flood control and disaster reduction schröter et al 2018 this study selected nanjing as the case study to comprehensively assess urban flood risk taking flood risk propagation characteristic into account with flood return periods of 5 10 20 50 and 100 years and aimed to 1 identify inundated areas and inundation intensity based on flood simulation 2 assess and draw flood risk map considering flood risk propagation 3 calculate and estimate flood economic losses from 5 to 100 years this study s findings could help identify the distribution of urban areas prone to flooding and formulate flood risk management policies and adaptive mitigation strategies in nanjing 2 methodology 2 1 study area nanjing 31 14 n 32 37 n 118 22 e 119 14 e fig 1 is located in the east of china and the capital of jiangsu province nanjing primarily composed of low mountains lies in hilly areas and subtropical monsoon climate shows the obvious feature of hot summer and cold winter annual average temperature reaches 15 4 and annual average precipitation is 1106 mm in nanjing until 2019 this city covers total area of 6 587 square kilometers and has 11 districts namely xuanwu qinhuai jianye gulou pukou qixia yuhuatai jiangning luhe lishui and gaochun district land use consisted of six types in nanjing in 2018 cropland woodland grassland water area built up land and unused land fig 2 cropland occupied the largest area 3417 69 square kilometers accounting for 51 89 of the total area built up land covered the second area 1638 21 square kilometers followed by water area woodland grassland and unused land table 1 as a rapidly growing city nanjing also faces with the higher urban flood risk wang et al 2020a and has been affected by floods in the recent years zhang et al 2019 this city has to deal with the challenge from more frequent urban flood 2 2 urban flood risk for nanjing to assess future flood risk in nanjing this study combined gis for flood model with historical data to conduct flood simulation application of historical data was an effective way to reduce the uncertainty in flood simulation wang et al 2019 rainstorm intensity equation was compiled on historical rainfall data in nanjing while scs cn model established the direct relationship between hydrological model parameters and remote sensing information based on rainfall and runoff considered the characteristics in the underlying surface and reflected the influence of land use on rainfall and runoff combined with rainstorm intensity equation and scs cn model we calculated runoff depth in different flood return periods determined inundation volume and perform flood simulation by digital elevation model dem table 2 in gis considering flood risk propagation this study put forward the modified susceptible infected recovered sir model to definite flood risk we made the following modification for sir model 1 we took the city as research object corresponding to the individual in sir model 2 human susceptibility to infection with and recovery from viruses were made to correspond to the susceptibility vulnerability and recovery of the city to flood respectively which represented the consequence and status of flood risk propagation susceptibility and vulnerability increase consequence while recovery diminish which implied that increasing vulnerability and susceptibility causes more flood loss while improving recovery reduces losses therefore flood risk could be defined r i s k s u s c e p t i b i l i t y v u l n e r a b i l i t y r e c o v e r y in this way this study identified and draw flood risk maps in nanjing for different flood return periods we combined the depth damage function and gis technology to predict and calculate the economic losses in nanjing during different flood return periods overall framework of this paper is shown in fig 3 considering the propagation characteristic of flood risk this study revealed the potential impact and damage of flood risk propagation through this study we could identify the possible scope of flood inundation and potential losses in nanjing and formulate flood risk management and adaptive mitigation strategy 2 3 flood simulation and modelling 2 3 1 rainstorm event design this study considered the result of rainstorm events to simulate the effect of urban flood in nanjing design of rainstorm events stemmed from the rainstorm intensity equation ins china outdoor drainage design code gb50014 2021 wang et al 2019 combined with statistical law of historical rainfall in nanjing the latest rainstorm intensity equation revised by nanjing city administration is following 1 i a 1 c l g p t b n 64 300 53 8001 lg p t 32 900 1 011 where i designed rainstorm intensity mm min t rainfall duration min p return period year n attenuation coefficient of rainstorm a 1 c b are regional parameters 2 3 2 runoff simulation soil conservation service curve number scs cn model is developed by usda soil conservation service and reflects the effect of different soil types land use patterns and soil antecedent moisture condition on rainfall runoff shi et al 2009 scs cn model was used for estimation of direct runoff for a given rainstorm event 2 q p i a 2 s p i a p i a 2 p i a s p i a 0 p i a 3 i a α s 4 s 25400 cn 254 5 p i d t where q runoff depth or effective rainfall mm p total rainfall depth mm calculated by rainstorm

from 0 to 100 dimensionless cn represented runoff depth potential of land use and cover and kept relevant to soil antecedent moisture condition amc global hydrologic soil groups and land use xiao et al 2011 higher cn value means higher runoff generated by ground surface during flood events amc consisted of three types amc i dry soil moisture amc ii moderate normal or average soil moisture condition and amc iii wet soil moisture this study mainly considered amc ii to estimate the runoff and cn value of amc ii is shown in supplementary material 2 3 3 flood simulation land use data of nanjing in 2018 and runoff depth were used to conduct the modelling of urban flood simulation this study selected the flood duration of 120 min calculated flood inundation volume in combination with runoff depth and conducted flood simulation by flood inundation volume and digital elevation model in gis based on china outdoor drainage design code gb50014 2021 urban drainage capacity was calculated by flood duration of 120 min and estimated in flood return periods of 2 years for storm sewer design in urban areas overall process of flood simulation could be seen in fig 4 6 v v 1 v 2 7 v 1 q 1 s 1 c 8 v 2 q 2 s 2 where v total flood inundation volume m 3 v 1 flood inundation volume in built up land v 2 flood inundation volume in other types of land m 3 q 1 runoff depth in built up

individuals recovering 2 4 2 flood risk calculation based on the original sir model this study considered modifying sir model to better understand and define risk considering flood risk propagation through the following equations this work could identify urban flood risk of nanjing in different return periods susceptibility reflects the possibility of being affected by the consequence of flood bertilsson et al 2019 larger inundation areas mean the greater susceptibility and susceptibility 13 i s s inudated s total where i s susceptibility s inudated inundated area s total total region area vulnerability means the potential damage of the elements exposed to the flood events such as people and assets vulnerability analysis generally consists of identifying the land use areas exposed to flood events and potential damage fuchs et al 2015 vulnerability is calculated by waghwala and agnihotri 2019 14 i v a s urban b s agriculture c s open s inudated 15 s open s total s urban s waterbodies s vegetation where i v vulnerability s urban urban areas exposed to flood events s agriculture agriculture areas exposed to flood events s open open areas exposed to flood events a b and c respectively represent the weight of flood damage a and b are identified by historical flood losses in urban and agricultural areas c 0 there is no vulnerability without exposure so if people and economic resources are not inundated flood vulnerability would be zero waghwala and agnihotri 2019 recovery refers to the ability to repair or replace flood damaged property including damage to the building and its property calculated based on economic loss and income bertilsson et al 2019 16 i r 1 i rm 17 i rm l i where i r recovery i rm economic recovery from flood loss l flood loss and i annual income therefore considering the characteristics of flood risk propagation flood risk could be defined 18 risk susceptibility vulnerability recovery 2 5 flood losses estimation this study estimated flood economic losses of nanjing in different flood return periods flood losses consisted of the loss of opportunity due to business interruption bi loss costs associated with emergency measures and asset damage gdp loss rate could analyze the impact and influence of flood events on normal urban system and quantify the corresponding economic loss this study referred to previous literature tanoue et al 2020 to calculate flood economic losses and calculation process is shown in fig 5 and indicators could be seen in table 3 2 5 1 bi loss bi loss referred to the loss caused by business interruption and arose from reduction of production in industry manufacturing and service industry bi loss directly reflected the impact and effect of flood events to normal operation of economy in the affected area 2 5 2 emergency measures costs emergency measures costs consisted of the cost of house cleaning alternative housing expenditure and emergency expenditure associated with alternative activities the cost of house cleaning included the cost of cleaning up collapsed houses and repairing damaged houses during the flood events alternative housing expenses was the cost of evacuating people and relocating them to new places during the flood events emergency expenditure costs associated with alternative activities included the information communication and commuting expense and the cost of emergency supplies such as drinking water warm clothes medicine and food 2 5 3 asset damage asset damage was calculated based on the flood depth inundation rate assets and depth damage function flood depth and inundation rate was obtained from inundated map and depth damage function was measured by literature survey huizinga et al 2017 assets was obtained by multiplying the daily gdp by stock conversion coefficient k k 2 8 tanoue et al 2020 3 results 3 1 flood simulation result 3 1 1 inundated areas of nanjing districts this study used inundated area and inundation intensity percentage of inundated area to total area to represent the inundation state in nanjing districts overall inundated area fig 6 inundation intensity fig 7 and flood depth gradually increased with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years the smallest inundated area occupied 517 19 km2 accounting for the 7 85 of total regional area in the five year flood return period while the largest covered 1045 80 km2 and made up for the 15 88 of total regional area in the return period of 100 years generally nanjing suffered from the obvious change in inundated areas from 517 19 654 11 657 92 834 49 to 1045 80 km2 and kept ascending in inundation intensity from 7 85 9 93 9 99 12 67 to 15 88 during urban flood events the maximum flood depth experienced the variation from 149 39 173 13 196 87 228 26 to 252 00 mm with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years table 4 the more area in nanjing where flood depth reached maximum mean the higher exposure to urban flooding furthermore flood depth in almost all districts of nanjing escalated clearly with the increase in flood return periods which reflected that urban flood could be the common problem in these districts inundated areas mainly concentrated on both sides of yangtze river central urban areas and low lying areas spatially in nanjing gaochun district occupied the dominating inundated area while had the relatively medium flood intensity during flood events gaochun district always covered the largest inundation area of 131 51 square kilometers and increased to 224 46 km2 in flood return period of 100 years accounting for approximately 16 73 and 28 55 of total inundation area respectively on the contrary jianye district occupied relatively smaller inundated area from 31 84 43 91 to 56 53 km2 while showed the highest inundation intensity with the change from 54 17 to 69 75 all districts in nanjing implied the typical spatial and regional differences in inundated areas and inundation intensity moreover inundation intensity was helpful and useful to grasp the inundation condition at regional level and reflected the contribution of each district to inundation in nanjing which further indicated that jianye district deserved to much attention for improvement of flood resistance capacity 3 1 2 inundated areas of land use in nanjing with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years inundated areas all showed the increasing trend in six types of land use fig 8 on the whole inundated areas of water area occupied the largest with inundation change from 386 07 404 61 405 06 426 93 to 497 14 km2 and the inundation of water area primarily reflected in the rise in water level caused by flood depth lin et al 2020 and could be more clear combined with fig 6 inundation intensity exhibited descending tendency in water area during flood events fig 9 and implied the attenuated effect and contribution to total flood inundation cropland covered the second largest inundated area and accounted for 17 46 26 11 26 00 32 27 36 66 of total inundation area which illustrated the increasingly intensive contribution to flood inundation in flood return periods built up land became the other primary type impact by urban flood and inundated area reached 27 53 58 54 61 57 111 25 and 134 60 km2 with inundation intensity ascending from 5 32 to 12 87 in different return periods which reflected the increasing contribution and effect to total flood inundation inundated area of woodland changed not significant with the area rising from 1 67 to 2 21 km2 and inundation intensity also declined in flood return periods moreover although grassland exhibited the obvious increase in inundated area inundation intensity went through two changes of up and down with the value from 2 23 2 81 2 80 3 01 to 2 71 these changes may get associated with the regulating effect of grassland on urban flood brody et al 2014 grassland could contribute to reducing surface runoff increase rainfall storage and play the important role in flood mitigation kim et al 2021 although various types of land exhibited more and more inundated areas there was the difference in the contribution of land to total inundation areas which implied the probable distribution of flood inundation on various lands during flood events to further explore the impact on various land caused by floods this study analyzed growth rate of land based on the inundated area in the return period of 5 years lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020b according to table 5 cropland and build up land showed rapid growth rate in inundated area which mean that these two types of land were more sensitive to flood change and would have the growing inundated area and flood damage during flood events furthermore with the increase in flood return periods various types of land use would be increasingly exposed to urban flood and cropland and build up land were expected to be the seriously affected 3 2 urban flood risk this study assessed and predicted urban flood risk in districts of nanjing based on the modified sir model under the scenarios of different flood return periods we identified and drew flood risk distribution map in nanjing based on the risk level table 6 considering flood risk propagation susceptibility changes not obviously in districts of nanjing and some districts always keep low susceptibility to urban floods fig 10 for five year return period only jianye district showed medium susceptibility and other districts displayed low susceptibility for flood return periods of ten years only jianye district exhibited high susceptibility and other districts in nanjing represented low susceptibility in the 20 year return period jianye district had shown high susceptibility and gulou district changed from low to medium susceptibility while other districts kept low susceptibility in the 50 years return period jianye district showed high susceptibility gulou district displayed medium susceptibility and other districts still remained low susceptibility in the 100 year flood only jianye district exhibited high susceptibility gulou and gaochun district showed medium susceptibility and other districts represented low susceptibility jianye district is surrounded by water on three sides with dense water network and low terrain and faced with the threat from outer river floods and urban waterlogging currently which led to high flood susceptibility in jianye different urban districts in nanjing changed greatly in the characteristics of vulnerability during urban flood events fig 11 in the five year return period jiangning lishui pukou qixia and yuhuatai district displayed low vulnerability while gaochun gulou jianye luhe qinhuai and xuanwu districts exhibited medium vulnerability in the 10 year return period jiangning and pukou district changed from low to medium vulnerability while jianye district transformed from medium to high vulnerability for 20 year return period gulou district changed from medium to high vulnerability with flood return period of 50 years jiangning and pukou district changed from medium to high vulnerability and gulou and jianye district represented high vulnerability gaochun luhe qinhuai and xuanwu district showed medium vulnerability and only lishui qixia and yuhuatai district showed low vulnerability in the 100 year flood gulou jiangning jianye luhe pukou and yuhuatai district showed high vulnerability while other districts represented medium vulnerability reduction in inundated area and losses of cropland and built up land became more helpful and meaningful for vulnerability mitigation waghwala and agnihotri 2019 recovery showed decreasing trend in districts of nanjing with food return periods from 5 to 100 years fig 12 in the five year return period all districts displayed high recovery in nanjing in the return period of 10 years jiangning qixia and yuhuatai district changed from high to medium in recovery and other districts exhibited high recovery in the 20 year return period jiangning qixia and yuhuatai district showed medium recovery jianye lishui and pukou district transformed from high to medium recovery and other districts represented high recovery with flood return period of 50 years jiangning and jianye district changed from medium to low recovery and luhe and xuanwu district transformed from high to medium recovery in the 100 year flood jiangning jianye qixia and yuhuatai district represented low recovery lishui luhe pukou gulou qinhuai and xuanwu district showed medium recovery and gaochun district displayed high recovery overall areas with high recovery mainly concentrated in the north and south of nanjing and the central region showed relatively low recovery higher recovery implied the rapider return to normal function and more resilience to floods and got closely related to regional economic level and flood economic losses economic losses were directly relevant about the damage and impact degree of urban areas abundant economic condition became the premise of urban flood prevention and mitigation wang et al 2021 and without certain economic foundation cities were bound to be hit when floods occurred this study identified risk status and consequence considering flood risk propagation by means of susceptibility vulnerability and recovery distribution and assessed flood risk based on the modified sir model in districts of nanjing fig 13 different districts showed different risk level and overall upward trend during flood events and medium and high flood risk areas primarily concentrated on the city center in nanjing in the return period of 5 years only jianye district showed medium risk and other districts exhibited low risk in the ten year return period gulou district transformed from low to medium risk and other districts remained low risk with flood return period of 20 years jianye district changed from medium to high risk and pukou luhe and gulou district showed medium risk in the 50 year return period only jianye district showed high risk and pukou jiangning luhe qinhuai and gulou district represented medium risk for the 100 year return period all districts reached the medium and high risk in nanjing only jianye district showed high risk and other exhibited the medium risk 3 3 flood losses estimation this study estimated flood economic losses in nanjing based on inundated areas flood depth and damage depth function flood losses were primarily reflected in the damage to nanjing s gdp and calculated in combination with social and economic data in 2018 from statistical yearbook of nanjing total economic losses due to floods exhibited the increasing trend with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years fig 14 meanwhile bi loss emergency measures costs and asset damage also showed uptrend from 5 to 100 years overall the higher economic loss implied more serious damage and impact to normal economic development and caused considerable gdp loss in cities bi loss reached 1 99 3 98 5 31 6 97 and 8 96 billion us respectively in flood return periods from 5 to 100 years table 7 increasing bi loss reflected the damage extent to the city s industry and determined the direct impact of local normal economic condition estimation of bi loss could help decision makers usefully comprehend the influence level due to flood events in cities emergency measures costs ascended from 25 86 26 91 27 61 28 48 to 29 52 billion in the return periods of 5 100 years which mean the measures cost that arose from flooding and enabled policy makers to grasp the possible expenses and develop useful flood prevention strategies moreover increase in asset damage reminded city leaders of the need to repair urban infrastructure in time to keep normal function increasing urban drainage capacity could effectively prevent the occurrence of floods in rainstorm weather overall total economic loss reached 27 85 30 89 32 91 35 50 to 38 55 billion and resulted in the 14 38 15 94 16 99 18 32 to 19 90 loss rate to gdp which implied the potential damage in gdp caused by floods and led to the decline in economy level during flood events 4 discussion this study obtained inundated area inundation intensity and flood depth by flood simulation and modelling it was helpful and meaningful to predict possible flood depth under future flood events by regression relationship between flood depth and return periods current studies on flood depth damage curve were limited and most focused on the national scale huizinga et al 2017 based on this study flood depth damage curve of nanjing could be established by flood depth and economic losses which provided basis on flood damage factor to calculate flood losses for further study at city level and this study found that inundated area in gaochun district remained the same from 5 to 50 years and suddenly shot up in 100 years and lishui district showed the same issue this phenomenon could reflect the current threshold value of drainage capacity in each district each district should determine the current reasonable drainage capacity based on the change of inundated area and strengthen the construction of drainage pipe network system wang et al 2020a to meet flood control needs urban construction could replace old pipe network and build complete drainage system for the purpose of rainwater and sewage diversion this study revealed that built up land became the most sensitive to flood change and showed rapid growth rate in inundation intensity which was similar to the findings in other studies lin et al 2020 however under rapid urbanization this result might not benefit to sustainable urban development urban expansion led to decrease in cropland and woodland fragmentation of water area and increase in built up land that reduced surface permeability shao et al 2020 impervious urban surface caused the reduced rainwater infiltration and increasing surface runoff and led to serious urban flooding due to climate change frequency and loss in floods have escalated sharply around the world and increased the exposure to urban floods these phenomena inevitably bring the contradiction between rapid urbanization and urban flood therefore for urban sustainable development nanjing should adjust the structure of land use reasonably control urbanization process and repair urban underlying surface to increase water permeability for example permeable asphalt materials could pave urban roads to reduce surface runoff and promoted the development of sponge cities furthermore this study found that grassland might show the regulating effect on urban flood reduce runoff and increase rainfall storage especially in highly developed urban areas yuan et al 2016 grassland became more fragmented and complicated in landscape structure reasonable and effective landscape planning of grassland could effectively reduce flood vulnerability kim et al 2021 therefore nanjing should increase the area and number of green parks vigorously promote the application of green infrastructure such as green roof and rain garden and improve ground water seepage capacity this study identified and assessed flood risk status and losses based on modified sir model considering flood risk propagation flood loss estimation helped city leaders determine the fluence level due to floods and formulated effective flood control measures based on specific loss category flood risk reduction and mitigation required consideration of regional context to reduce susceptibility and vulnerability and improve recovery for districts with high population and building density such as jianye and gulou district flood control measures should focus on the protection of people s lives and assets to reduce susceptibility and vulnerability and strengthen drainage network to meet flood prevention demand to improve recovery for districts with agricultural clusters such as gaochun and lishui district it is indispensable to strengthen monitoring and forecast warning of heavy rain weather for susceptibility and vulnerability reduction and provide farmers with refined guidance on agriculture losses prevention to improve recovery this study performed flood simulation and combined with historical rainfall under the scenarios of different flood return periods although this approach could help to decrease uncertainty climate change affects rainfall trends and leads to more complexity in precipitation and rainfall distribution climate change has contributed to more extreme precipitation events and future precipitation would likely significantly increase in east asia zhang et al 2010 and rainfall runoff relationship would change in yangtze river basin chu et al 2019 therefore future work should consider the effect of climate change for more accurate flood simulation moreover this study established flood risk model to capture risk status and losses considering flood risk propagation based on modified sir model and this method need to put into practice and examine the applicability and effectiveness in further studies 5 conclusion to assess and analyze flood risk considering the risk propagation characteristic this study conducted flood simulation and modelling by gis identified and mapped urban flood risk based on modified sir model estimated flood losses in the scenarios of different flood return periods we found that inundated area covered 517 19 654 11 657 92 834 49 and 1045 80 square kilometers with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years in nanjing accounting for 7 85 9 93 9 99 12 67 and 15 88 of total regional area respectively built up land and cropland were more sensitive to flood change and grassland might have the regulating effect on urban flood furthermore differences of flood risk appeared in districts of nanjing and jianye district showed high risk during flood events total economic loss reached 27 85 30 89 32 91 35 50 and 38 55 billion and resulted in the 14 38 15 94 15 94 18 32 and 19 90 loss rate to gdp respectively to reduce and mitigate flood risk we suggested that each district should replace old pipe network and build complete drainage system for flood prevention nanjing should control urbanization rate develop the green infrastructure such as green roof and build the sponge city finally it is necessary to pay attention to protection of people s lives and assets to reduce susceptibility and vulnerability and enhance urban drainage capacity for recovery improvement in jianye and gulou district future research should consider the effect of climate change to achieve more accurate flood simulation credit authorship contribution statement peng wang investigation conceptualization methodology writing review editing

3975,increasing urban flood posed serious threat to urban safety and sustainable development and resulted in great loss and damage it was significant and indispensable to master the potential change of urban flood for flood risk mitigation and adaption floods not merely caused the physical losses but also led to potential damage and harm during flood risk propagation studies have mainly focused on the physical features of flood risk and post disaster reconstruction while few have discussed the potential risk consequence considering flood risk propagation therefore this study analyzed flood risk propagation based on modified susceptible infected recovered sir model we performed flood simulation and modelling mapped urban flood risk in consideration of flood risk propagation and estimated flood losses in nanjing with flood return periods of 5 10 20 50 and 100 years results indicated that inundated area occupied 517 19 654 11 657 92 834 49 and 1045 80 km2 with return periods from 5 to 100 years respectively jianye district showed high flood risk and it was suggested to protect people s lives and assets to reduce susceptibility and vulnerability and enhance urban drainage capacity for recovery improvement moreover total economic losses reached 27 85 30 89 32 91 35 50 and 38 55 billion and led to the 14 38 15 94 15 94 18 32 and 19 90 gdp loss rate respectively this study could support the effective flood risk mitigation practice for adaptive urban development keyword urban flood risk flood risk propagation susceptible infected recovered model flood simulation and modelling flood losses estimation 1 introduction flood disasters become one of the most common natural disasters and pose the serious threat around the world mai et al 2020 over the last twenty years flood events have shown significant increase in frequency and intensity de koning et al 2019 kotzee and reyers 2016 thanvisitthpon et al 2020 and account for 47 in natural disasters rios 2015 severe urban flood not only causes the casualty and deterioration in human society but also leads to considerable losses guo et al 2020 with population and asset mainly concentrated on urban areas the inevitable urban flood badly affects both developed and developing countries bertilsson et al 2019 due to climate change cities are becoming more exposed to flood and losses caused by floods are expected to greatly increase in urban areas de silva and kawasaki 2020 furthermore disaster projection indicates that flood of a given return period within historical reference interval would be likely more frequent and intense in the future especially in china kundzewicz et al 2019 therefore it is indispensable to comprehend how to live with urban flood and mitigate flood risk for sustainable development in cities laeni et al 2019 future evolution of urban flood remains an unresolved issue wu et al 2017 to predict and understand the change flood simulation and modelling are incorporated in urban flood risk management as an effective tool and provide helpful information about local floods characteristics which have developed rapidly in the field of hydrology wang et al 2019 flood simulation and modelling could be classified based on dimensionality spatial extent and mathematical complexity though there is no homogeneity in classification approach nkwunonwo et al 2020 in dimensionality flood simulation and modelling include one dimensional 1d two dimensional 2d and three dimensional flood 3d model despite the simplest and simplified 1d flood with high computational speed low cost and data requirements lian et al 2013 such as swmm mike 11 and hec ras model it could not fit in the complex terrain and provide the detailed information wu et al 2017 meanwhile 2d flood models tuflow mike 21 caddies etc establish two dimensional hydrodynamic mathematical model to simulate flood and are applied on small scales such as urban streets roads and buildings chen et al 2018 advances in remote sensing technology and higher computing power further promote the popularity of 2d models in flood simulation recently nkwunonwo et al 2020 3d flood model shows more accurate information on flood flow and spatial characteristics of water flow dynamically rong et al 2020 although 2d and 3d flood model provide accurate flood depth and inundation area they require higher spatial resolution computation time and data requirement rong et al 2020 further some of these models have been developed for commercial use nkwunonwo et al 2020 not available for open source and with relatively expensive cost these factors limit the widespread use especially in developing countries of asia and africa flood modelling based on spatial extent such as 1k dhm 1 km distributed hydrological model would be not widely applied in practice tanaka et al 2020 for flood models based on mathematical complexity most are simplified 2d models or complexity reduced flood model nkwunonwo et al 2020 such as geographic information system gis performance of flood simulation could be conducted by gis based models and combined with decision making to achieve flood control and protection measures hossain and meng 2020 current flood simulation methods mainly consist of numerical simulation rainfall data estimation remote sensing and flood simulation by geographic information system gis wang et al 2019 combining the spatial analysis techniques by gis with historical flood data would be an effective way to effectively reduce uncertainty and simplify and solve urban flood modelling in flood simulation de silva and kawasaki 2020 zeng et al 2019 despite the unexpected floods that cause great impact flood simulation and modelling benefits to the grasp of urban flood change and support efforts to reduce and mitigate flood risk in most countries da silva et al 2020 risk consists of two fundamental aspects hazard and consequence hemmati et al 2020 hazard refers to an event that causes harm to people and property possibly consequence gets characterized by the interaction of potential threat and impact based on flood simulation flood model captures physical feature of urban flood and supports the identification of area distribution prone to floods but interconnectivity in urban areas increases the complexity of flood risk and urban networks make urban system more vulnerable to flooding serre and heinzlef 2018 for instance electric system potentially resulted in short circuit due to heavy rainfall and seriously affected urban transportation and communication system during flood events damage to road and traffic paralysis would get worse because of floods that spread from one area to another through rivers yusuf et al 2019 and flood impacts deteriorated owing to flood risk propagation with urban infrastructure breaking down fekete 2020 although floods brought the uncertainty and led to great losses in the process of flood risk propagation kundzewicz et al 2019 current research designed to map urban flood hazard mainly focused on physical feature of flood risk such as flood scope and depth and rarely considered the potential consequences of flood risk propagation mai et al 2020 zhao et al 2019 it is gradually conscious that dynamics complexity and propagation characteristic of flood risk dong et al 2020a b hossain and meng 2020 but most studies government policy and measure for reducing flood risk primarily fasten on post disaster response after floods and the propagation characteristic of flood risk deserves to much attention surminski and thieken 2017 propagation characteristic of flood risk benefits to comprehensive understanding of risk definition and makes flood risk assessment more useful for flood protection measures moreover flood losses estimation played the basic role in flood risk analysis heinzlef et al 2019 xu et al 2020 flood losses assessment included historical and empirical data method and input output method historical and empirical data method usually used indicators about floods to establish the relationship with historical flood losses such as depth damage function and closely associated with gis and remote sensing technology guo et al 2020 huizinga de moel and szewczyk 2017 developed globally database of depth damage curves to eliminate geographical differences in the relationship between flood depth and damage chinh et al 2017 expected annual flood damage to private households of us 3340 thousand for flood risk assessment by multi variable loss model approximately 2 5 of total annual household income meanwhile input output method economically evaluated physical damage and production shortfall caused by disasters mendoza tinoco et al 2020 such as input output io and computable general equilibrium cge model vamvakeridou lyroudia et al 2020 put forward cge model to assess direct and indirect flood economic losses and solved the uncertainty caused by flood in regional economy tanoue et al 2020 used cge model to estimate the indirect economic losses after a long inundation period in 2011 thailand flood but input output methods generally required much basic data and calculation demand greater accuracy from the data and have lower calculation value guo et al 2020 after flood recovery from structural damage and return to normal functioning generally accompanied by considerable economic losses and burdens sohn et al 2020 flood losses estimation could provide necessary basis for optimizing flood risk management and making decisions about flood control and disaster reduction schröter et al 2018 this study selected nanjing as the case study to comprehensively assess urban flood risk taking flood risk propagation characteristic into account with flood return periods of 5 10 20 50 and 100 years and aimed to 1 identify inundated areas and inundation intensity based on flood simulation 2 assess and draw flood risk map considering flood risk propagation 3 calculate and estimate flood economic losses from 5 to 100 years this study s findings could help identify the distribution of urban areas prone to flooding and formulate flood risk management policies and adaptive mitigation strategies in nanjing 2 methodology 2 1 study area nanjing 31 14 n 32 37 n 118 22 e 119 14 e fig 1 is located in the east of china and the capital of jiangsu province nanjing primarily composed of low mountains lies in hilly areas and subtropical monsoon climate shows the obvious feature of hot summer and cold winter annual average temperature reaches 15 4 and annual average precipitation is 1106 mm in nanjing until 2019 this city covers total area of 6 587 square kilometers and has 11 districts namely xuanwu qinhuai jianye gulou pukou qixia yuhuatai jiangning luhe lishui and gaochun district land use consisted of six types in nanjing in 2018 cropland woodland grassland water area built up land and unused land fig 2 cropland occupied the largest area 3417 69 square kilometers accounting for 51 89 of the total area built up land covered the second area 1638 21 square kilometers followed by water area woodland grassland and unused land table 1 as a rapidly growing city nanjing also faces with the higher urban flood risk wang et al 2020a and has been affected by floods in the recent years zhang et al 2019 this city has to deal with the challenge from more frequent urban flood 2 2 urban flood risk for nanjing to assess future flood risk in nanjing this study combined gis for flood model with historical data to conduct flood simulation application of historical data was an effective way to reduce the uncertainty in flood simulation wang et al 2019 rainstorm intensity equation was compiled on historical rainfall data in nanjing while scs cn model established the direct relationship between hydrological model parameters and remote sensing information based on rainfall and runoff considered the characteristics in the underlying surface and reflected the influence of land use on rainfall and runoff combined with rainstorm intensity equation and scs cn model we calculated runoff depth in different flood return periods determined inundation volume and perform flood simulation by digital elevation model dem table 2 in gis considering flood risk propagation this study put forward the modified susceptible infected recovered sir model to definite flood risk we made the following modification for sir model 1 we took the city as research object corresponding to the individual in sir model 2 human susceptibility to infection with and recovery from viruses were made to correspond to the susceptibility vulnerability and recovery of the city to flood respectively which represented the consequence and status of flood risk propagation susceptibility and vulnerability increase consequence while recovery diminish which implied that increasing vulnerability and susceptibility causes more flood loss while improving recovery reduces losses therefore flood risk could be defined r i s k s u s c e p t i b i l i t y v u l n e r a b i l i t y r e c o v e r y in this way this study identified and draw flood risk maps in nanjing for different flood return periods we combined the depth damage function and gis technology to predict and calculate the economic losses in nanjing during different flood return periods overall framework of this paper is shown in fig 3 considering the propagation characteristic of flood risk this study revealed the potential impact and damage of flood risk propagation through this study we could identify the possible scope of flood inundation and potential losses in nanjing and formulate flood risk management and adaptive mitigation strategy 2 3 flood simulation and modelling 2 3 1 rainstorm event design this study considered the result of rainstorm events to simulate the effect of urban flood in nanjing design of rainstorm events stemmed from the rainstorm intensity equation ins china outdoor drainage design code gb50014 2021 wang et al 2019 combined with statistical law of historical rainfall in nanjing the latest rainstorm intensity equation revised by nanjing city administration is following 1 i a 1 c l g p t b n 64 300 53 8001 lg p t 32 900 1 011 where i designed rainstorm intensity mm min t rainfall duration min p return period year n attenuation coefficient of rainstorm a 1 c b are regional parameters 2 3 2 runoff simulation soil conservation service curve number scs cn model is developed by usda soil conservation service and reflects the effect of different soil types land use patterns and soil antecedent moisture condition on rainfall runoff shi et al 2009 scs cn model was used for estimation of direct runoff for a given rainstorm event 2 q p i a 2 s p i a p i a 2 p i a s p i a 0 p i a 3 i a α s 4 s 25400 cn 254 5 p i d t where q runoff depth or effective rainfall mm p total rainfall depth mm calculated by rainstorm

from 0 to 100 dimensionless cn represented runoff depth potential of land use and cover and kept relevant to soil antecedent moisture condition amc global hydrologic soil groups and land use xiao et al 2011 higher cn value means higher runoff generated by ground surface during flood events amc consisted of three types amc i dry soil moisture amc ii moderate normal or average soil moisture condition and amc iii wet soil moisture this study mainly considered amc ii to estimate the runoff and cn value of amc ii is shown in supplementary material 2 3 3 flood simulation land use data of nanjing in 2018 and runoff depth were used to conduct the modelling of urban flood simulation this study selected the flood duration of 120 min calculated flood inundation volume in combination with runoff depth and conducted flood simulation by flood inundation volume and digital elevation model in gis based on china outdoor drainage design code gb50014 2021 urban drainage capacity was calculated by flood duration of 120 min and estimated in flood return periods of 2 years for storm sewer design in urban areas overall process of flood simulation could be seen in fig 4 6 v v 1 v 2 7 v 1 q 1 s 1 c 8 v 2 q 2 s 2 where v total flood inundation volume m 3 v 1 flood inundation volume in built up land v 2 flood inundation volume in other types of land m 3 q 1 runoff depth in built up

individuals recovering 2 4 2 flood risk calculation based on the original sir model this study considered modifying sir model to better understand and define risk considering flood risk propagation through the following equations this work could identify urban flood risk of nanjing in different return periods susceptibility reflects the possibility of being affected by the consequence of flood bertilsson et al 2019 larger inundation areas mean the greater susceptibility and susceptibility 13 i s s inudated s total where i s susceptibility s inudated inundated area s total total region area vulnerability means the potential damage of the elements exposed to the flood events such as people and assets vulnerability analysis generally consists of identifying the land use areas exposed to flood events and potential damage fuchs et al 2015 vulnerability is calculated by waghwala and agnihotri 2019 14 i v a s urban b s agriculture c s open s inudated 15 s open s total s urban s waterbodies s vegetation where i v vulnerability s urban urban areas exposed to flood events s agriculture agriculture areas exposed to flood events s open open areas exposed to flood events a b and c respectively represent the weight of flood damage a and b are identified by historical flood losses in urban and agricultural areas c 0 there is no vulnerability without exposure so if people and economic resources are not inundated flood vulnerability would be zero waghwala and agnihotri 2019 recovery refers to the ability to repair or replace flood damaged property including damage to the building and its property calculated based on economic loss and income bertilsson et al 2019 16 i r 1 i rm 17 i rm l i where i r recovery i rm economic recovery from flood loss l flood loss and i annual income therefore considering the characteristics of flood risk propagation flood risk could be defined 18 risk susceptibility vulnerability recovery 2 5 flood losses estimation this study estimated flood economic losses of nanjing in different flood return periods flood losses consisted of the loss of opportunity due to business interruption bi loss costs associated with emergency measures and asset damage gdp loss rate could analyze the impact and influence of flood events on normal urban system and quantify the corresponding economic loss this study referred to previous literature tanoue et al 2020 to calculate flood economic losses and calculation process is shown in fig 5 and indicators could be seen in table 3 2 5 1 bi loss bi loss referred to the loss caused by business interruption and arose from reduction of production in industry manufacturing and service industry bi loss directly reflected the impact and effect of flood events to normal operation of economy in the affected area 2 5 2 emergency measures costs emergency measures costs consisted of the cost of house cleaning alternative housing expenditure and emergency expenditure associated with alternative activities the cost of house cleaning included the cost of cleaning up collapsed houses and repairing damaged houses during the flood events alternative housing expenses was the cost of evacuating people and relocating them to new places during the flood events emergency expenditure costs associated with alternative activities included the information communication and commuting expense and the cost of emergency supplies such as drinking water warm clothes medicine and food 2 5 3 asset damage asset damage was calculated based on the flood depth inundation rate assets and depth damage function flood depth and inundation rate was obtained from inundated map and depth damage function was measured by literature survey huizinga et al 2017 assets was obtained by multiplying the daily gdp by stock conversion coefficient k k 2 8 tanoue et al 2020 3 results 3 1 flood simulation result 3 1 1 inundated areas of nanjing districts this study used inundated area and inundation intensity percentage of inundated area to total area to represent the inundation state in nanjing districts overall inundated area fig 6 inundation intensity fig 7 and flood depth gradually increased with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years the smallest inundated area occupied 517 19 km2 accounting for the 7 85 of total regional area in the five year flood return period while the largest covered 1045 80 km2 and made up for the 15 88 of total regional area in the return period of 100 years generally nanjing suffered from the obvious change in inundated areas from 517 19 654 11 657 92 834 49 to 1045 80 km2 and kept ascending in inundation intensity from 7 85 9 93 9 99 12 67 to 15 88 during urban flood events the maximum flood depth experienced the variation from 149 39 173 13 196 87 228 26 to 252 00 mm with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years table 4 the more area in nanjing where flood depth reached maximum mean the higher exposure to urban flooding furthermore flood depth in almost all districts of nanjing escalated clearly with the increase in flood return periods which reflected that urban flood could be the common problem in these districts inundated areas mainly concentrated on both sides of yangtze river central urban areas and low lying areas spatially in nanjing gaochun district occupied the dominating inundated area while had the relatively medium flood intensity during flood events gaochun district always covered the largest inundation area of 131 51 square kilometers and increased to 224 46 km2 in flood return period of 100 years accounting for approximately 16 73 and 28 55 of total inundation area respectively on the contrary jianye district occupied relatively smaller inundated area from 31 84 43 91 to 56 53 km2 while showed the highest inundation intensity with the change from 54 17 to 69 75 all districts in nanjing implied the typical spatial and regional differences in inundated areas and inundation intensity moreover inundation intensity was helpful and useful to grasp the inundation condition at regional level and reflected the contribution of each district to inundation in nanjing which further indicated that jianye district deserved to much attention for improvement of flood resistance capacity 3 1 2 inundated areas of land use in nanjing with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years inundated areas all showed the increasing trend in six types of land use fig 8 on the whole inundated areas of water area occupied the largest with inundation change from 386 07 404 61 405 06 426 93 to 497 14 km2 and the inundation of water area primarily reflected in the rise in water level caused by flood depth lin et al 2020 and could be more clear combined with fig 6 inundation intensity exhibited descending tendency in water area during flood events fig 9 and implied the attenuated effect and contribution to total flood inundation cropland covered the second largest inundated area and accounted for 17 46 26 11 26 00 32 27 36 66 of total inundation area which illustrated the increasingly intensive contribution to flood inundation in flood return periods built up land became the other primary type impact by urban flood and inundated area reached 27 53 58 54 61 57 111 25 and 134 60 km2 with inundation intensity ascending from 5 32 to 12 87 in different return periods which reflected the increasing contribution and effect to total flood inundation inundated area of woodland changed not significant with the area rising from 1 67 to 2 21 km2 and inundation intensity also declined in flood return periods moreover although grassland exhibited the obvious increase in inundated area inundation intensity went through two changes of up and down with the value from 2 23 2 81 2 80 3 01 to 2 71 these changes may get associated with the regulating effect of grassland on urban flood brody et al 2014 grassland could contribute to reducing surface runoff increase rainfall storage and play the important role in flood mitigation kim et al 2021 although various types of land exhibited more and more inundated areas there was the difference in the contribution of land to total inundation areas which implied the probable distribution of flood inundation on various lands during flood events to further explore the impact on various land caused by floods this study analyzed growth rate of land based on the inundated area in the return period of 5 years lin et al 2020 wang et al 2020b according to table 5 cropland and build up land showed rapid growth rate in inundated area which mean that these two types of land were more sensitive to flood change and would have the growing inundated area and flood damage during flood events furthermore with the increase in flood return periods various types of land use would be increasingly exposed to urban flood and cropland and build up land were expected to be the seriously affected 3 2 urban flood risk this study assessed and predicted urban flood risk in districts of nanjing based on the modified sir model under the scenarios of different flood return periods we identified and drew flood risk distribution map in nanjing based on the risk level table 6 considering flood risk propagation susceptibility changes not obviously in districts of nanjing and some districts always keep low susceptibility to urban floods fig 10 for five year return period only jianye district showed medium susceptibility and other districts displayed low susceptibility for flood return periods of ten years only jianye district exhibited high susceptibility and other districts in nanjing represented low susceptibility in the 20 year return period jianye district had shown high susceptibility and gulou district changed from low to medium susceptibility while other districts kept low susceptibility in the 50 years return period jianye district showed high susceptibility gulou district displayed medium susceptibility and other districts still remained low susceptibility in the 100 year flood only jianye district exhibited high susceptibility gulou and gaochun district showed medium susceptibility and other districts represented low susceptibility jianye district is surrounded by water on three sides with dense water network and low terrain and faced with the threat from outer river floods and urban waterlogging currently which led to high flood susceptibility in jianye different urban districts in nanjing changed greatly in the characteristics of vulnerability during urban flood events fig 11 in the five year return period jiangning lishui pukou qixia and yuhuatai district displayed low vulnerability while gaochun gulou jianye luhe qinhuai and xuanwu districts exhibited medium vulnerability in the 10 year return period jiangning and pukou district changed from low to medium vulnerability while jianye district transformed from medium to high vulnerability for 20 year return period gulou district changed from medium to high vulnerability with flood return period of 50 years jiangning and pukou district changed from medium to high vulnerability and gulou and jianye district represented high vulnerability gaochun luhe qinhuai and xuanwu district showed medium vulnerability and only lishui qixia and yuhuatai district showed low vulnerability in the 100 year flood gulou jiangning jianye luhe pukou and yuhuatai district showed high vulnerability while other districts represented medium vulnerability reduction in inundated area and losses of cropland and built up land became more helpful and meaningful for vulnerability mitigation waghwala and agnihotri 2019 recovery showed decreasing trend in districts of nanjing with food return periods from 5 to 100 years fig 12 in the five year return period all districts displayed high recovery in nanjing in the return period of 10 years jiangning qixia and yuhuatai district changed from high to medium in recovery and other districts exhibited high recovery in the 20 year return period jiangning qixia and yuhuatai district showed medium recovery jianye lishui and pukou district transformed from high to medium recovery and other districts represented high recovery with flood return period of 50 years jiangning and jianye district changed from medium to low recovery and luhe and xuanwu district transformed from high to medium recovery in the 100 year flood jiangning jianye qixia and yuhuatai district represented low recovery lishui luhe pukou gulou qinhuai and xuanwu district showed medium recovery and gaochun district displayed high recovery overall areas with high recovery mainly concentrated in the north and south of nanjing and the central region showed relatively low recovery higher recovery implied the rapider return to normal function and more resilience to floods and got closely related to regional economic level and flood economic losses economic losses were directly relevant about the damage and impact degree of urban areas abundant economic condition became the premise of urban flood prevention and mitigation wang et al 2021 and without certain economic foundation cities were bound to be hit when floods occurred this study identified risk status and consequence considering flood risk propagation by means of susceptibility vulnerability and recovery distribution and assessed flood risk based on the modified sir model in districts of nanjing fig 13 different districts showed different risk level and overall upward trend during flood events and medium and high flood risk areas primarily concentrated on the city center in nanjing in the return period of 5 years only jianye district showed medium risk and other districts exhibited low risk in the ten year return period gulou district transformed from low to medium risk and other districts remained low risk with flood return period of 20 years jianye district changed from medium to high risk and pukou luhe and gulou district showed medium risk in the 50 year return period only jianye district showed high risk and pukou jiangning luhe qinhuai and gulou district represented medium risk for the 100 year return period all districts reached the medium and high risk in nanjing only jianye district showed high risk and other exhibited the medium risk 3 3 flood losses estimation this study estimated flood economic losses in nanjing based on inundated areas flood depth and damage depth function flood losses were primarily reflected in the damage to nanjing s gdp and calculated in combination with social and economic data in 2018 from statistical yearbook of nanjing total economic losses due to floods exhibited the increasing trend with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years fig 14 meanwhile bi loss emergency measures costs and asset damage also showed uptrend from 5 to 100 years overall the higher economic loss implied more serious damage and impact to normal economic development and caused considerable gdp loss in cities bi loss reached 1 99 3 98 5 31 6 97 and 8 96 billion us respectively in flood return periods from 5 to 100 years table 7 increasing bi loss reflected the damage extent to the city s industry and determined the direct impact of local normal economic condition estimation of bi loss could help decision makers usefully comprehend the influence level due to flood events in cities emergency measures costs ascended from 25 86 26 91 27 61 28 48 to 29 52 billion in the return periods of 5 100 years which mean the measures cost that arose from flooding and enabled policy makers to grasp the possible expenses and develop useful flood prevention strategies moreover increase in asset damage reminded city leaders of the need to repair urban infrastructure in time to keep normal function increasing urban drainage capacity could effectively prevent the occurrence of floods in rainstorm weather overall total economic loss reached 27 85 30 89 32 91 35 50 to 38 55 billion and resulted in the 14 38 15 94 16 99 18 32 to 19 90 loss rate to gdp which implied the potential damage in gdp caused by floods and led to the decline in economy level during flood events 4 discussion this study obtained inundated area inundation intensity and flood depth by flood simulation and modelling it was helpful and meaningful to predict possible flood depth under future flood events by regression relationship between flood depth and return periods current studies on flood depth damage curve were limited and most focused on the national scale huizinga et al 2017 based on this study flood depth damage curve of nanjing could be established by flood depth and economic losses which provided basis on flood damage factor to calculate flood losses for further study at city level and this study found that inundated area in gaochun district remained the same from 5 to 50 years and suddenly shot up in 100 years and lishui district showed the same issue this phenomenon could reflect the current threshold value of drainage capacity in each district each district should determine the current reasonable drainage capacity based on the change of inundated area and strengthen the construction of drainage pipe network system wang et al 2020a to meet flood control needs urban construction could replace old pipe network and build complete drainage system for the purpose of rainwater and sewage diversion this study revealed that built up land became the most sensitive to flood change and showed rapid growth rate in inundation intensity which was similar to the findings in other studies lin et al 2020 however under rapid urbanization this result might not benefit to sustainable urban development urban expansion led to decrease in cropland and woodland fragmentation of water area and increase in built up land that reduced surface permeability shao et al 2020 impervious urban surface caused the reduced rainwater infiltration and increasing surface runoff and led to serious urban flooding due to climate change frequency and loss in floods have escalated sharply around the world and increased the exposure to urban floods these phenomena inevitably bring the contradiction between rapid urbanization and urban flood therefore for urban sustainable development nanjing should adjust the structure of land use reasonably control urbanization process and repair urban underlying surface to increase water permeability for example permeable asphalt materials could pave urban roads to reduce surface runoff and promoted the development of sponge cities furthermore this study found that grassland might show the regulating effect on urban flood reduce runoff and increase rainfall storage especially in highly developed urban areas yuan et al 2016 grassland became more fragmented and complicated in landscape structure reasonable and effective landscape planning of grassland could effectively reduce flood vulnerability kim et al 2021 therefore nanjing should increase the area and number of green parks vigorously promote the application of green infrastructure such as green roof and rain garden and improve ground water seepage capacity this study identified and assessed flood risk status and losses based on modified sir model considering flood risk propagation flood loss estimation helped city leaders determine the fluence level due to floods and formulated effective flood control measures based on specific loss category flood risk reduction and mitigation required consideration of regional context to reduce susceptibility and vulnerability and improve recovery for districts with high population and building density such as jianye and gulou district flood control measures should focus on the protection of people s lives and assets to reduce susceptibility and vulnerability and strengthen drainage network to meet flood prevention demand to improve recovery for districts with agricultural clusters such as gaochun and lishui district it is indispensable to strengthen monitoring and forecast warning of heavy rain weather for susceptibility and vulnerability reduction and provide farmers with refined guidance on agriculture losses prevention to improve recovery this study performed flood simulation and combined with historical rainfall under the scenarios of different flood return periods although this approach could help to decrease uncertainty climate change affects rainfall trends and leads to more complexity in precipitation and rainfall distribution climate change has contributed to more extreme precipitation events and future precipitation would likely significantly increase in east asia zhang et al 2010 and rainfall runoff relationship would change in yangtze river basin chu et al 2019 therefore future work should consider the effect of climate change for more accurate flood simulation moreover this study established flood risk model to capture risk status and losses considering flood risk propagation based on modified sir model and this method need to put into practice and examine the applicability and effectiveness in further studies 5 conclusion to assess and analyze flood risk considering the risk propagation characteristic this study conducted flood simulation and modelling by gis identified and mapped urban flood risk based on modified sir model estimated flood losses in the scenarios of different flood return periods we found that inundated area covered 517 19 654 11 657 92 834 49 and 1045 80 square kilometers with flood return periods from 5 to 100 years in nanjing accounting for 7 85 9 93 9 99 12 67 and 15 88 of total regional area respectively built up land and cropland were more sensitive to flood change and grassland might have the regulating effect on urban flood furthermore differences of flood risk appeared in districts of nanjing and jianye district showed high risk during flood events total economic loss reached 27 85 30 89 32 91 35 50 and 38 55 billion and resulted in the 14 38 15 94 15 94 18 32 and 19 90 loss rate to gdp respectively to reduce and mitigate flood risk we suggested that each district should replace old pipe network and build complete drainage system for flood prevention nanjing should control urbanization rate develop the green infrastructure such as green roof and build the sponge city finally it is necessary to pay attention to protection of people s lives and assets to reduce susceptibility and vulnerability and enhance urban drainage capacity for recovery improvement in jianye and gulou district future research should consider the effect of climate change to achieve more accurate flood simulation credit authorship contribution statement peng wang investigation conceptualization methodology writing review editing

3976,many earlier developed and densely populated metropolises served by combined sewer systems have been implementing additional stormwater control measures to reduce the impacts of combined sewer overflows cso driven by severe rainstorms these mitigation measures call for robust modeling strategies to assess the overall performance before development and to predict vulnerabilities and examine the underlying mechanisms causing them during or after development in a systematic manner this paper first introduces a hydrologic and hydraulic coupled modeling program metroflow that interacts and integrates multiple models built via diverse methods and tools a typical integrated urban drainage system iuds in the greater land area of chicago in the us was investigated as a testbed in addition a large scale tunnel and reservoir plan in construction was evaluated as a mitigation measure to alleviate cso risks in this effort three models were coupled into metroflow to account for the best available data of the multiple structural layers involved in this evolving system hydrological responses were analyzed under existing and projected system conveyance and storage capacities considering the full spectrum of rainfall conditions employing synthetic storms and real time simulations of four historical extreme events to account for the anomalies exemplified by individual natural events the overall effectiveness and resilience of the system were further assessed by the evaluation of normalized performance indicators pis quantifying the reduction of total volume duration and spread of csos the cluster of simulation results collectively suggests that a the proposed structural layer based modeling approach is applicable in reproducing distributed rainstorm driven csos for an evolving iuds based on emerging digital physical data b cso characteristics are rather multivariate functions of the rainfall tempo spatial characteristics as well as the hydraulic performance of the collection system and c consistent improvement of cso abatement was predicted with increasing conveyance and storage provided by the deep tunnel system the projected system is predicted to capture 24 h storms of return period up to 10 years metroflow s framework may also promote collaborative modeling in which community scale models can be utilized and merged to support extended scale water and wastewater infrastructure planning design and management keywords urban drainage modeling stormwater control measures combined sewer overflows extreme storms deep tunnel system mitigation measures 1 introduction wastewater and stormwater are both major water based flows of concern for urban infrastructure development combined sewer systems csss were largely constructed in older cities densely populated worldwide to collect and convey both wastewater and stormwater to reduce the city s vulnerabilities to floods and pollution in general a typical css usually connects to an intercepting sewer system that routes primarily dry weather flow dwf to water reclamation plants wrp before releasing the effluent to nearby watercourses such a system also known as integrated urban drainage system iuds may be cost effective during relatively dry weather however will inevitably result in sewer surcharge to the streets and overflows to nearby water courses during moderate to severe rainstorms the untreated wastewater and stormwater discharges also known as combined sewer overflows cso further result in serious water quality degradation and public health threats due to bacterial and or viral contamination fu et al 2019 usepa et al 1999 usepa 2008 which has been extensively examined via numerical modeling and monitoring efforts accordingly miskewitz and uchrin 2013 montserrat et al 2015 lacour et al 2009 quijano et al 2017 riechel et al 2016 sinha et al 2013 in the us there are currently 746 communities served by csss and a total of 9 345 cso outfalls identified across 31 states with a total of 182 css communities with active cso permits identified within the great lakes watershed usepa 2004 usepa 2008 the rapid expansion of urban areas coupled with increased precipitation associated with climate change typically result in more surface runoff changnon and westcott 2002 melillo et al 2014 usgcrp 2017 many municipalities are designing and implementing mitigation measures zimmer et al 2018 mainly providing supplementary in line and off line storage for stormwater and increasing infiltration to attenuate surface runoff via sustainable stormwater management practices chen et al 2019 usepa 2004 tiwary and kumar 2014 although green infrastructure gi and other low impact developments lids may be effective at the local level for small to moderate intensity storms yang and chui 2018 the deep tunnel system has been deemed as the state of the art large scale solution to flooding damage and water pollution due to severe storms owusu et al 2013 since it was adopted by the metropolitan water reclamation district of greater chicago mwrdgc in 1972 175 km usepa 1988 the scheme has been emulated and is being implemented in many metropolises such as milwaukee 45 9 km st louis 44 7 km and dc 20 9 km in the us and london 25 7 km in the uk guangzhou 55 5 km in china etc besides the differences in construction size i e the spatial scale of the overall system and geometric characteristics of the structures regionalized geographical and topographical properties these systems may share similar functionality and architecture configuration as illustrated in fig 1 namely the excessive inflow that overwhelms interceptors overflows via flow diversion and splitting structures e g side weirs and dropshafts to deep tunnels draining to storage reservoir further downstream flow regulators e g sluice gates were installed to control flow rates to the tunnels based on water levels in the system the deep tunnel system provides temporary storage of the combined sewage which will be pumped and delivered to nearby wrps for treatment the reduced csos if not eliminated discharge directly to nearby watercourses via outflow structures i e outflow pipes and tide gates which are used to control the outflow rates screen and prevent backflow from the river due to the long time span and expensive nature of any alike large scale structural solutions numerical modeling and simulation efforts are demanded to assess the performance of the engineering design prior to the development and identify any remaining vulnerabilities due to severe weather events in a real time manner amid or after the construction several modeling packages are available for modeling an entire urban drainage system uds utilizing digital geophysical data for example swmm and infoswmm models allow the inclusion of both catchment hydrology and sewer hydraulics within the same model but requires detailed physical data of the entire sewer system similarly commercial models such as mike flood mike urban xpswmm and infoworks icm can be used to integrate surface hydrology sewer hydraulics and waterway interactions however these tools suffer from the disadvantage that they are not extensible to incorporate additional functionality and or account for incomplete physical data cantone et al 2011 meanwhile such development and evolution of urban drainage infrastructure have resulted in a highly complex system featuring multiple interconnected structural layers see fig 5 with numerous hydraulic connections therefore may not be optimal to solve in a single model luo et al 2014 additionally as the scale of the domain and complexity of the architecture increases a single model may only be achieved at the cost of more modeling simplifications to retain computational efficiency and stability for example wu et al 2016 developed a swmm based model for donghaochong basin including the existing drainage network and a designed pilot of guangzhou deep tunnel system in which the tunnels were generalized to one conduit and the drop structures were simplified to orifices by formularization and parameterization of flow control and energy dissipation similarly huang et al 2019 employed a further simplified swmm based model to evaluate the urban flooding mitigation by the inclusion of the planned deep tunnel system which was further reduced to a storage unit previously in studies on risk assessment and performance evaluation of a planned deep tunnel system design storms with return periods up to 10 years were generally employed wu et al 2016 huang et al 2019 considering the design criteria of uds however the more extreme rainfall events 25 year to 100 year recurrences can cause serious localized as well as widespread flooding uds to overflow reservoirs to fill and even the waterways to rise to flood stage huff and angel 1992 changnon and vogel 1981 reported that the type of rainstorm that most frequently produces flash floods and csos in illinois and largely the us are the ones very localized resulting in large amounts of rainfall in short duration i e less than 72 h moreover large metropolitan areas such as chicago are more susceptible to tremendous property and life damage from such severe storms huff and angel 1989 markus et al 2012 as a result the overall cso abatement of the deep tunnel system may be further influenced by the rainfall spatio temporal structure of isolated extreme events in addition recent climate studies indicates potential increase in frequency of intense storms byun and hamlet 2018 usgcrp 2017 making it imperative to analyze the impacts of more extreme storm events when to evaluate the performance of a uds especially the impact of a mitigation measure aiming for city vulnerability to weather extremity is to be assessed sandoval et al 2013 reported monitored rainfall and cso events in berlin germany to establish the correlation between rainfall and cso characteristics and to identify which rainfall parameters are the most relevant to cso characteristics canonical correlation derived from partial least squares pls regression in this study indicated that the maximum and average rainfall intensities seem the most influential variables to predict cso water quantity and pollutant loads other authors reported predictions of cso hydraulic behavior as a function of rainfall parameters including intensity duration and totals montserrat et al 2015 mailhot et al 2015 yu et al 2013 yu et al 2018 mainly using statistical approaches such as conditional regression trees cluster analysis or regression models regardless of the fact that these data driven models and statistical alternatives can be useful for exploring the influence of rainfall on cso characteristics and establishing the thresholds for cso occurrences solely based on rainfall parameters the prediction quality of cso characteristics could be undermined by the variability of outflow control structures as well as the uncertainties and scarcity of continuous cso monitoring data lacour et al 2009 moreover yu et al 2013 examined 100 rainfall events and over 60 outfalls in a japanese city however found a poor correlation between cso behavior and rainfall this study also illuminates that cso behavior is rather a multivariate function of precipitation the overland and underdrain conditions therefore a systematic prediction of csos in a real time manner and or a full assessment of a large scale and complex iuds to control csos still requires integrated hydrologic and hydraulic h h modeling simulation results from a robust physical process based model may also complement the stormwater measurements which further advances the development of data driven or predictive models hu et al 2018 yu et al 2013 therefore this study first introduces a modeling program metroflow that takes an integrated approach to emulate urban drainage systems by utilizing less complex models that represent interconnected structural layers such as catchment hydrology sewers connecting structures and csos these models can be developed and tested independently by domain specific tools engineers and or researchers the models are linked together in metroflow to provide communications between the models by treating them as black box components by specifying inputs and outputs at their interfaces in this way metroflow facilitates understanding of the entire set of hydrologic and hydraulic processes and their interactions while balancing the computational cost metroflow was then utilized to assess the system performance of an evolving iuds in greater chicago land area to curb csos using a scenario based approach multiple performance indicators are introduced to quantify cso characteristics in terms of their spreads durations and volumes finally cso characteristics and system performances versus the rainfall tempo spatial characteristics were analyzed based on a cluster of simulation results using historical extreme storm events and synthetic storms constructed considering a full spectrum of regional storm conditions the enclosed quantitative analyses may unravel the remaining risks and the underlying mechanisms causing them in response to varying storm conditions with emphasis on extreme events on track to increase across most of the us by the end of the century usgcrp 2017 city planners and water managers can use this tool to further explore operational strategies to maximize the flood and pollution control in addition to cso abatement benefits of a deep tunnel system and to seek supplementary measures in the zones of concentrated risks metroflow s model framework may also facilitate collaborative modeling so that community scale models developed using diverse methods and or tools can be utilized and merged to support extended scale water and waster infrastructure planning design and management 2 background and materials 2 1 system overview the wastewater treatment facilities the completion of a series of hydraulic structures that reverse the flow of chicago river which originally flowed into lake michigan the primary drinking water supply of the city and the adoption of the deep tunnel system make chicago s uds one of the most advanced infrastructures for pollution and flood control worldwide lanyon 2016 the csss collect both sanitary flows and stormwater runoffs from a total area of 971 km2 375 mi2 across the city of chicago and 51 suburbs interceptor sewers were constructed afterwards in the length of over 400 miles to convey primarily dry weather flows dwf to wrps before releasing the effluent to chicago area waterway system caws however in case of heavy storm events wet weather flow wwf in excess of the diversion capacity to the interceptor may reverse into residential basements streets and discharges to nearby caws fig 2 shows that the system is observed to overflow up to 178 h annually based on the frequency analysis of cso activities reported by mwrdgc 2018 the most active cso outfalls i e 10 of the total cso outfalls that overflow 78 to 178 h annually are along the south fork of branch of chicago river north branch of the chicago river and chicago sanitary and ship canal moreover the current operation practice allows the high flow in caws during extreme storm events to be released to lake michigan via lakefront controlling structures i e locks and gates at locations shown in fig 3 reversing the normal flow direction as marked to mitigate flooding risks in the city as a result the resultant csos to caws pose direct hazards to the primary drinking water source in addition to the local waterways the tunnel and reservoir system consists of four subsystems with 175 km 109 mi tunnels which run parallel to the rivers and culminate in three suburban reservoirs also known as the tunnel and reservoir plan tarp as shown in fig 3 tarp is a joint project developed by mwrdgc and the us army corps of engineers usace the tunnels range in size between 2 7 m and 10 m in diameter and were constructed between 45 8 m to 106 7 m below grade in solid rock the attached reservoirs are built to provide flood relief by storing the stormwater conveyed by the tunnels and the contents within will be pumped to nearest wrps for treatment immediately after a rainstorm four wrps discharge treated sewage effluent into the rivers including the largest one in the world the stickney wrp by 2029 the entire system is projected to provide a total of 21 billion gallons of storage and to intercept 369 permitted csos in the entire css serviced area 2 2 summary of input data prior to the development of the hydrological and hydraulic models multiple arcgis layers of geospatial databases were developed and built into physical databanks pdb to provide a digital description of the physical characteristics of the study area including the sewer network deep tunnels and associated connecting structures and regulators other inputs include precipitation flow monitoring as well operational and maintenance data as tabulated in table 1 the required hydrological input primarily consists of two major parts i digitized municipal sewer atlas and delineated subcatchments i e service areas as shown in fig 4 draining to each outlet pipe routing to the sewer system and ii topographical and hydrologic characteristics of the catchment such as drainage area and shape slope length percentage of imperviousness roughness and depression storage the primary data source is the department of water management dwm sewer gis which is currently maintained by the city s business and information services department the city uses the nad 1983 illinois east feet projection and chicago city datum ccd as a vertical datum the hydrologic parameters for delineated catchments were largely extracted based on chicago metropolitan agency for planning land use data 1 3 arc second 10 meters digital elevation model dem of illinois from the us geological survey seamless data distribution system soil map data ssurgo database for the state of illinois from the natural resource conservation service of the us department of agriculture and aerial photography gis tools and aerial photos were used to calculate the impervious coverage of each subcatchment main hydraulic inputs include i geographical locations reference elevations of the tunnels storage reservoir and hydraulic structures including the entrance and exit sections ii and geometry i e type and size and topology description of the connections to other components or layers of the system i e to distribute the flow between the near surface sewers and the deep tunnel system and iii operational limits e g maximum gate opening gate opening rate etc in addition the hydraulic data obtained by synthesizing the data for individual components of the tarp system to determine conveyance of each major structure include i coefficients required for hydraulic calculations ii stage storage relationships for each connecting structure the databases were developed and further quality assured and quality controlled qa qc based on the sewer atlas sheets and as built structural contract drawings provided by mwrdgc and municipalities 2 3 study area this study uses the urban catchments that feed the mainstream des plaines ms dp tarp system encompassing most of city of chicago and evanston with a total drainage area of 409 km2 and an average subcatchment area of 5 37 x 104 m2 and 37 northern and western suburbs with a total drainage area of 168 km2 and an average subcatchment area 1 08 x 106 m2 see fig 4a as a case study ms dp tunnel systems completed in 2006 are the largest subsystems of tarp and merge into mccook reservoir which is projected to provide additional 37 8 x 106 m3 10 bg by 2029 usace et al 2013 the subcatchments within the city of chicago have an area averaged imperviousness as high as 63 and such value for the service areas in the suburbs is approximately 40 see fig 4b the mainstream system consists of 157 dropshafts and 65 2 km of deep tunnels ranging in size from 4 0 to 10 0 m and are located as much as 97 5 m below ground level the des plaines system is comprised of 50 dropshafts and 41 2 km deep tunnels ranging in size between 3 0 m to 10 0 m in diameter and are located as deep as 76 2 m below ground level stormwater and wastewater collected in ms dp tarp system are lifted via three major pumping stations i e mainstream pump station mainstream ps racine avenue ps and north branch ps as annotated in fig 3 and and thereafter conveyed to the nearby o brien wrp treatment capacity of 1 7 x 106 m3 or 450 mgd and stickney wrp capacity of 5 5x 106 m3 or 1440 mgd for treatment in addition to the combined sewage conveyed by interceptor sewers the racine avenue ps and north branch ps may also lift excess flow diverted from interceptor resulted from severe storms and release to the rivers directly when the capacity of tarp is reached 2 4 precipitation data quality controlled 10 min precipitation data for historical storms was obtained from cook county precipitation network ccpn operated by the illinois state water survey isws ccpn is a relatively dense raingage network consisting of 25 gauges in the entire cook county spaced 10 km apart and 13 of them are in the study area as shown in fig 4a this study analyzed the four most intense storm events reported in cook county during wy 2008 to wy 2016 on 9 12 14 08 7 23 25 10 7 22 23 11 and 4 17 18 13 bauer et al 2016 these four storm events were also reported by mwdgc with record high reversal flows to lake michigan due to rising river level mainly as a result of high cso discharges mwrdgc 2019 due to the spatial variation of the intense precipitation across the study area the thiessen polygon method as illustrated in fig 4a was used to determine the relative contribution of each raingauge to each dropshaft service area the same interpolation is applied to all storm events to exclude any inter storm bias due to the interpolation scheme despite of the spatial variation between the dropshaft service areas the rainfall within an individual service area was assumed to be uniform for computational efficiency precipitation frequency data was compiled via the precipitation frequency data server developed by the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 bonnin et al 2006 based on frequency analysis of partial duration series pds using the method of l moments a network average is obtained between the 10 stations maintained by national centers for environmental information formerly known as national climatic data center ncdc available in the study area fig 4a the resultant precipitation frequency analysis is shown in fig 8 it has been pointed out that a stationary climate assumption may lead to an underestimation of extreme precipitation due to growing extreme climatic events also nonstationary precipitation idf curves were introduced by other authors cheng and aghakouchak 2014 sarhadi and soulis 2017 yan et al 2021 given the wide range of uncertainties that might arise using different methods and the fact that noaa atlas 14 approach has been widely accepted for infrastructure design thus this data was selected for a wide computation range including extreme events up to 500 years to account for potential increasing risks 3 methods 3 1 a structural layer based modeling approach following the structural evolution of the drainage system the entire system may be considered as three layers the overland region or sewershed and the near surface css layer i the interceptors layer ii and the deep tunnel system layer iii see fig 5 distinct from previous practices instead of simplifying the structures in each layer and the connections between multiple layers to fit in a single model the relative independence of each layer may be utilized by proper handling of the divisions and connections between them therefore this study considers layer i layer iii and its connections to layer i ii separately as a result the urban catchments with sewer networks deep tunnels and the storage reservoir with the receiving and regulating structures controlling the flow direction and rates to interceptors dropshafts and cso outfalls were modeled independently accordingly the following assumptions were adopted along with the 1 d modeling work a according to the time and length scales identified in urban catchments precipitation overland flow infiltration depression storage surface runoff and the sewer were considered as the most important hydrologic processes at the urban scale of interest kalma and sivapalan 1995 thus were accounted for also see fig 1a b the minor interactions and feedback between the aforementioned three layers were ignored that said no backflow is allowed from the deeper layer to the near surface system or from waterways to the sewer system this approach also allows any updates and modifications to the existing plans and structures and or other human interventions to alter hydrologic properties to be implemented only in the targeted layer for example new urbanization developments and green infrastructures should be modeled in layer i hence only alter the source of storm and wastewater and the total inflows to layer ii iii from the cso modeling perspective furthermore this approach allows different structural layers to be controlled separately with user defined operational control rules for example if the precipitation remains unvaried the inflows routed via csss would stay the same thus only the hydraulic performance i e conveyance and storage capacity and control rules in layer ii and layer iii would affect the csos this approach drastically reduces the amount of physical data and control rules that would need to be engined in one model hence improves the computational stability and efficiency metroflow is a holistic modeling program written in c an object oriented programming language and in which the interfaces are abstract constructs that contain no actual programming code and are the key features of the c language that allows extensibility metroflow operates through packages which are a collection of models geometries variables and scenarios a core concept used by metroflow is the software interface a software component interface is a set of operation signatures i e function parameters that defines the complete set of requests that can be sent to the component it can also be thought of as a shared boundary across which two separate components of a software system exchange information this version of metroflow supports software interfaces including swmm infoworks and matlab this framework also allows metroflow to interact with the individual components of a system in a way that does not require the actual type of the component namely the metroflow codebase works with a collection of modellayers which defines properties and functions that a given model component must implement therefore the program facilitates layer based model development and integrates the interconnected sub systems to a provide a way for a suite of models to interact sequentially and b to allow continuous simulation of an integrated drainage system such as the one in the greater chicago area and the physical processes involved i e fig 1a in a tightly coupled manner the following three models were built into metroflow a the infoworks cs model city model solving the subcatchments and underneath sewer system i e layer i located within city of chicago b the probabilistic based illinois urban hydrologic model iuhm solving layer i located in the suburbs and c the infoworks cs model of the deep tunnels reservoir dropshafts i e layer iii and connections to layer ii and iii cs tarp model for the entire study area fig 1a and 5 in conjunction with fig 6 illustrate the h h processes that each model simulates and the links between the model layers the annotated key methods and or theories adopted in each modeling component is clustered in fig 6 and detailed in the following sections accordingly metroflow allows the following piecewise analyses to be performed sequentially or separately a the transformation from rainfall to runoff in overland regions b the hydraulics and outflows of the combined sewer systems c the unsteady flow distribution between combined sewers interceptor sewer tarp and cso outfalls d the hydraulics of tarp and connecting structures the real time operations of pumps and regulating structures 3 1 1 illinois urban hydrologic model iuhm due to the limited documentation of the municipal csss earlier developed outside city of chicago see the division shown in fig 4a e g the majority of systems were missing conduit slopes and diameters in some cases only the layout of the combined sewer system was available the iuhm was adopted for its capability to predict the hydrologic response and associated uncertainties in highly heterogeneous catchments with limited input and calibration data following the procedures by cantone et al 2011 to guide the readers the key methodology may be summarized as follows the iuhm contains a state space model which characterizes each conduit of the sewer system by a conduit state x ci and the overland flow region draining to a conduit by an overland state x oi where i is the catchment order based on strahler ordering scheme rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 the modified ordering allows for the merging of conduits in series without an increase in conduit order to be noted this ordering scheme requires the network to be dendritic such that the stormwater collected by the sewer system is assumed to travel successively from low order to higher order pipes an example has been illustrated in fig 7 a the combined sewer network contributing to each dropshaft consists of hundreds of inlets and conduits with limited information the probabilistic basis of the model allows using representative values based on the statistics of the available information if any of the parameters are missing the overland region is further divided into pervious and impervious portions which facilitates the evaluation of hydrologic response driven by excessive rainfall this division significantly decreases the number of rainfall flow paths that need to be modeled to a finite number 2 ω where ω is the highest order of the pipe in the catchment also known as the order of the catchment according to the probability p w where w denotes a random flow path and w w w is the path space w x oi perv x oi imp x ci x cj x ω i 1 2 ω the channel flow in the i th order conduit considers both external flow from the inlets and inflow from lower order conduits unlike deterministic modeling the iuhm formulation estimates the travel times for each state x k probabilistically following the geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh lee and yen 1997 by assuming a probability density function pdf f xk t with a mean value t x k t it is important to note that t and t are distinct time related to rainfall intensity i t and travel time pdf i e f xk t respectively thus the travel time distribution is driven by the i t herein an exponential distribution was chosen for both overland flow and channel or conduit flow states as 1 f x k t 1 t x k t exp t t x k t the mean travel time t x k t is computed hydraulically using the kinematic wave assumption derived by lee and yen 1997 and the flood wave function given by cappelaere 1997 the network impulse function of the catchment is derived as follows 2 u t t w w f x o i perv t f x oi imp t f x ci t f x cj t f x c ω t p w where denotes a convolution integral the primary output of iuhm is the direct runoff hydrograph for each catchment derived as follows 3 q t t 1 u t t q lw t a where a is the total area of the catchment and q lw t is the equivalent pervious excess rainfall which is determined by the depression storage for both pervious and impervious flow regions and the infiltration rate f t for pervious regions thus q lw t is assumed to be zero until all the depression is filled for pervious regions q lw t i t f t where f t is assumed to be uniform and determined by the green and ampt method green 1911 and for impervious regions q lw t i t afterwards 3 1 2 city of chicago combined sewer model city model as the city of chicago has grown with increased urbanization and population relief sewers have been added to the existing system to ease basement flooding resulting in a highly looped system i e allow for relief in the system with many interconnections rather than a dendritic system as assumed in iuhm in addition the flow diversions were added downstream to split the flow between interceptors and dropshafts metroflow incorporates a detailed h h model developed on the platform of infoworks cs by associates for the dwm to determine the total flows collected via the css across the city luo et al 2019 this model is based on a simplified representation of the system which covers all sewers 0 6 m in diameter and larger compared to the sewersheds in the suburbs modeled by iuhm the drainage areas within the city is characterized by higher degree of heterogeneity thus a finer delineation to the neighborhood scale is adopted as shown in fig 4a statistically the entire watershed was divided into subcatchments ranging from 1 36 103 m2 to 7 16 105 m2 with a median size of 4 7 104 m2 as shown in fig 4 the model adopted a dual drainage concept in which the drainage areas are delineated to distribute storm runoff and dry weather flows to appropriate locations in the sub network typically near the center of the catchment a swmm routing model i e nonlinear reservoir is utilized to simulate the rainfall runoff process in which the infiltration lost on the pervious area is estimated using horton s infiltration model the hydrodynamics in the sewers is computed utilizing a conduit model same as the one used in the cs tarp modeling layer more details are given in the cs tarp section 3 1 3 dry weather flow estimation dry weather flow consumes conveyance capability of the sewer system during wet weather therefore should be accounted for in the modeling process iuhm estimate sanitary dry weather inflows using parameters based on the special contributing area loading program developed by the usace et al 2017 for lake michigan diversion accounting for subcatchments modeled by the city model wastewater profiles were developed based on wrp flow monitoring data during identified dry days and water consumption data from dwm the dwfs were estimated as the sum of foul flow and trade flow which include residential commercial and industrial wastewater flows in the sewer system for each subcatchment for subcatchments modeled by iuhm the dry weather flow is calculated as part of the preprocessing and appended to the simulated runoff as the total outflow from each subcatchment thus the outflows obtained from each outlet from both models are the sums of both sanitary inflows and stormwater runoff 3 1 4 connecting structure tarp cs tarp model the mainstream des plaines tarp system consists of 207 dropshafts and over 400 connecting structures that vary in topology design and geometry besides some dropshafts have multiple connections to the csss and overflow to different cso outfalls and a single connecting structure may include multiple regulating structures that divert the inflow into different directions thus a generic connecting structure model is neither feasible nor capable of allocating the transient flows in the system accurately the cs tarp model first introduced by luo et al 2014 integrated tremendous efforts to interpret the as built structural drawings in terms of hydraulic modeling components and sub networks centering at each dropshaft the model is built completely from physical data without any calibration in previous studies the model predicted cso discharges had been fed to 3d hydrodynamic models for caws as inflow boundary conditions and the accuracy of these point cso predictions have been validated by the stage measurements at monitored stations the details of these studies can be referred to zhu et al 2017 and quijano et al 2017 as an as built example illustrated in fig 1a figs 7 demonstrate a subsystem centered at a dropshaft i e mds n20 which is a drop structure diverting combined inflows captured in the near surface sewer system to the deep tunnel system see a 3d view of the structure in fig 7b along with vent releasing highly pressurized air due to incoming surge specifically dropshaft mds n20 located in the north branch of mainstream tunnel system receives wwf collected by the sewer network as shown in fig 7a in excess of diversion capacity of the interceptor sewer i e mwrdgc howard 3 through a sluice gate d while the diversion capacity of interceptor is determined by a side weir structure inside connecting structure b mds n20 also acts as a relief for the interceptor sewer when the inflow i e confluence from upstream interceptor pipe and diverting from connecting structure b exceeds the diversion capacity controlled by side weir structure e if and when tarp reaches capacity and the sluice gate d is closed and or the capacity of connecting structure a is exceeded combined sewage overflows into the upper north branch of chicago river through an outfall pipe in addition to the storage provided by connecting structure a b and c the sluice gate d and weir structure e add additional storage via the attached chamber as shown in fig 7b cs tarp model was thereafter developed and tested for hydraulic structure functionality for such individual subsystem using infoworks cs package before merging to one single model to route the simulated inflows dwf wwf output from city model and or iuhm model fig 6 some dropshafts receive inflows from subcatchments both within and outside of the city region via connecting structures to interceptor dropshafts and or cso outfalls an inflow mapping model further bridges the model layers by preprocessing the designated inflow hydrographs from the outflow pipe in iuhm and city model and internally converting to the compatible inflow format that is readable by cs tarp model and related to each receiving structure the conduit model solves one dimensional saint venant equations using preissmann 4 point finite difference scheme preissmann 1961 innovyze 2011 thus is capable of providing unsteady analysis of the flows and hydraulic grade line hgl throughout the system over the course of a storm event a smooth transition between the free surface and surcharged or pressurized flow is rendered by introducing the preissmann slot and using the iterative newton raphson method the implicit nature of the numerical scheme i e implicit euler further assures unconditional stability when entering the pressurized flow condition which is the system norm under extreme storms this capability also facilitates the implementation of real time control rtc rules of the regulators e g gates pumps that follow the operational guidelines as per mwrdgc sharma and serafino 2012 with highlights summarized in the following section the model was supplemented with a number of boundary conditions built in the aforementioned pdb including synthesized stage storage relations describing the attached storage of various control or connecting structures as exemplified in figs 7 and storage reservoir as well as operational rules of the regulators the developed cs tarp model therefore dynamically distributes the inflows captured by csss between interceptors tarp dropshafts and cso outfalls based on boundary conditions in the interceptors and the associated hydraulic structures which are further governed by the geometrical and physical properties and or operations of these structures as well as downstream system states see fig 6 the resultant cso hydrographs are used to calculate the volume and duration of cso discharge from each cso location consistent with the ones as of mwrdgc 2018 3 2 real time control real time control rtc of the iuds can be facilitated if system process variables e g water level and flow rates can be monitored or predicted continuously and used to operate regulators according to the classification of rtc summarized by garcia et al 2015 the rtc strategy adopted for the operation of the tarp system are rule based algorithms these algorithms determine the appropriate control actions according to the rules developed by considering possible operational scenarios that can occur zimmer et al 2018 these operations control the sluice gates openings to the dropshafts the inlet gate openings to the reservoir and pumping from tarp to nearest treatment plants the rtc module in the cs tarp model specifies a set of global system criteria based on the different hydraulic gradelines hgl at the downstream ends of the tunnel systems as operational objectives the global control levels then take this information to produce the set points for local controllers at each regulator see fig 6 noting that there are approximately 35 of the dropshafts are ungated as a result the excessive inflows may continue to raise the hgl across the system while the global control level is reached and the sluice gates are closed and excluding the excessive flows from entering the system via the gated dropshafts in this study to facilitate a worst scenario cso analysis in the city model the rtc module sets all sluice gates to tarp fully open assuming tarp has adequate or available storage at the time of storm thus no additional outlet control at the downstream ends i e free outfall is imposed in layer i besides flow restrictors are typically located at the inlets to control flow rates locally entering the sewer system this approach allows all inflows to the system i e wwf dwf to be routed and further distributed within the cs tarp layer which also facilitates a quantitative evaluation of tarp as a mitigation plan of csos such rtc rules or boundary conditions can be easily modified when the city model is used as a standalone tool to examine street and basement flooding issues luo et al 2019 these control rules as per mwrdgc sharma and serafino 2012 are subject to change according to the evolution of the tarp storage with the projected mccook reservoir online the tunnel hgl is further governed by the water surface elevation wsel in the reservoir downstream in order to prevent the tunnels from being extensively over pressurized the sluice gates to mainstream tarp are assumed to close when the tunnel hgl surpasses 17 68 m 58 ft ccd the sluice gates to des plaines tarp are closed when the tunnel hgl surpasses 18 60 m 61ft ccd and the inlet gates to mccook reservoir is assumed to remain fully open no pumping is allowed at the msps i e pumping from mccook reservoir during a storm event 3 3 hydraulic performance indicators previous studies identified that the key variables of a cso event on the receiving water bodies are the number of active point discharging sources the duration and volume alp and melching 2009 mailhot et al 2015 montserrat et al 2015 accordingly this study assesses the overall effectiveness of the system multi phases under designated operations by introducing various dimensionless performance indicators pi quantifying hydraulic performance criteria as follows 4 pi n a 1 n a n t 0 1 5 pi s 1 v cso v in 0 1 6 pi t t cso t r 0 where n a denotes the total number of cso outfalls that actively discharge or overflow during and or immediately after the storm event while n t is the total number of cso outfalls in the system v cso is the total volume of cso resulting from a storm event of the entire system while v in represents the total inflow collected by the combined sewer system and routed to interceptor and tarp system t cso denotes the maximum duration of csos in the system and t r is the storm duration namely pi n a can be considered as a measure of the spatial extent or spread of cso occurrences in the system pi s is a universal measure to evaluate the overall effectiveness of tarp storage at capturing cso pollution finally pi t is used to evaluate the maximum system duration of cso relative to the duration of the storm event the possible range of pi n a and pi s is within 0 to 1 as cso event can extend longer than the storm itself pi t may result in values greater than 1 for pi n a and pi s a value of 1 indicates the best system performance while a smaller value of pi t closer to 0 indicates better system performance 3 4 simulation configurations metroflow was employed as the major tool to perform the hydrological and hydraulic analysis in a coupled manner for the study area as shown in fig 4a the simulations were designed to examine the system in response to a full spectrum of storm conditions that could occur with an emphasis on extreme events first design storm simulations were performed for diagnostic purposes considering various average recurrence interval ari also known as return periods at various durations to facilitate a diagnostic analysis a set of synthetic or design storms were constructed based on regional precipitation frequency and temporal structure varying by durations of the storms berne et al 2004 changnon and vogel 1981 huff and angel 1989 huff and angel 1992 second simulations were performed for the four most intense storm events that occurred in cook county during wy 2008 to wy 2016 on 9 12 14 08 7 23 25 10 7 22 23 11 and 4 17 18 13 bauer et al 2016 for each historical event with the same inflows output from iuhm and city models the cs tarp model was used to simulate three scenarios as follows i zero storage and conveyance from tarp denoted as pre tarp ii the completed conveyance and storage of the tunnels in 2006 i e tarp1 and approximately 6 1 106 m3 or 1 6 bg which reflects the actual historical conditions of tarp system when the storms occurred and iii plus 37 8 106 m3 10 bg i e in total 43 7 106 m3 projected additional storage of mccook reservoir by 2029 i e tarp2 for all the simulations the entire system was initiated with dry and empty conditions the simulation time step was 30s for all models and the results were reported every minute 4 results and discussions cluster of simulation results were analyzed quantitatively and visualized in the following two sections classified into design storms and historical extreme events 4 1 diagnostic analysis using design storms the regional precipitation frequency interpreted using ensemble statistics of available noaa weather stations is presented in figs 8 the precipitation extreme for 1 h flash storms can reach up to 115 mm hr in intensity locally in contrast a 48 h rainfall may result in as much as 300 mm in totals while the event average intensity is less than 10 mm hr sub daily rainfall events produce relatively less volume in general however the increase in intensity is not proportional to the event durations and result in much more intense flash storms the wider error bars also indicate greater spatial variation for more intense storms which further suggests that spatial interpolation scheme is required for extreme real time event simulations fig 9 and table 2 presented the computed total inflows routed to interceptor and tarp system marked as total in and to tarp solely i e tarp in1 and tarp in2 as well as the resultant cso discharges for a matrix of 25 design storms considering additional conveyance and storage capacity as of tarp1 and tarp2 therefore a series of 50 simulations were performed the sub daily storms are crucial to evaluate drainage conveyances as the peak flow rate is more sensitive to the peak intensity and shape of rainfall than the total depth on the other hand the design of storage facility and associated dewatering pumps depends on the continuous storms lasting for days the sub daily hyetographs initiating with a sharp peak tend to distribute over 75 of rainfall in the first half of the storm duration see the hyetograph in the upper plot of each subfigure in fig 9 as a result the system conveyance has been exceeded for storms with an ari of 10 years or more it may be noted that this type of storms may also result in extended urban flooding in addition to csos as the inlet and channel capacity of the near surface sewer system would also be overwhelmed thus as the return period increases up to 10 years the storms with shorter durations up to 6 h that result in different peak runoffs however result in similar peak inflows that route to tarp and interceptors as the event prolongs the volume was more evenly distributed featuring a much smaller peak and more symmetrical shape accordingly the storage capacity of the system is better utilized while the conveyance is not a universal constraint although the local inadequacy may still exist as cso is not completely eliminated even though there is remaining active storage with tarp2 storage the results identified that the conveyance capacity of the system for sub daily storms would be reached for 5 year storms and the storage capacity of the 24 h storm would be reached for 10 100 year storms herein the storage capacity refers to the static storage of the tunnel and reservoir i e 43 7 106 m3 without considering the dynamic pumping to wrps the system performances to curb csos were further evaluated diagnostically using the proposed measures of three pis as of eq 6 to eq 4 see fig 10 the original data based on metroflow simulations were complemented by data from fitted curve based on least squares for tarp1 both storage and conveyance become performance constraint in case of more intense storms of shorter durations therefore pi n a tends to be greater for storms of longer durations and more evenly distributed temporally while for tarp2 the pi n a and pi s have a much wider range of variation which indicates the additional storage of reservoir 10 bg would substantially improve the system performance for the full spectrum of expected storm conditions also pi t has been reduced evidently which implies the durations of cso events have been shortened however more intense storms i e 100 year return period with durations longer than 6 h will inevitably result in extensive overflows throughout the system as both the design storage and conveyance capacities have been universally exceeded overall the system performance degrades as the storm intensity increases a turning point at 5 year storms of and pi s curves may suggest that the peak rain intensities resulting in the design peak flow rate the latter would activate tarp or exceed the diversion capacity of the interceptor extensively the similar low values of pi n a for both storage scenarios for storms with ari greater than 10 years further suggest that the conveyance become almost a universal constraint throughout the system as a result additional storage can only be utilized within a limited extent thus no significant improvement or mitigation effect is produced the fact that fig 10s showing the three pis do not vary continuously with respect to either rainfall parameter indicates that none of these three indicators denoting the system performance are solely governed by rainfall characteristics even the geometric and physical properties of the system remain invariant the hydraulic performance is dynamically determined by the flow conditions in the system thus requiring the transport equation to be solved numerically for unsteady flow analysis as well as varying boundary conditions 4 2 real time simulation and analysis for historical extreme events figs 11 presented the computed total inflows to tarp and interceptor and the resultant cso discharges for the aforementioned three phases of system storage the storm of 9 12 14 08 resulted in an average areal precipitation of 17 76 cm 6 99 inches over a 62 h period and had a maximum hourly precipitation of 1 73 cm 0 68 inches the event total and average intensity correspond to a ari of 50 to 100 years i e annual exceedance probability between 2 to 1 bauer et al 2016 bonnin et al 2006 the pre tarp scenario resulted in a total of 47 59 106 m3 of csos the tarp1 scenario resulted in a substantially reduced amount of 29 00 106 m3 and the tarp2 further reduced this amount to 4 44 106 m3 as a result of the increased storage capacity the interceptor sewer and tarp2 system is predicted to capture up to 93 77 of the combined inflows which increased the pi s of interceptor system with tarp1 by 158 3 similarly pi t is reduced from 1 91 to 0 53 namely the cso duration is drastically reduced from nearly double the storm duration to half of it the peak flow rates that discharge to the river were attenuated by 22 1 and 92 2 with tarp1 and tarp2 storage respectively compared to the value before tarp was built see fig 11 and table 3 the event resulted in a total of 78 09 106 m3 inflow which exhausted the storage capacity of tarp1 and even tarp2 at the end of the event i e 60 h see fig 12 a as the combined sewage filled up the tunnels and the projected mccook reservoir to their control levels specified by the aforementioned rtc the sluice gates to gated dropshafts were closed no further flows can be diverted to those segments of tarp thus result in overflows to the river the high head pumps released the additional inflows i e continuing received via the ungated dropshaft that the system cannot handle and retained the hgl in the tunnels and or wsel in the reservoir within the safe operational range during the passage of the storm the isohyetal patterns were shown in fig 13 along with the distributed cso volumes predicted by metroflow for the scenarios with tarp1 and tarp2 two centers were identified with the highest rainfall totals one in the central northern to northwestern suburbs and the other over the southern suburbs it may be noted that with the development of sensor network flow meter readings might be retrieved in the future to further verify the model but by the time the model was developed and this study was carried out such data was not available therefore point by point validation was not provided but to give a sense of the model accuracy the cso occurrences monitored by mwrdgc 2018 are presented for comparison purposes table 4 for clarity in presentation since cso outfalls are typically located nearby their associated dropshafts the total cso volumes i e the sum would be used if multiple cso outfalls are associated with one dropshaft were related to the geographical feature of a dropshaft as an attribute the cso volumes are presented using the quantile classification method thus each class consists of equal numbers of representative cso features metroflow predicted with tarp1 storage 100 dropshafts were reported with cso activated during the storm consistent with the numerical predictions cso events were reported at cso outfalls adjacent to 86 of these 100 dropshafts by mwrdgc 2018 as shown in fig 13 a thus metroflow was found to accurately predict the cso activities throughout the system in response to severe storms such as the one in september 2008 a process based program like metroflow might facilitate efficient implementation of sensor network concentrated in the areas of higher risks predicted which in turn return measurements to further improve the accuracy of the model with tarp2 this number is dramatically reduced to 13 accordingly pi n a is increased from 0 46 to 0 94 compared to the tarp1 scenario see fig 13a where 40 activated cso outfalls resulted in more than 120 103 m3 of total volume fig 13 b shows that with tarp2 storage 80 of the activated cso outfalls resulted in less than 58 103 m3 the results also highlighted that the cso outfalls adjacent to dropshaft mds 27 resulted in total 3 1 106 m3 cso volume which contributes to 70 of the system total cso volume even as per projected mccook reservoir fully in operation this finding is also consistent with the monitored cso frequency as observed in fig 2 which the localized operations of the pumps may explain the dwfs are intercepted by the mwrdgc interceptor sewers and directed to racine avenue ps where depending on the wet well level determined by water level at control nodes in cs tarp model low head dwf or high head wwf pumps lift flow to the stickney wrp via a interceptor sewer as a result the wwf from the interceptors are initially conveyed to the stickney wrp via racine avenue pss flows exceeding the dwf pumping capacity are diverted to deep tunnels if and when tarp reaches storage capacity the sluice gates to dropshafts are closed and the treatment capacity of stickney wrp is reached high head pumps start to pump csos to the south fork of the south branch sfsb of chicago river in cases of intense precipitation when the capacity of tarp and the treatment capacity of stickney wrp are still unavailable the dwf pumps are also changed to pump combined sewage to sfsb instead such a practice substantially reduces the spread of csos in the system and fully utilizes the available storage capacity of nearby treatment facilities i e stickney wrp however in case of extreme events the current treatment capacity of stickney wrp with additional storage rendered by tarp1 and even tarp2 is still not sufficient to capture the excess wwf and result in csos with a relatively high concentration of pollutants directly released to sfsb which further directs much attention to the water quality of this particular branch of chicago river alp and melching 2009 sinha et al 2013 quijano et al 2017 due to this type of localized variability in both structures and operations individual models developed for each subsystem based on best available data are found to be necessary to capture spatially distributed cso characteristics accurately figs 11 and table 3 also compare the performances of the entire system at capturing csos for the four storms varying by durations intensities and temporal structures first the two storms in september 2008 and july 2010 resemble each other regarding durations and peak intensities both of them overwhelmed the storage capacity of the tunnels and even the projected reservoir see fig 12 the latter resulted in an extremely high rise of the hgl in the tunnels and filled up the reservoir to its control level in about 30 h after the storm initiated although the rainfall total of the former is greater the latter s flashier behavior led to larger amount of surface runoff with a sharper peak flow rate via the css to the interceptor sewer and tarp system as a result both pi n a and pi s of the latter are consistently lower for all the three simulated storage scenarios as shown in the hyetographs of fig 11b most of the rain fell within 20 to 40 h after the storm commenced with a sharp peak and retained high intensity the runoff hydrograph routed through the sewer system highly resembled the precipitation pattern as the lag time due to travel time in the overland region and the abstraction of rainfall in the basin with substantially reduced perviousness due to urbanization is trivial the resultant sewer inflows overburdened the diversion capacity of the interceptors and the conveyance capacity of tarp as a result the system is more susceptible to storms of such a shape as not only the storage capacity but also the conveyance capacity constrains the system s performance to effectively capture csos which is consistent with the diagnostic analysis presented in section 4 1 before the implementation of tarp the interceptor sewer system is predicted to only capture up to 33 of combined sewer flows resulting from such type of storm even with tarp 2 the system still discharges 18 as csos from 38 i e a number of 80 cso outfalls the 7 22 23 11 event consisted of a small storm that occurred in the first 20 h followed by a larger storm with a sharp peak as high as 2 94 cm hr the highest peak intensity among the four storms during the first 10 h upon the commencement of the latter similar to the 7 23 25 10 event the highly flash behavior of the storm resulted in large amount of inflows rapidly flushing into interceptor and tarp which overwhelms the conveyance capacity of the tunnels as a result the available storage of the reservoir cannot be fully utilized to capture the csos as shown in fig 12c the similar temporal structure of the hyetograph results in similar system responses as a result pi s for the event in july 2011 did not exceed 85 and pi n a did not exceed 0 54 nevertheless the implementation and fully completion of tarp would have substantially reduced the system duration of cso to as low as 30 of the storm duration other flood producing storms are the ones that comprise a series of moderately intense showers and thunderstorms huff and angel 1989 such as the event that occurred in april 2013 fig 11d this event resulted in an average of 13 5 cm rainfall for 48 h with a smaller event followed by a larger event the smaller storm retained the drainage basin in a pre saturated condition the entire event produced a comparable total amount of inflows as the one that occurred in july 2010 table 3 however at a much smaller intensity with a peak at 1 37 cm hr the interceptor system can divert 56 of the inflows in addition the system has sufficient conveyance capacity to distribute inflows throughout the tunnel system therefore with additional storage provided by mccook reservoir i e tarp2 the integrated system is predicted to capture up to 99 of the estimated combined sewer flows and the pi t is reduced to 0 21 both indicating the best performances among the four events furthermore it demonstrates that the projected tarp system would be resilient to moderate intense storms of extended durations and adequate to divert almost all the resultant overflows as the storm prolongs the performance would be further governed by the active storage in the reservoir which also depends on the pump operational rules that control the outflow rates to dewater the reservoir also see fig 1b this study presented a total of 29 storms 25 design 4 historical and 62 simulations 50 for the former 12 for the latter which collectively suggest that cso is a combined function of the precipitation and drainage system these simulations are in the position to fill the data need of cso discharges in responses to extreme events which rarely exist but play an important role in water quality assessment a systematic analytic method is proposed to compile process and assess the system performance based on the cluster of cso results the results might be case specific and were inherently tied to the local operations or structural variability as narrated however the underlying control mechanisms meteorologically and hydraulically that lead to overflow are generalizable and transferable to other urban drainage systems the pis hgl and system inflows predicted by metroflow may further facilitate a multi criteria decision analysis in future work to optimize the system operations furthermore metroflow s model framework allows the factors that govern the deep tunnel system performance as a mitigation plan including rainfall characteristics and rtc rules of the inlet gates and pumps to be assessed separately for the multiple modeling layers cost benefit analysis and the treatment capacity of receiving treatment plants may also be taken into account to maximize the flood and pollution control benefits 5 conclusions the rapid development and expansion of urbanization have made the infrastructure system in cities especially the megacities like chicago in the us sophisticated to understand and model in this study a multi layer based and multi approach coupled modeling program metroflow was introduced to emulate the hierarchy of major h h processes that would occur across the interconnected drainage basins in metropolitan areas where complex and evolving drainage systems are present this modeling strategy proved both efficient and effective accounting for increasing urbanization and upgrading infrastructure with complex connections the entire system was subdivided to three layers for modeling purposes the probabilistic based iuhm was adopted to model layer i for the subcatchments located in the suburbs of chicago to account for the incomplete sewer network data the h h model developed at neighborhood scale across the city of chicago city model for layer i was adopted to account for the looping feature and complex connections within the network due to the long history of development finally the cs tarp model built upon the conduit model in infoworks cs was adopted for layer ii iii for the entire study area namely layer iii is the target model layer and the cs tarp model is considered the operational model to receive the input from the other two models and output any system responses due to weather structural or operational input changes the coupled h h models were demonstrated to be capable of predicting the combined sewer inflows resulting from a full spectrum of rainfall conditions especially recorded extreme events the amount dynamically captured by the drainage systems and mitigation plans such as tarp in chicago and ultimately the resultant cso characteristics the cluster of results collectively suggest that rainstorm driven csos are complex functions of a spatio temporal characteristics of rainfall b the hydraulic performance of wastewater infrastructures as well as c the operations of the regulators and or hydraulic structures reflect this to the iuds in the city of chicago the three terms relate to the tunnel conveyance capacity and catchment hydrology and determine the hydraulic conditions in the tunnel system and the storage capacities in the reservoir thus have direct impact on csos the intercomparison between historical intense storms that would be relevant for cso producing and reservoir filling reveals that a downpour like storms with flash characteristics lead to relatively more csos in terms of spread and volume i e pi n a and pi s due to overwhelmed local conveyance capacities b better system performances were predicted for storms with moderate intensity with more uniform temporal distribution even at prolonged duration c these storms typically lasted over 48 h to fill the projected reservoir the fine scale hourly and sub hourly rainfall temporal structure attributed to distinctive system responses and cso abatement performances despite the varying system performances due to rainfall characteristics the comparative study considering three structural scenarios showed consistent improvement of cso abatement using the introduced pis as evaluation criteria with increasing conveyance and storage provided by the deep tunnel system the projected system is predicted to capture 24 h storm of return periods up to 10 years i e pi s 85 therefore metroflow s framework may facilitate the assessment of structural and operational measures given the existing system as a baseline condition furthermore the enclosed extreme storm studies may also shed light on the design and operation of resilient wastewater infrastructure systems as well as implementation of green infrastructures as supplementary alternatives to the existing gray ones in urban areas where the risks to the ecosystem from more intense ari 10 years flash floods remains a primary concern broadly thinking metroflow aims for a way to promote collaborative modeling so that community scale models and or models that are developed at different times using diverse methods and

3976,many earlier developed and densely populated metropolises served by combined sewer systems have been implementing additional stormwater control measures to reduce the impacts of combined sewer overflows cso driven by severe rainstorms these mitigation measures call for robust modeling strategies to assess the overall performance before development and to predict vulnerabilities and examine the underlying mechanisms causing them during or after development in a systematic manner this paper first introduces a hydrologic and hydraulic coupled modeling program metroflow that interacts and integrates multiple models built via diverse methods and tools a typical integrated urban drainage system iuds in the greater land area of chicago in the us was investigated as a testbed in addition a large scale tunnel and reservoir plan in construction was evaluated as a mitigation measure to alleviate cso risks in this effort three models were coupled into metroflow to account for the best available data of the multiple structural layers involved in this evolving system hydrological responses were analyzed under existing and projected system conveyance and storage capacities considering the full spectrum of rainfall conditions employing synthetic storms and real time simulations of four historical extreme events to account for the anomalies exemplified by individual natural events the overall effectiveness and resilience of the system were further assessed by the evaluation of normalized performance indicators pis quantifying the reduction of total volume duration and spread of csos the cluster of simulation results collectively suggests that a the proposed structural layer based modeling approach is applicable in reproducing distributed rainstorm driven csos for an evolving iuds based on emerging digital physical data b cso characteristics are rather multivariate functions of the rainfall tempo spatial characteristics as well as the hydraulic performance of the collection system and c consistent improvement of cso abatement was predicted with increasing conveyance and storage provided by the deep tunnel system the projected system is predicted to capture 24 h storms of return period up to 10 years metroflow s framework may also promote collaborative modeling in which community scale models can be utilized and merged to support extended scale water and wastewater infrastructure planning design and management keywords urban drainage modeling stormwater control measures combined sewer overflows extreme storms deep tunnel system mitigation measures 1 introduction wastewater and stormwater are both major water based flows of concern for urban infrastructure development combined sewer systems csss were largely constructed in older cities densely populated worldwide to collect and convey both wastewater and stormwater to reduce the city s vulnerabilities to floods and pollution in general a typical css usually connects to an intercepting sewer system that routes primarily dry weather flow dwf to water reclamation plants wrp before releasing the effluent to nearby watercourses such a system also known as integrated urban drainage system iuds may be cost effective during relatively dry weather however will inevitably result in sewer surcharge to the streets and overflows to nearby water courses during moderate to severe rainstorms the untreated wastewater and stormwater discharges also known as combined sewer overflows cso further result in serious water quality degradation and public health threats due to bacterial and or viral contamination fu et al 2019 usepa et al 1999 usepa 2008 which has been extensively examined via numerical modeling and monitoring efforts accordingly miskewitz and uchrin 2013 montserrat et al 2015

gates which are used to control the outflow rates screen and prevent backflow from the river due to the long time span and expensive nature of any alike large scale structural solutions numerical modeling and simulation efforts are demanded to assess the performance of the engineering design prior to the development and identify any remaining vulnerabilities due to severe weather events in a real time manner amid or after the construction several modeling packages are available for modeling an entire urban drainage system uds utilizing digital geophysical data for example swmm and infoswmm models allow the inclusion of both catchment hydrology and sewer hydraulics within the same model but requires detailed physical data of the entire sewer system similarly commercial models such as mike flood mike urban xpswmm and infoworks icm can be used to integrate surface hydrology sewer hydraulics and waterway interactions however these tools suffer from the disadvantage that they are not extensible to incorporate additional functionality and or account for incomplete physical data cantone et al 2011 meanwhile such development and evolution of urban drainage infrastructure have resulted in a highly complex system featuring multiple interconnected structural layers see fig 5 with numerous hydraulic connections therefore may not be optimal to solve in a single model luo et al 2014 additionally as the scale of the domain and complexity of the architecture increases a single model may only be achieved at the cost of more modeling simplifications to retain computational efficiency and stability for example wu et al 2016 developed a swmm based model for donghaochong basin including the existing drainage network and a designed pilot of guangzhou deep tunnel system in which the tunnels were generalized to one conduit and the drop structures were simplified to orifices by formularization and parameterization of flow control and energy dissipation similarly huang et al 2019 employed a further simplified swmm based model to evaluate the urban flooding mitigation by the inclusion of the planned deep tunnel system which was further reduced to a storage unit previously in studies on risk assessment and performance evaluation of a planned deep tunnel system design storms with return periods up to 10 years were generally employed wu et al 2016 huang et al 2019 considering the design criteria of uds however the more extreme rainfall events 25 year to 100 year recurrences can cause serious localized as well as widespread flooding uds to overflow reservoirs to fill and even the waterways to rise to flood stage huff and angel 1992 changnon and vogel 1981 reported that the type of rainstorm that most frequently produces flash floods and csos in illinois and largely the us are the ones very localized resulting in large amounts of rainfall in short duration i e less than 72 h moreover large metropolitan areas such as chicago are more susceptible to tremendous property and life damage from such severe storms huff and angel 1989 markus et al 2012 as a result the overall cso abatement of the deep tunnel system may be further influenced by the rainfall spatio temporal structure of isolated extreme events in addition recent climate studies indicates potential increase in frequency of intense storms byun and hamlet 2018 usgcrp 2017 making it imperative to analyze the impacts of more extreme storm events when to evaluate the performance of a uds especially the impact of a mitigation measure aiming for city vulnerability to weather extremity is to be assessed sandoval et al 2013 reported monitored rainfall and cso events in berlin germany to establish the correlation between rainfall and cso characteristics and to identify which rainfall parameters are the most relevant to cso characteristics canonical correlation derived from partial least squares pls regression in this study indicated that the maximum and average rainfall intensities seem the most influential variables to predict cso water quantity and pollutant loads other authors reported predictions of cso hydraulic behavior as a function of rainfall parameters including intensity duration and totals montserrat et al 2015 mailhot et al 2015 yu et al 2013 yu et al 2018 mainly using statistical approaches such as conditional regression trees cluster analysis or regression models regardless of the fact that these data driven models and statistical alternatives can be useful for exploring the influence of rainfall on cso characteristics and establishing the thresholds for cso occurrences solely based on rainfall parameters the prediction quality of cso characteristics could be undermined by the variability of outflow control structures as well as the uncertainties and scarcity of continuous cso monitoring data lacour et al 2009 moreover yu et al 2013 examined 100 rainfall events and over 60 outfalls in a japanese city however found a poor correlation between cso behavior and rainfall this study also illuminates that cso behavior is rather a multivariate function of precipitation the overland and underdrain conditions therefore a systematic prediction of csos in a real time manner and or a full assessment of a large scale and complex iuds to control csos still requires integrated hydrologic and hydraulic h h modeling simulation results from a robust physical process based model may also complement the stormwater measurements which further advances the development of data driven or predictive models hu et al 2018 yu et al 2013 therefore this study first introduces a modeling program metroflow that takes an integrated approach to emulate urban drainage systems by utilizing less complex models that represent interconnected structural layers such as catchment hydrology sewers connecting structures and csos these models can be developed and tested independently by domain specific tools engineers and or researchers the models are linked together in metroflow to provide communications between the models by treating them as black box components by specifying inputs and outputs at their interfaces in this way metroflow facilitates understanding of the entire set of hydrologic and hydraulic processes and their interactions while balancing the computational cost metroflow was then utilized to assess the system performance of an evolving iuds in greater chicago land area to curb csos using a scenario based approach multiple performance indicators are introduced to quantify cso characteristics in terms of their spreads durations and volumes finally cso characteristics and system performances versus the rainfall tempo spatial characteristics were analyzed based on a cluster of simulation results using historical extreme storm events and synthetic storms constructed considering a full spectrum of regional storm conditions the enclosed quantitative analyses may unravel the remaining risks and the underlying mechanisms causing them in response to varying storm conditions with emphasis on extreme events on track to increase across most of the us by the end of the century usgcrp 2017 city planners and water managers can use this tool to further explore operational strategies to maximize the flood and pollution control in addition to cso abatement benefits of a deep tunnel system and to seek supplementary measures in the zones of concentrated risks metroflow s model framework may also facilitate collaborative modeling so that community scale models developed using diverse methods and or tools can be utilized and merged to support extended scale water and waster infrastructure planning design and management 2 background and materials 2 1 system overview the wastewater treatment facilities the completion of a series of hydraulic structures that reverse the flow of chicago river which originally flowed into lake michigan the primary drinking water supply of the city and the adoption of the deep tunnel system make chicago s uds one of the most advanced infrastructures for pollution and flood control worldwide lanyon 2016 the csss collect both sanitary flows and stormwater runoffs from a total area of 971 km2 375 mi2 across the city of chicago and 51 suburbs interceptor sewers were constructed afterwards in the length of over 400 miles to convey primarily dry weather flows dwf to wrps before releasing the effluent to chicago area waterway system caws however in case of heavy storm events wet weather flow wwf in excess of the diversion capacity to the interceptor may reverse into residential basements streets and discharges to nearby caws fig 2 shows that the system is observed to overflow up to 178 h annually based on the frequency analysis of cso activities reported by mwrdgc 2018 the most active cso outfalls i e 10 of the total cso outfalls that overflow 78 to 178 h annually are along the south fork of branch of chicago river north branch of the chicago river and chicago sanitary and ship canal moreover the current operation practice allows the high flow in caws during extreme storm events to be released to lake michigan via lakefront controlling structures i e locks and gates at locations shown in fig 3 reversing the normal flow direction as marked to mitigate flooding risks in the city as a result the resultant csos to caws pose direct hazards to the primary drinking water source in addition to the local waterways the tunnel and reservoir system consists of four subsystems with 175 km 109 mi tunnels which run parallel to the rivers and culminate in three suburban reservoirs also known as the tunnel and reservoir plan tarp as shown in fig 3 tarp is a joint project developed by mwrdgc and the us army corps of engineers usace the tunnels range in size between 2 7 m and 10 m in diameter and were constructed between 45 8 m to 106 7 m below grade in solid rock the attached reservoirs are built to provide flood relief by storing the stormwater conveyed by the tunnels and the contents within will be pumped to nearest wrps for treatment immediately after a rainstorm four wrps discharge treated sewage effluent into the rivers including the largest one in the world the stickney wrp by 2029 the entire system is projected to provide a total of 21 billion gallons of storage and to intercept 369 permitted csos in the entire css serviced area 2 2 summary of input data prior to the development of the hydrological and hydraulic models multiple arcgis layers of geospatial databases were developed and built into physical databanks pdb to provide a digital description of the physical characteristics of the study area including the sewer network deep tunnels and associated connecting structures and regulators other inputs include precipitation flow monitoring as well operational and maintenance data as tabulated in table 1 the required hydrological input primarily consists of two major parts i digitized municipal sewer atlas and delineated subcatchments i e service areas as shown in fig 4 draining to each outlet pipe routing to the sewer system and ii topographical and hydrologic characteristics of the catchment such as drainage area and shape slope length percentage of imperviousness roughness and depression storage the primary data source is the department of water management dwm sewer gis which is currently maintained by the city s business and information services department the city uses the nad 1983 illinois east feet projection and chicago city datum ccd as a vertical datum the hydrologic parameters for delineated catchments were largely extracted based on chicago metropolitan agency for planning land use data 1 3 arc second 10 meters digital elevation model dem of illinois from the us geological survey seamless data distribution system soil map data ssurgo database for the state of illinois from the natural resource conservation service of the us department of agriculture and aerial photography gis tools and aerial photos were used to calculate the impervious coverage of each subcatchment main hydraulic inputs include i geographical locations reference elevations of the tunnels storage reservoir and hydraulic structures including the entrance and exit sections ii and geometry i e type and size and topology description of the connections to other components or layers of the system i e to distribute the flow between the near surface sewers and the deep tunnel system and iii operational limits e g maximum gate opening gate opening rate etc in addition the hydraulic data obtained by synthesizing the data for individual components of the tarp system to determine conveyance of each major structure include i coefficients required for hydraulic calculations ii stage storage relationships for each connecting structure the databases were developed and further quality assured and quality controlled qa qc based on the sewer atlas sheets and as built structural contract drawings provided by mwrdgc and municipalities 2 3 study area this study uses the urban catchments that feed the mainstream des plaines ms dp tarp system encompassing most of city of chicago and evanston with a total drainage area of 409 km2 and an average subcatchment area of 5 37 x 104 m2 and 37 northern and western suburbs with a total drainage area of 168 km2 and an average subcatchment area 1 08 x 106 m2 see fig 4a as a case study ms dp tunnel systems completed in 2006 are the largest subsystems of tarp and merge into mccook reservoir which is projected to provide additional 37 8 x 106 m3 10 bg by 2029 usace et al 2013 the subcatchments within the city of chicago have an area averaged imperviousness as high as 63 and such value for the service areas in the suburbs is approximately 40 see fig 4b the mainstream system consists of 157 dropshafts and 65 2 km of deep tunnels ranging in size from 4 0 to 10 0 m and are located as much as 97 5 m below ground level the des plaines system is comprised of 50 dropshafts and 41 2 km deep tunnels ranging in size between 3 0 m to 10 0 m in diameter and are located as deep as 76 2 m below ground level stormwater and wastewater collected in ms dp tarp system are lifted via three major pumping stations i e mainstream pump station mainstream ps racine avenue ps and north branch ps as annotated in fig 3 and and thereafter conveyed to the nearby o brien wrp treatment capacity of 1 7 x 106 m3 or 450 mgd and stickney wrp capacity of 5 5x 106 m3 or 1440 mgd for treatment in addition to the combined sewage conveyed by interceptor sewers the racine avenue ps and north branch ps may also lift excess flow diverted from interceptor resulted from severe storms and release to the rivers directly when the capacity of tarp is reached 2 4 precipitation data quality controlled 10 min precipitation data for historical storms was obtained from cook county precipitation network ccpn operated by the illinois state water survey isws ccpn is a relatively dense raingage network consisting of 25 gauges in the entire cook county spaced 10 km apart and 13 of them are in the study area as shown in fig 4a this study analyzed the four most intense storm events reported in cook county during wy 2008 to wy 2016 on 9 12 14 08 7 23 25 10 7 22 23 11 and 4 17 18 13 bauer et al 2016 these four storm events were also reported by mwdgc with record high reversal flows to lake michigan due to rising river level mainly as a result of high cso discharges mwrdgc 2019 due to the spatial variation of the intense precipitation across the study area the thiessen polygon method as illustrated in fig 4a was used to determine the relative contribution of each raingauge to each dropshaft service area the same interpolation is applied to all storm events to exclude any inter storm bias due to the interpolation scheme despite of the spatial variation between the dropshaft service areas the rainfall within an individual service area was assumed to be uniform for computational efficiency precipitation frequency data was compiled via the precipitation frequency data server developed by the united states national oceanic and atmospheric administration noaa atlas 14 bonnin et al 2006 based on frequency analysis of partial duration series pds using the method of l moments a network average is obtained between the 10 stations maintained by national centers for environmental information formerly known as national climatic data center ncdc available in the study area fig 4a the resultant precipitation frequency analysis is shown in fig 8 it has been pointed out that a stationary climate assumption may lead to an underestimation of extreme precipitation due to growing extreme climatic events also nonstationary precipitation idf curves were introduced by other authors cheng and aghakouchak 2014 sarhadi and soulis 2017 yan et al 2021 given the wide range of uncertainties that might arise using different methods and the fact that noaa atlas 14 approach has been widely accepted for infrastructure design thus this data was selected for a wide computation range including extreme events up to 500 years to account for potential increasing risks 3 methods 3 1 a structural layer based modeling approach following the structural evolution of the drainage system the entire system may be considered as three layers the overland region or sewershed and the near surface css layer i the interceptors layer ii and the deep tunnel system layer iii see fig 5 distinct from previous practices instead of simplifying the structures in each layer and the connections between multiple layers to fit in a single model the relative independence of each layer may be utilized by proper handling of the divisions and connections between them therefore this study considers layer i layer iii and its connections to layer i ii separately as a result the urban catchments with sewer networks deep tunnels and the storage reservoir with the receiving and regulating structures controlling the flow direction and rates to interceptors dropshafts and cso outfalls were modeled independently accordingly the following assumptions were adopted along with the 1 d modeling work a according to the time and length scales identified in urban catchments precipitation overland flow infiltration depression storage surface runoff and the sewer were considered as the most important hydrologic processes at the urban scale of interest kalma and sivapalan 1995 thus were accounted for also see fig 1a b the minor interactions and feedback between the aforementioned three layers were ignored that said no backflow is allowed from the deeper layer to the near surface system or from waterways to the sewer system this approach also allows any updates and modifications to the existing plans and structures and or other human interventions to alter hydrologic properties to be implemented only in the targeted layer for example new urbanization developments and green infrastructures should be modeled in layer i hence only alter the source of storm and wastewater and the total inflows to layer ii iii from the cso modeling perspective furthermore this approach allows different structural layers to be controlled separately with user defined operational control rules for example if the precipitation remains unvaried the inflows routed via csss would stay the same thus only the hydraulic performance i e conveyance and storage capacity and control rules in layer ii and layer iii would affect the csos this approach drastically reduces the amount of physical data and control rules that would need to be engined in one model hence improves the computational stability and efficiency metroflow is a holistic modeling program written in c an object oriented programming language and in which the interfaces are abstract constructs that contain no actual programming code and are the key features of the c language that allows extensibility metroflow operates through packages which are a collection of models geometries variables and scenarios a core concept used by metroflow is the software interface a software component interface is a set of operation signatures i e function parameters that defines the complete set of requests that can be sent to the component it can also be thought of as a shared boundary across which two separate components of a software system exchange information this version of metroflow supports software interfaces including swmm infoworks and matlab this framework also allows metroflow to interact with the individual components of a system in a way that does not require the actual type of the component namely the metroflow codebase works with a collection of modellayers which defines properties and functions that a given model component must implement therefore the program facilitates layer based model development and integrates the interconnected sub systems to a provide a way for a suite of models to interact sequentially and b to allow continuous simulation of an integrated drainage system such as the one in the greater chicago area and the physical processes involved i e fig 1a in a tightly coupled manner the following three models were built into metroflow a the infoworks cs model city model solving the subcatchments and underneath sewer system i e layer i located within city of chicago b the probabilistic based illinois urban hydrologic model iuhm solving layer i located in the suburbs and c the infoworks cs model of the deep tunnels reservoir dropshafts i e layer iii and connections to layer ii and iii cs tarp model for the entire study area fig 1a and 5 in conjunction with fig 6 illustrate the h h processes that each model simulates and the links between the model layers the annotated key methods and or theories adopted in each modeling component is clustered in fig 6 and detailed in the following sections accordingly metroflow allows the following piecewise analyses to be performed sequentially or separately a the transformation from rainfall to runoff in overland regions b the hydraulics and outflows of the combined sewer systems c the unsteady flow distribution between combined sewers interceptor sewer tarp and cso outfalls d the hydraulics of tarp and connecting structures the real time operations of pumps and regulating structures 3 1 1 illinois urban hydrologic model iuhm due to the limited documentation of the municipal csss earlier developed outside city of chicago see the division shown in fig 4a e g the majority of systems were missing conduit slopes and diameters in some cases only the layout of the combined sewer system was available the iuhm was adopted for its capability to predict the hydrologic response and associated uncertainties in highly heterogeneous catchments with limited input and calibration data following the procedures by cantone et al 2011 to guide the readers the key methodology may be summarized as follows the iuhm contains a state space model which characterizes each conduit of the sewer system by a conduit state x ci and the overland flow region draining to a conduit by an overland state x oi where i is the catchment order based on strahler ordering scheme rodríguez iturbe and valdés 1979 the modified ordering allows for the merging of conduits in series without an increase in conduit order to be noted this ordering scheme requires the network to be dendritic such that the stormwater collected by the sewer system is assumed to travel successively from low order to higher order pipes an example has been illustrated in fig 7 a the combined sewer network contributing to each dropshaft consists of hundreds of inlets and conduits with limited information the probabilistic basis of the model allows using representative values based on the statistics of the available information if any of the parameters are missing the overland region is further divided into pervious and impervious portions which facilitates the evaluation of hydrologic response driven by excessive rainfall this division significantly decreases the number of rainfall flow paths that need to be modeled to a finite number 2 ω where ω is the highest order of the pipe in the catchment also known as the order of the catchment according to the probability p w where w denotes a random flow path and w w w is the path space w x oi perv x oi imp x ci x cj x ω i 1 2 ω the channel flow in the i th order conduit considers both external flow from the inlets and inflow from lower order conduits unlike deterministic modeling the iuhm formulation estimates the travel times for each state x k probabilistically following the geomorphologic instantaneous unit hydrograph giuh lee and yen 1997 by assuming a probability density function pdf f xk t with a mean value t x k t it is important to note that t and t are distinct time related to rainfall intensity i t and travel time pdf i e f xk t respectively thus the travel time distribution is driven by the i t herein an exponential distribution was chosen for both overland flow and channel or conduit flow states as 1 f x k t 1 t x k t exp t t x k t the mean travel time t x k t is computed hydraulically using the kinematic wave assumption derived by lee and yen 1997 and the flood wave function given by cappelaere 1997 the network impulse function of the catchment is derived as follows 2 u t t w w f x o i perv t f x oi imp t f x ci t f x cj t f x c ω t p w where denotes a convolution integral the primary output of iuhm is the direct runoff hydrograph for each catchment derived as follows 3 q t t 1 u t t q lw t a where a is the total area of the catchment and q lw t is the equivalent pervious excess rainfall which is determined by the depression storage for both pervious and impervious flow regions and the infiltration rate f t for pervious regions thus q lw t is assumed to be zero until all the depression is filled for pervious regions q lw t i t f t where f t is assumed to be uniform and determined by the green and ampt method green 1911 and for impervious regions q lw t i t afterwards 3 1 2 city of chicago combined sewer model city model as the city of chicago has grown with increased urbanization and population relief sewers have been added to the existing system to ease basement flooding resulting in a highly looped system i e allow for relief in the system with many interconnections rather than a dendritic system as assumed in iuhm in addition the flow diversions were added downstream to split the flow between interceptors and dropshafts metroflow incorporates a detailed h h model developed on the platform of infoworks cs by associates for the dwm to determine the total flows collected via the css across the city luo et al 2019 this model is based on a simplified representation of the system which covers all sewers 0 6 m in diameter and larger compared to the sewersheds in the suburbs modeled by iuhm the drainage areas within the city is characterized by higher degree of heterogeneity thus a finer delineation to the neighborhood scale is adopted as shown in fig 4a statistically the entire watershed was divided into subcatchments ranging from 1 36 103 m2 to 7 16 105 m2 with a median size of 4 7 104 m2 as shown in fig 4 the model adopted a dual drainage concept in which the drainage areas are delineated to distribute storm runoff and dry weather flows to appropriate locations in the sub network typically near the center of the catchment a swmm routing model i e nonlinear reservoir is utilized to simulate the rainfall runoff process in which the infiltration lost on the pervious area is estimated using horton s infiltration model the hydrodynamics in the sewers is computed utilizing a conduit model same as the one used in the cs tarp modeling layer more details are given in the cs tarp section 3 1 3 dry weather flow estimation dry weather flow consumes conveyance capability of the sewer system during wet weather therefore should be accounted for in the modeling process iuhm estimate sanitary dry weather inflows using parameters based on the special contributing area loading program developed by the usace et al 2017 for lake michigan diversion accounting for subcatchments modeled by the city model wastewater profiles were developed based on wrp flow monitoring data during identified dry days and water consumption data from dwm the dwfs were estimated as the sum of foul flow and trade flow which include residential commercial and industrial wastewater flows in the sewer system for each subcatchment for subcatchments modeled by iuhm the dry weather flow is calculated as part of the preprocessing and appended to the simulated runoff as the total outflow from each subcatchment thus the outflows obtained from each outlet from both models are the sums of both sanitary inflows and stormwater runoff 3 1 4 connecting structure tarp cs tarp model the mainstream des plaines tarp system consists of 207 dropshafts and over 400 connecting structures that vary in topology design and geometry besides some dropshafts have multiple connections to the csss and overflow to different cso outfalls and a single connecting structure may include multiple regulating structures that divert the inflow into different directions thus a generic connecting structure model is neither feasible nor capable of allocating the transient flows in the system accurately the cs tarp model first introduced by luo et al 2014 integrated tremendous efforts to interpret the as built structural drawings in terms of hydraulic modeling components and sub networks centering at each dropshaft the model is built completely from physical data without any calibration in previous studies the model predicted cso discharges had been fed to 3d hydrodynamic models for caws as inflow boundary conditions and the accuracy of these point cso predictions have been validated by the stage measurements at monitored stations the details of these studies can be referred to zhu et al 2017 and quijano et al 2017 as an as built example illustrated in fig 1a figs 7 demonstrate a subsystem centered at a dropshaft i e mds n20 which is a drop structure diverting combined inflows captured in the near surface sewer system to the deep tunnel system see a 3d view of the structure in fig 7b along with vent releasing highly pressurized air due to incoming surge specifically dropshaft mds n20 located in the north branch of mainstream tunnel system receives wwf collected by the sewer network as shown in fig 7a in excess of diversion capacity of the interceptor sewer i e mwrdgc howard 3 through a sluice gate d while the diversion capacity of interceptor is determined by a side weir structure inside connecting structure b mds n20 also acts as a relief for the interceptor sewer when the inflow i e confluence from upstream interceptor pipe and diverting from connecting structure b exceeds the diversion capacity controlled by side weir structure e if and when tarp reaches capacity and the sluice gate d is closed and or the capacity of connecting structure a is exceeded combined sewage overflows into the upper north branch of chicago river through an outfall pipe in addition to the storage provided by connecting structure a b and c the sluice gate d and weir structure e add additional storage via the attached chamber as shown in fig 7b cs tarp model was thereafter developed and tested for hydraulic structure functionality for such individual subsystem using infoworks cs package before merging to one single model to route the simulated inflows dwf wwf output from city model and or iuhm model fig 6 some dropshafts receive inflows from subcatchments both within and outside of the city region via connecting structures to interceptor dropshafts and or cso outfalls an inflow mapping model further bridges the model layers by preprocessing the designated inflow hydrographs from the outflow pipe in iuhm and city model and internally converting to the compatible inflow format that is readable by cs tarp model and related to each receiving structure the conduit model solves one dimensional saint venant equations using preissmann 4 point finite difference scheme preissmann 1961 innovyze 2011 thus is capable of providing unsteady analysis of the flows and hydraulic grade line hgl throughout the system over the course of a storm event a smooth transition between the free surface and surcharged or pressurized flow is rendered by introducing the preissmann slot and using the iterative newton raphson method the implicit nature of the numerical scheme i e implicit euler further assures unconditional stability when entering the pressurized flow condition which is the system norm under extreme storms this capability also facilitates the implementation of real time control rtc rules of the regulators e g gates pumps that follow the operational guidelines as per mwrdgc sharma and serafino 2012 with highlights summarized in the following section the model was supplemented with a number of boundary conditions built in the aforementioned pdb including synthesized stage storage relations describing the attached storage of various control or connecting structures as exemplified in figs 7 and storage reservoir as well as operational rules of the regulators the developed cs tarp model therefore dynamically distributes the inflows captured by csss between interceptors tarp dropshafts and cso outfalls based on boundary conditions in the interceptors and the associated hydraulic structures which are further governed by the geometrical and physical properties and or operations of these structures as well as downstream system states see fig 6 the resultant cso hydrographs are used to calculate the volume and duration of cso discharge from each cso location consistent with the ones as of mwrdgc 2018 3 2 real time control real time control rtc of the iuds can be facilitated if system process variables e g water level and flow rates can be monitored or predicted continuously and used to operate regulators according to the classification of rtc summarized by garcia et al 2015 the rtc strategy adopted for the operation of the tarp system are rule based algorithms these algorithms determine the appropriate control actions according to the rules developed by considering possible operational scenarios that can occur zimmer et al 2018 these operations control the sluice gates openings to the dropshafts the inlet gate openings to the reservoir and pumping from tarp to nearest treatment plants the rtc module in the cs tarp model specifies a set of global system criteria based on the different hydraulic gradelines hgl at the downstream ends of the tunnel systems as operational objectives the global control levels then take this information to produce the set points for local controllers at each regulator see fig 6 noting that there are approximately 35 of the dropshafts are ungated as a result the excessive inflows may continue to raise the hgl across the system while the global control level is reached and the sluice gates are closed and excluding the excessive flows from entering the system via the gated dropshafts in this study to facilitate a worst scenario cso analysis in the city model the rtc module sets all sluice gates to tarp fully open assuming tarp has adequate or available storage at the time of storm thus no additional outlet control at the downstream ends i e free outfall is imposed in layer i besides flow restrictors are typically located at the inlets to control flow rates locally entering the sewer system this approach allows all inflows to the system i e wwf dwf to be routed and further distributed within the cs tarp layer which also facilitates a quantitative evaluation of tarp as a mitigation plan of csos such rtc rules or boundary conditions can be easily modified when the city model is used as a standalone tool to examine street and basement flooding issues luo et al 2019 these control rules as per mwrdgc sharma and serafino 2012 are subject to change according to the evolution of the tarp storage with the projected mccook reservoir online the tunnel hgl is further governed by the water surface elevation wsel in the reservoir downstream in order to prevent the tunnels from being extensively over pressurized the sluice gates to mainstream tarp are assumed to close when the tunnel hgl surpasses 17 68 m 58 ft ccd the sluice gates to des plaines tarp are closed when the tunnel hgl surpasses 18 60 m 61ft ccd and the inlet gates to mccook reservoir is assumed to remain fully open no pumping is allowed at the msps i e pumping from mccook reservoir during a storm event 3 3 hydraulic performance indicators previous studies identified that the key variables of a cso event on the receiving water bodies are the number of active point discharging sources the duration and volume alp and melching 2009 mailhot et al 2015 montserrat et al 2015 accordingly this study assesses the overall effectiveness of the system multi phases under designated operations by introducing various dimensionless performance indicators pi quantifying hydraulic performance criteria as follows 4 pi n a 1 n a n t 0 1 5 pi s 1 v cso v in 0 1 6 pi t t cso t r 0 where n a denotes the total number of cso outfalls that actively discharge or overflow during and or immediately after the storm event while n t is the total number of cso outfalls in the system v cso is the total volume of cso resulting from a storm event of the entire system while v in represents the total inflow collected by the combined sewer system and routed to interceptor and tarp system t cso denotes the maximum duration of csos in the system and t r is the storm duration namely pi n a can be considered as a measure of the spatial extent or spread of cso occurrences in the system pi s is a universal measure to evaluate the overall effectiveness of tarp storage at capturing cso pollution finally pi t is used to evaluate the maximum system duration of cso relative to the duration of the storm event the possible range of pi n a and pi s is within 0 to 1 as cso event can extend longer than the storm itself pi t may result in values greater than 1 for pi n a and pi s a value of 1 indicates the best system performance while a smaller value of pi t closer to 0 indicates better system performance 3 4 simulation configurations metroflow was employed as the major tool to perform the hydrological and hydraulic analysis in a coupled manner for the study area as shown in fig 4a the simulations were designed to examine the system in response to a full spectrum of storm conditions that could occur with an emphasis on extreme events first design storm simulations were performed for diagnostic purposes considering various average recurrence interval ari also known as return periods at various durations to facilitate a diagnostic analysis a set of synthetic or design storms were constructed based on regional precipitation frequency and temporal structure varying by durations of the storms berne et al 2004 changnon and vogel 1981 huff and angel 1989 huff and angel 1992 second simulations were performed for the four most intense storm events that occurred in cook county during wy 2008 to wy 2016 on 9 12 14 08 7 23 25 10 7 22 23 11 and 4 17 18 13 bauer et al 2016 for each historical event with the same inflows output from iuhm and city models the cs tarp model was used to simulate three scenarios as follows i zero storage and conveyance from tarp denoted as pre tarp ii the completed conveyance and storage of the tunnels in 2006 i e tarp1 and approximately 6 1 106 m3 or 1 6 bg which reflects the actual historical conditions of tarp system when the storms occurred and iii plus 37 8 106 m3 10 bg i e in total 43 7 106 m3 projected additional storage of mccook reservoir by 2029 i e tarp2 for all the simulations the entire system was initiated with dry and empty conditions the simulation time step was 30s for all models and the results were reported every minute 4 results and discussions cluster of simulation results were analyzed quantitatively and visualized in the following two sections classified into design storms and historical extreme events 4 1 diagnostic analysis using design storms the regional precipitation frequency interpreted using ensemble statistics of available noaa weather stations is presented in figs 8 the precipitation extreme for 1 h flash storms can reach up to 115 mm hr in intensity locally in contrast a 48 h rainfall may result in as much as 300 mm in totals while the event average intensity is less than 10 mm hr sub daily rainfall events produce relatively less volume in general however the increase in intensity is not proportional to the event durations and result in much more intense flash storms the wider error bars also indicate greater spatial variation for more intense storms which further suggests that spatial interpolation scheme is required for extreme real time event simulations fig 9 and table 2 presented the computed total inflows routed to interceptor and tarp system marked as total in and to tarp solely i e tarp in1 and tarp in2 as well as the resultant cso discharges for a matrix of 25 design storms considering additional conveyance and storage capacity as of tarp1 and tarp2 therefore a series of 50 simulations were performed the sub daily storms are crucial to evaluate drainage conveyances as the peak flow rate is more sensitive to the peak intensity and shape of rainfall than the total depth on the other hand the design of storage facility and associated dewatering pumps depends on the continuous storms lasting for days the sub daily hyetographs initiating with a sharp peak tend to distribute over 75 of rainfall in the first half of the storm duration see the hyetograph in the upper plot of each subfigure in fig 9 as a result the system conveyance has been exceeded for storms with an ari of 10 years or more it may be noted that this type of storms may also result in extended urban flooding in addition to csos as the inlet and channel capacity of the near surface sewer system would also be overwhelmed thus as the return period increases up to 10 years the storms with shorter durations up to 6 h that result in different peak runoffs however result in similar peak inflows that route to tarp and interceptors as the event prolongs the volume was more evenly distributed featuring a much smaller peak and more symmetrical shape accordingly the storage capacity of the system is better utilized while the conveyance is not a universal constraint although the local inadequacy may still exist as cso is not completely eliminated even though there is remaining active storage with tarp2 storage the results identified that the conveyance capacity of the system for sub daily storms would be reached for 5 year storms and the storage capacity of the 24 h storm would be reached for 10 100 year storms herein the storage capacity refers to the static storage of the tunnel and reservoir i e 43 7 106 m3 without considering the dynamic pumping to wrps the system performances to curb csos were further evaluated diagnostically using the proposed measures of three pis as of eq 6 to eq 4 see fig 10 the original data based on metroflow simulations were complemented by data from fitted curve based on least squares for tarp1 both storage and conveyance become performance constraint in case of more intense storms of shorter durations therefore pi n a tends to be greater for storms of longer durations and more evenly distributed temporally while for tarp2 the pi n a and pi s have a much wider range of variation which indicates the additional storage of reservoir 10 bg would substantially improve the system performance for the full spectrum of expected storm conditions also pi t has been reduced evidently which implies the durations of cso events have been shortened however more intense storms i e 100 year return period with durations longer than 6 h will inevitably result in extensive overflows throughout the system as both the design storage and conveyance capacities have been universally exceeded overall the system performance degrades as the storm intensity increases a turning point at 5 year storms of and pi s curves may suggest that the peak rain intensities resulting in the design peak flow rate the latter would activate tarp or exceed the diversion capacity of the interceptor extensively the similar low values of pi n a for both storage scenarios for storms with ari greater than 10 years further suggest that the conveyance become almost a universal constraint throughout the system as a result additional storage can only be utilized within a limited extent thus no significant improvement or mitigation effect is produced the fact that fig 10s showing the three pis do not vary continuously with respect to either rainfall parameter indicates that none of these three indicators denoting the system performance are solely governed by rainfall characteristics even the geometric and physical properties of the system remain invariant the hydraulic performance is dynamically determined by the flow conditions in the system thus requiring the transport equation to be solved numerically for unsteady flow analysis as well as varying boundary conditions 4 2 real time simulation and analysis for historical extreme events figs 11 presented the computed total inflows to tarp and interceptor and the resultant cso discharges for the aforementioned three phases of system storage the storm of 9 12 14 08 resulted in an average areal precipitation of 17 76 cm 6 99 inches over a 62 h period and had a maximum hourly precipitation of 1 73 cm 0 68 inches the event total and average intensity correspond to a ari of 50 to 100 years i e annual exceedance probability between 2 to 1 bauer et al 2016 bonnin et al 2006 the pre tarp scenario resulted in a total of 47 59 106 m3 of csos the tarp1 scenario resulted in a substantially reduced amount of 29 00 106 m3 and the tarp2 further reduced this amount to 4 44 106 m3 as a result of the increased storage capacity the interceptor sewer and tarp2 system is predicted to capture up to 93 77 of the combined inflows which increased the pi s of interceptor system with tarp1 by 158 3 similarly pi t is reduced from 1 91 to 0 53 namely the cso duration is drastically reduced from nearly double the storm duration to half of it the peak flow rates that discharge to the river were attenuated by 22 1 and 92 2 with tarp1 and tarp2 storage respectively compared to the value before tarp was built see fig 11 and table 3 the event resulted in a total of 78 09 106 m3 inflow which exhausted the storage capacity of tarp1 and even tarp2 at the end of the event i e 60 h see fig 12 a as the combined sewage filled up the tunnels and the projected mccook reservoir to their control levels specified by the aforementioned rtc the sluice gates to gated dropshafts were closed no further flows can be diverted to those segments of tarp thus result in overflows to the river the high head pumps released the additional inflows i e continuing received via the ungated dropshaft that the system cannot handle and retained the hgl in the tunnels and or wsel in the reservoir within the safe operational range during the passage of the storm the isohyetal patterns were shown in fig 13 along with the distributed cso volumes predicted by metroflow for the scenarios with tarp1 and tarp2 two centers were identified with the highest rainfall totals one in the central northern to northwestern suburbs and the other over the southern suburbs it may be noted that with the development of sensor network flow meter readings might be retrieved in the future to further verify the model but by the time the model was developed and this study was carried out such data was not available therefore point by point validation was not provided but to give a sense of the model accuracy the cso occurrences monitored by mwrdgc 2018 are presented for comparison purposes table 4 for clarity in presentation since cso outfalls are typically located nearby their associated dropshafts the total cso volumes i e the sum would be used if multiple cso outfalls are associated with one dropshaft were related to the geographical feature of a dropshaft as an attribute the cso volumes are presented using the quantile classification method thus each class consists of equal numbers of representative cso features metroflow predicted with tarp1 storage 100 dropshafts were reported with cso activated during the storm consistent with the numerical predictions cso events were reported at cso outfalls adjacent to 86 of these 100 dropshafts by mwrdgc 2018 as shown in fig 13 a thus metroflow was found to accurately predict the cso activities throughout the system in response to severe storms such as the one in september 2008 a process based program like metroflow might facilitate efficient implementation of sensor network concentrated in the areas of higher risks predicted which in turn return measurements to further improve the accuracy of the model with tarp2 this number is dramatically reduced to 13 accordingly pi n a is increased from 0 46 to 0 94 compared to the tarp1 scenario see fig 13a where 40 activated cso outfalls resulted in more than 120 103 m3 of total volume fig 13 b shows that with tarp2 storage 80 of the activated cso outfalls resulted in less than 58 103 m3 the results also highlighted that the cso outfalls adjacent to dropshaft mds 27 resulted in total 3 1 106 m3 cso volume which contributes to 70 of the system total cso volume even as per projected mccook reservoir fully in operation this finding is also consistent with the monitored cso frequency as observed in fig 2 which the localized operations of the pumps may explain the dwfs are intercepted by the mwrdgc interceptor sewers and directed to racine avenue ps where depending on the wet well level determined by water level at control nodes in cs tarp model low head dwf or high head wwf pumps lift flow to the stickney wrp via a interceptor sewer as a result the wwf from the interceptors are initially conveyed to the stickney wrp via racine avenue pss flows exceeding the dwf pumping capacity are diverted to deep tunnels if and when tarp reaches storage capacity the sluice gates to dropshafts are closed and the treatment capacity of stickney wrp is reached high head pumps start to pump csos to the south fork of the south branch sfsb of chicago river in cases of intense precipitation when the capacity of tarp and the treatment capacity of stickney wrp are still unavailable the dwf pumps are also changed to pump combined sewage to sfsb instead such a practice substantially reduces the spread of csos in the system and fully utilizes the available storage capacity of nearby treatment facilities i e stickney wrp however in case of extreme events the current treatment capacity of stickney wrp with additional storage rendered by tarp1 and even tarp2 is still not sufficient to capture the excess wwf and result in csos with a relatively high concentration of pollutants directly released to sfsb which further directs much attention to the water quality of this particular branch of chicago river alp and melching 2009 sinha et al 2013 quijano et al 2017 due to this type of localized variability in both structures and operations individual models developed for each subsystem based on best available data are found to be necessary to capture spatially distributed cso characteristics accurately figs 11 and table 3 also compare the performances of the entire system at capturing csos for the four storms varying by durations intensities and temporal structures first the two storms in september 2008 and july 2010 resemble each other regarding durations and peak intensities both of them overwhelmed the storage capacity of the tunnels and even the projected reservoir see fig 12 the latter resulted in an extremely high rise of the hgl in the tunnels and filled up the reservoir to its control level in about 30 h after the storm initiated although the rainfall total of the former is greater the latter s flashier behavior led to larger amount of surface runoff with a sharper peak flow rate via the css to the interceptor sewer and tarp system as a result both pi n a and pi s of the latter are consistently lower for all the three simulated storage scenarios as shown in the hyetographs of fig 11b most of the rain fell within 20 to 40 h after the storm commenced with a sharp peak and retained high intensity the runoff hydrograph routed through the sewer system highly resembled the precipitation pattern as the lag time due to travel time in the overland region and the abstraction of rainfall in the basin with substantially reduced perviousness due to urbanization is trivial the resultant sewer inflows overburdened the diversion capacity of the interceptors and the conveyance capacity of tarp as a result the system is more susceptible to storms of such a shape as not only the storage capacity but also the conveyance capacity constrains the system s performance to effectively capture csos which is consistent with the diagnostic analysis presented in section 4 1 before the implementation of tarp the interceptor sewer system is predicted to only capture up to 33 of combined sewer flows resulting from such type of storm even with tarp 2 the system still discharges 18 as csos from 38 i e a number of 80 cso outfalls the 7 22 23 11 event consisted of a small storm that occurred in the first 20 h followed by a larger storm with a sharp peak as high as 2 94 cm hr the highest peak intensity among the four storms during the first 10 h upon the commencement of the latter similar to the 7 23 25 10 event the highly flash behavior of the storm resulted in large amount of inflows rapidly flushing into interceptor and tarp which overwhelms the conveyance capacity of the tunnels as a result the available storage of the reservoir cannot be fully utilized to capture the csos as shown in fig 12c the similar temporal structure of the hyetograph results in similar system responses as a result pi s for the event in july 2011 did not exceed 85 and pi n a did not exceed 0 54 nevertheless the implementation and fully completion of tarp would have substantially reduced the system duration of cso to as low as 30 of the storm duration other flood producing storms are the ones that comprise a series of moderately intense showers and thunderstorms huff and angel 1989 such as the event that occurred in april 2013 fig 11d this event resulted in an average of 13 5 cm rainfall for 48 h with a smaller event followed by a larger event the smaller storm retained the drainage basin in a pre saturated condition the entire event produced a comparable total amount of inflows as the one that occurred in july 2010 table 3 however at a much smaller intensity with a peak at 1 37 cm hr the interceptor system can divert 56 of the inflows in addition the system has sufficient conveyance capacity to distribute inflows throughout the tunnel system therefore with additional storage provided by mccook reservoir i e tarp2 the integrated system is predicted to capture up to 99 of the estimated combined sewer flows and the pi t is reduced to 0 21 both indicating the best performances among the four events furthermore it demonstrates that the projected tarp system would be resilient to moderate intense storms of extended durations and adequate to divert almost all the resultant overflows as the storm prolongs the performance would be further governed by the active storage in the reservoir which also depends on the pump operational rules that control the outflow rates to dewater the reservoir also see fig 1b this study presented a total of 29 storms 25 design 4 historical and 62 simulations 50 for the former 12 for the latter which collectively suggest that cso is a combined function of the precipitation and drainage system these simulations are in the position to fill the data need of cso discharges in responses to extreme events which rarely exist but play an important role in water quality assessment a systematic analytic method is proposed to compile process and assess the system performance based on the cluster of cso results the results might be case specific and were inherently tied to the local operations or structural variability as narrated however the underlying control mechanisms meteorologically and hydraulically that lead to overflow are generalizable and transferable to other urban drainage systems the pis hgl and system inflows predicted by metroflow may further facilitate a multi criteria decision analysis in future work to optimize the system operations furthermore metroflow s model framework allows the factors that govern the deep tunnel system performance as a mitigation plan including rainfall characteristics and rtc rules of the inlet gates and pumps to be assessed separately for the multiple modeling layers cost benefit analysis and the treatment capacity of receiving treatment plants may also be taken into account to maximize the flood and pollution control benefits 5 conclusions the rapid development and expansion of urbanization have made the infrastructure system in cities especially the megacities like chicago in the us sophisticated to understand and model in this study a multi layer based and multi approach coupled modeling program metroflow was introduced to emulate the hierarchy of major h h processes that would occur across the interconnected drainage basins in metropolitan areas where complex and evolving drainage systems are present this modeling strategy proved both efficient and effective accounting for increasing urbanization and upgrading infrastructure with complex connections the entire system was subdivided to three layers for modeling purposes the probabilistic based iuhm was adopted to model layer i for the subcatchments located in the suburbs of chicago to account for the incomplete sewer network data the h h model developed at neighborhood scale across the city of chicago city model for layer i was adopted to account for the looping feature and complex connections within the network due to the long history of development finally the cs tarp model built upon the conduit model in infoworks cs was adopted for layer ii iii for the entire study area namely layer iii is the target model layer and the cs tarp model is considered the operational model to receive the input from the other two models and output any system responses due to weather structural or operational input changes the coupled h h models were demonstrated to be capable of predicting the combined sewer inflows resulting from a full spectrum of rainfall conditions especially recorded extreme events the amount dynamically captured by the drainage systems and mitigation plans such as tarp in chicago and ultimately the resultant cso characteristics the cluster of results collectively suggest that rainstorm driven csos are complex functions of a spatio temporal characteristics of rainfall b the hydraulic performance of wastewater infrastructures as well as c the operations of the regulators and or hydraulic structures reflect this to the iuds in the city of chicago the three terms relate to the tunnel conveyance capacity and catchment hydrology and determine the hydraulic conditions in the tunnel system and the storage capacities in the reservoir thus have direct impact on csos the intercomparison between historical intense storms that would be relevant for cso producing and reservoir filling reveals that a downpour like storms with flash characteristics lead to relatively more csos in terms of spread and volume i e pi n a and pi s due to overwhelmed local conveyance capacities b better system performances were predicted for storms with moderate intensity with more uniform temporal distribution even at prolonged duration c these storms typically lasted over 48 h to fill the projected reservoir the fine scale hourly and sub hourly rainfall temporal structure attributed to distinctive system responses and cso abatement performances despite the varying system performances due to rainfall characteristics the comparative study considering three structural scenarios showed consistent improvement of cso abatement using the introduced pis as evaluation criteria with increasing conveyance and storage provided by the deep tunnel system the projected system is predicted to capture 24 h storm of return periods up to 10 years i e pi s 85 therefore metroflow s framework may facilitate the assessment of structural and operational measures given the existing system as a baseline condition furthermore the enclosed extreme storm studies may also shed light on the design and operation of resilient wastewater infrastructure systems as well as implementation of green infrastructures as supplementary alternatives to the existing gray ones in urban areas where the risks to the ecosystem from more intense ari 10 years flash floods remains a primary concern broadly thinking metroflow aims for a way to promote collaborative modeling so that community scale models and or models that are developed at different times using diverse methods and tools generally in line with different construction or research projects could be interacted and integrated to support regional water and wastewater infrastructure planning design and management

3977,this research provides a novel methodology for modeling multivariate dependence structures of meteorological drought characteristics severity duration peak and interarrival time based on the combination of four dimensional vine copulas and data mining algorithm hereinafter called vc dm two flexible vine copula structures i e canonical vine c vine and drawable vine d vine were used for multivariate drought modeling in three climatologically different regions of iran i e mehrabad semnan and nowshahr synoptic stations furthermore data mining algorithms approach was employed for downscaling bias correction rainfall data obtained from four general circulation models gcms i e canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 the approach was based on the least square support vector machine lssvm which is hybridized with two optimization algorithms i e grid search gs and sine cosine algorithm sca results indicated that lssvm sca was more accurate than lssvm gs for all gcms in the testing period the uncertainty analysis results for the historical period 1977 2005 revealed that lssvm sca had less uncertainty than lssvm gs it was also observed that of all the selected gcms canesm2 had less uncertainty for most climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 so canesm2 as the best gcm with low uncertainty and lssvm sca as the superior downscaling bias correction method were selected for drought characteristics analysis under climate change conditions the rainfall predictions for the 2021 2100 period were projected to decrease in mehrabad station and increase in semnan and nowshahr stations under all three selected rcps finally all projected drought characteristics were analyzed by the selected and preferable vine copula based model c vine model with mixed pair copulas to provide comprehensive insight towards future drought conditions it can be concluded that more severe droughts will occur in 2021 2100 than the historical period and the absolute value of drought severity decreases under rcp2 6 in all stations all drought durations are also expected to decrease while drought peaks will not change significantly in all stations and under all scenarios

dynamics laboratory climate model version 3 1 introduction human history is full of natural disasters and their adverse effects on the lives of earth s inhabitants including massive floods and long term droughts which sedimentological studies have proved their past occurrence drought is one of the inseparable phenomena from the climatic conditions of countries located in subtropical regions this common phenomenon in these regions which contain most of the world s deserts can lead to harmful consequences actually in arid and semi arid regions which naturally have limited water resources significant drought effects on these resources are quickly revealed the study of iran s past history also confirms the occurrence of famine and the death of thousands of people due to consecutive droughts drought can have different aspects such as meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economical climatologist donald wilhite and atmospheric scientist michael glantz 1985 presented this classification based on four fundamental approaches to drought measurement as the most considerable aspect meteorological drought is usually defined based on the degree of dryness compared to normal or average values and the length of dry period this definition should be considered on a case by case basis for each specific region since the weather conditions which cause lack of rainfall change drastically from one region to another understanding the environmental vulnerability to drought seems complex because of its unexpected effects many researches have been conducted in the past on identifying the components of this phenomenon and its modeling by statistical and mathematical methods to provide practical predictions for its occurrence and characteristics there are a variety of studies that provide information on developments and innovations in drought modeling mishra and singh 2010 aghakouchak et al 2015 due to the randomness of this phenomenon monitoring its probabilistic properties quickly became the target of many researchers around the world however the common weak point of many studies was the use of univariate analysis which ignored the effect of other variables and the dependencies between them yue et al 2001 pointed out that univariate analyses could in no way consider the effects of these correlations and can cause misinterpretation they suggested that to study and model these components a multivariate analysis should be implemented which uses simultaneous analysis of components to monitor one phenomenon the traditional method of multivariate analysis was the use of classical multivariate distribution functions but uniformity of marginal distributions was mandatory in using these functions and certainly limited their use like in entropy in addition these functions do not have much variety including the exponential normal gamma pareto and generalized pareto distributions which have been mentioned in several studies beersma and buishand 2004 jakubowski 2006 vangelis et al 2011 the main weakness of these studies is the need to use a joint statistical distribution for variables and the possibility of disproportionate fitness of variables to marginal distributions also these studies do not consider the correlation of variables with each other and as a result do not have high accuracy in modeling multivariate phenomena a more appropriate method for multivariate analysis that has overcome the limitations of classical multivariate distribution functions is the use of copula functions which have been widely used recently in water resources studies copulas are functions that link multivariate distributions to marginal distributions of one variable and consequently the structure of dependence between variables with different marginal distributions could be modeled more accurately these functions can preserve the dependence structure among all characteristics and imitate their joint behavior for flexible parameterization and modeling wu et al 2020 tosunoglu and onof 2017 implementation of copula functions in drought analyses does not have a long history serinaldi et al 2009 used a six month spi index to analyze the probabilistic characteristics of droughts in the sicilian region of italy to model the stochastic behavior of characteristics and specify the considered return periods they implemented copula functions which had high flexibility in selecting marginal distribution functions amirataee and montaseri 2017 performed the regional analysis of the joint probability of drought characteristics of lake urmia in iran using spi index and copula functions significant reduction of uncertainty in modeling the probabilities of important components of drought phenomenon was the most important result of their research wang et al 2020 evaluated hydrological and meteorological droughts and their relationships their results revealed that the two dimensional frank copula is the best fitted copula function to investigate the drought return period copula functions have been highly applied in drought modeling but if there are more than two components d 2 the problem will be very complex and time consuming in order to overcome this drawback the vine structure was introduced by joe 1997 as a tool for the decomposition of multivariate distribution functions to interrelated conditional bivariate distributions bedford and cooke 2001 developed a flexible graphical model called regular vine for multivariate more than two distribution functions this model s vine shaped structure makes the multivariate density function from the binary combination of copulas pair copulas aas et al 2009 introduced two different structures for vines canonical vine c vine and drawable vine d vine that differed in the order in which the variables were placed next to each other and the shape of the tree structure of the pair copulas the flexibility and high accuracy of these models made their use rapidly common in hydrologic applications including simulation of rainfall and storm characteristics gyasi agyei and melching 2012 vernieuwe et al 2015 probabilistic modeling of evapotranspiration pham et al 2015 flood frequency analysis shafaei et al 2016 daneshkhah et al 2016 it must be mentioned that the use of vine copula functions in four dimensional drought related issues is quite rare so one of the main approaches of this research will be the representation of dependence structure between drought characteristics severity duration peak and interarrival time and the determination of joint return period of drought variables due to the occurrence of climate change in recent years as one of the serious threats to sustainable development in various dimensions including environment natural resources and economic activities it will be vital to conduct studies that can consider these future changes and improve our preparedness to deal with their effects and resulting costs as one of the most important extreme events the drought phenomenon is affected by climatic processes due to changes in precipitation and temperature patterns several studies have been performed on simulation of rainfall data based on climate scenarios and models e g kiem and austin 2013 tavakolifar et al 2017 nourani et al 2018 azari et al 2021 evidently there are several sources of uncertainty that affect the results of studies conducted on climate change impact assessments among them the uncertainty related to the choice of general circulation models gcms has been considered in most studies woldemeskel et al 2016 reported an uncertainty reduction in cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 precipitation projections relative to those in cmip3 their results revealed that uncertainty is relatively larger and smaller in colder and hotter regions respectively yin et al 2020 investigated the changes in flood characteristics with uncertainty analysis under climate change condition using the ability of copula functions for construction of characteristics joint distribution and the outputs of multi model cmip5 gcms their results revealed a positive trend of precipitation over china and increasing uncertainty of flood characteristics estimations in the future there are several studies conducted to evaluate the performance of multi model gcms in meteorological and hidrological variables projections jia et al 2019 mesbahzadeh et al 2019 yin et al 2021 the most important advantage of such comparative studies is improving the accuracy of projections in different climatic conditions and reducing the effects of climate models uncertainties furthermore using gcms output needs downscaling bias correction to infer high resolution information from low resolution variables woldemeskel et al 2016 reported a significant uncertainty reduction in gcms projection after several bias correction approaches basically this reduction is because that all models are forced to have the same properties e g mean and standard deviation fang et al 2018 used some downscaling bias correction approaches to make large scale grid based precipitation and temperature data to station scales and highlighted the uncertainties arising from gcm models krinner et al 2020 concluded that empirical bias corrections could potentially reduce the uncertainty of cmip outputs and improve the quality of large scale gcm data machine learning methods have recently found successful applications especially in rainfall prediction e g ehteram et al 2019 farrokhi et al 2020 pham et al 2020 anaraki et al 2021 azad et al 2021 these methods can improve the accuracy of downscaling bias correction among these methods the least square support vector machine lssvm as a progressive data mining algorithm has some advantages over others such as high efficiency in computation time having a simple structure and not getting stuck in the local optima suyken et al 2002 guo et al 2020 proposed a new hybrid model using lssvm with a recursive mechanism to explore the modeling multi step ahead forecasts of reservoir water availability results indicated that the model outperforms other comparative models in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback as well as the adaptive mechanism due to the high accuracy required in determining the parameters of this method conventional procedures like the fundamental trial and error method will be extremely time consuming farzin et al 2020 in these cases optimization algorithms can be employed as leading approaches for accurate modeling as a superior population based approach the sine cosine optimization algorithm sca can efficiently optimize the lssvm parameters the sca is a modern optimization technique that creates multiple initial random candidate solutions to fluctuate toward the best solution using sine and cosine functions mirjalili 2016 in this study four selected gcms from the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 were spatially downscaled using one sophisticated machine learning based bias correction model lssvm sca this effective approach for predictors correction could lead to high quality downscaled simulations into situ data it is worth mentioning that the main goal of this research is to introduce a novel methodology called vc dm to study meteorological drought phenomena in response to climate change by using four dimensional vine copula functions and downscaled hybrid model outputs lssvm sca to this end the copula based model is used for multivariate analysis while data mining prediction methods are used for downscaling rainfall time series and projecting future rainfall data this methodology can be useful to predict future droughts and simulate their components with more precision 2 the proposed framework the proposed vc dm methodology of meteorological drought characteristics modeling includes the following steps fig 1 1 collecting and preprocessing of required data initially monthly observed spi data are collected for the base period drought characteristics are extracted from the spi time series in each station for all time series marginal distributions are selected among different distributions based on the chi square test and kolmogorov simonov test and their fitting with empirical cdf are evaluated 2 constructing vine copula models the canonical c vine and drawable d vine vine structures hereinafter called cvm and dvm are used to construct the suitable four dimensional multivariate model the kendall s tau coefficient is employed for dependency measurement between pairwise variables and selecting the order of variables in the star shaped structure of cvm and the hamiltonian path of dvm then ten families of well known copulas gaussian student t clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 and mixed are examined for all bivariate copula branches and the appropriate ones are selected for each model based on akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and loglik criteria eventually all drought characteristics are simulated by the best selected cvm and dvm the accuracy of predictions is evaluated based on mae rmse and r criteria in all stations and the appropriate multivariate vine model is introduced by statistical and graphical methods 3 rainfall simulation and prediction under climate change conditions rainfall data from four large scale gcms canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 are downscaled by a novel hybrid data mining method lssvm hybridized with sine cosine algorithm lssvm sca the performance of lssvm sca is compared with the traditional grid search gs algorithm and the superiority of the proposed model is confirmed the uncertainty analysis is also performed to select a gcm with less uncertainty for climate change projections finally the hybrid model is used to simulate future rainfall for the prediction period 2021 2100 based on selected gcm and under three climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and changes in statistical parameters of predicted rainfalls are calculated 4 analyzing drought characteristics under future climate change conditions in the final step the impact of climate change on future droughts is evaluated using the selected vine copula model introduced in step 2 all characteristics are modeled under three considered rcp scenarios and change in return periods are investigated in all stations it is worth mentioning that all computations are performed using the dynamic copula toolbox of matlab software and the cd vine package of r software 3 study area and dataset 3 1 study area the study area of this research is located inside the central plateau and caspian sea watersheds in the northern strip of iran this area includes three provinces tehran semnan and mazandaran that are of particular geopolitical importance the central plateau where most of the area of tehran and semnan provinces are located consists of several closed basins surrounded by the alborz mountains from the north and the zagros mountains from the west the average elevation of this plateau is about 900 m but several of the mountains that tower over the plateau exceed 3 000 m this watershed is one of the least rainy basins in iran with an average of 145 mm annual rainfall and drains an area of about 824000 km2 the distribution of rainfall is not also uniform throughout this basin so that in the lowest area of this watershed the annual rainfall does not reach 50 mm the caspian sea watershed as a narrow and long plain extends for more than 600 km along the shore of the largest lake on the earth referred to as the caspian sea so that at some places the coast is less than 2 km away from the foothills of alborz this open basin contains several rivers that lead to the caspian sea and drains an area of about 174000 km2 due to the high slope there is a difference of about 5500 m between the highest and lowest point of this watershed while the average elevation across the coastal area is about 21 m also as the rainiest watershed in the country the average annual rainfall varies between 1800 mm in the west and 200 mm in the east this study was performed with monthly rainfall time series obtained from three synoptic stations namely mehrabad latitude 35 41 n longitude 51 47 e and elevation 1191 m amsl semnan latitude 35 35 n longitude 53 42 e and elevation 1127 m amsl and nowshahr latitude 36 39 n longitude 51 31 e and elevation 20 9 m bmsl as shown in fig 2 according to the iran meteorological organization these stations have different climatic conditions the mehrabad station which is located in tehran city has a cold semi arid climate with continental climate characteristics bsh group based on koppen index its climate follows a mediterranean precipitation pattern and the average annual rainfall and temperature are 231 mm and 17 7 c respectively the semnan station which is located in the northern borders of dasht e kavir desert has a cold desert climate and is classified in the bwk group its average monthly temperature varies from 0 c in january to 36 6 c in july and the average annual rainfall is 140 mm the nowshahr station is located across the caspian sea due to high humidity the climate of this station is classified in the csa group hot summer mediterranean climate the average annual rainfall of nowshahr station is 964 mm generally these three stations cover a diverse range of climates and a comparative analysis of droughts in these areas can provide a comprehensive view for water resources managers to make appropriate decisions and prevent damages 3 2 dataset for this research historical data of monthly rainfall for all three stations provided by the iran meteorological organization are implemented for the 1977 2005 period in order to determine the multi dimensional distribution of drought characteristics four variables were extracted from monthly spi time series including drought severity ds maximum spi value dm drought duration dd and time interval between two events dl to this end the theory of runs yevjevich 1967 is used for drought characteristics definition a negative positive run is defined as a portion of the time series of variable spi t in which all values are below above a selected threshold level the spi value of 1 is also defined as the threshold level for identifying drought events one drought event begins when spi drops below the value of 1 mckee et al 1993 and ends until it reaches 0 so the number of drought events extracted from the databases using the run theory are 81 64 and 53 events in mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively evidently data scarcity as one of the main challenges of drought characteristics modeling may lead to low accuracy in model predictions in particular for independent variables but from a statistical point of view the small size of data could be acceptable especially in multivariate problems daneshkhah et al 2016 genest et al 2007 fig 3 illustrates drought characteristics and how they were calculated the large scale gcm data of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were used as the predictors to train and test the introduced hybrid model the predictors extracted from canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 gcms under representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios were used to investigate the future climate table 1 the rcp scenarios are also the greenhouse gas concentration not emissions trajectory adopted by the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 in 2014 and describe our future climate by consideration of the possible volume of greenhouse gases ghg emitted in the atmosphere the most important factors affecting these scenarios are population growth rate socio economic developments and concentrations of greenhouse gases especially carbon dioxide emission in this research three famous scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 have been considered with the 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 possible range of radiative forcing values at the end of 21st respectively van vuuren et al 2011 all data have been received from the canadian climate change scenarios network cccsn http www cccsn ec gc ca with 2 5 degree spatial resolution also the prediction period is defined from 2021 to 2100 4 material and methods 4 1 copulas and vine structures generally copulas are functions that link multivariate distributions to univariate marginal distributions on the unit square 0 1 these multivariate cumulative distribution functions can model the dependency structures between variables with different marginal distributions hence the properties of each copula are very similar to the corresponding distribution function in the theory of copulas marginal distribution functions do not necessarily follow a definite distribution and this is why copulas can evaluate changes in the dependencies of variables more appropriately in joint distributions based on sklar s theorem sklar 1959 copula functions make it possible to construct a multivariate distribution in which the dependence between components is considered from a number of univariate distributions with different statistical distributions accordingly an n dimensional copula is a multivariate cumulative distribution function with uniform marginal distribution functions u i f i x i i 1 2 n on the 0 1 so the joint cumulative distribution function can be written as follows f x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n θ 1 c u 1 u n θ pr u 1 u 1 u n u n where c is an n dimensional copula on c 0 1 n 0 1 and θ is the copula s parameter that can specify the amount of dependency between marginal distribution functions if marginal distribution functions are continuous c will be unique otherwise c will be calculated on ran f 1 r a n f 2 r a n f n exclusively ranf is the range of the marginal function so far different families of copulas have been developed based on differences in providing details of dependencies between variables in different sciences some have an explicit formula to express the cumulative distribution function such as archimedean copulas and some do not such as elliptical copulas but when the number of variables increases it will be very difficult and time consuming to use ordinary copula functions to analyze multivariate distributions n 3 bedford and cooke 2001 introduced a graphical model called the regular normal vine copula a vine structure with n variable is a nested set of connected trees where the edges in the first tree are the nodes of the second tree the edges of the second tree are the nodes of the third tree etc so at level j 1 the nodes of the tree will be constructed by the edges of the tree from level j and the given variables are the nodes of level 1 the vine structure breaks down the multivariate density function into pair copulas n n 1 2 bivariate copulas and constructs the joint density function from the bivariate copulas between the marginal and conditional distributions of the n variables each pair copula can be selected from different bivariate copulas which makes modeling more flexible kurowicka and cooke 2007 two types of the regular vine are called canonical c vine and drawable d vine vines fig 4 where each one has its exclusive structure the order in which the variables are connected to each other and have been more practical in hydrological sciences generally n 2 patterns can be made based on the order of variables while there can be only n 1 trees in each structure the star shaped structure of the c vine assigns one node in each tree the maximal degree and puts key variable at the root of this structure while d vine has a pass like structure in which no node can be connected to more than two adjacent nodes and consequently no node is considered as the root of the structure aas et al 2009 the four dimensional joint density function of the random variable x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 in c vine structure can be written as follows f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 f x 4 c 12 f x 1 f x 2 c 13 f x 1 f x 3 c 14 f x 1 f x 4 c 23 1 f x 2 x 1 f x 3 x 1 c 34 1 f x 3 x 1 f x 4 x 1 2 c 34 12 f x 3 x 1 x 2 f x 4 x 1 x 2 f x 2 x 1 c 12 f x 1 f x 2 θ 21 f x 1 f x 3 x 1 c 13 f x 1 f x 3 θ 31 f x 1 f x 4 x 1 c 14 f x 1 f x 4 θ 41 f x 1 f x 4 x 1 x 2 c 42 1 f x 4 x 1 f x 2 x 1 θ 24 1 f x 2 x 1 3 f x 3 x 1 x 2 c 32 1 f x 3 x 1 f x 2 x 1 θ 23 1 f x 2 x 1 where f x j x i is conditional distribution function θ ij is conditional dependence parameter obtained from f x j f x i bivariate margins θ ij k is copula parameter of f x i x k and f x j x k margins parameters will be estimated using the maximum likelihood method where the likelihood logarithm is maximized using numerical methods and the corresponding parameter is estimated the best fitted copula function will be selected by using aic and bic statistics similarly the four dimensional joint density function in d vine structure can be written as follows f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 f x 4 c 12 f x 1 f x 2 c 23 f x 2 f x 3 c 34 f x 3 f x 4 c 13 2 f x 1 x 2 f x 3 x 2 c 24 3 f x 2 x 3 f x 4 x 3 4 c 14 23 f x 1 x 2 x 3 f x 4 x 2 x 3 this structure has a path in which the variables have maximum dependence this path is also known as the hamiltonian path joe 1997 expressed the right side elements of the above equation using the concept of joint copulas from conditional probabilistic distribution functions as follows 5 f x ϑ c x ϑ j ϑ j f x ϑ j f ϑ j ϑ j f ϑ j ϑ j where ϑ j corresponds to the arbitrary element of n dimensional vector ϑ ϑ j is the same vector ϑ except the component j and c x ϑ j ϑ j is suitable bivariate copula function of conditional distribution f x ϑ if ϑ is univariate eq 5 can be represented as follows aas et al 2009 6 f x ϑ c x ϑ f x f ϑ θ f ϑ similarly the parameters of the copula functions must be chosen in such a way as to maximize the log likelihood for the copulas the value of log likelihood for each n dimensional structure with n data can be obtained by the following equations 7 l cvine θ k 1 n i 1 n 1 j 1 n i l o g c i i j 1 j 1 f i 1 j 1 f i j 1 j 1 θ i i j 1 j 1 l dvine θ k 1 n i 1 n 1 j 1 n i l o g c j j i j 1 j i 1 f j j 1 j i 1 f j i j 1 j i 1 θ j j i j 1 j i 1 choosing the most suitable bivariate copula function and the best structure for all pair copulas can be conducted by computing aic bic and also using the maximum likelihood method ml aic is based on the hypothesis test and ranks different models akaike 1974 bic has more power to compare models because it considers the number of observations in the second sentence of its equation schwarz 1978 these criteria can be expressed as follows aic 2 i 1 n j 1 n l o g c θ u i u j θ 2 k 8 bic 2 i 1 n j 1 n l o g c θ u i u j θ 2 k l o g n where k is the number of copula function parameters and n is the number of data brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 also multivariate return periods can be obtained from too much data which the vine copula model simulates in a multivariate situation the copula based approach can appropriately model the joint probability and return period of drought characteristics salvadori and de michele 2004 calculated as follows shiau 2006 ganguli and reddy 2014 9 rp d s i l n q 1 c d s m l where n is the drought period based on spi data q is the number of drought events c d s i l is a four variate joint distribution produced by the vine copula model and rp d s m l is a four variate joint return period when a problem is faced with a small amount of data the conditional distributions at second and third trees may be estimated with lower accuracy somehow noisier but it could be resolved by ignoring some unnecessary conditional dependencies stöeber et al 2013 however based on the results of this study the need for this simplifying assumption was not recognized the results confirm the great and reliable performance of modeling with vine copula structures so fitting an appropriate structure to data and constructing a suitable multivariate model can be summarized in the following three steps first determining an appropriate order of the variables for each structure some approaches can be implemented for selecting the order of variables in vine tree shaped structures calculation of kendall s tau coefficient is the most commonly used in statistical analysis for measuring the dependence between pairwise variables the star shaped order and the hamiltonian path will be selected based on the strongest cumulative dependence of all connections maximizing the sum of absolute kendall s tau values in c vine and d vine structures respectively second fitting the best bivariate copula families to each pair copula and estimation of their parameters in all trees the bivariate copula parameters of the first tree are computed from observed data by the ml method for the next trees conditional distribution functions eq 5 and eq 6 play the role of input data and the parameters can be derived aas et al 2009 in the present study well known copulas gaussian student t clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 and mixed are investigated by aic bic and loglik criteria third simulating all variables by the best selected model and testing the accuracy of their predictions some evaluation criteria including mae rmse and r were used to compare the fitting of simulated results and observed data and introduced an appropriate multivariate dependence model with vine structures 4 2 least square support vector machine lssvm in the present study the lssvm as a modified version of the support vector machine has been used to statistically downscale rainfall data from gcms it has more computational advantage than svm especially in assessing nonlinear classification problems and regression analysis suykens and vandewalle 1999 utilizing the least square optimization method has made this progressive data mining algorithm more efficient in terms of computation time a nonlinear function φ is the mapping function that maps the input data into a higher dimensional transformed one the lssvm function can be shown as follows 10 f x w t φ x b where w is a weight vector and b is the bias according to the structural minimization principle the optimal regression problem can be formulated by minimizing j w e as follows j w e 1 2 w t w γ 2 i 1 m e i 2 s t y i w t φ x i b e i i 1 2 m where e i is residual error variable and γ is the tuning parameter margin parameter the lssvm will be solved after the lagrangian function is constructed as follows 12 l w b e α j w e i 1 n α i w t φ x i b e i y i where α i are lagrange multipliers optimal conditions of the above objective function eq 12 can be obtained by solving the partial derivatives from the objective function suykens and vandewalle 1999 elimination of w and e will yield a linear system linear relation between input and output data 13 0 i n t i n k γ 1 i n b α 0 y where α is support vector α α 1 α n i is identity matrix i 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 y is output data y y 1 y n and k is the kernel function defined according to the mercer theorem so the general form of lssvm in linear interaction can be shown as follows 14 y x i 1 n α i k x x i b where x i are training data and reused as for input data so far several types of kernel functions are introduced including linear polynomial and radial basis functions rbf in the present study rbf as the most common function in regression problems is implemented to map the input data into higher dimensional transformed one which is calculated as follows 15 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the width of the kernel function determining the lssvm parameters with conventional procedures adjustment of gamma γ and sigma σ parameters will be extremely time consuming in these cases powerful optimization algorithms such as sca can be used to determine the parameters which is discussed in the next section 4 3 sine cosine algorithm sca in this section the leading metaheuristic algorithm will be explained as a superior population based approach which was used to optimize the lssvm parameters efficiently for this purpose various optimization methods have been used in the previous studies including genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso grid search gs etc the gs algorithm which has received more attention outperforms other algorithms especially in stock market studies but the calculation process of this traditional method is complicated and so time consuming chen et al 2018 this algorithm is based on comparing the parameters of each grid and debugging the optimal parameters group using integer exponentials due to the convergence of inconsistency with deviation in the learning paradigm this method cannot be accurate mo et al 2020 so in this research the sca which was introduced by mirjalili 2016 as a modern optimization technique has been implemented in this population based optimization algorithm the mathematical sine and cosine functions are used with a set of random solutions in other words it creates multiple initial random candidate solutions to fluctuate toward the best solution using sine and cosine functions mirjalili 2016 the procedure begins with a set of search agents solutions and updates continuously by the following equation 16 x i t 1 x i t r 1 sin r 2 r 3 p i t x i t r 4 0 5 x i t r 1 cos r 2 r 3 p i t x i t r 4 0 5 where x i t represents position vector of the current search agent p i t refers to the position of the destination point in the i th dimension at the t th iteration and r 1 r 2 r 3 and r 4 are random numbers called the main parameters of the sca parameter r 1 is used to find the region of the next solution this region might be either inside the space between the solution and destination or outside them parameter r 2 indicates the movement distance either outward or toward the destination and obeys uniform distribution between 0 and 2 π parameter r 3 is a random weight of destination which randomly emphasizes when r 3 1 or deemphasizes when r 3 1 the desalination effect in setting the distance and it obeys uniform distribution between 0 and 2 the last parameter r 4 switches the equation between sine and cosine modules by the same token and its value range is bounded between 0 to 1 the conceptual model of sca is shown in fig 5 the optimization process is divided into exploration and exploitation phases in the exploration phase the sca algorithm combines random search agents in the set of search agents suddenly with a high rate of arbitrariness to discover favorable regions of the search space in the other phase the variation of random search agents is considerably decreased in order to reach the global optima the algorithm should be able to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities therefore parameter r 1 in eq 16 is linearly reduced from a to 0 during the iterations to balance the exploration and exploitation based on the following equation 17 r 1 a t a t where t represents the current iteration t indicates the maximum number of iterations and a is a constant a 0 indeed the algorithm does not search all the space which takes the least possible time and reduces the computational cost so fewer parameter settings simplicity of its concept easy implementation and faster convergence are the main advantages of this novel algorithm furthermore due to the randomized search nature of this algorithm it can reduce the chance of a model overfitting to the training data the flowchart of sca is illustrated in fig 6 further details can be found in mirjalili 2016 4 4 hybrid of lssvm with sca and gs lssvm sca and lssvm gs the hybridization strategy used in this study for optimization lssvm parameters is applying the sca method which was explained in the previous section this optimization leads to stability in model performance and increases its accuracy in addition comparing the results of lssvm sca with lssvm gs can be a valuable evaluation of the proposed strategy the sca algorithm uses rmse as the objective function and finds optimal lssvm parameters γ and σ with smaller rmse values these parameters are also considered as decision variables for this hybrid model sca creates multiple initial random candidate solutions to fluctuate toward the best solution using sine and cosine functions the flowchart of lssvm sca is shown in fig 7 in the present study 70 of data samples are used to train lssvm sca and lssvm gs also 30 of data samples are employed for testing the investigated algorithms these data were imposed on algorithms by random calibration the process of modeling precipitation by lssvm sca and lssvm gs is as follows 1 the inputs and target data are collected the large scale rainfall data obtained from gcms are considered inputs and rainfall data in the station is considered a target 2 the data are divided into training and testing samples 3 the range of gamma and sigma for lssvm sca and lssvm gs is set to 1 250 and 0 01 0 5 respectively based on the authors experience 4 the mesh grid size of gamma and sigma for lssvm gs is considered equal to 5 and 0 05 respectively based on the authors experience 5 the lssvm is trained for each gamma and sigma in the mesh grid and the best parameters of lssvm with minimum mse are determined lssvm gs 6 the sca is optimized lssvm to find the best parameters of lssvm with minimum mse lssvm sca 7 the lssvm sca and lssvm gs are tested based on the test data 8 the accuracy of lssvm sca and lssvm gs are compared and the best model is selected 5 results and discussion 5 1 drought analysis by spi in the base period to get an overview of the general drought situation of the study area the spi time series is assessed in all stations and illustrated in fig 8 the red and blue colors in this figure show dry and wet conditions respectively as seen semnan and mehrabad stations have more severe more maximum severity and longer droughts than the nowshahr station also after the year 2000 the drought severity in semnan and mehrabad is more than in nowshahr therefore it can be concluded that more extreme droughts have occurred in semnan and mehrabad because these two stations are located in an arid and semi arid climate while nowshahr has a more humid climate 5 2 marginal distribution of drought characteristics in this section the marginal distributions of different drought characteristics in all stations are extracted table 2 presents the best fitted marginal distributions and their parameters these distributions are selected among different distributions based on the chi square c s and kolmogorov simonov k s tests according to table 2 ds and dm in all investigated stations have general extreme values distribution the dd in mehrabad and semnan stations has general pareto distribution and it has gamma distribution in the nowshahr station the best distribution for dl in mehrabad is general pareto distribution and the best distribution in semnan and nowshahr is general extreme values figs 9 11 show the cdf of empirical and marginal ds dm dd and dl for mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively as seen all marginal distributions are fitted by good precision expected of dl in semnan distribution these good precisions in marginal distribution can lead to better simulation of drought characteristics also the dl time series of semnan station has a high variance compared to other characteristics time series so dl s marginal and empirical cdf in this station could not properly fit and yield an acceptable result thus it is expected that the simulation of dl for the semnan station performs worse in the following sections 5 3 construction of vine copula based models here different structures of cvm and dvm have been considered by permuting the variables to construct adequate models so kendall s tau coefficient is employed for dependency measurement between pairwise variables and selecting the order of variables in the star shaped structure of cvm and hamiltonian path of dvm czado et al 2012 vernieuwe et al 2015 table 3 lists the values of kendall s tau between drought variables which are statistically significant at 0 5 level in each model the structure with the maximum sum of absolute values of kendall s tau in tree one would be selected as the best one according to the results the hamiltonian path of dvm for all stations is dm ds dd dl with the sum of 2 201 2 059 and 2 151 for mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively also the ds is chosen as the best root node in the star shaped structure of cvm for all stations and the sum of absolute values of pairwise variables kendall s tau are 2 136 1 954 and 2 107 for mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively in the next step different bivariate copula families are compared to fit each pair of variables in each vine structure the considered copula families are gaussian student t clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 and mixed the mixed copula is a weighted combination of some copula families and can express asymmetric correlation independently in this research the combination of the first copula to the tenth copula families shown by 1 to 10 is considered the mixed copula experience has shown that only families 1 and 5 were valid for dvm but all investigated families were valid for cvm thus mixed copula for dvm does not include the second family after estimating the parameters in all structures the constructed cvm and dvm are evaluated by aic bic and loglik criteria and the superior model will be selected fig 12 demonstrates the comparison of copula families fitted to cvm and dvm in all investigated stations each cvm or dvm with less aic bic and more loglik can be considered a more accurate model as seen in the mehrabad station the mixed dvm and mixed cvm have less aic and bic the mixed cvm and cvm9 also have more loglik the aic and bic for mixed cvm are less than mixed dvm and loglik for mixed cvm are more than cvm9 hence in the mehrabad station by considering all investigated criteria the mixed cvm has the first rank and mixed dvm is placed in the second rank in semnan and nowshahr stations mixed cvm and mixed dvm can be selected as the best cvm and dvm respectively it is worth mentioning that cvm2 has performed very weakly in all stations especially in semnan station which indicates that cvm with t copula family is not appropriate for drought simulation 5 4 simulating drought characteristics by the best cvm and dvm in this section the ds dm dd and dl are simulated by mixed cvm best cvm and mixed dvm best dvm firstly the mixed cvm and mixed dvm are compared based on the mae rmse and r criteria to show the accuracy of these copula models then the violin plots are used for comparing the distribution of simulated results and observed data table 4 shows the mae rmse and r for simulating ds dm dd and dl by mixed cvm and mixed dvm in different investigated stations it can be seen that in all stations and for different drought characteristics mixed cvm outperforms mixed dvm except for dm the mixed dvm simulated the dm with slightly more accuracy than mixed cvm therefore mixed cvm is better for simulating the severity duration and interarrival time of droughts while for simulating extreme conditions mixed dvm is slightly more accurate than mixed cvm nevertheless this slight difference can be disregarded and mixed cvm is selected as the best copula model in all investigated stations fig 13 shows the violin plots of drought characteristics modeling by mixed cvm and mixed dvm in mehrabad station as the control station the violin plots show the distribution of simulated drought characteristics versus observed drought characteristics as seen in fig 13 the distribution of simulated drought characteristics is slightly different from observed drought characteristics for mixed cvm and mixed dvm the violin plots for other stations also show good performance of mixed cvm and mixed dvm in simulating ds dm dd and dl finally by considering table 4 and fig 13 the mixed cvm is selected as the best structure for predicting drought characteristics under climate change conditions 5 5 rainfall simulation by the proposed hybrid models in the following the performance of hybrid data mining models is investigated in the downscaling bias correction step first lssvm as one of the most advanced artificial intelligent models is hybridized with the traditional gs method to simulate rainfall data second the performance of the novel hybrid model called lssvm sca is investigated and compared with lssvm gs to show the superiority of the proposed model the considered input combinations for rainfall simulation are listed in table 5 in this table the input combination with id equal to one only considered rainfall with one month lag while input combination with id equal to 12 considered rainfall with one month to 12 months lag in this table plag n shows the rainfall with nth lag the monthly observed data for the 1977 2005 period were selected for rainfall simulation by the hybrid data mining models the data were also randomized and split into training 70 of data includes 243 samples and testing 30 of data includes 105 samples data sets these data were imposed on algorithms by random calibration the performance of lssvm gs is investigated by considering the mae rmse and r criteria for canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 as listed in tables 6 a 1 a 2 and a 3 respectively according to the downscaled results based on canesm2 data in the testing phase the best performance of lssvm gs in mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations is related to inputs id equal to 12 10 and 12 respectively these results are reported for bnu esm as inputs id equal to 11 9 and 12 for ccsm4 as inputs id equal to 6 9 and 9 and for gfdl cm3 as inputs id equal to 8 10 and 10 also these tables present the best parameters of lssvm that gs obtains based on all investigated gcms in all stations the values of evaluation criterion r are also less than 0 88 except in gfdl cm3 at mehrabad station which can be concluded that this downscaling bias correction model is not suitable for adequate rainfall modeling therefore in this research a novel optimization algorithm called the sine cosine algorithm sca is employed to build a new hybrid data mining algorithm called lssvm sca the performance analyses of lssvm sca are tabulated in tables 7 a 4 a 5 and a 6 for canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 respectively for all gcms the input ids as the decision variables selected by the sca algorithm are 1 1 and 4 for mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively according to the results of these tables the lssvm sca is trained with reasonable accuracy in all stations by comparing the results of the performance evaluation criteria of lssvm sca with the results of lssvm gs for all gcms the superiority of lssvm sca is inferred in terms of criterions improvement in the testing phase the mae and rmse values of lssvm sca for all gcms are improved than the results of lssvm gs at all stations table 8 although the values of the r criterion for lssvm gs at mehrabad and nowshahr stations are 2 35 and 1 11 better than lssvm sca based on canesm2 and gfdl cm3 data respectively it could have to do with the procedure of search space evaluation in the gs algorithm which leads to dimensionality and storing many independent variables in its memory in the least square regression using typical data the r criterion is slightly increasing with increases in the number of model regressors so this criterion alone cannot be used as a meaningful comparison of the models and other criteria must also be considered therefore by considering all evaluation criteria for all selected gcms and at all stations it could be concluded that lssvm sca outperforms lssvm gs and its performance is confirmed for rainfall simulation fig 14 a 1 a 2 and a 3 illustrate the randomized monthly observed and simulated rainfall data by lssvm sca during 1977 2005 for canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 respectively as seen the simulated rainfall data for all gcms and at all three stations have good agreement with the observed data so lssvm sca is selected as the superior hybrid model for downscaling bias correction step and will be used for drought characteristics analysis in the next section 5 6 meteorological drought characteristics analysis by vc dm under climate change in this section meteorological drought characteristics will be investigated under future climate change conditions to this ends future rainfall data are projected under three rcp scenarios i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 using two hybrid data mining approaches since the uncertainty is an inseparable companion of almost all climate change impact studies here the uncertainties arising from the selection of gcms downscaling methods and rcps are initially evaluated and compared using the fuzzy method zadeh 1965 in this theory a fuzzy number or membership function will be assigned to each subset when it comes to uncertainty these numbers can be used as uncertain quantities which allow handling imprecise knowledge in the present study the triangular fuzzy membership function was used to compare the uncertainties of the models simulation results this function has three elements minimum maximum and median of data since the minimum and maximum values show the dispersion of data their membership function will be zero representing maximum uncertainty anaraki et al 2021 najafi and hessami kermani 2017 the membership function of median values will be 1 0 which is less affected by the uncertainty issues according to this theory the wider the triangle the greater the uncertainty and vice versa here lssvm sca and lssvm gs models were investigated for uncertainty analysis of rainfall predictions for the historical 1977 2005 and future 2021 2100 periods based on the application of four gcms and three rcps scenarios fig 15 shows the uncertainty analysis results of simulated rainfall in the historical period based on four gcms data using fuzzy elements according to the membership functions corresponding to rainfall simulation by lssvm sca and lssvm gc canesm2 has the lowest uncertainty in both downscaling models while ccsm4 has the highest uncertainty also comparing two downscaling models results lssvm sca has the lowest uncertainty for most gcms data except for ccsm4 which lssvm gc has slightly less uncertainty fig 16 results of projected rainfall for the future period indicate less uncertainty of canesm2 for most rcps however for rcp8 5 and lssvm sca downscaling method gfdl cms has slightly less uncertainty than other gcms fig 17 shows the uncertainty analysis results for rainfall predictions under three selected rcps based on lssvm sca and lssvm gc methods the highest uncertainty of bnu esm is also observed in the three selected rcps and two downscaling methods therefore according to the mentioned uncertainty analysis results canesm2 is selected as the best model with less uncertainty for drought characteristics analysis under climate change moreover fig 18 demonstrates the membership functions corresponding to rainfall simulation by lssvm sca under different scenarios based on canesm2 data it is observed that rainfall simulation under rcp8 5 has the highest uncertainty among all investigated rcps while the uncertainty of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 rank second and third respectively fig 19 shows the observed and predicted rainfall data under climate change conditions using lssvm sca based on canesm2 as is seen the observed period is from 1977 to 2005 and the prediction period is from 2021 to 2100 according to the results of rainfall prediction in mehrabad station the projected data will decrease under all three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 while in the semnan and nowshahr stations it will be increasing under all scenarios also the rate of increase in the semnan station will be more than in the nowshahr station the changes in statistical parameters of rainfall i e mean minimum and maximum under all investigated scenarios are tabulated in table 9 according to this table all parameters of the projected rainfall for the mehrabad station will decrease under all scenarios in this station the change of mean parameter is between 50 to 61 the change of minimum parameter is between 35 to 54 and the change of maximum parameter is between 62 to 67 this severe reduction could have to do with high fossil fuel consumption and land use changes which contributed to serious air pollution in this city and lead to more emissions of greenhouse gases so it is expected that this reduction will be observed in all scenarios and will be much greater than what has previously been thought sarhadi et al 2016 have also pointed out this severe reduction in the near and long term predictions in the semnan station the mean and minimum parameters will increase while the maximum parameter will decrease according to the results of this station the change of mean parameter is between 16 and 24 the change of minimum parameter is between 7 and 41 and the change of maximum parameter is between 6 to 14 finally in the nowshahr station the mean minimum and maximum parameters will increase as is seen the change of mean parameter is in the range of 13 to 16 the change of minimum parameter is in the range of 17 to 26 and the change of maximum parameter is in the range of 21 to 33 finally future meteorological drought characteristics are projected and analyzed under climate change conditions in mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations based on downscaled data of canesm2 gcm for this purpose the mixed cvm as the best copula model is used by considering three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 at this stage the inputs of the multivariate cvm model are drought characteristics extracted from the projected spi series fig 20 demonstrates all investigated drought characteristics and their return periods in different stations and for different scenarios as is seen in the mehrabad station absolute values of ds for all scenarios will decrease except for rcp2 6 increase up to 50 units for a 20000 year return period also the dm will increase while the dd and dl will decrease under all considered scenarios thus dd will decrease for all scenarios while dl will decrease for all scenarios except for rcp8 5 in the nowshahr station absolute values of ds will increase under all scenarios increase up to 25 units for rcp2 6 and 20000 year return period except for rcp8 5 the dm has not changed significantly while dd will decrease under all scenarios the dl will also increase in all scenarios except for rcp4 5 according to the projected data in 2021 2100 it is obvious that the absolute values of ds under rcp2 6 will decrease in all stations and for this scenario there are more severe droughts than observation period without significant change in dm the other point of the results showed in fig 20 is that dd is expected to decrease in all stations and under all scenarios the dl will also decrease in all stations and scenarios except for semnan and nowshahr stations under rcp8 5 therefore it can be concluded that in 2021 2100 more severe droughts will occur under rcp2 6 while there will be better conditions under rcp8 5 moreover the mehrabad station will have more severe droughts than other investigated stations and this issue is consistent with the results of table 9 and fig 19 another result that can be deducted from fig 20 is that by increasing return periods the ds dm and dd will increase and dl will decrease which can be interpreted according to the nature of drought actually in low return periods severe droughts rarely occur 6 conclusion due to the importance of rainfall prediction in drought analysis and the essential need to plan and manage droughts under future climate conditions this research was conducted to provide comprehensive insight towards future drought conditions of the northern strip of iran for this purpose a new methodology called vc dm was presented for meteorological drought analysis under climate change conditions based on the combination of four dimensional vine copula model c vine and d vine and hybrid machine learning algorithm least square support vector machine hybridized with sine cosine algorithm and evaluated in different climates of the north of iran which are frequently affected by this extreme phenomenon the drought was indexed by monthly spi and four major characteristics of drought event extracted including drought severity ds maximum spi value dm drought duration dd and the time interval between two events dl here two flexible vine copula structures were fitted to observed data for characterizing multivariate dependencies among these variables the best ordering of variables in vine structures was chosen by kendall s tau coefficients and then ten families of existing bivariate copulas were examined for fitting to pairwise variables the mixed cvm ranked first according to aic bic and log likelihood criteria the superior performance of the selected model was also emphasized for simulation of characteristics by mae rmse and r criteria in all stations so mixed cvm was selected for drought analysis under future climate change conditions it is worth mentioning that like many previous studies conducted on drought modeling this research was also facing data scarcity however from a statistical point of view the small size of data could be acceptable especially in multivariate problems daneshkhah et al 2016 genest et al 2007 in the following large scale rainfall data from four cmip5 gcms were spatially downscaled using a sophisticated machine learning based bias correction model lssvm sca the performance of lssvm sca was also compared to hybrid of lssvm and grid search method lssvm gs the analysis indicated that lssvm sca outperforms lssvm gs in rainfall simulation evidently uncertainty is an inevitable part of all gcms predictions which can be related to their natural variability and coarse resolutions ahmadalipour et al 2017 and depends on the region they are applied to here the uncertainty arising from the selection of gcms downscaling bias correction methods and rcps were investigated using triangular fuzzy membership functions results revealed that canesm2 gcm has the lowest uncertainty in both downscaling models and lssvm sca has lower uncertainty than lssvm gs in the historical period it is also observed that for the future period canesm2 has less uncertainty for most rcps also rcp8 5 has the highest uncertainty among all investigated rcps highlighting the fact that rainfall projection results with this scenario should be interpreted with more caution so canesm2 as the superior gcm and lssvm sca as the more accurate downscaling method were selected for drought characteristics analysis under future climate change the mean of projected rainfall data will increase in all stations up to 24 for rcp8 5 in semnan station except for mehrabad station up to 52 for rcp2 6 this severe reduction in the mehrabad station can be related to high fossil fuel consumption and land use changes which was emphasized by sarhadi et al 2016 finally the results of drought analysis under future climate change by vc dm showed that in the 2021 2100 period the absolute values of ds under rcp2 6 would decrease in all stations and for this scenario there will be more severe droughts than the observation period without significant changes in dm thus dm will not have significant changes in all stations and under all scenarios the dl will also decrease in all stations and scenarios except for semnan and nowshahr stations under rcp8 5 therefore it can be concluded that in 2021 2100 more severe droughts will occur under rcp2 6 up to 50 units more absolute ds than the observed period while for rcp8 5 there will be better conditions also the mehrabad station will have more severe droughts values of 70 for ds and 20 000 return period than other investigated stations generally the main goal of this methodological study is to address the performance of the proposed methodology in multivariate vine copula based modeling of drought analysis and explain how it can be used for future climate change assessments the authors would like to recommend the comparative analysis of the proposed methodology for other meteorological parameters like temperature in other regions to provide a more comprehensive picture of future climate change credit authorship contribution statement alireza farrokhi methodology software formal analysis investigation writing

3977,this research provides a novel methodology for modeling multivariate dependence structures of meteorological drought characteristics severity duration peak and interarrival time based on the

lssvm which is hybridized with two optimization algorithms i e grid search gs and sine cosine algorithm sca results indicated that lssvm sca was more accurate than lssvm gs for all gcms in the testing period the uncertainty analysis results for the historical period 1977 2005 revealed that lssvm sca had less uncertainty than lssvm gs it was also observed that of all the selected gcms canesm2 had less uncertainty for most climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 so canesm2 as the best gcm with low uncertainty and lssvm sca as the superior downscaling bias correction method were selected for drought characteristics analysis under climate change conditions the rainfall predictions for the 2021 2100 period were projected to decrease in mehrabad station and increase in semnan and nowshahr stations under all three selected rcps finally all projected drought characteristics were analyzed by the selected and preferable vine copula based model c vine model with mixed pair copulas to provide comprehensive insight towards future drought conditions it can be concluded that more severe droughts will occur in 2021 2100 than the historical period and the absolute value of drought severity decreases under rcp2 6 in all stations all drought durations are also expected to decrease while drought peaks will not change significantly in all stations and under all scenarios

dynamics laboratory climate model version 3 1 introduction human history is full of natural disasters and their adverse effects on the lives of earth s inhabitants including massive floods and long term droughts which sedimentological studies have proved their past occurrence drought is one of the inseparable phenomena from the climatic conditions of countries located in subtropical regions this common phenomenon in these regions which contain most of the world s deserts can lead to harmful consequences actually in arid and semi arid regions which naturally have limited water resources significant drought effects on these resources are quickly revealed the study of iran s past history also confirms the occurrence of famine and the death of thousands of people due to consecutive droughts drought can have different aspects such as meteorological hydrological agricultural and socio economical climatologist donald wilhite and atmospheric scientist michael glantz 1985 presented this classification based on four fundamental approaches to drought measurement as the most considerable aspect meteorological drought is usually defined based on the degree of dryness compared to normal or average values and the length of dry period this definition should be considered on a case by case basis for each specific region since the weather conditions which cause lack of rainfall change drastically from one region to another understanding the environmental vulnerability to drought seems complex because of its unexpected effects many researches have been conducted in the past on identifying the components of this phenomenon and its modeling by statistical and mathematical methods to provide practical predictions for its occurrence and characteristics there are a variety of studies that provide information on developments and innovations in drought modeling mishra and singh 2010 aghakouchak et al 2015 due to the randomness of this phenomenon monitoring its probabilistic properties quickly became the target of many researchers around the world however the common weak point of many studies was the use of univariate analysis which ignored the effect of other variables and the dependencies between them yue et al 2001 pointed out that univariate analyses could in no way consider the effects of these correlations and can cause misinterpretation they suggested that to study and model these components a multivariate analysis should be implemented which uses simultaneous analysis of components to monitor one phenomenon the traditional method of multivariate analysis was the use of classical multivariate distribution functions but uniformity of marginal distributions was mandatory in using these functions and certainly limited their use like in entropy in addition these functions do not have much variety including the exponential normal gamma pareto and generalized pareto distributions which have been mentioned in several studies beersma and buishand 2004 jakubowski 2006 vangelis et al 2011 the main weakness of these studies is the need to use a joint statistical distribution for variables and the possibility of disproportionate fitness of variables to marginal distributions also these studies do not consider the correlation of variables with each other and as a result do not have high accuracy in modeling multivariate phenomena a more appropriate method for multivariate analysis that has overcome the limitations of classical multivariate distribution functions is the use of copula functions which have been widely used recently in water resources studies copulas are functions that link multivariate distributions to marginal distributions of one variable and consequently the structure of dependence between variables with different marginal distributions could be modeled more accurately these functions can preserve the dependence structure among all characteristics and imitate their joint behavior for flexible parameterization and modeling wu et al 2020 tosunoglu and onof 2017 implementation of copula functions in drought analyses does not have a long history serinaldi et al 2009 used a six month spi index to analyze the probabilistic characteristics of droughts in the sicilian region of italy to model the stochastic behavior of characteristics and specify the considered return periods they implemented copula functions which had high flexibility in selecting marginal distribution functions amirataee and montaseri 2017 performed the regional analysis of the joint probability of drought characteristics of lake urmia in iran using spi index and copula functions significant reduction of uncertainty in modeling the probabilities of important components of drought phenomenon was the most important result of their research wang et al 2020 evaluated hydrological and meteorological droughts and their relationships their results revealed that the two dimensional frank copula is the best fitted copula function to investigate the drought return period copula functions have been highly applied in drought modeling but if there are more than two components d 2 the problem will be very complex and time consuming in order to overcome this drawback the vine structure was introduced by joe 1997 as a tool for the decomposition of multivariate distribution functions to interrelated conditional bivariate distributions bedford and cooke 2001 developed a flexible graphical model called regular vine for multivariate more than two distribution functions this model s vine shaped structure makes the multivariate density function from the binary combination of copulas pair copulas aas et al 2009 introduced two different structures for vines canonical vine c vine and drawable vine d vine that differed in the order in which the variables were placed next to each other and the shape of the tree structure of the pair copulas the flexibility and high accuracy of these models made their use rapidly common in hydrologic applications including simulation of rainfall and storm characteristics gyasi agyei and melching 2012 vernieuwe et al 2015 probabilistic modeling of evapotranspiration pham et al 2015 flood frequency analysis shafaei et al 2016 daneshkhah et al 2016 it must be mentioned that the use of vine copula functions in four dimensional drought related issues is quite rare so one of the main approaches of this research will be the representation of dependence structure between drought characteristics severity duration peak and interarrival time and the determination of joint return period of drought variables due to the occurrence of climate change in recent years as one of the serious threats to sustainable development in various dimensions including environment natural resources and economic activities it will be vital to conduct studies that can consider these future changes and improve our preparedness to deal with their effects and resulting costs as one of the most important extreme events the drought phenomenon is affected by climatic processes due to changes in precipitation and temperature patterns several studies have been performed on simulation of rainfall data based on climate scenarios and models e g kiem and austin 2013 tavakolifar et al 2017 nourani et al 2018 azari et al 2021 evidently there are several sources of uncertainty that affect the results of studies conducted on climate change impact assessments among them the uncertainty related to the choice of general circulation models gcms has been considered in most studies woldemeskel et al 2016 reported an uncertainty reduction in cmip5 coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 precipitation projections relative to those in cmip3 their results revealed that uncertainty is relatively larger and smaller in colder and hotter regions respectively yin et al 2020 investigated the changes in flood characteristics with uncertainty analysis under climate change condition using the ability of copula functions for construction of characteristics joint distribution and the outputs of multi model cmip5 gcms their results revealed a positive trend of precipitation over china and increasing uncertainty of flood characteristics estimations in the future there are several studies conducted to evaluate the performance of multi model gcms in meteorological and hidrological variables projections jia et al 2019 mesbahzadeh et al 2019 yin et al 2021 the most important advantage of such comparative studies is improving the accuracy of projections in different climatic conditions and reducing the effects of climate models uncertainties furthermore using gcms output needs downscaling bias correction to infer high resolution information from low resolution variables woldemeskel et al 2016 reported a significant uncertainty reduction in gcms projection after several bias correction approaches basically this reduction is because that all models are forced to have the same properties e g mean and standard deviation fang et al 2018 used some downscaling bias correction approaches to make large scale grid based precipitation and temperature data to station scales and highlighted the uncertainties arising from gcm models krinner et al 2020 concluded that empirical bias corrections could potentially reduce the uncertainty of cmip outputs and improve the quality of large scale gcm data machine learning methods have recently found successful applications especially in rainfall prediction e g ehteram et al 2019 farrokhi et al 2020 pham et al 2020 anaraki et al 2021 azad et al 2021 these methods can improve the accuracy of downscaling bias correction among these methods the least square support vector machine lssvm as a progressive data mining algorithm has some advantages over others such as high efficiency in computation time having a simple structure and not getting stuck in the local optima suyken et al 2002 guo et al 2020 proposed a new hybrid model using lssvm with a recursive mechanism to explore the modeling multi step ahead forecasts of reservoir water availability results indicated that the model outperforms other comparative models in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback as well as the adaptive mechanism due to the high accuracy required in determining the parameters of this method conventional procedures like the fundamental trial and error method will be extremely time consuming farzin et al 2020 in these cases optimization algorithms can be employed as leading approaches for accurate modeling as a superior population based approach the sine cosine optimization algorithm sca can efficiently optimize the lssvm parameters the sca is a modern optimization technique that creates multiple initial random candidate solutions to fluctuate toward the best solution using sine and cosine functions mirjalili 2016 in this study four selected gcms from the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 were spatially downscaled using one sophisticated machine learning based bias correction model lssvm sca this effective approach for predictors correction could lead to high quality downscaled simulations into situ data it is worth mentioning that the main goal of this research is to introduce a novel methodology called vc dm to study meteorological drought phenomena in response to climate change by using four dimensional vine copula functions and downscaled hybrid model outputs lssvm sca to this end the copula based model is used for multivariate analysis while data mining prediction methods are used for downscaling rainfall time series and projecting future rainfall data this methodology can be useful to predict future droughts and simulate their components with more precision 2 the proposed framework the proposed vc dm methodology of meteorological drought characteristics modeling includes the following steps fig 1 1 collecting and preprocessing of required data initially monthly observed spi data are collected for the base period drought characteristics are extracted from the spi time series in each station for all time series marginal distributions are selected among different distributions based on the chi square test and kolmogorov simonov test and their fitting with empirical cdf are evaluated 2 constructing vine copula models the canonical c vine and drawable d vine vine structures hereinafter called cvm and dvm are used to construct the suitable four dimensional multivariate model the kendall s tau coefficient is employed for dependency measurement between pairwise variables and selecting the order of variables in the star shaped structure of cvm and the hamiltonian path of dvm then ten families of well known copulas gaussian student t clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 and mixed are examined for all bivariate copula branches and the appropriate ones are selected for each model based on akaike information criterion aic bayesian information criterion bic and loglik criteria eventually all drought characteristics are simulated by the best selected cvm and dvm the accuracy of predictions is evaluated based on mae rmse and r criteria in all stations and the appropriate multivariate vine model is introduced by statistical and graphical methods 3 rainfall simulation and prediction under climate change conditions rainfall data from four large scale gcms canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 are downscaled by a novel hybrid data mining method lssvm hybridized with sine cosine algorithm lssvm sca the performance of lssvm sca is compared with the traditional grid search gs algorithm and the superiority of the proposed model is confirmed the uncertainty analysis is also performed to select a gcm with less uncertainty for climate change projections finally the hybrid model is used to simulate future rainfall for the prediction period 2021 2100 based on selected gcm and under three climate change scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and changes in statistical parameters of predicted rainfalls are calculated 4 analyzing drought characteristics under future climate change conditions in the final step the impact of climate change on future droughts is evaluated using the selected vine copula model introduced in step 2 all characteristics are modeled under three considered rcp scenarios and change in return periods are investigated in all stations it is worth mentioning that all computations are performed using the dynamic copula toolbox of matlab software and the cd vine package of r software 3 study area and dataset 3 1 study area the study area of this research is located inside the central plateau and caspian sea watersheds in the northern strip of iran this area includes three provinces tehran semnan and mazandaran that are of particular geopolitical importance the central plateau where most of the area of tehran and semnan provinces are located consists of several closed basins surrounded by the alborz mountains from the north and the zagros mountains from the west the average elevation of this plateau is about 900 m but several of the mountains that tower over the plateau exceed 3 000 m this watershed is one of the least rainy basins in iran with an average of 145 mm annual rainfall and drains an area of about 824000 km2 the distribution of rainfall is not also uniform throughout this basin so that in the lowest area of this watershed the annual rainfall does not reach 50 mm the caspian sea watershed as a narrow and long plain extends for more than 600 km along the shore of the largest lake on the earth referred to as the caspian sea so that at some places the coast is less than 2 km away from the foothills of alborz this open basin contains several rivers that lead to the caspian sea and drains an area of about 174000 km2 due to the high slope there is a difference of about 5500 m between the highest and lowest point of this watershed while the average elevation across the coastal area is about 21 m also as the rainiest watershed in the country the average annual rainfall varies between 1800 mm in the west and 200 mm in the east this study was performed with monthly rainfall time series obtained from three synoptic stations namely mehrabad latitude 35 41 n longitude 51 47 e and elevation 1191 m amsl semnan latitude 35 35 n longitude 53 42 e and elevation 1127 m amsl and nowshahr latitude 36 39 n longitude 51 31 e and elevation 20 9 m bmsl as shown in fig 2 according to the iran meteorological organization these stations have different climatic conditions the mehrabad station which is located in tehran city has a cold semi arid climate with continental climate characteristics bsh group based on koppen index its climate follows a mediterranean precipitation pattern and the average annual rainfall and temperature are 231 mm and 17 7 c respectively the semnan station which is located in the northern borders of dasht e kavir desert has a cold desert climate and is classified in the bwk group its average monthly temperature varies from 0 c in january to 36 6 c in july and the average annual rainfall is 140 mm the nowshahr station is located across the caspian sea due to high humidity the climate of this station is classified in the csa group hot summer mediterranean climate the average annual rainfall of nowshahr station is 964 mm generally these three stations cover a diverse range of climates and a comparative analysis of droughts in these areas can provide a comprehensive view for water resources managers to make appropriate decisions and prevent damages 3 2 dataset for this research historical data of monthly rainfall for all three stations provided by the iran meteorological organization are implemented for the 1977 2005 period in order to determine the multi dimensional distribution of drought characteristics four variables were extracted from monthly spi time series including drought severity ds maximum spi value dm drought duration dd and time interval between two events dl to this end the theory of runs yevjevich 1967 is used for drought characteristics definition a negative positive run is defined as a portion of the time series of variable spi t in which all values are below above a selected threshold level the spi value of 1 is also defined as the threshold level for identifying drought events one drought event begins when spi drops below the value of 1 mckee et al 1993 and ends until it reaches 0 so the number of drought events extracted from the databases using the run theory are 81 64 and 53 events in mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively evidently data scarcity as one of the main challenges of drought characteristics modeling may lead to low accuracy in model predictions in particular for independent variables but from a statistical point of view the small size of data could be acceptable especially in multivariate problems daneshkhah et al 2016 genest et al 2007 fig 3 illustrates drought characteristics and how they were calculated the large scale gcm data of the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5 cmip5 were used as the predictors to train and test the introduced hybrid model the predictors extracted from canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 gcms under representative concentration pathway rcp scenarios were used to investigate the future climate table 1 the rcp scenarios are also the greenhouse gas concentration not emissions trajectory adopted by the ipcc s fifth assessment report ar5 in 2014 and describe our future climate by consideration of the possible volume of greenhouse gases ghg emitted in the atmosphere the most important factors affecting these scenarios are population growth rate socio economic developments and concentrations of greenhouse gases especially carbon dioxide emission in this research three famous scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 have been considered with the 2 6 4 5 and 8 5 w m2 possible range of radiative forcing values at the end of 21st respectively van vuuren et al 2011 all data have been received from the canadian climate change scenarios network cccsn http www cccsn ec gc ca with 2 5 degree spatial resolution also the prediction period is defined from 2021 to 2100 4 material and methods 4 1 copulas and vine structures generally copulas are functions that link multivariate distributions to univariate marginal distributions on the unit square 0 1 these multivariate cumulative distribution functions can model the dependency structures between variables with different marginal distributions hence the properties of each copula are very similar to the corresponding distribution function in the theory of copulas marginal distribution functions do not necessarily follow a definite distribution and this is why copulas can evaluate changes in the dependencies of variables more appropriately in joint distributions based on sklar s theorem sklar 1959 copula functions make it possible to construct a multivariate distribution in which the dependence between components is considered from a number of univariate distributions with different statistical distributions accordingly an n dimensional copula is a multivariate cumulative distribution function with uniform marginal distribution functions u i f i x i i 1 2 n on the 0 1 so the joint cumulative distribution function can be written as follows f x 1 x n c f 1 x 1 f n x n θ 1 c u 1 u n θ pr u 1 u 1 u n u n where c is an n dimensional copula on c 0 1 n 0 1 and θ is the copula s parameter that can specify the amount of dependency between marginal distribution functions if marginal distribution functions are continuous c will be unique otherwise c will be calculated on ran f 1 r a n f 2 r a n f n exclusively ranf is the range of the marginal function so far different families of copulas have been developed based on differences in providing details of dependencies between variables in different sciences some have an explicit formula to express the cumulative distribution function such as archimedean copulas and some do not such as elliptical copulas but when the number of variables increases it will be very difficult and time consuming to use ordinary copula functions to analyze multivariate distributions n 3 bedford and cooke 2001 introduced a graphical model called the regular normal vine copula a vine structure with n variable is a nested set of connected trees where the edges in the first tree are the nodes of the second tree the edges of the second tree are the nodes of the third tree etc so at level j 1 the nodes of the tree will be constructed by the edges of the tree from level j and the given variables are the nodes of level 1 the vine structure breaks down the multivariate density function into pair copulas n n 1 2 bivariate copulas and constructs the joint density function from the bivariate copulas between the marginal and conditional distributions of the n variables each pair copula can be selected from different bivariate copulas which makes modeling more flexible kurowicka and cooke 2007 two types of the regular vine are called canonical c vine and drawable d vine vines fig 4 where each one has its exclusive structure the order in which the variables are connected to each other and have been more practical in hydrological sciences generally n 2 patterns can be made based on the order of variables while there can be only n 1 trees in each structure the star shaped structure of the c vine assigns one node in each tree the maximal degree and puts key variable at the root of this structure while d vine has a pass like structure in which no node can be connected to more than two adjacent nodes and consequently no node is considered as the root of the structure aas et al 2009 the four dimensional joint density function of the random variable x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 in c vine structure can be written as follows f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 f x 4 c 12 f x 1 f x 2 c 13 f x 1 f x 3 c 14 f x 1 f x 4 c 23 1 f x 2 x 1 f x 3 x 1 c 34 1 f x 3 x 1 f x 4 x 1 2 c 34 12 f x 3 x 1 x 2 f x 4 x 1 x 2 f x 2 x 1 c 12 f x 1 f x 2 θ 21 f x 1 f x 3 x 1 c 13 f x 1 f x 3 θ 31 f x 1 f x 4 x 1 c 14 f x 1 f x 4 θ 41 f x 1 f x 4 x 1 x 2 c 42 1 f x 4 x 1 f x 2 x 1 θ 24 1 f x 2 x 1 3 f x 3 x 1 x 2 c 32 1 f x 3 x 1 f x 2 x 1 θ 23 1 f x 2 x 1 where f x j x i is conditional distribution function θ ij is conditional dependence parameter obtained from f x j f x i bivariate margins θ ij k is copula parameter of f x i x k and f x j x k margins parameters will be estimated using the maximum likelihood method where the likelihood logarithm is maximized using numerical methods and the corresponding parameter is estimated the best fitted copula function will be selected by using aic and bic statistics similarly the four dimensional joint density function in d vine structure can be written as follows f x 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 f x 1 f x 2 f x 3 f x 4 c 12 f x 1 f x 2 c 23 f x 2 f x 3 c 34 f x 3 f x 4 c 13 2 f x 1 x 2 f x 3 x 2 c 24 3 f x 2 x 3 f x 4 x 3 4 c 14 23 f x 1 x 2 x 3 f x 4 x 2 x 3 this structure has a path in which the variables have maximum dependence this path is also known as the hamiltonian path joe 1997 expressed the right side elements of the above equation using the concept of joint copulas from conditional probabilistic distribution functions as follows 5 f x ϑ c x ϑ j ϑ j f x ϑ j f ϑ j ϑ j f ϑ j ϑ j where ϑ j corresponds to the arbitrary element of n dimensional vector ϑ ϑ j is the same vector ϑ except the component j and c x ϑ j ϑ j is suitable bivariate copula function of conditional distribution f x ϑ if ϑ is univariate eq 5 can be represented as follows aas et al 2009 6 f x ϑ c x ϑ f x f ϑ θ f ϑ similarly the parameters of the copula functions must be chosen in such a way as to maximize the log likelihood for the copulas the value of log likelihood for each n dimensional structure with n data can be obtained by the following equations 7 l cvine θ k 1 n i 1 n 1 j 1 n i l o g c i i j 1 j 1 f i 1 j 1 f i j 1 j 1 θ i i j 1 j 1 l dvine θ k 1 n i 1 n 1 j 1 n i l o g c j j i j 1 j i 1 f j j 1 j i 1 f j i j 1 j i 1 θ j j i j 1 j i 1 choosing the most suitable bivariate copula function and the best structure for all pair copulas can be conducted by computing aic bic and also using the maximum likelihood method ml aic is based on the hypothesis test and ranks different models akaike 1974 bic has more power to compare models because it considers the number of observations in the second sentence of its equation schwarz 1978 these criteria can be expressed as follows aic 2 i 1 n j 1 n l o g c θ u i u j θ 2 k 8 bic 2 i 1 n j 1 n l o g c θ u i u j θ 2 k l o g n where k is the number of copula function parameters and n is the number of data brechmann and schepsmeier 2013 also multivariate return periods can be obtained from too much data which the vine copula model simulates in a multivariate situation the copula based approach can appropriately model the joint probability and return period of drought characteristics salvadori and de michele 2004 calculated as follows shiau 2006 ganguli and reddy 2014 9 rp d s i l n q 1 c d s m l where n is the drought period based on spi data q is the number of drought events c d s i l is a four variate joint distribution produced by the vine copula model and rp d s m l is a four variate joint return period when a problem is faced with a small amount of data the conditional distributions at second and third trees may be estimated with lower accuracy somehow noisier but it could be resolved by ignoring some unnecessary conditional dependencies stöeber et al 2013 however based on the results of this study the need for this simplifying assumption was not recognized the results confirm the great and reliable performance of modeling with vine copula structures so fitting an appropriate structure to data and constructing a suitable multivariate model can be summarized in the following three steps first determining an appropriate order of the variables for each structure some approaches can be implemented for selecting the order of variables in vine tree shaped structures calculation of kendall s tau coefficient is the most commonly used in statistical analysis for measuring the dependence between pairwise variables the star shaped order and the hamiltonian path will be selected based on the strongest cumulative dependence of all connections maximizing the sum of absolute kendall s tau values in c vine and d vine structures respectively second fitting the best bivariate copula families to each pair copula and estimation of their parameters in all trees the bivariate copula parameters of the first tree are computed from observed data by the ml method for the next trees conditional distribution functions eq 5 and eq 6 play the role of input data and the parameters can be derived aas et al 2009 in the present study well known copulas gaussian student t clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 and mixed are investigated by aic bic and loglik criteria third simulating all variables by the best selected model and testing the accuracy of their predictions some evaluation criteria including mae rmse and r were used to compare the fitting of simulated results and observed data and introduced an appropriate multivariate dependence model with vine structures 4 2 least square support vector machine lssvm in the present study the lssvm as a modified version of the support vector machine has been used to statistically downscale rainfall data from gcms it has more computational advantage than svm especially in assessing nonlinear classification problems and regression analysis suykens and vandewalle 1999 utilizing the least square optimization method has made this progressive data mining algorithm more efficient in terms of computation time a nonlinear function φ is the mapping function that maps the input data into a higher dimensional transformed one the lssvm function can be shown as follows 10 f x w t φ x b where w is a weight vector and b is the bias according to the structural minimization principle the optimal regression problem can be formulated by minimizing j w e as follows j w e 1 2 w t w γ 2 i 1 m e i 2 s t y i w t φ x i b e i i 1 2 m where e i is residual error variable and γ is the tuning parameter margin parameter the lssvm will be solved after the lagrangian function is constructed as follows 12 l w b e α j w e i 1 n α i w t φ x i b e i y i where α i are lagrange multipliers optimal conditions of the above objective function eq 12 can be obtained by solving the partial derivatives from the objective function suykens and vandewalle 1999 elimination of w and e will yield a linear system linear relation between input and output data 13 0 i n t i n k γ 1 i n b α 0 y where α is support vector α α 1 α n i is identity matrix i 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 y is output data y y 1 y n and k is the kernel function defined according to the mercer theorem so the general form of lssvm in linear interaction can be shown as follows 14 y x i 1 n α i k x x i b where x i are training data and reused as for input data so far several types of kernel functions are introduced including linear polynomial and radial basis functions rbf in the present study rbf as the most common function in regression problems is implemented to map the input data into higher dimensional transformed one which is calculated as follows 15 k x i x j e x p x i x j 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the width of the kernel function determining the lssvm parameters with conventional procedures adjustment of gamma γ and sigma σ parameters will be extremely time consuming in these cases powerful optimization algorithms such as sca can be used to determine the parameters which is discussed in the next section 4 3 sine cosine algorithm sca in this section the leading metaheuristic algorithm will be explained as a superior population based approach which was used to optimize the lssvm parameters efficiently for this purpose various optimization methods have been used in the previous studies including genetic algorithm ga particle swarm optimization pso grid search gs etc the gs algorithm which has received more attention outperforms other algorithms especially in stock market studies but the calculation process of this traditional method is complicated and so time consuming chen et al 2018 this algorithm is based on comparing the parameters of each grid and debugging the optimal parameters group using integer exponentials due to the convergence of inconsistency with deviation in the learning paradigm this method cannot be accurate mo et al 2020 so in this research the sca which was introduced by mirjalili 2016 as a modern optimization technique has been implemented in this population based optimization algorithm the mathematical sine and cosine functions are used with a set of random solutions in other words it creates multiple initial random candidate solutions to fluctuate toward the best solution using sine and cosine functions mirjalili 2016 the procedure begins with a set of search agents solutions and updates continuously by the following equation 16 x i t 1 x i t r 1 sin r 2 r 3 p i t x i t r 4 0 5 x i t r 1 cos r 2 r 3 p i t x i t r 4 0 5 where x i t represents position vector of the current search agent p i t refers to the position of the destination point in the i th dimension at the t th iteration and r 1 r 2 r 3 and r 4 are random numbers called the main parameters of the sca parameter r 1 is used to find the region of the next solution this region might be either inside the space between the solution and destination or outside them parameter r 2 indicates the movement distance either outward or toward the destination and obeys uniform distribution between 0 and 2 π parameter r 3 is a random weight of destination which randomly emphasizes when r 3 1 or deemphasizes when r 3 1 the desalination effect in setting the distance and it obeys uniform distribution between 0 and 2 the last parameter r 4 switches the equation between sine and cosine modules by the same token and its value range is bounded between 0 to 1 the conceptual model of sca is shown in fig 5 the optimization process is divided into exploration and exploitation phases in the exploration phase the sca algorithm combines random search agents in the set of search agents suddenly with a high rate of arbitrariness to discover favorable regions of the search space in the other phase the variation of random search agents is considerably decreased in order to reach the global optima the algorithm should be able to balance the exploration and exploitation capabilities therefore parameter r 1 in eq 16 is linearly reduced from a to 0 during the iterations to balance the exploration and exploitation based on the following equation 17 r 1 a t a t where t represents the current iteration t indicates the maximum number of iterations and a is a constant a 0 indeed the algorithm does not search all the space which takes the least possible time and reduces the computational cost so fewer parameter settings simplicity of its concept easy implementation and faster convergence are the main advantages of this novel algorithm furthermore due to the randomized search nature of this algorithm it can reduce the chance of a model overfitting to the training data the flowchart of sca is illustrated in fig 6 further details can be found in mirjalili 2016 4 4 hybrid of lssvm with sca and gs lssvm sca and lssvm gs the hybridization strategy used in this study for optimization lssvm parameters is applying the sca method which was explained in the previous section this optimization leads to stability in model performance and increases its accuracy in addition comparing the results of lssvm sca with lssvm gs can be a valuable evaluation of the proposed strategy the sca algorithm uses rmse as the objective function and finds optimal lssvm parameters γ and σ with smaller rmse values these parameters are also considered as decision variables for this hybrid model sca creates multiple initial random candidate solutions to fluctuate toward the best solution using sine and cosine functions the flowchart of lssvm sca is shown in fig 7 in the present study 70 of data samples are used to train lssvm sca and lssvm gs also 30 of data samples are employed for testing the investigated algorithms these data were imposed on algorithms by random calibration the process of modeling precipitation by lssvm sca and lssvm gs is as follows 1 the inputs and target data are collected the large scale rainfall data obtained from gcms are considered inputs and rainfall data in the station is considered a target 2 the data are divided into training and testing samples 3 the range of gamma and sigma for lssvm sca and lssvm gs is set to 1 250 and 0 01 0 5 respectively based on the authors experience 4 the mesh grid size of gamma and sigma for lssvm gs is considered equal to 5 and 0 05 respectively based on the authors experience 5 the lssvm is trained for each gamma and sigma in the mesh grid and the best parameters of lssvm with minimum mse are determined lssvm gs 6 the sca is optimized lssvm to find the best parameters of lssvm with minimum mse lssvm sca 7 the lssvm sca and lssvm gs are tested based on the test data 8 the accuracy of lssvm sca and lssvm gs are compared and the best model is selected 5 results and discussion 5 1 drought analysis by spi in the base period to get an overview of the general drought situation of the study area the spi time series is assessed in all stations and illustrated in fig 8 the red and blue colors in this figure show dry and wet conditions respectively as seen semnan and mehrabad stations have more severe more maximum severity and longer droughts than the nowshahr station also after the year 2000 the drought severity in semnan and mehrabad is more than in nowshahr therefore it can be concluded that more extreme droughts have occurred in semnan and mehrabad because these two stations are located in an arid and semi arid climate while nowshahr has a more humid climate 5 2 marginal distribution of drought characteristics in this section the marginal distributions of different drought characteristics in all stations are extracted table 2 presents the best fitted marginal distributions and their parameters these distributions are selected among different distributions based on the chi square c s and kolmogorov simonov k s tests according to table 2 ds and dm in all investigated stations have general extreme values distribution the dd in mehrabad and semnan stations has general pareto distribution and it has gamma distribution in the nowshahr station the best distribution for dl in mehrabad is general pareto distribution and the best distribution in semnan and nowshahr is general extreme values figs 9 11 show the cdf of empirical and marginal ds dm dd and dl for mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively as seen all marginal distributions are fitted by good precision expected of dl in semnan distribution these good precisions in marginal distribution can lead to better simulation of drought characteristics also the dl time series of semnan station has a high variance compared to other characteristics time series so dl s marginal and empirical cdf in this station could not properly fit and yield an acceptable result thus it is expected that the simulation of dl for the semnan station performs worse in the following sections 5 3 construction of vine copula based models here different structures of cvm and dvm have been considered by permuting the variables to construct adequate models so kendall s tau coefficient is employed for dependency measurement between pairwise variables and selecting the order of variables in the star shaped structure of cvm and hamiltonian path of dvm czado et al 2012 vernieuwe et al 2015 table 3 lists the values of kendall s tau between drought variables which are statistically significant at 0 5 level in each model the structure with the maximum sum of absolute values of kendall s tau in tree one would be selected as the best one according to the results the hamiltonian path of dvm for all stations is dm ds dd dl with the sum of 2 201 2 059 and 2 151 for mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively also the ds is chosen as the best root node in the star shaped structure of cvm for all stations and the sum of absolute values of pairwise variables kendall s tau are 2 136 1 954 and 2 107 for mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively in the next step different bivariate copula families are compared to fit each pair of variables in each vine structure the considered copula families are gaussian student t clayton gumbel frank joe bb1 bb6 bb7 bb8 and mixed the mixed copula is a weighted combination of some copula families and can express asymmetric correlation independently in this research the combination of the first copula to the tenth copula families shown by 1 to 10 is considered the mixed copula experience has shown that only families 1 and 5 were valid for dvm but all investigated families were valid for cvm thus mixed copula for dvm does not include the second family after estimating the parameters in all structures the constructed cvm and dvm are evaluated by aic bic and loglik criteria and the superior model will be selected fig 12 demonstrates the comparison of copula families fitted to cvm and dvm in all investigated stations each cvm or dvm with less aic bic and more loglik can be considered a more accurate model as seen in the mehrabad station the mixed dvm and mixed cvm have less aic and bic the mixed cvm and cvm9 also have more loglik the aic and bic for mixed cvm are less than mixed dvm and loglik for mixed cvm are more than cvm9 hence in the mehrabad station by considering all investigated criteria the mixed cvm has the first rank and mixed dvm is placed in the second rank in semnan and nowshahr stations mixed cvm and mixed dvm can be selected as the best cvm and dvm respectively it is worth mentioning that cvm2 has performed very weakly in all stations especially in semnan station which indicates that cvm with t copula family is not appropriate for drought simulation 5 4 simulating drought characteristics by the best cvm and dvm in this section the ds dm dd and dl are simulated by mixed cvm best cvm and mixed dvm best dvm firstly the mixed cvm and mixed dvm are compared based on the mae rmse and r criteria to show the accuracy of these copula models then the violin plots are used for comparing the distribution of simulated results and observed data table 4 shows the mae rmse and r for simulating ds dm dd and dl by mixed cvm and mixed dvm in different investigated stations it can be seen that in all stations and for different drought characteristics mixed cvm outperforms mixed dvm except for dm the mixed dvm simulated the dm with slightly more accuracy than mixed cvm therefore mixed cvm is better for simulating the severity duration and interarrival time of droughts while for simulating extreme conditions mixed dvm is slightly more accurate than mixed cvm nevertheless this slight difference can be disregarded and mixed cvm is selected as the best copula model in all investigated stations fig 13 shows the violin plots of drought characteristics modeling by mixed cvm and mixed dvm in mehrabad station as the control station the violin plots show the distribution of simulated drought characteristics versus observed drought characteristics as seen in fig 13 the distribution of simulated drought characteristics is slightly different from observed drought characteristics for mixed cvm and mixed dvm the violin plots for other stations also show good performance of mixed cvm and mixed dvm in simulating ds dm dd and dl finally by considering table 4 and fig 13 the mixed cvm is selected as the best structure for predicting drought characteristics under climate change conditions 5 5 rainfall simulation by the proposed hybrid models in the following the performance of hybrid data mining models is investigated in the downscaling bias correction step first lssvm as one of the most advanced artificial intelligent models is hybridized with the traditional gs method to simulate rainfall data second the performance of the novel hybrid model called lssvm sca is investigated and compared with lssvm gs to show the superiority of the proposed model the considered input combinations for rainfall simulation are listed in table 5 in this table the input combination with id equal to one only considered rainfall with one month lag while input combination with id equal to 12 considered rainfall with one month to 12 months lag in this table plag n shows the rainfall with nth lag the monthly observed data for the 1977 2005 period were selected for rainfall simulation by the hybrid data mining models the data were also randomized and split into training 70 of data includes 243 samples and testing 30 of data includes 105 samples data sets these data were imposed on algorithms by random calibration the performance of lssvm gs is investigated by considering the mae rmse and r criteria for canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 as listed in tables 6 a 1 a 2 and a 3 respectively according to the downscaled results based on canesm2 data in the testing phase the best performance of lssvm gs in mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations is related to inputs id equal to 12 10 and 12 respectively these results are reported for bnu esm as inputs id equal to 11 9 and 12 for ccsm4 as inputs id equal to 6 9 and 9 and for gfdl cm3 as inputs id equal to 8 10 and 10 also these tables present the best parameters of lssvm that gs obtains based on all investigated gcms in all stations the values of evaluation criterion r are also less than 0 88 except in gfdl cm3 at mehrabad station which can be concluded that this downscaling bias correction model is not suitable for adequate rainfall modeling therefore in this research a novel optimization algorithm called the sine cosine algorithm sca is employed to build a new hybrid data mining algorithm called lssvm sca the performance analyses of lssvm sca are tabulated in tables 7 a 4 a 5 and a 6 for canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 respectively for all gcms the input ids as the decision variables selected by the sca algorithm are 1 1 and 4 for mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations respectively according to the results of these tables the lssvm sca is trained with reasonable accuracy in all stations by comparing the results of the performance evaluation criteria of lssvm sca with the results of lssvm gs for all gcms the superiority of lssvm sca is inferred in terms of criterions improvement in the testing phase the mae and rmse values of lssvm sca for all gcms are improved than the results of lssvm gs at all stations table 8 although the values of the r criterion for lssvm gs at mehrabad and nowshahr stations are 2 35 and 1 11 better than lssvm sca based on canesm2 and gfdl cm3 data respectively it could have to do with the procedure of search space evaluation in the gs algorithm which leads to dimensionality and storing many independent variables in its memory in the least square regression using typical data the r criterion is slightly increasing with increases in the number of model regressors so this criterion alone cannot be used as a meaningful comparison of the models and other criteria must also be considered therefore by considering all evaluation criteria for all selected gcms and at all stations it could be concluded that lssvm sca outperforms lssvm gs and its performance is confirmed for rainfall simulation fig 14 a 1 a 2 and a 3 illustrate the randomized monthly observed and simulated rainfall data by lssvm sca during 1977 2005 for canesm2 bnu esm ccsm4 and gfdl cm3 respectively as seen the simulated rainfall data for all gcms and at all three stations have good agreement with the observed data so lssvm sca is selected as the superior hybrid model for downscaling bias correction step and will be used for drought characteristics analysis in the next section 5 6 meteorological drought characteristics analysis by vc dm under climate change in this section meteorological drought characteristics will be investigated under future climate change conditions to this ends future rainfall data are projected under three rcp scenarios i e rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 using two hybrid data mining approaches since the uncertainty is an inseparable companion of almost all climate change impact studies here the uncertainties arising from the selection of gcms downscaling methods and rcps are initially evaluated and compared using the fuzzy method zadeh 1965 in this theory a fuzzy number or membership function will be assigned to each subset when it comes to uncertainty these numbers can be used as uncertain quantities which allow handling imprecise knowledge in the present study the triangular fuzzy membership function was used to compare the uncertainties of the models simulation results this function has three elements minimum maximum and median of data since the minimum and maximum values show the dispersion of data their membership function will be zero representing maximum uncertainty anaraki et al 2021 najafi and hessami kermani 2017 the membership function of median values will be 1 0 which is less affected by the uncertainty issues according to this theory the wider the triangle the greater the uncertainty and vice versa here lssvm sca and lssvm gs models were investigated for uncertainty analysis of rainfall predictions for the historical 1977 2005 and future 2021 2100 periods based on the application of four gcms and three rcps scenarios fig 15 shows the uncertainty analysis results of simulated rainfall in the historical period based on four gcms data using fuzzy elements according to the membership functions corresponding to rainfall simulation by lssvm sca and lssvm gc canesm2 has the lowest uncertainty in both downscaling models while ccsm4 has the highest uncertainty also comparing two downscaling models results lssvm sca has the lowest uncertainty for most gcms data except for ccsm4 which lssvm gc has slightly less uncertainty fig 16 results of projected rainfall for the future period indicate less uncertainty of canesm2 for most rcps however for rcp8 5 and lssvm sca downscaling method gfdl cms has slightly less uncertainty than other gcms fig 17 shows the uncertainty analysis results for rainfall predictions under three selected rcps based on lssvm sca and lssvm gc methods the highest uncertainty of bnu esm is also observed in the three selected rcps and two downscaling methods therefore according to the mentioned uncertainty analysis results canesm2 is selected as the best model with less uncertainty for drought characteristics analysis under climate change moreover fig 18 demonstrates the membership functions corresponding to rainfall simulation by lssvm sca under different scenarios based on canesm2 data it is observed that rainfall simulation under rcp8 5 has the highest uncertainty among all investigated rcps while the uncertainty of rcp2 6 and rcp4 5 rank second and third respectively fig 19 shows the observed and predicted rainfall data under climate change conditions using lssvm sca based on canesm2 as is seen the observed period is from 1977 to 2005 and the prediction period is from 2021 to 2100 according to the results of rainfall prediction in mehrabad station the projected data will decrease under all three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 while in the semnan and nowshahr stations it will be increasing under all scenarios also the rate of increase in the semnan station will be more than in the nowshahr station the changes in statistical parameters of rainfall i e mean minimum and maximum under all investigated scenarios are tabulated in table 9 according to this table all parameters of the projected rainfall for the mehrabad station will decrease under all scenarios in this station the change of mean parameter is between 50 to 61 the change of minimum parameter is between 35 to 54 and the change of maximum parameter is between 62 to 67 this severe reduction could have to do with high fossil fuel consumption and land use changes which contributed to serious air pollution in this city and lead to more emissions of greenhouse gases so it is expected that this reduction will be observed in all scenarios and will be much greater than what has previously been thought sarhadi et al 2016 have also pointed out this severe reduction in the near and long term predictions in the semnan station the mean and minimum parameters will increase while the maximum parameter will decrease according to the results of this station the change of mean parameter is between 16 and 24 the change of minimum parameter is between 7 and 41 and the change of maximum parameter is between 6 to 14 finally in the nowshahr station the mean minimum and maximum parameters will increase as is seen the change of mean parameter is in the range of 13 to 16 the change of minimum parameter is in the range of 17 to 26 and the change of maximum parameter is in the range of 21 to 33 finally future meteorological drought characteristics are projected and analyzed under climate change conditions in mehrabad semnan and nowshahr stations based on downscaled data of canesm2 gcm for this purpose the mixed cvm as the best copula model is used by considering three scenarios rcp2 6 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 at this stage the inputs of the multivariate cvm model are drought characteristics extracted from the projected spi series fig 20 demonstrates all investigated drought characteristics and their return periods in different stations and for different scenarios as is seen in the mehrabad station absolute values of ds for all scenarios will decrease except for rcp2 6 increase up to 50 units for a 20000 year return period also the dm will increase while the dd and dl will decrease under all considered scenarios thus dd will decrease for all scenarios while dl will decrease for all scenarios except for rcp8 5 in the nowshahr station absolute values of ds will increase under all scenarios increase up to 25 units for rcp2 6 and 20000 year return period except for rcp8 5 the dm has not changed significantly while dd will decrease under all scenarios the dl will also increase in all scenarios except for rcp4 5 according to the projected data in 2021 2100 it is obvious that the absolute values of ds under rcp2 6 will decrease in all stations and for this scenario there are more severe droughts than observation period without significant change in dm the other point of the results showed in fig 20 is that dd is expected to decrease in all stations and under all scenarios the dl will also decrease in all stations and scenarios except for semnan and nowshahr stations under rcp8 5 therefore it can be concluded that in 2021 2100 more severe droughts will occur under rcp2 6 while there will be better conditions under rcp8 5 moreover the mehrabad station will have more severe droughts than other investigated stations and this issue is consistent with the results of table 9 and fig 19 another result that can be deducted from fig 20 is that by increasing return periods the ds dm and dd will increase and dl will decrease which can be interpreted according to the nature of drought actually in low return periods severe droughts rarely occur 6 conclusion due to the importance of rainfall prediction in drought analysis and the essential need to plan and manage droughts under future climate conditions this research was conducted to provide comprehensive insight towards future drought conditions of the northern strip of iran for this purpose a new methodology called vc dm was presented for meteorological drought analysis under climate change conditions based on the combination of four dimensional vine copula model c vine and d vine and hybrid machine learning algorithm least square support vector machine hybridized with sine cosine algorithm and evaluated in different climates of the north of iran which are frequently affected by this extreme phenomenon the drought was indexed by monthly spi and four major characteristics of drought event extracted including drought severity ds maximum spi value dm drought duration dd and the time interval between two events dl here two flexible vine copula structures were fitted to observed data for characterizing multivariate dependencies among these variables the best ordering of variables in vine structures was chosen by kendall s tau coefficients and then ten families of existing bivariate copulas were examined for fitting to pairwise variables the mixed cvm ranked first according to aic bic and log likelihood criteria the superior performance of the selected model was also emphasized for simulation of characteristics by mae rmse and r criteria in all stations so mixed cvm was selected for drought analysis under future climate change conditions it is worth mentioning that like many previous studies conducted on drought modeling this research was also facing data scarcity however from a statistical point of view the small size of data could be acceptable especially in multivariate problems daneshkhah et al 2016 genest et al 2007 in the following large scale rainfall data from four cmip5 gcms were spatially downscaled using a sophisticated machine learning based bias correction model lssvm sca the performance of lssvm sca was also compared to hybrid of lssvm and grid search method lssvm gs the analysis indicated that lssvm sca outperforms lssvm gs in rainfall simulation evidently uncertainty is an inevitable part of all gcms predictions which can be related to their natural variability and coarse resolutions ahmadalipour et al 2017 and depends on the region they are applied to here the uncertainty arising from the selection of gcms downscaling bias correction methods and rcps were investigated using triangular fuzzy membership functions results revealed that canesm2 gcm has the lowest uncertainty in both downscaling models and lssvm sca has lower uncertainty than lssvm gs in the historical period it is also observed that for the future period canesm2 has less uncertainty for most rcps also rcp8 5 has the highest uncertainty among all investigated rcps highlighting the fact that rainfall projection results with this scenario should be interpreted with more caution so canesm2 as the superior gcm and lssvm sca as the more accurate downscaling method were selected for drought characteristics analysis under future climate change the mean of projected rainfall data will increase in all stations up to 24 for rcp8 5 in semnan station except for mehrabad station up to 52 for rcp2 6 this severe reduction in the mehrabad station can be related to high fossil fuel consumption and land use changes which was emphasized by sarhadi et al 2016 finally the results of drought analysis under future climate change by vc dm showed that in the 2021 2100 period the absolute values of ds under rcp2 6 would decrease in all stations and for this scenario there will be more severe droughts than the observation period without significant changes in dm thus dm will not have significant changes in all stations and under all scenarios the dl will also decrease in all stations and scenarios except for semnan and nowshahr stations under rcp8 5 therefore it can be concluded that in 2021 2100 more severe droughts will occur under rcp2 6 up to 50 units more absolute ds than the observed period while for rcp8 5 there will be better conditions also the mehrabad station will have more severe droughts values of 70 for ds and 20 000 return period than other investigated

3978,identification of diffused nitrate no3 sources in groundwater is challenging in headwater areas with diverse land uses multiple potential inputs and intensification of precipitation although no3 sources in headwater areas with different land uses have been observed the mechanisms of the impact of extreme precipitation on no3 transport to groundwater and no3 sources in these areas are not well understood in this study dual isotopic compositions of no3 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and hydrochemical data were measured in groundwater samples during august 2014 january 2017 under four land uses natural vegetation nv farmland fl economic forestland ef and residential areas ra an isotope mixing model siar was applied to determine the main no3 sources and the governing factors affected by extreme precipitation the rates of exceeding the who standard of no3 45 mg l increased to 93 3 65 6 100 and 46 7 for groundwater samples from ra fl ef and nv respectively when comparing with 88 7 56 6 92 9 and 6 1 of samples collected before extreme precipitation from ra fl ef and nv respectively siar results showed that the contribution of anthropogenetic activities to no3 in groundwater was accelerated after extreme precipitation before extreme precipitation soil n 43 5 and organic matter of soil 32 3 were the dominant no3 source in nv and manure sewage made substantial contributions to no3 concentrations in groundwater accounting for 55 8 56 2 and 52 7 in ra fl and ef respectively in nv the contributions of organic matter of soil increased to 46 8 and the contribution of soil n decreased to 28 9 the contributions of chemical fertilizers in soil increased from 15 2 to 31 3 and there was a corresponding decrease in the contribution from manure sewage 41 1 in fl although the contribution of no3 from manure sewage increased in ef 66 3 and ra 57 6 assessing temporal variation of no3 sources in the headwater areas of the north china plain can help to protect water resource and avoid further deterioration of water quality during land use management and extreme precipitation in the future keywords nitrate source land use extreme precipitation stable isotopes siar mixing model 1 introduction in recent decades human activity that included application of chemical fertilizer sewage irrigation livestock and poultry breeding and domestic sewage leaching have significantly increased watershed nitrogen loading and also elevated concentrations of nitrate no3 in groundwater and surface water nakagawa et al 2017 green et al 2018 ti et al 2019 elevated no3 in the hydrologic cycle leads to deterioration in water quality eutrophication and toxic algal blooms boyle 2017 ford et al 2017 green et al 2018 no3 is also an important drinking water contaminant with associated health risks such as methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome and colorectal cancer pastén zapata et al 2014 schullehner et al 2018 for these reasons no3 pollution in surface water and groundwater have become a global environmental issue therefore to improve water quality it is crucial to identify no3 sources and to understand the processes that affect its concentrations to develop effective strategies to mitigate no3 pollution no3 contamination in groundwater is strongly correlated to land use and climate change xue et al 2009 zhou et al 2017 ti et al 2019 the changes in land use have altered hydrologic connectivity between surface and groundwater through engineered flow paths designed to route water quickly through storm drains tile drains for agricultural land and ditches kaushal et al 2010 in addition accelerated transport from surface to groundwater and reduced retention capacity may amplify the amplitude and frequency of contaminant pulses over relatively short time periods by climate variability e g extreme large precipitation vidon et al 2009 kaushal et al 2010 several studies have shown that changes in land use have dramatically affected no3 concentration in groundwater by altering inputs of water and nitrogen contaminants from the surface changing recharge sources and altering mechanisms in the unsaturated zone xue et al 2009 wilson 2015 zhang et al 2020 at the same time changes in climate such as extreme precipitation will drive changes in watershed hydrology which drive ecosystem processes grimm et al 2013 larger and more frequent pulsed discharge events could increase the downstream transport of nutrients organic matter and contaminants kaushal et al 2014 stephen et al 2018 particularly changes to the magnitude intensity and frequency of rainfall will also have significant impacts on the magnitude of transport of no3 and other contaminants sieger et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 no3 can be quickly flushed from surface into river and groundwater during high rainfall events when overland runoff occurs wang et al 2020 the groundwater recharge mechanism changed from translatory flow to preferential or bypass flow after extreme precipitation and much of accumulated no3 in the vadose zone leached into groundwater kaushal et al 2010 zheng et al 2019 although no3 in groundwater was diluted by the extreme precipitation events during the groundwater recharge process the greater leaching of no3 than the diluting effect elevated no3 concentration in groundwater yue et al 2020 consequently land use patterns and extreme precipitation in combination with hydrological and biogeochemical controls strongly determine concentrations of no3 in groundwater the no3 derived from various n sources in groundwater is mainly from soil organic nitrogen chemical fertilizer manure or sewage wastes and precipitation kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2012 identification of no3 sources is thus critical for the efficient control of no3 contamination and for achieving sustainable protection of water resources because different no3 sources may have distinctive isotopic signatures δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 kendall et al 2007 stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 provide powerful indicators for identifying no3 sources and biochemical transformation processes in different areas kim et al 2015 taufiq et al 2019 however overlapping isotopic values from different sources uncertain and variable isotopic characteristics of localized sources and different initial values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can vary due to complex isotope fractionations differences in groundwater flow systems and multiple sources of nitrogen during no3 transport process wang et al 2017 li et al 2019 therefore isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were combined with land use hydrochemical properties and statistical analysis methods to address these uncertainties and to identify possible no3 sources wang et al 2017 meghdadi and javar 2018 nejatijahromi et al 2019 to estimate the proportional contributions of different no3 sources a bayesian stable isotope mixing model has been constructed for stable isotope analysis in the r siar software package parnell et al 2010 xue et al 2012 siar can define more than three sources when only two isotopes are utilized the siar model output is also able to recognize the distinct isotopic fingerprint of different n sources for a contributing source of no3 kim et al 2015 torres martínez et al 2020 nyilitya et al 2021 the headwater areas of the taihang mountains which are considered the main areas of recharge for the aquifer systems of the north china plain ncp these areas in the transition from the taihang mountains to the plains of the ncp are typically characterized by more diverse land uses there has been an increase in water problems in this region which include a decline in the water table and an increase in no3 pollution hu et al 2010 wang et al 2016 the groundwater quality in the headwater areas is sensitive to climate change particularly to extreme precipitation previous work found that no3 flux increased sharply after extreme precipitation during the rainy season in a wet year comparatively approximately 30 and 7 of the no3 flux was from no3 that accumulated in the vadose zone of natural vegetation and cultivated farmland respectively during the rainy season in a normal year zheng et al 2020 to prevent excessive no3 input into groundwater in the headwater areas of the ncp no3 sources and transportation processes that occur in different land uses during extreme precipitation events need to be constrained and quantified to our knowledge no previous studies have combined the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and siar to trace no3 sources and transportation processes in headwater areas with mixed land uses during extreme precipitation events in order to investigate no3 sources dynamics and its controlling factors in groundwater under different land uses during extreme precipitation events nine water sampling events were conducted over four years during the dry season and wet season including one extreme large precipitation event at the headwater areas of taihang mountains ncp the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and the siar model were combined to trace no3 sources and transportation processes affected by extreme precipitation the objectives of this study were 1 to understand the relationship between no3 dynamics and extreme precipitation in groundwater under different land uses 2 to quantify the contribution rates of different no3 sources and 3 to determine the variation of no3 sources under different precipitation events this study provides useful information for land use water and nitrogen management that can be used to help mitigate groundwater contamination in headwater areas affected by climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area was located in the taihang mountains which is a headwater area of the ncp fig 1 in the study area the bedrock consists of granite granite porphyry limestone sandstone and shale the dominant soils are mountainous cinnamon soils ustalf which are calcareous soils formed mainly from weathered gneissic granitites limestone and shale liu et al 2014 the landscape of the study area can be divided into four predominant land uses which included natural vegetation nv economic forestland ef farmland fl and residential areas ra in recent decades land use in the study area changed from 1987 to 2015 due to intensified human activity which lead to an increase in the proportion of the area that was ef from 0 2 to 3 4 ra increased from 4 6 to 12 4 and fl increased from 25 3 to 30 5 wang et al 2017 the climate is semi arid according to the köppen geiger climate classification by kottek et al 2006 the mean annual precipitation was approximately 513 2 mm year with an average of 75 falling from june through september which was influenced strongly by the east asian summer monsoon xiao et al 2009 the daily precipitation from 2014 to 2017 in the study area was shown in fig 2 the precipitation amount 100 mm day was defined as the extreme precipitation intensities wang et al 2012 therefore the precipitation events on the 19th 247 9 mm 24 h and 20th 256 3 mm 24 h of july 2016 were extreme precipitation events according to this classification 2 2 field survey and sample collection field surveys and water sampling were conducted nine times from august 2014 to january 2017 of which six times were conducted before extreme precipitation august 2014 november 2014 march 2015 may 2015 july 2015 and april 2016 and three times were conducted after extreme precipitation july 2016 october 2016 and january 2017 fig 1 shows the locations of the groundwater sampling sites including nv 6 sites fl 17 sites ef 5 sites ra 19 sites and r two reservoirs t15 and t24 site from the upper reaches to lower reaches in the study area all groundwater sampling sites were along the beisha river and zhulong river fig 1 sites t01 t14 and sites t41 t46 were in the upstream of bayi reservoir which was located along the beisha river sites t21 t40 and sites t16 t20 were along the zhulong river which was upstream and downstream of bayi reservoir respectively prior to sampling we measured the depth to groundwater by a portable reader solinst 102 canada and approximately two well volumes of groundwater were pumped from the well to remove stagnant well water subsequently groundwater samples were collected using two polyethylene plastic bottles 100 ml rinsed with field water and transported to the laboratory refrigerated to 4 until analysis several parameters which included water ph temperature t dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field using a portable meter wm 22ep dkk toa corporation japan major ions were analyzed for all samples collected in nine sampling periods the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed for samples collected in april 2016 and in january 2017 2 3 chemical and isotope analysis all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm filters before being loaded into ion chromatography ics 2100 dionex usa to analyze for major ions na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and no3 the precision of ion analysis was 0 2 mg l bicarbonate was measured by titration using 0 01 n h2so4 quality control for analyses of ions was conducted by calculating charge balances the charge balance errors for the measurements were less than 5 the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed using the denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 casciotti et al 2002 at the key laboratory of environmental radioactivity analysis chinese academy of agricultural sciences stable isotope ratios of no3 are expressed in delta δ units and a per mille notation relative to an international standard δ sample r sample r standard 1 1 000 where rsample and rstandard are the isotope ratios 15n 14n 18o 16o of samples and standards respectively the international standards were atmospheric n isotopes and the analytical error was 0 5 for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 respectively 2 4 bayesian isotope mixing model siar the baysian stable isotope mixing model siar can quantify the contribution of potential no3 sources to no3 in water the dirchlet distribution is considered as a logical prior distribution of potential no3 source contributions in addition the mixing model takes uncertainties into account such as uncertainty of temporal and spatial variability in the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and uncertainty of isotopic fractionation during denitrification the siar mixing model can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2013 davis et al 2015 stock and semmens 2018 2 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 3 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 4 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 5 ε ij n 0 σ j 2 where xij refers to the measured isotope value j of the mixture i i 1 2 3 i and j 1 2 3 j sjk refers to the source value k of isotope j k 1 2 3 k which is normally distributed with mean μjk and standard deviation ωjk pk refers to the proportion of source k cjk refers to the fractionation factor for isotope j of source k and is normally distributed with mean λjk and standard deviation τjk εij refers to the residual error that represents the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation σj in this study the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 j 2 were used the contributions of four potential no3 sources precipitation soil n chemical fertilizer and manure sewage to no3 in groundwater concentrations were quantified by siar sjk and cjk were inputs and outputs were graphically and numerically descriptive posterior probability distribution estimates of the source contributions moore and semmens 2008 3 results 3 1 field parameters and hydrochemical compositions the field parameters of depth to groundwater ph do ec and no3 concentration of groundwater in different land uses are summarized in table 1 mean values were used to describe the field parameters before extreme precipitation july 2016 because these parameters were relatively stable for the field parameters during august 2014 to april 2016 table 1 it was found that depth to groundwater at almost all sites except for t17 where pumping in farmland decreased the groundwater depth decreased after extreme precipitation in july 2016 particularly t04 and t05 in nv decreased from 10 4 to 1 2 m and from 3 2 to 0 8 m after extreme precipitation respectively the variations of depth to groundwater at five goundwater monitoring wells in the study area showed an decreased trend with different amplitude over time affected by the extreme precipitation fig 2 the groundwater depths at w 01 and w 03 upstream decreased immediately at the same day of extreme precipitation events however the groundwater depths at w 02 w 04 and w 05 showed a lagging response to extreme precipitation with a lagging of 7 days 3 days and 70 days respectively due to the thick vadose zone fig 2 field parameters in different land uses before and after extreme precipitation showed distinctive features the ph values collected from august 2014 to april 2016 ranged from 6 74 to 8 51 however the ph values collected after extreme precipitation in july 2016 had a greater range from 5 20 to 8 72 the values of do in most groundwater samples collected in july 2016 were lower than those collected during other sampling periods before extreme precipitation the mean ec for groundwater at nv was lowest 580 μs cm while the mean ec was highest 1240 μs cm at ra where variation was the greastest of all land uses from 760 to 2890 μs cm after the extreme precipitation in july 2016 the mean ec for groundwater at nv and fl increased to 810 and 1110 μs cm respectively however the mean ec for groundwater at ra decreased to 1020 μs cm since the bedrock in this study area is mainly consisted of limestone sandstone granite granite porphyry and shale the dominant cation and anion are ca2 and hco3 previous study showed that five groundwater types ca mg hco3 so4 ca hco3 so4 ca hco3 ca hco3 cl no3 and ca hco3 so4 cl no3 exist during a normal precipitation year before extreme precipitation in the study area fig 3 a wang et al 2017 four groundwater types after extreme precipitation were with the same as those in normal years before extreme precipitation which included ca mg hco3 so4 ca hco3 so4 ca hco3 cl no3 and ca hco3 so4 cl no3 fig 3b the main groundwater type ca hco3 particularly for groundwater at nv site was not found before extreme precipitation the hco3 cl and no3 distributions were related to the land use shown as right triangle in fig 3a after that the cl and no3 concentration for groundwater at all land uses increased fig 3b and table 2 3 2 characteristics of no3 concentration the no3 concentrations in groundwater at eight sampling periods are shown in table 1 and the no3 statistics for all groundwater samples from the four land uses are shown in fig 4 for samples collected from august 2014 to april 2016 the concentration of no3 in groundwater in nv varied from 4 6 to 61 9 mg l and the lower mean value was 17 7 mg l mean no3 was the highest 147 3 mg l in ra which ranged from 22 2 to 690 8 mg l and 88 7 of groundwater samples had no3 concentrations that exceeded the who standard 45 mg l who 1971 the groundwater no3 concentrations in groundwater of ef and fl areas varied from 32 4 to 127 1 mg l and from 17 3 to 121 7 mg l respectively with mean values of 99 6 and 59 0 mg l respectively overall 92 9 and 56 6 of groundwater samples in ef and fl areas had no3 concentrations that exceeded the who standard fig 4 t15 and t24 sites in reservoir had the lowest no3 range and mean values after the extreme precipitation event in july 2016 the no3 concentrations for groundwater and surface water in the study area had large variations for different land uses table 1 fig 4 overall the no3 concentrations in all groundwater samples that exceeded the who standard increased from 53 9 to 75 9 the no3 concentration in nv increased significantly p 0 05 in july 2016 and 85 7 of groundwater samples had no3 concentrations that exceeded the who standard then no3 concentrations decreased in october 2016 and january 2017 and ranged from 9 3 to 45 1 mg l the mean no3 concentrations in groundwater in fl and ef in july 2016 were 136 0 and 225 7 mg l respectively overall 65 6 and 100 of groundwater samples in fl and ef areas had no3 concentrations that exceeded the who standard after extreme precipitation from july 2016 to january 2017 the mean no3 concentration for groundwater in fl decreased to 83 7 mg l and then increased to 115 7 mg l the mean no3 concentration for groundwater in ef decreased from 225 7 to 107 4 mg l in the ra no3 concentrations ranged from 28 9 to 269 7 mg l in july 2016 and 83 3 of the groundwater samples exceeded the who standard in october 2016 no3 concentrations ranged from 105 3 to 311 4 mg l and 100 of the samples in ra exceeded the who standard the number of samples in ra that exceeded the who standard decreased to 93 8 in january 2017 for reservoir samples only t24 site beizhengxiang reservoir had relatively higher concentrations than the t15 site bayi reservoir which ranged from 66 0 to 68 1 mg l 3 3 isotopic characteristics of nitrate in potential sources and waters the ranges of the values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 from the four potential no3 sources are summarized in table 3 all data were within the wide typical ranges of δ15n and δ18o reported by xue et al 2009 who reviewed numerous studies in the literature and summarized typical δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 ranges from potential no3 sources the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for all groundwater collected in two sampling periods april 2016 and january 2017 are shown in fig 5 in april 2016 the δ15n no3 values were relatively low with a median of 4 2 ranged from 1 7 to 4 7 for groundwater in nv the δ15n no3 values were relatively high with a median of 7 3 ranged from 5 5 to 8 8 for groundwater in the ef the median δ15n no3 value for groundwater in fl 6 9 was lower than in ef and the 25th and 75th percentile δ15n values in fl were 4 4 and 7 3 respectively and in ef were 5 0 and 8 7 respectively the range of δ15n no3 values for ra was wider than the other land uses ranged from 4 6 to 9 9 and the 25th and 75th percentile values were highest 5 5 and 8 8 respectively the δ18o no3 values for groundwater in the nv were the highest median 6 7 and those in the ra were the lowest median 8 0 and ranged from 38 2 to 1 7 the median δ18o no3 values for fl and ef were 4 3 and 8 0 and values ranged from 18 6 to 0 5 and from 7 1 to 3 4 respectively after extreme precipitation in january 2017 the ranges of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 for all groundwater in different land uses were smaller than those in april 2016 fig 5 b and 5d the median values of the δ15n no3 for groundwater in nv fl and ef were lower than those in april 2016 but those in ra were higher than those in april 2016 the median δ18o no3 values for groundwater in fl ef and ra were 4 7 1 2 and 1 0 which were higher than those in april 2016 however the median δ18o no3 values for nv were lower than those in april 2016 and ranged from 3 2 to 6 1 4 discussion 4 1 factors that impact sources of nitrate in groundwater cl is relatively stable in the natural environment and generally is not affected by biogeochemical processes and the relationship between cl and no3 concentration can be used to further determine the sources of no3 krapac et al 2002 liu et al 2006 the sources of cl might be domestic sewage dissolved minerals industrial wastewater or seawater pellerin et al 2008 furthermore chemical fertilizer contains a high no3 concentration and high no3 cl chen et al 2014 yue et al 2017 as there are no halite deposits industrial and seawater intrusion in the study area the high cl concentrations in groundwater were induced by the impact of anthropogenic sources such as sewage manure fig 6 shows the relationship between cl and no3 concentrations and the variation of the no3 cl molar ratios in groundwater of four land uses during the sampling period the different cl and no3 concentrations and no3 cl ratios in the four land uses nv fl ra and ef suggest that no3 concentrations are related to the input of different land uses the low cl 0 3 mmol and no3 concentration 0 2 mmol in nv except site t04 suggests that anthropogenic activities had little impact on groundwater quality in nv the high cl concentration 3 mmol but low no3 cl ratio 0 7 in ra site t13 t14 and t21 and fl site t20 implied that the no3 in groundwater was affected by manure or sewage for the low cl concentration 0 4 mmol and high no3 cl ratio 1 in fl site t28 and ef site t07 1 the results suggested that no3 was mainly derived from agricultural activities at other sampling sites the cl concentration ranged from 0 6 to 1 4 mmol l and the no3 cl molar ratio ranged from 0 2 to 1 9 which suggested that no3 was from mixed multiple sources including manure or sewage chemical fertilizer precipitation or soil organic matter after an extreme precipitation event some sampling sites in fl and ef exhibited high cl concentration and high no3 cl ratios which suggested there was increased contribution of chemical fertilizer to no3 sources at those sites fig 6 b 6 c and 6 d extreme precipitation increased the leaching of more accumulated chemical fertilizer such as npk compound fertilizer from the soil surface to groundwater zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2019 groundwater at other sites from nv and ra had significantly higher cl and no3 concentrations δ15n no3 values and the no3 cl ratios suggested there were greater contributions of manure sewage to groundwater no3 fig 5 fig 6 land use was the major factor that controlled no3 concentration and nitrogen sources in groundwater in normal years which was in accordance with the previous research wang et al 2017 little groundwater recharge through translatory flow resulted in the accumulation of no3 in the vadose zone in normal years before extreme precipitation however extreme precipitation induced the groundwater recharge by preferential flow or bypass flow that accounted for 42 and the leaching of accumulated no3 accounted for 43 in fl zheng et al 2020 thus an extreme precipitation event increased no3 concentrations in groundwater by increasing leaching of chemical fertilizer at the farmland and economic forest land and sewage at the residence land mixing of land uses and extreme precipitation events were the main factors that influenced the migration of no3 in the headwater areas of the ncp 4 2 nitrate sources and transportation identification using δ15n and δ18o the dual isotopic plot of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 implied that no3 had several major sources which included atmospheric deposition chemical fertilizers soil n and manure sewage fig 7 previous studies combined these isotopes with principal component analysis q mode hierarchical cluster analysis and a δ18o cl mixing model to identify the source of no3 in groundwater before extreme precipitation wang et al 2017 as shown in fig 7a in nv the low δ15n no3 which ranged from 1 7 to 4 7 indicated that soil n was the main source along with some precipitation input manure and septic waste were the dominant sources for most groundwater with high no3 and cl concentrations in fl ef and ra and other groundwater with lower cl was attributed to fertilizer usage in january 2017 after extreme precipitation in the same region the distribution of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in groundwater of the same region fig 7b was more tightly than that in april 2016 fig 7b the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 relationship in fl overlapped in regions which indicated that chemical fertilizer and soil n were the sources but those in ef and ra overlapped in regions which indicated that chemical fertilizer and manure sewage were the sources this suggested that the influence of chemical fertilizer on groundwater no3 in fl was accelerated by the extreme precipitation event previous work has found that groundwater recharge was ignored when the precipitation was 20 mm day during a normal year zheng et al 2019 the no3 in the vadose zone accumulated and therefore there was less no3 leaching into groundwater in normal years asadi et al 2002 however the flux of water and no3 leaching into groundwater increased when accumulated chemical fertilizer in the vadose zone in fl areas was carried with fast flow by extreme or heavy precipitation chen et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 similarly the accumulated manure or septic waste in soil of ef and ra also affected the increased δ15n no3 isotopes and no3 concentrations in groundwater along with different no3 sources biological processes such as nitrification and denitrification in water systems also had an impact on no3 isotopes puig et al 2017 jin et al 2018 denitrification is influenced by factors such as do t and no3 concentrations if significant denitrification were occurred the δ18o δ15n ratios ranged from 1 1 3 to 1 2 1 aravena and robertson 1998 böttcher et al 1990 the groundwater samples in nv fl ra and ef did not fall within this range fig 7a the relationship between δ15n values and no3 concentrations also showed no negative correlation r2 0 32 p 0 05 in april 2016 r2 0 08 p 0 05 in january 2017 fig 8 moreover the do concentration in most groundwater samples ranged from 2 1 to 6 8 mg l in april 2016 and from 4 6 to 11 8 mg l in january 2017 table 1 denitrification is not considered to be a significant process due to the presence of do 1 mg l in most groundwater samples yang and toor 2016 all these factors indicated that no significant denitrification occurred during the sampling period additionally the δ18o values for no3 produced by microbial nitrification ranged from 0 1 to 7 8 and from 0 9 to 5 6 ji et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in theory about 1 3 of the o in the no3 produced by nitrification is derived from atmospheric o2 but the remaining 2 3 is derived from water δ18ono3 1 3δ18oo2 2 3δ18oh2o andersson and hooper 1983 according to our results the δ18oh2o value of the groundwater in april 2016 ranged from 9 2 to 6 6 the δ18oh2o value of the groundwater in january 2017 ranged from 9 3 to 6 2 and the δ18oo2 value in the air was 23 5 amberger and schmidt 1987 the calculated δ18o value of no3 derived from nitrification in groundwater in april 2016 ranged from 1 7 to 3 4 and in january 2017 it ranged from 1 6 to 3 7 however most of the groundwater samples in the study area had δ18o no3 values exceeding this range fig 5 fig 7 which suggested that significant nitrification process did not occurring in groundwater therefore nitrification and denitrification processes were weak and had minimal impacts on mixing and the migration of no3 in groundwater in the study area 4 3 variations of contribution ratios of nitrate sources affected by extreme precipitation in order to estimate the proportional contributions of different potential no3 sources to groundwater no3 pollution the siar model was employed based on the land uses hydrochemical characteristics and stable isotopes of no3 in groundwater δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 vary due to isotope fractionations the fractionation factor cjk can influence on the siar mixing model results in this study the fractionation factor cjk was set as zero due to the denitrification had little effect on the no3 isotopic compositions see section 4 2 the parameters and their values used in the siar model were listed in table 3 the isotope information from four no3 sources which included means maximum minimum and standard deviations of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in table 3 were derived from measurements of chemical fertilizer manure sewage soil n and precipitation in the study area the siar output showed a high variability in the proportional contribution of no3 sources for different land uses in april 2016 and january 2017 fig 9 the proportional apportionment of four potential no3 sources in fl ef and ra in april 2016 showed that the contribution of manure sewage was the highest with mean contributions of 56 2 52 7 and 55 8 respectively which ranged from 34 5 to 73 9 from 40 9 to 65 4 and from 50 2 to 61 4 respectively this was followed by soil n mean contributions of 23 6 21 7 and 26 5 in fl ef and ra respectively no3 fertilizers mean contributions of 15 2 15 8 and 12 3 in fl ef and ra respectively and no3 in precipitation mean contributions of 5 0 9 8 and 5 4 in fl ef and ra respectively in nv the contribution of soil n was the highest with a mean of 43 5 which ranged from 37 3 to 50 9 this was followed by manure sewage with a mean of 32 3 no3 fertilizers with a mean of 15 8 and no3 in precipitation with a mean of 8 3 however there was no chemical fertilizer or manure sewage applied in nv since forest was the major land use in the natural vegetation area organic matter from leavers or litters contained abundant organic matter the source of manure sewage for no3 in nv was from organic matter in soil in january 2017 after extreme precipitation the contribution rate of manure sewage in fl decreased to 41 1 but the mean contribution from no3 in fertilizers increased significantly from 15 2 to 31 3 fig 9 compared with that in april 2016 the extreme precipitation in july 2016 recharged to groundwater which led to a higher contribution of manure sewage to no3 in ef and ra which increased by 13 6 and 1 8 in january 2017 respectively the variation of n sources in fl and ef was in accordance with the historical application of fertilizers manure was widely applied in agriculture before the 1990 s after that manure was replaced by chemical fertilizer in farmland but application of manure was also popular in economic forests the surface chemical n in fl and n from manure in ef were easily carried to groundwater by fast flow or preferential flow induced by extreme precipitation in nv the contribution of manure sewage and no3 fertilizers showed a significantly increase compared with those in april 2016 with means of 46 8 and 21 5 respectively there was a lower contribution of no3 from soil n and precipitation with means of 28 9 and 2 8 respectively this result is the impact of different anthropogenic source of no3 on groundwater which resulted in different proportional contributions from four no3 sources in nv fl ra and ef wang et al 2017 this result was also impacted by the transport path for no3 by water as affected by the extreme precipitation event congreves et al 2016 the existence of preferential or fast flow during the extreme precipitation was found in the headwater area and other areas demand et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 additionally increased no3 leaching carried by the preferential or fast flow in the vadose zone in farmland was affected by the extreme precipitation event and accounted for the transport of chemical nitrogen from the surface soil zheng et al 2020 the increased no3 leaching to groundwater under extreme precipitation in farmland was consistent with results reported after similar extreme precipitation experiments in the u s midwest hess et al 2020 compared with that in a normal year the large amount of extreme precipitation in a wet year caused the flow of more accumulated chemical nitrogen and manure sewage into rivers or groundwater faster briand et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the source contributions calculated by siar generally agreed with analyses according to hydrochemical characteristics and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopes fig 6 fig 7 however some issues require caution which include the changes in contributions of no3 from sources due to temporal variability of isotopes calculated by siar the mean values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the potential no3 sources with large standard deviations in some land uses were affected by the siar output table 3 in this study although the mean and variance of no3 sources were mainly consistent with those measured by similar sources in different land uses we have not considered the spatial variability of the same no3 sources in groundwater to obtain more accurate isotope information on δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 for different no3 sources in the study area further studies should be conducted the uncertainty of the results was belonged to the variance ωjk and the spatial variability of no3 sources using more accurate isotope data for no3 source values which included a smaller variance ωjk and the spatial variability of no3 sources the uncertainty of the results can be reduced 5 conclusions in this study dual no3 isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were combined with water chemistry characteristics and a siar mixing model to identify the sources and transportation processes of no3 in groundwater the results indicate that the extreme precipitation increased no3 concentration in groundwater and changed the isotopic composition of no3 in groundwater under different land uses the main sources of no3 in nv were soil nitrogen although the manure and septic waste were the main sources in fl ef and ra before extreme precipitation there was no evidence of denitrification and nitrification processes in groundwater in the headwater areas of the ncp therefore the siar mixing model can be used to estimate the proportional contribution of different sources to no3 in groundwater the results showed that before extreme precipitation the major sources of no3 were soil n 37 3 50 9 and organic matter in soil 24 7 42 1 in nv and manure sewage was the main source of no3 in fl 34 5 73 9 ef 40 9 65 4 and ra 50 2 61 4 affected by the extreme precipitation accumulated organic matter of leaves leaching into groundwater the proportional contribution of no3 source in organic matter in soil in nv increased 39 9 53 9 and the corresponding contribution of soil n was decreased 24 8 33 5 since the sewage discharge in ra and the application of manure in ef the contributions of manure sewage to no3 in ra and ef increased which accounted for 49 7 76 2 and 61 5 73 4 respectively the extreme precipitation event accelerated the transport of no3 from chemical fertilizer stored in the soil surface to the groundwater in fl 9 7 40 9 and correspondingly the no3 from manure sewage decreased 27 9 73 4 our results verify the strong impact of land use types and extreme precipitation events on groundwater based on the results of this study decision makers may propose more

3978,identification of diffused nitrate no3 sources in groundwater is challenging in headwater areas with diverse land uses multiple potential inputs and intensification of precipitation although no3 sources in headwater areas with different land uses have been observed the mechanisms of the impact of extreme precipitation on no3 transport to groundwater and no3 sources in these areas are not well understood in this study dual isotopic compositions of no3 δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and hydrochemical data were measured in groundwater samples during august 2014 january 2017 under four land uses natural vegetation nv farmland fl economic forestland ef and residential areas ra an isotope mixing model siar was applied to determine the main no3 sources and the governing factors affected by extreme precipitation the rates of exceeding the who standard of no3 45 mg l increased to 93 3 65 6 100 and 46 7 for groundwater samples from ra fl ef and nv respectively when comparing with 88 7 56 6 92 9 and 6 1 of samples collected before extreme precipitation from ra fl ef and nv respectively siar results showed that the contribution of anthropogenetic activities to no3 in groundwater was accelerated after extreme precipitation before extreme precipitation soil n 43 5 and organic matter of soil 32 3 were the dominant no3 source in nv and manure sewage made substantial contributions to no3 concentrations in groundwater accounting for 55 8 56 2 and 52 7 in ra fl and ef respectively in nv the contributions of organic matter of soil increased to 46 8 and the contribution of soil n decreased to 28 9 the contributions of chemical fertilizers in soil increased from 15 2 to 31 3 and there was a corresponding decrease in the contribution from manure sewage 41 1 in fl although the contribution of no3 from manure sewage increased in ef 66 3 and ra 57 6 assessing temporal variation of no3 sources in the headwater areas of the north china plain can help to protect water resource and avoid further deterioration of water quality during land use management and extreme precipitation in the future keywords nitrate source land use extreme precipitation stable isotopes siar mixing model 1 introduction in recent decades human activity that included application of chemical fertilizer sewage irrigation livestock and poultry breeding and domestic sewage leaching have significantly increased watershed nitrogen loading and also elevated concentrations of nitrate no3 in groundwater and surface water nakagawa et al 2017 green et al 2018 ti et al 2019 elevated no3 in the hydrologic cycle leads to deterioration in water quality eutrophication and toxic algal blooms boyle 2017 ford et al 2017 green et al 2018 no3 is also an important drinking water contaminant with associated health risks such as methemoglobinemia blue baby syndrome and colorectal cancer pastén zapata et al 2014 schullehner et al 2018 for these reasons no3 pollution in surface water and groundwater have become a global environmental issue therefore to improve water quality it is crucial to identify no3 sources and to understand the processes that affect its concentrations to develop effective strategies to mitigate no3 pollution no3 contamination in groundwater is strongly correlated to land use and climate change xue et al 2009 zhou et al 2017 ti et al 2019 the changes in land use have altered hydrologic connectivity between surface and groundwater through engineered flow paths designed to route water quickly through storm drains tile drains for agricultural land and ditches kaushal et al 2010 in addition accelerated transport from surface to groundwater and reduced retention capacity may amplify the amplitude and frequency of contaminant pulses over relatively short time periods by climate variability e g extreme large precipitation vidon et al 2009 kaushal et al 2010 several studies have shown that changes in land use have dramatically affected no3 concentration in groundwater by altering inputs of water and nitrogen contaminants from the surface changing recharge sources and altering mechanisms in the unsaturated zone xue et al 2009 wilson 2015 zhang et al 2020 at the same time changes in climate such as extreme precipitation will drive changes in watershed hydrology which drive ecosystem processes grimm et al 2013 larger and more frequent pulsed discharge events could increase the downstream transport of nutrients organic matter and contaminants kaushal et al 2014 stephen et al 2018 particularly changes to the magnitude intensity and frequency of rainfall will also have significant impacts on the magnitude of transport of no3 and other contaminants sieger et al 2017 zheng et al 2020 no3 can be quickly flushed from surface into river and groundwater during high rainfall events when overland runoff occurs wang et al 2020 the groundwater recharge mechanism changed from translatory flow to preferential or bypass flow after extreme precipitation and much of accumulated no3 in the vadose zone leached into groundwater kaushal et al 2010 zheng et al 2019 although no3 in groundwater was diluted by the extreme precipitation events during the groundwater recharge process the greater leaching of no3 than the diluting effect elevated no3 concentration in groundwater yue et al 2020 consequently land use patterns and extreme precipitation in combination with hydrological and biogeochemical controls strongly determine concentrations of no3 in groundwater the no3 derived from various n sources in groundwater is mainly from soil organic nitrogen chemical fertilizer manure or sewage wastes and precipitation kendall et al 2007 xue et al 2012 identification of no3 sources is thus critical for the efficient control of no3 contamination and for achieving sustainable protection of water resources because different no3 sources may have distinctive isotopic signatures δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 kendall et al 2007 stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 provide powerful indicators for identifying no3 sources and biochemical transformation processes in different areas kim et al 2015 taufiq et al 2019 however overlapping isotopic values from different sources uncertain and variable isotopic characteristics of localized sources and different initial values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 can vary due to complex isotope fractionations differences in groundwater flow systems and multiple sources of nitrogen during no3 transport process wang et al 2017 li et al 2019 therefore isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were combined with land use hydrochemical properties and statistical analysis methods to address these uncertainties and to identify possible no3 sources wang et al 2017 meghdadi and javar 2018 nejatijahromi et al 2019 to estimate the proportional contributions of different no3 sources a bayesian stable isotope mixing model has been constructed for stable isotope analysis in the r siar software package parnell et al 2010 xue et al 2012 siar can define more than three sources when only two isotopes are utilized the siar model output is also able to recognize the distinct isotopic fingerprint of different n sources for a contributing source of no3 kim et al 2015 torres martínez et al 2020 nyilitya et al 2021 the headwater areas of the taihang mountains which are considered the main areas of recharge for the aquifer systems of the north china plain ncp these areas in the transition from the taihang mountains to the plains of the ncp are typically characterized by more diverse land uses there has been an increase in water problems in this region which include a decline in the water table and an increase in no3 pollution hu et al 2010 wang et al 2016 the groundwater quality in the headwater areas is sensitive to climate change particularly to extreme precipitation previous work found that no3 flux increased sharply after extreme precipitation during the rainy season in a wet year comparatively approximately 30 and 7 of the no3 flux was from no3 that accumulated in the vadose zone of natural vegetation and cultivated farmland respectively during the rainy season in a normal year zheng et al 2020 to prevent excessive no3 input into groundwater in the headwater areas of the ncp no3 sources and transportation processes that occur in different land uses during extreme precipitation events need to be constrained and quantified to our knowledge no previous studies have combined the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and siar to trace no3 sources and transportation processes in headwater areas with mixed land uses during extreme precipitation events in order to investigate no3 sources dynamics and its controlling factors in groundwater under different land uses during extreme precipitation events nine water sampling events were conducted over four years during the dry season and wet season including one extreme large precipitation event at the headwater areas of taihang mountains ncp the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and the siar model were combined to trace no3 sources and transportation processes affected by extreme precipitation the objectives of this study were 1 to understand the relationship between no3 dynamics and extreme precipitation in groundwater under different land uses 2 to quantify the contribution rates of different no3 sources and 3 to determine the variation of no3 sources under different precipitation events this study provides useful information for land use water and nitrogen management that can be used to help mitigate groundwater contamination in headwater areas affected by climate change 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area description the study area was located in the taihang mountains which is a headwater area of the ncp fig 1 in the study area the bedrock consists of granite granite porphyry limestone sandstone and shale the dominant soils are mountainous cinnamon soils ustalf which are calcareous soils formed mainly from weathered gneissic granitites limestone and shale liu et al 2014 the landscape of the study area can be divided into four predominant land uses which included natural vegetation nv economic forestland ef farmland fl and residential areas ra in recent decades land use in the study area changed from 1987 to 2015 due to intensified human activity which lead to an increase in the proportion of the area that was ef from 0 2 to 3 4 ra increased from 4 6 to 12 4 and fl increased from 25 3 to 30 5 wang et al 2017 the climate is semi arid according to the köppen geiger climate classification by kottek et al 2006 the mean annual precipitation was approximately 513 2 mm year with an average of 75 falling from june through september which was influenced strongly by the east asian summer monsoon xiao et al 2009 the daily precipitation from 2014 to 2017 in the study area was shown in fig 2 the precipitation amount 100 mm day was defined as the extreme precipitation intensities wang et al 2012 therefore the precipitation events on the 19th 247 9 mm 24 h and 20th 256 3 mm 24 h of july 2016 were extreme precipitation events according to this classification 2 2 field survey and sample collection field surveys and water sampling were conducted nine times from august 2014 to january 2017 of which six times were conducted before extreme precipitation august 2014 november 2014 march 2015 may 2015 july 2015 and april 2016 and three times were conducted after extreme precipitation july 2016 october 2016 and january 2017 fig 1 shows the locations of the groundwater sampling sites including nv 6 sites fl 17 sites ef 5 sites ra 19 sites and r two reservoirs t15 and t24 site from the upper reaches to lower reaches in the study area all groundwater sampling sites were along the beisha river and zhulong river fig 1 sites t01 t14 and sites t41 t46 were in the upstream of bayi reservoir which was located along the beisha river sites t21 t40 and sites t16 t20 were along the zhulong river which was upstream and downstream of bayi reservoir respectively prior to sampling we measured the depth to groundwater by a portable reader solinst 102 canada and approximately two well volumes of groundwater were pumped from the well to remove stagnant well water subsequently groundwater samples were collected using two polyethylene plastic bottles 100 ml rinsed with field water and transported to the laboratory refrigerated to 4 until analysis several parameters which included water ph temperature t dissolved oxygen do and electrical conductivity ec were measured in the field using a portable meter wm 22ep dkk toa corporation japan major ions were analyzed for all samples collected in nine sampling periods the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed for samples collected in april 2016 and in january 2017 2 3 chemical and isotope analysis all water samples were filtered through 0 22 μm filters before being loaded into ion chromatography ics 2100 dionex usa to analyze for major ions na k ca2 mg2 cl so4 2 and no3 the precision of ion analysis was 0 2 mg l bicarbonate was measured by titration using 0 01 n h2so4 quality control for analyses of ions was conducted by calculating charge balances the charge balance errors for the measurements were less than 5 the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were analyzed using the denitrifier method sigman et al 2001 casciotti et al 2002 at the key laboratory of environmental radioactivity analysis chinese academy of agricultural sciences stable isotope ratios of no3 are expressed in delta δ units and a per mille notation relative to an international standard δ sample r sample r standard 1 1 000 where rsample and rstandard are the isotope ratios 15n 14n 18o 16o of samples and standards respectively the international standards were atmospheric n isotopes and the analytical error was 0 5 for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 respectively 2 4 bayesian isotope mixing model siar the baysian stable isotope mixing model siar can quantify the contribution of potential no3 sources to no3 in water the dirchlet distribution is considered as a logical prior distribution of potential no3 source contributions in addition the mixing model takes uncertainties into account such as uncertainty of temporal and spatial variability in the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 and uncertainty of isotopic fractionation during denitrification the siar mixing model can be expressed as follows parnell et al 2013 davis et al 2015 stock and semmens 2018 2 x ij k 1 k p k s jk c jk ε ij 3 s jk n μ jk ω jk 2 4 c jk n λ jk τ jk 2 5 ε ij n 0 σ j 2 where xij refers to the measured isotope value j of the mixture i i 1 2 3 i and j 1 2 3 j sjk refers to the source value k of isotope j k 1 2 3 k which is normally distributed with mean μjk and standard deviation ωjk pk refers to the proportion of source k cjk refers to the fractionation factor for isotope j of source k and is normally distributed with mean λjk and standard deviation τjk εij refers to the residual error that represents the additional unquantified variation between individual mixtures and is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation σj in this study the stable isotopes of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 j 2 were used the contributions of four potential no3 sources precipitation soil n chemical fertilizer and manure sewage to no3 in groundwater concentrations were quantified by siar sjk and cjk were inputs and outputs were graphically and numerically descriptive posterior probability distribution estimates of the source contributions moore and semmens 2008 3 results 3 1 field parameters and hydrochemical compositions the field parameters of depth to groundwater ph do ec and no3 concentration of groundwater in different land uses are summarized in table 1 mean values were used to describe the field parameters before extreme precipitation july 2016 because these parameters were relatively stable for the field parameters during august 2014 to april 2016 table 1 it was found that depth to groundwater at almost all sites except for t17 where pumping in farmland decreased the groundwater depth decreased after extreme precipitation in july 2016 particularly t04 and t05 in nv decreased from 10 4 to 1 2 m and from 3 2 to 0 8 m after extreme precipitation respectively the variations of depth to groundwater at five goundwater monitoring wells in the study area showed an decreased trend with different amplitude over time affected by the extreme precipitation fig 2 the groundwater depths at w 01 and w 03 upstream decreased immediately at the same day of extreme precipitation events however the groundwater depths at w 02 w 04 and w 05 showed a lagging response to extreme precipitation with a lagging of 7 days 3 days and 70 days respectively due to the thick vadose zone fig 2 field parameters in different land uses before and after extreme precipitation showed distinctive features the ph values collected from august 2014 to april 2016 ranged from 6 74 to 8 51 however the ph values collected after extreme precipitation in july 2016 had a greater range from 5 20 to 8 72 the values of do in most groundwater samples collected in july 2016 were lower than those collected during other sampling periods before extreme precipitation the mean ec for groundwater at nv was lowest 580 μs cm while the mean ec was highest 1240 μs cm at ra where variation was the greastest of all land uses from 760 to 2890 μs cm after the extreme precipitation in july 2016 the mean ec for groundwater at nv and fl increased to 810 and 1110 μs cm respectively however the mean ec for groundwater at ra decreased to 1020 μs cm since the bedrock in this study area is mainly consisted of limestone sandstone granite granite porphyry and shale the dominant cation and anion are ca2 and hco3 previous study showed that five groundwater types ca mg hco3 so4 ca hco3 so4 ca hco3 ca hco3 cl no3 and ca hco3 so4 cl no3 exist during a normal precipitation year before extreme precipitation in the study area fig 3 a wang et al 2017 four groundwater types after extreme precipitation were with the same as those in normal years before extreme precipitation which included ca mg hco3 so4 ca hco3 so4 ca hco3 cl no3 and ca hco3 so4 cl no3 fig 3b the main groundwater type ca hco3 particularly for groundwater at nv site was not found before extreme precipitation the hco3 cl and no3 distributions were related to the land use shown as right triangle in fig 3a after that the cl and no3 concentration for groundwater at all land uses increased fig 3b and table 2 3 2 characteristics of no3 concentration the no3 concentrations in groundwater at eight sampling periods are shown in table 1 and the no3 statistics for all groundwater samples from the four land uses are shown in fig 4 for samples collected from august 2014 to april 2016 the concentration of no3 in groundwater in nv varied from 4 6 to 61 9 mg l and the lower mean value was 17 7 mg l mean no3 was the highest 147 3 mg l in ra which ranged from 22 2 to 690 8 mg l and 88 7 of groundwater samples had no3 concentrations that exceeded the who standard 45 mg l who 1971 the groundwater no3 concentrations in groundwater of ef and fl areas varied from 32 4 to 127 1 mg l and from 17 3 to 121 7 mg l respectively with mean values of 99 6 and 59 0 mg l respectively overall 92 9 and 56 6 of groundwater samples in ef and fl areas had no3 concentrations that exceeded the who standard fig 4 t15 and t24 sites in reservoir had the lowest no3 range and mean values after the extreme precipitation event in july 2016 the no3 concentrations for groundwater and surface water in the study area had large variations for different land uses table 1 fig 4 overall the no3 concentrations in all groundwater samples that exceeded the who standard increased from 53 9 to 75 9 the no3 concentration in nv increased significantly p 0 05 in july 2016 and 85 7 of groundwater samples had no3 concentrations that exceeded the who standard then no3 concentrations decreased in october 2016 and january 2017 and ranged from 9 3 to 45 1 mg l the mean no3 concentrations in groundwater in fl and ef in july 2016 were 136 0 and 225 7 mg l respectively overall 65 6 and 100 of groundwater samples in fl and ef areas had no3 concentrations that exceeded the who standard after extreme precipitation from july 2016 to january 2017 the mean no3 concentration for groundwater in fl decreased to 83 7 mg l and then increased to 115 7 mg l the mean no3 concentration for groundwater in ef decreased from 225 7 to 107 4 mg l in the ra no3 concentrations ranged from 28 9 to 269 7 mg l in july 2016 and 83 3 of the groundwater samples exceeded the who standard in october 2016 no3 concentrations ranged from 105 3 to 311 4 mg l and 100 of the samples in ra exceeded the who standard the number of samples in ra that exceeded the who standard decreased to 93 8 in january 2017 for reservoir samples only t24 site beizhengxiang reservoir had relatively higher concentrations than the t15 site bayi reservoir which ranged from 66 0 to 68 1 mg l 3 3 isotopic characteristics of nitrate in potential sources and waters the ranges of the values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 from the four potential no3 sources are summarized in table 3 all data were within the wide typical ranges of δ15n and δ18o reported by xue et al 2009 who reviewed numerous studies in the literature and summarized typical δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 ranges from potential no3 sources the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values for all groundwater collected in two sampling periods april 2016 and january 2017 are shown in fig 5 in april 2016 the δ15n no3 values were relatively low with a median of 4 2 ranged from 1 7 to 4 7 for groundwater in nv the δ15n no3 values were relatively high with a median of 7 3 ranged from 5 5 to 8 8 for groundwater in the ef the median δ15n no3 value for groundwater in fl 6 9 was lower than in ef and the 25th and 75th percentile δ15n values in fl were 4 4 and 7 3 respectively and in ef were 5 0 and 8 7 respectively the range of δ15n no3 values for ra was wider than the other land uses ranged from 4 6 to 9 9 and the 25th and 75th percentile values were highest 5 5 and 8 8 respectively the δ18o no3 values for groundwater in the nv were the highest median 6 7 and those in the ra were the lowest median 8 0 and ranged from 38 2 to 1 7 the median δ18o no3 values for fl and ef were 4 3 and 8 0 and values ranged from 18 6 to 0 5 and from 7 1 to 3 4 respectively after extreme precipitation in january 2017 the ranges of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 for all groundwater in different land uses were smaller than those in april 2016 fig 5 b and 5d the median values of the δ15n no3 for groundwater in nv fl and ef were lower than those in april 2016 but those in ra were higher than those in april 2016 the median δ18o no3 values for groundwater in fl ef and ra were 4 7 1 2 and 1 0 which were higher than those in april 2016 however the median δ18o no3 values for nv were lower than those in april 2016 and ranged from 3 2 to 6 1 4 discussion 4 1 factors that impact sources of nitrate in groundwater cl is relatively stable in the natural environment and generally is not affected by biogeochemical processes and the relationship between cl and no3 concentration can be used to further determine the sources of no3 krapac et al 2002 liu et al 2006 the sources of cl might be domestic sewage dissolved minerals industrial wastewater or seawater pellerin et al 2008 furthermore chemical fertilizer contains a high no3 concentration and high no3 cl chen et al 2014 yue et al 2017 as there are no halite deposits industrial and seawater intrusion in the study area the high cl concentrations in groundwater were induced by the impact of anthropogenic sources such as sewage manure fig 6 shows the relationship between cl and no3 concentrations and the variation of the no3 cl molar ratios in groundwater of four land uses during the sampling period the different cl and no3 concentrations and no3 cl ratios in the four land uses nv fl ra and ef suggest that no3 concentrations are related to the input of different land uses the low cl 0 3 mmol and no3 concentration 0 2 mmol in nv except site t04 suggests that anthropogenic activities had little impact on groundwater quality in nv the high cl concentration 3 mmol but low no3 cl ratio 0 7 in ra site t13 t14 and t21 and fl site t20 implied that the no3 in groundwater was affected by manure or sewage for the low cl concentration 0 4 mmol and high no3 cl ratio 1 in fl site t28 and ef site t07 1 the results suggested that no3 was mainly derived from agricultural activities at other sampling sites the cl concentration ranged from 0 6 to 1 4 mmol l and the no3 cl molar ratio ranged from 0 2 to 1 9 which suggested that no3 was from mixed multiple sources including manure or sewage chemical fertilizer precipitation or soil organic matter after an extreme precipitation event some sampling sites in fl and ef exhibited high cl concentration and high no3 cl ratios which suggested there was increased contribution of chemical fertilizer to no3 sources at those sites fig 6 b 6 c and 6 d extreme precipitation increased the leaching of more accumulated chemical fertilizer such as npk compound fertilizer from the soil surface to groundwater zhou et al 2016 wang et al 2019 groundwater at other sites from nv and ra had significantly higher cl and no3 concentrations δ15n no3 values and the no3 cl ratios suggested there were greater contributions of manure sewage to groundwater no3 fig 5 fig 6 land use was the major factor that controlled no3 concentration and nitrogen sources in groundwater in normal years which was in accordance with the previous research wang et al 2017 little groundwater recharge through translatory flow resulted in the accumulation of no3 in the vadose zone in normal years before extreme precipitation however extreme precipitation induced the groundwater recharge by preferential flow or bypass flow that accounted for 42 and the leaching of accumulated no3 accounted for 43 in fl zheng et al 2020 thus an extreme precipitation event increased no3 concentrations in groundwater by increasing leaching of chemical fertilizer at the farmland and economic forest land and sewage at the residence land mixing of land uses and extreme precipitation events were the main factors that influenced the migration of no3 in the headwater areas of the ncp 4 2 nitrate sources and transportation identification using δ15n and δ18o the dual isotopic plot of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 implied that no3 had several major sources which included atmospheric deposition chemical fertilizers soil n and manure sewage fig 7 previous studies combined these isotopes with principal component analysis q mode hierarchical cluster analysis and a δ18o cl mixing model to identify the source of no3 in groundwater before extreme precipitation wang et al 2017 as shown in fig 7a in nv the low δ15n no3 which ranged from 1 7 to 4 7 indicated that soil n was the main source along with some precipitation input manure and septic waste were the dominant sources for most groundwater with high no3 and cl concentrations in fl ef and ra and other groundwater with lower cl was attributed to fertilizer usage in january 2017 after extreme precipitation in the same region the distribution of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in groundwater of the same region fig 7b was more tightly than that in april 2016 fig 7b the δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 relationship in fl overlapped in regions which indicated that chemical fertilizer and soil n were the sources but those in ef and ra overlapped in regions which indicated that chemical fertilizer and manure sewage were the sources this suggested that the influence of chemical fertilizer on groundwater no3 in fl was accelerated by the extreme precipitation event previous work has found that groundwater recharge was ignored when the precipitation was 20 mm day during a normal year zheng et al 2019 the no3 in the vadose zone accumulated and therefore there was less no3 leaching into groundwater in normal years asadi et al 2002 however the flux of water and no3 leaching into groundwater increased when accumulated chemical fertilizer in the vadose zone in fl areas was carried with fast flow by extreme or heavy precipitation chen et al 2020 zheng et al 2019 zheng et al 2020 similarly the accumulated manure or septic waste in soil of ef and ra also affected the increased δ15n no3 isotopes and no3 concentrations in groundwater along with different no3 sources biological processes such as nitrification and denitrification in water systems also had an impact on no3 isotopes puig et al 2017 jin et al 2018 denitrification is influenced by factors such as do t and no3 concentrations if significant denitrification were occurred the δ18o δ15n ratios ranged from 1 1 3 to 1 2 1 aravena and robertson 1998 böttcher et al 1990 the groundwater samples in nv fl ra and ef did not fall within this range fig 7a the relationship between δ15n values and no3 concentrations also showed no negative correlation r2 0 32 p 0 05 in april 2016 r2 0 08 p 0 05 in january 2017 fig 8 moreover the do concentration in most groundwater samples ranged from 2 1 to 6 8 mg l in april 2016 and from 4 6 to 11 8 mg l in january 2017 table 1 denitrification is not considered to be a significant process due to the presence of do 1 mg l in most groundwater samples yang and toor 2016 all these factors indicated that no significant denitrification occurred during the sampling period additionally the δ18o values for no3 produced by microbial nitrification ranged from 0 1 to 7 8 and from 0 9 to 5 6 ji et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 in theory about 1 3 of the o in the no3 produced by nitrification is derived from atmospheric o2 but the remaining 2 3 is derived from water δ18ono3 1 3δ18oo2 2 3δ18oh2o andersson and hooper 1983 according to our results the δ18oh2o value of the groundwater in april 2016 ranged from 9 2 to 6 6 the δ18oh2o value of the groundwater in january 2017 ranged from 9 3 to 6 2 and the δ18oo2 value in the air was 23 5 amberger and schmidt 1987 the calculated δ18o value of no3 derived from nitrification in groundwater in april 2016 ranged from 1 7 to 3 4 and in january 2017 it ranged from 1 6 to 3 7 however most of the groundwater samples in the study area had δ18o no3 values exceeding this range fig 5 fig 7 which suggested that significant nitrification process did not occurring in groundwater therefore nitrification and denitrification processes were weak and had minimal impacts on mixing and the migration of no3 in groundwater in the study area 4 3 variations of contribution ratios of nitrate sources affected by extreme precipitation in order to estimate the proportional contributions of different potential no3 sources to groundwater no3 pollution the siar model was employed based on the land uses hydrochemical characteristics and stable isotopes of no3 in groundwater δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 vary due to isotope fractionations the fractionation factor cjk can influence on the siar mixing model results in this study the fractionation factor cjk was set as zero due to the denitrification had little effect on the no3 isotopic compositions see section 4 2 the parameters and their values used in the siar model were listed in table 3 the isotope information from four no3 sources which included means maximum minimum and standard deviations of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in table 3 were derived from measurements of chemical fertilizer manure sewage soil n and precipitation in the study area the siar output showed a high variability in the proportional contribution of no3 sources for different land uses in april 2016 and january 2017 fig 9 the proportional apportionment of four potential no3 sources in fl ef and ra in april 2016 showed that the contribution of manure sewage was the highest with mean contributions of 56 2 52 7 and 55 8 respectively which ranged from 34 5 to 73 9 from 40 9 to 65 4 and from 50 2 to 61 4 respectively this was followed by soil n mean contributions of 23 6 21 7 and 26 5 in fl ef and ra respectively no3 fertilizers mean contributions of 15 2 15 8 and 12 3 in fl ef and ra respectively and no3 in precipitation mean contributions of 5 0 9 8 and 5 4 in fl ef and ra respectively in nv the contribution of soil n was the highest with a mean of 43 5 which ranged from 37 3 to 50 9 this was followed by manure sewage with a mean of 32 3 no3 fertilizers with a mean of 15 8 and no3 in precipitation with a mean of 8 3 however there was no chemical fertilizer or manure sewage applied in nv since forest was the major land use in the natural vegetation area organic matter from leavers or litters contained abundant organic matter the source of manure sewage for no3 in nv was from organic matter in soil in january 2017 after extreme precipitation the contribution rate of manure sewage in fl decreased to 41 1 but the mean contribution from no3 in fertilizers increased significantly from 15 2 to 31 3 fig 9 compared with that in april 2016 the extreme precipitation in july 2016 recharged to groundwater which led to a higher contribution of manure sewage to no3 in ef and ra which increased by 13 6 and 1 8 in january 2017 respectively the variation of n sources in fl and ef was in accordance with the historical application of fertilizers manure was widely applied in agriculture before the 1990 s after that manure was replaced by chemical fertilizer in farmland but application of manure was also popular in economic forests the surface chemical n in fl and n from manure in ef were easily carried to groundwater by fast flow or preferential flow induced by extreme precipitation in nv the contribution of manure sewage and no3 fertilizers showed a significantly increase compared with those in april 2016 with means of 46 8 and 21 5 respectively there was a lower contribution of no3 from soil n and precipitation with means of 28 9 and 2 8 respectively this result is the impact of different anthropogenic source of no3 on groundwater which resulted in different proportional contributions from four no3 sources in nv fl ra and ef wang et al 2017 this result was also impacted by the transport path for no3 by water as affected by the extreme precipitation event congreves et al 2016 the existence of preferential or fast flow during the extreme precipitation was found in the headwater area and other areas demand et al 2019 zheng et al 2019 additionally increased no3 leaching carried by the preferential or fast flow in the vadose zone in farmland was affected by the extreme precipitation event and accounted for the transport of chemical nitrogen from the surface soil zheng et al 2020 the increased no3 leaching to groundwater under extreme precipitation in farmland was consistent with results reported after similar extreme precipitation experiments in the u s midwest hess et al 2020 compared with that in a normal year the large amount of extreme precipitation in a wet year caused the flow of more accumulated chemical nitrogen and manure sewage into rivers or groundwater faster briand et al 2017 chen et al 2020 the source contributions calculated by siar generally agreed with analyses according to hydrochemical characteristics and δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 isotopes fig 6 fig 7 however some issues require caution which include the changes in contributions of no3 from sources due to temporal variability of isotopes calculated by siar the mean values for δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in the potential no3 sources with large standard deviations in some land uses were affected by the siar output table 3 in this study although the mean and variance of no3 sources were mainly consistent with those measured by similar sources in different land uses we have not considered the spatial variability of the same no3 sources in groundwater to obtain more accurate isotope information on δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 for different no3 sources in the study area further studies should be conducted the uncertainty of the results was belonged to the variance ωjk and the spatial variability of no3 sources using more accurate isotope data for no3 source values which included a smaller variance ωjk and the spatial variability of no3 sources the uncertainty of the results can be reduced 5 conclusions in this study dual no3 isotopes δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 were combined with water chemistry characteristics and a siar mixing model to identify the sources and transportation processes of no3 in groundwater the results indicate that the extreme precipitation increased no3 concentration in groundwater and changed the isotopic composition of no3 in groundwater under different land uses the main sources of no3 in nv were soil nitrogen although the manure and septic waste were the main sources in fl ef and ra before extreme precipitation there was no evidence of denitrification and nitrification processes in groundwater in the headwater areas of the ncp therefore the siar mixing model can be used to estimate the proportional contribution of different sources to no3 in groundwater the results showed that before extreme precipitation the major sources of no3 were soil n 37 3 50 9 and organic matter in soil 24 7 42 1 in nv and manure sewage was the main source of no3 in fl 34 5 73 9 ef 40 9 65 4 and ra 50 2 61 4 affected by the extreme precipitation accumulated organic matter of leaves leaching into groundwater the proportional contribution of no3 source in organic matter in soil in nv increased 39 9 53 9 and the corresponding contribution of soil n was decreased 24 8 33 5 since the sewage discharge in ra and the application of manure in ef the contributions of manure sewage to no3 in ra and ef increased which accounted for 49 7 76 2 and 61 5 73 4 respectively the extreme precipitation event accelerated the transport of no3 from chemical fertilizer stored in the soil surface to the groundwater in fl 9 7 40 9 and correspondingly the no3 from manure sewage decreased 27 9 73 4 our results verify the strong impact of land use types and extreme precipitation events on groundwater based on the results of this study decision makers may propose more remediation strategies to improve careful land use and water management to prevent excessive input of no3 into groundwater credit authorship contribution statement wenbo zheng conceptualization

3979,the importance of natural water towers to water resource demand of the ecological environment and human activities is self evident they are also vulnerable and extremely sensitive to the effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change however water bodies change in water towers have not received sufficient attention therefore changbai mountain a typical high latitude water tower which is the source of second songhua river tumen river and yalu river was selected to analyze the change of water bodies and its response to interaction of driving factors over recent decades by the methods of correlation analysis and geodetector results showed that there was an obviously divergent trend in water bodies with a significant increase in surface water area swa and a significant decrease in terrestrial water storage tws in the high latitude water tower which was firstly found the strong increase in water use was the dominant factor causing the divergent trends of water bodies in tumen river changes in water bodies in the other two basins were all the result of the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities it is worth mentioning that snowpack had a noticeable influence on the change of water storage in this water tower meanwhile reduced water conservation capacity due to degradation of complex forest wetland ecosystems and altered snowmelt processes in the context of climate warming may be two key underlying causes in addition we innovatively found that the enhanced interactivity of the driving factors was an inherent reason the results of this study will be beneficial for ecosystem conservation and stability of downstream water supply in this high latitude water tower keywords water tower surface water area terrestrial water storage snow climate change water use 1 introduction mountains are the water towers of the world and important sources of freshwater they supply a substantial part of both natural and anthropogenic water demands viviroli et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2020 they are also highly sensitive and prone to changing environment especially in high latitude regions pepin et al 2015 tao et al 2020 however changes in water bodies and interaction of their driving factors in high latitude water towers have not received sufficient attention numerous open surface water bodies are distributed in high latitude water towers and provide water resources used in thermoelectric power production agricultural irrigation and downstream public water supply zhou et al 2019 pekel et al 2016 however our knowledge is limited to understand the role of surface water bodies in regional water security in the past few decades wang et al 2020 the occurrence of these surface water bodies in a high latitude area is highly variable with trends varying around the world pickens et al 2020 several studies have found a rapid loss on the mongolian plateau tao et al 2015 and substantial expansion on the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2019 for surface water areas swa during recent decades surface water is one of the major components of terrestrial water storage tws the variation of surface water bodies can change the groundwater recharge and tws wang et al 2020 tws that is the sum of continental water stored in canopies ice and snow rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands soil and groundwater is a key component of the global water and energy budget pokhrel et al 2021 it plays a key role in determining the availability of water resources and regulating the interaction of water flux between the components of the earth system rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 studies related to the spatiotemporal variability of tws have also been carried out at regional national and global scales wang et al 2020 qian et al 2020 these studies have identified locations where terrestrial water reserves appear to be lower than previous ranges especially where snow or ice are reduced due to climate change and where groundwater is extracted at an unsustainable rate however whether the changes are consistent between swa and tws remains to be further investigated wada et al 2012 siebert et al 2010 changbai mountain is an important water tower located in a high latitude region and is the source of second songhua river tumen river and yalu river the tumen river and yalu river are the international boundary rivers between china and north korea and russia respectively yu et al 2019 changbai mountain is also an important ecological functional area with a typical vertical belt spectrum from temperate broad leaved forest to tundra in eastern eurasia chi et al 2017 fang 2011 water is an important factor in maintaining the balance of this region s ecosystem however our knowledge is still limited on changes in the region s water bodies chen et al 2019 in particular there is still a lack of research on the temporal and spatial changes of water storage in the changbai mountain several studies have already reported that the external environment including climate and human activities have changed in changbai mountain over recent decades extreme precipitation frequency and temperature increased significantly snowmelt period advanced and human activities became more intense than before these have caused several ecosystem changes du et al 2018 wang et al 2019 however whether these changes have affected the swa and tws in changbai mountain remains to be further studied the objective of this study was to fill the above mentioned research gaps by investigating the interannual variations and trends of water bodies and how they were interactively affected by anthropogenic and climatic drivers in the high latitude water tower during 1984 2018 firstly the divergent trends of swa and tws in the changbai mountain were analyzed using remote sensing products secondly the correlation between eight main driving factors and changes in water bodies was simulated finally the contributions of these drivers and their interactions to changes in water bodies were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description this research was conducted in the changbai mountain which is the source of second songhua river tumen river and yalu river its area was approximately 17 16 104 km2 table 1 it ranges 39 8 45 4 n and 123 5 131 3 e fig 1 a the tumen river and yalu river are the international boundary rivers between china and north korea and russia respectively changbai mountain is an important water tower hydropower energy base and source of high quality natural mineral water in northeast china it has an obvious elevation gradient ranging from 8m to 2738 m fig 1b this area belongs to the temperate continental mountain climate affected by monsoons it is hot and rainy in summer and cold and dry in winter the climate is characterized by annual rainfall of 700 1400 mm annual average temperature of 7 3 and annual average snowfall of more than 600 mm besides the characteristics of general mountain climate there are obvious vertical climate changes in addition changbai mountain is an important functional ecological area in northeast china which has a typical vertical belt spectrum from temperate broad leaved forest to tundra in the east of eurasia the ecosystem in the area is mainly composed of korean pine broad leaved forest coniferous and broad leaved mixed forest coniferous forest betula platyphylla forest and alpine tundra five vegetation distribution zones are formed from bottom to top with an obvious law of vertical distribution 2 2 data surface water area swa dataset and land water storage dataset based on gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tws were download from the websites https global surface water appspot com and http

pickens et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2021 tao et al 2020 daily meteorological data from 48 stations in changbai mountain was obtained for the period of 1984 2018 from china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn the variables included rainfall rf evapotranspiration et0 and mean temperature mt the highest snow depth hsd dataset for the period of 1984 2018 is provided by national cryosphere desert data center http www ncdc ac cn water use datasets from 1984 to 2010 for irrigation iwu domestic dwu production pwu and electricity generation ewu were obtained from the result of huang et al 2018 and can be download from https hess copernicus org articles 22 2117 2018 2 3 method 1 modified mann kendall method modified mann kendall mmk test was applied to analyze the long term trend of swa and grace tws throughout the entire study period the traditional mann kendall test assumes that the series is independent and not robust against autocorrelation however some time series data may frequently show statistically significant serial correlation this may lead to a disproportionate rejection of the null hypothesis without the trend whereas the null hypothesis is actually true therefore the effect of serial correlation is a main source of uncertainty in testing and interpreting trends qi et al 2017 to correct the serial correlation in the data the trend free pre whitening procedure was used a more specific process of this methodology is described by yue et al 2002 after z value α 0 01 and α 0 05 was calculated for all meteorological stations they were spatially aggregated to obtain probability maps of the statistical differences 2 correlation analysis method pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to analyze the correlativity between the water bodies and driving factors and r value was calculated using spss software 3 geodetector the geographical detector model is a statistical method used to measure spatially stratified heterogeneity and identify the driving factors for some natural phenomena and socioeconomic activities geodetector includes 4 aspects of detection as follows ① factor detector factor detector was used to identify the factors that affect the dependent variable the explanatory power of each factor is measured by q value 1 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 1 ssw sst 2 ssw h 1 l n h σ h 2 sst n σ 2 where q is the explanatory power of one factor on the dependent variable h is the number of classifications or partitions of y or factor x n h and n are the number of units in class h and the whole region respectively the q value ranges from 0 to 1 the larger the q value is the stronger the spatial heterogeneity of y wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 ② risk detector risk detector is used to judge whether there is a significant difference in the attribute mean value between two sub regions t statistic is used to test 3 t y h 1 y h 2 y h 1 y h 2 v a r y h 1 n h 1 v a r y h 2 n h 2 1 2 where y represents the mean value of attributes in the sub region h n h is the number of samples in sub region h var is variance the t value is derived from the student s t test ③ ecological detector ecological detector is used to compare the effects of two factors x 1 and x 2 on the spatial distribution of attribute y which is examined by f statistic 4 f n x 1 n x 2 1 s s w x 1 n x 2 n x 1 1 s s w x 2 5 ss w x 1 h 1 l 1 n h σ h ss w x 2 h 1 l 2 n h σ h 2 where n x 1 and n x 2 represent the sample size of two factors x 1 and x 2 respectively ss w x 1 and ss w x 2 represent the sum of variance within the layer formed by x 1 and x 2 respectively l 1 and l 2 represent the number of variables x 1 and x 2 respectively ④ interaction detector interaction detector was used to identify interaction between two different factors e g x 1 and x 2 that is to say whether the combined action of factors x 1 and x 2 will increase or decrease the explanatory power of the dependent variable y or whether the influence of these factors on y is independent of each other the relationship between the two factors q x 1 x 2 can be divided into the following categories as seen in fig 2 3 results 3 1 divergent trends of surface water areas and terrestrial water storage 1 spatial distribution of water bodies in the changbai mountain open surface water was mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the three basins fig 3 a the multi year average of the total swa was 3323 38 km2 in the changbai mountain during 1984 2018 the swa of ssr was the largest and that of tr was the smallest table 2 compared to 1984 the swa showed an increasing trend with only slightly decreasing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the three basins fig 3c the swa of tr showed a characteristic of decreasing as a whole some swa of ssr and yr increased in local region and the rest decreased on the whole the water storage in the west of changbai mountain was less than that in the east the multi year average of the total grace tws was 1 63 cm in changbai mountain during 2002 2018 meanwhile different from the average distribution of total swa water storage in the tr was the largest and that in the yr was the smallest table 2 the spatial tws reduced during 2002 2018 consistent with the spatial distribution of water storage the decrease in the west was obviously more than that in east fig 3d water storage was reduced by up to 9 36 cm on the west side on the changbai mountain the water storage of ssr and yr decreased most significantly during 2002 2018 2 temporal change patterns of water bodies in the changbai mountain the change of swa agrees with the normal distribution for ssr fig 4 a1 tr fig 4b1 and yr fig 4c1 the average swa during 1984 2018 was 1838 06 km2 in ssr 219 03 km2 in tr and 1266 29 km2 in yr respectively there was an increasing trend in the swa in the changbai mountain during 1984 2018 except for the ssr basin fig 4a2 the increasing trend of swa in the other two basins was all significant p 0 01 during 1984 2018 the increasing trend was 6 50 km2 yr 6 36 km2 yr and 6 93 km2 yr for ssr basin tr basin and yr basin respectively the increasing trend of swa during 2000 2010 was the most significant in ssr and yr however that of swa in tr was the most significant before 1990 and after 2010 the change of grace tws also agrees with the normal distribution for ssr fig 4a3 tr fig 4b3 and yr fig 4c3 the average grace tws during 2002 2018 was 1 21 cm in ssr 1 00 cm in tr and 2 68 cm in yr respectively contrary to the change of swa a significant decreasing trend was shown in the three basins during 2002 2018 the decreasing trend was 0 35 cm yr 0 28 cm yr and 0 63 cm yr for ssr basin fig 4a2 tr basin fig 4b2 and yr basin fig 4c2 respectively the decrease trend of tws in yr was obviously the most significant 3 2 relationship between water bodies and driving factors in the changbai mountain in order to analyze the causes of water bodies changes eight factors e g rf hsd mt et0 dwu iwu ewu pwu were selected the relationship between the change of water bodies and each factor was fitted for the changbai mountain it was found that there was not a simple linear relationship between water bodies and driving factors fig 5 therefore the change of both swa and grace tws was the result of multiple driving factors the correlation between change of water bodies and driving factors in each basin was not completely consistent the change of swa in the ssr was significantly correlated with rf p 0 01 et0 p 0 05 and iwu p 0 05 fig 6 a and that of tr was significantly correlated with ewu p 0 01 and pwu p 0 01 fig 6b whereas that of yr was significantly correlated with rf p 0 01 ewu p 0 05 and iwu p 0 01 fig 6c during the period of 1984 2018 these results indicate that changes in the swa of the tr were mainly influenced by human activities while the other two basins were mainly affected by a combination of climate change and human activities the correlation between the change of grace tws and driving factors was different from that of swa in the changbai mountain the change of grace tws was significantly correlated with pwu p 0 05 in the ssr fig 6a with iwu in the tr fig 6b and with rf et0 and iwu in the yr fig 6c during the period of 2002 2018 these results indicate that changes in the tws of the yr were mainly influenced by a combination of climate change and human activities while the other two basins were mainly affected by human activities 3 3 contribution of driving factors to water bodies change in the changbai mountain however whether the correlation was significant could not be used as a basis for the contribution of driving factors to water bodies change therefore we made an analysis on the contribution of driving factors to changes of water bodies based on the geodetector the contribution of each driving factor to the changes of swa and grace tws was analyzed in the three basins based on the geographical detector model fig 7 the first three factors that contributed the most to the change of swa in the ssr were rf q 0 40 et0 q 0 26 and iwu q 0 26 that of the tr in order were ewu q 0 62 pwu q 0 53 and mt q 0 37 while that of the yr in order were rf q 0 35 dwu q 0 24 iwu q 0 23 and et0 q 0 23 the first three factors that contributed the most to the change of grace tws were different from that of swa the contribution of hsd to change of grace tws in the three basins was relatively larger the first three factors in the ssr in order were rf q 0 53 hsd q 0 48 ewu q 0 44 or pwu q 0 44 the factors of tr were iwu q 0 57 hsd q 0 52 and pwu q 0 44 in order while that of yr were mt q 0 67 hsd q 0 66 and et0 q 0 59 in order as mentioned above the relationship between change of water bodies and driving factors in changbai mountain was not simply linear the changes of these water bodies are caused by multiple factors interaction therefore contribution of driving factors interaction to water bodies changes in the three basins of changbai mountain from 1984 to 2018 was analyzed fig 8 under the interaction of two factors the effect on water bodies change was enhanced the enhancement effect could be generalized to two types dual factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement there were two significant differences that most interactions of driving factors on aws showed a non linear enhancement and most of the interactions on grace tws showed a dual factor enhancement in the form of nonlinear enhancement the interaction factors with the most significant contribution to aws change were rf t m rf e w u and rf i w u q 0 8 in ssr and rf e w u hsd e w u and iwu e w u q 0 9 in tr with rf e w u q 0 9 in yr the results showed that the contribution of rf e w u interaction to aws change was most significant in the changbai mountain however the effect of two factor interaction on grace tws was more complex in the three basins the interaction factors with the most significant contribution to grace tws change were e t 0 i w u q 0 9 in ssr in the form of nonlinear enhancement however the most significant contributions were rf e w u rf i w u rf p w u q 1 in the form of nonlinear enhancement and iwu p w u q 1 in the form of dual factor enhancement in tr the impact characteristics of the two factor interaction was most complex in yr the interaction factors in the form of dual factor enhancement were rf h s d rf t m rf i w u hsd t m hsd p w u tm i w u tm p w u e t 0 p w u and iwu p w u q 0 9 while those in the form of nonlinear enhancement were hsd d w u and iwu d w u q 0 9 4 discussion 4 1 spatial temporal change patterns of water bodies as an important water tower in eastern asia changbai mountain is critical for regional ecology industrial production and downstream livelihood at the same time the ecological health and abundant water supply of the tumen and yalu rivers which are important international border rivers between china north korea and russia are of great practical importance for maintaining international cooperative relations however little attention has been paid to the vulnerability of water resources in the water tower this finding is presented for the first time in this study the change of water bodies in changbai mountain was the complete opposite during recent decades for a time the swa was increasing however the water storage was significantly decreasing fig 4 which seems to be a contradictory phenomenon in our opinion this phenomenon was in line with natural conditions the swa only increased near lakes or rivers and the water reserves decrease in all areas the increase of water volume in some areas did not affect the decrease of that in the whole area among the three basins the increasing trend of swa in yr was the most significant at a rate of 6 93 km2 yr and the decreasing trend of tws was also most prominent at a rate of 0 63 cm yr these results were supported by the research of wang et al 2020 except that it was not emphasized in their study and lacked research in the north korean region spatially the swa increased significantly except for some mid downstream regions meanwhile the reduction of tws on the west side was significantly higher than that on the east side fig 3 these changes may be closely related to climate change and human activities qian et al 2020 cao 2017 this view could also be proven from the perspective of the correlation of water bodies changes from driving factors fig 6 rf was the dominant factor in the change of water bodies in changbai mountain although there was no significant change in annual rainfall the frequency of extreme precipitation has increased over past decades du et al 2013 this leads to the formation of quick flow which is not conducive to groundwater recharge and storage scaife et al 2020 in addition high latitude mountains were among the regions where the most dramatic temperature increases pepin et al 2015 although no significant correlation was found between temperature and change of water bodies but the change of temperature could affect significantly et0 and hsd they were important influencing factors on water bodies change in the changbai mountain barnett et al 2005 as climate warms snow melts early and quickly however due to the presence of permafrost in the whole changbai mountain during spring most of the melt water evaporates or forms runoff resulting in stored in reservoirs or out of the basin and rarely recharges groundwater pepin et al 2015 barnett et al 2005 diffenbaugh et al 2013 in addition there was no question that water use was also a major factor in the change of water bodies a large number of reservoirs have been built in order to meet human needs for water electricity and flood control most of these reservoirs were built in mountainous regions fang et al 2019 reservoir storage leads to an increase in swa which explains why when water consumption was higher the water surface area in some regions was larger fig 5 however power generation from reservoirs was an important factor in the reduction of water storage in the changbai mountains this is because reservoirs increased low winter flows to meet the demand for power generation but most of the water flows downstream or into the ocean due to the presence of permafrost in winter limiting recharge to groundwater ge et al 2011 woo and winter 1993 evans et al 2018 power generation in other seasons would alter timing peaks and durations of high flow pulses and flooding poff and schmidt 2016 also change river recharge to groundwater additionally meeting the human demand for water resources with only surface water was insufficient so a large amount of groundwater was extracted jiang 2017 leading to a decline of the tws in the changbai mountain the reduction of water storage may cause a series of potential irrecoverable adverse effects on the changbai mountain ecosystem such as droughts pokhrel et al 2021 floods and plant wilting ma et al 2020 it may be an effective way to effectively reduce natural disasters by restoring ecosystems reducing groundwater extraction etc 4 2 anthropogenic and climatic drivers for swa and tws dynamics previous studies have highlighted that water bodies in northeast china were controlled by rainfall on the interannual scale qian et al 2020 similar results were also found in this study there was no significant trend in rainfall but the interannual variability was substantial fig 9 a our study found that rf has a large contribution to changes of water bodies but is not the absolute dominant factor in terms of contribution to the change in tws hsd was greater than that of rf fig 7 there was also no significant change trend in hsd fig 9b however a nonlinear relationship between tws and hsd could be found figs 5 and 6 the mt over the changbai mountain displayed in fig 9c exhibiting the characteristic of first increasing then decreasing and then increasing again during the study period qian et al 2020 li et al 2014 the increasing trend of mt was most significant in ssr p 0 05 the direct effect of mt on water bodies was limited however it could indirectly change water bodies by affecting snow melting and et0 there was no significant trend in et0 change in the changbai mountain it was similar to the variation of other meteorological factors and had a large interannual variation it was also one of the main drivers of water bodies change in the changbai mountain especially in the yalu river showing a significant negative correlation with water storage variation figs 5c4 6c and 7 the trend of increasing ewu in the three basins was significant between 1984 and 2018 p 0 01 and relatively flat between 2002 and 2018 fig 9e this indicator was also one of the main anthropogenic drivers of swa change in the tr and yr fig 9 irrigation is a major water user in a watershed and consumes a large amount of water each year causing large amounts of surface water to flow out of the river and groundwater to be extracted siebert et al 2010 li 2020 this indicator may be the most important anthropogenic driver as shown in fig 9f there was a slight trend of decrease in irrigation water use in the three watersheds due to the conversion of paddy fields to dry fields in some areas zheng et al 2017 2020 however it did not mean that the perturbation of this factor on the change of water bodies was decreasing rather it continued to increase there were many sloped farmland slope 25 which destroyed the forest wetland complex ecosystem leading to the decline of water conservation capacity zhang 2019 and then the decrease of tws in changbai mountain the dwu including residential and livestock decreased and then increased during 1984 2018 in the changbai mountain p 0 05 however the impact of this indicator on the change of water bodies was not significant moreover the increase of pwu in the changbai mountain was very significant especially that of ssr at a rate of 0 27 mm yr fig 9h this directly led to a significant decrease of tws in ssr the modification of water bodies in mid high latitude areas by climate change and human activities has been confirmed by many previous studies chen et al 2019 wang et al 2018 tao et al 2020 barnett et al 2005 these studies analyzed the effects of these factors on water bodies from a single factor perspective in fact the alteration of water bodies was often triggered by the interaction of multiple factors however this view has received little attention in this study we tried to innovatively analyze the contribution of the interaction of dual factors to the change of the water bodies these results identified two type effect dual factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement fig 8 providing a new perspective to reveal the driving factors of divergent changes of water bodies in changbai mountain 4 3 uncertainty and prospects in this study eight representative driving factors were selected to analyze the individual and interactive contributions to water bodies changes some important conclusions have been obtained however there are still some complex issues which need further study for the divergent changes of water bodies in changbai mountain the critical impact of altered snowmelt process on the reduction of water storage in the context of climate warming remains to be further quantified musselman et al 2017 jodar et al 2020 musselman et al 2018 in addition it is widely recognized that vegetation changes or land use can significantly affect the local water storage however it is still a challenge to predict changes in water storage following vegetation change due to limited understanding of catchment storage dynamics cheng et al 2017 the significant impact of reduced water conservation capacity on water storage due to degradation of forest wetland complex ecosystems is also a key scientific issue that needs urgent attention barnett et al 2005 meanwhile the water storage depletion can also have adverse consequences on phreatophytes groundwater dependent natural vegetation bhanja et al 2019 therefore the relationship between vegetation or land use change and water storage is a very complex mutual feed process to alleviate ecosystem breakdown a project called mountains rivers forests farmlands lakes grasslands life community meaning that these ecological elements will be considered as a whole has been implemented by the chinese government yu et al 2019 therefore how to scientifically evaluate the impact of the project on the hydrological cycle would also be an important issue to address constructing a distributed eco hydrological model to solve the impact of vegetation changes on water storage will be the next problem we have to solve 5 conclusions this study identified the trend of divergent changes in water bodies during recent decades and their driving factors in a high latitude water tower based on these findings the following conclusions can be drawn 1 there was a significant trend of divergent changes in water bodies in the high latitude water tower during recent decades with a significant increase in surface water area and a significant decrease in water storage 2 the strong increase in water use was the dominant factor causing the divergent trends of water bodies in tr changes in water bodies in the other two basins were all the result of the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities 3 it is worth mentioning that snowpack had an important influence on the change of water storage in the high latitude water tower 4 we innovatively found that the enhanced interactivity of the driving factors was the deep seated reason for the divergent trend of water bodies in high latitude water tower 5 two important underlying causes of reduced water storage may be the reduced water conservation capacity due to degradation of forest wetland complex ecosystems and altered snowmelt process in the context of climate warming in

3979,the importance of natural water towers to water resource demand of the ecological environment and human activities is self evident they are also vulnerable and extremely sensitive to the effects of anthropogenic activities and climate change however water bodies change in water towers have not received sufficient attention therefore changbai mountain a typical high latitude water tower which is the source of second songhua river tumen river and yalu river was selected to analyze the change of water bodies and its response to interaction of driving factors over recent decades by the methods of correlation analysis and geodetector results showed that there was an obviously divergent trend in water bodies with a significant increase in surface water area swa and a significant decrease in terrestrial water storage tws in the high latitude water tower which was firstly found the strong increase in water use was the dominant factor causing the divergent trends of water bodies in tumen river changes in water bodies in the other two basins were all the result of the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities it is worth mentioning that snowpack had a noticeable influence on the change of water storage in this water tower meanwhile reduced water conservation capacity due to degradation of complex forest wetland ecosystems and altered snowmelt processes in the context of climate warming may be two key underlying causes in addition we innovatively found that the enhanced interactivity of the driving factors was an inherent reason the results of this study will be beneficial for ecosystem conservation and stability of downstream water supply in this high latitude water tower keywords water tower surface water area terrestrial water storage snow climate change water use 1 introduction mountains are the water towers of the world and important sources of freshwater they supply a substantial part of both natural and anthropogenic water demands viviroli et al 2007 immerzeel et al 2020 they are also highly sensitive and prone to changing environment especially in high latitude regions pepin et al 2015 tao et al 2020 however changes in water bodies and interaction of their driving factors in high latitude water towers have not received sufficient attention numerous open surface water bodies are distributed in high latitude water towers and provide water resources used in thermoelectric power production agricultural irrigation and downstream public water supply zhou et al 2019 pekel et al 2016 however our knowledge is limited to understand the role of surface water bodies in regional water security in the past few decades wang et al 2020 the occurrence of these surface water bodies in a high latitude area is highly variable with trends varying around the world pickens et al 2020 several studies have found a rapid loss on the mongolian plateau tao et al 2015 and substantial expansion on the tibetan plateau zhang et al 2019 for surface water areas swa during recent decades surface water is one of the major components of terrestrial water storage tws the variation of surface water bodies can change the groundwater recharge and tws wang et al 2020 tws that is the sum of continental water stored in canopies ice and snow rivers lakes reservoirs wetlands soil and groundwater is a key component of the global water and energy budget pokhrel et al 2021 it plays a key role in determining the availability of water resources and regulating the interaction of water flux between the components of the earth system rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 studies related to the spatiotemporal variability of tws have also been carried out at regional national and global scales wang et al 2020 qian et al 2020 these studies have identified locations where terrestrial water reserves appear to be lower than previous ranges especially where snow or ice are reduced due to climate change and where groundwater is extracted at an unsustainable rate however whether the changes are consistent between swa and tws remains to be further investigated wada et al 2012 siebert et al 2010 changbai mountain is an important water tower located in a high latitude region and is the source of second songhua river tumen river and yalu river the tumen river and yalu river are the international boundary rivers between china and north korea and russia respectively yu et al 2019 changbai mountain is also an important ecological functional area with a typical vertical belt spectrum from temperate broad leaved forest to tundra in eastern eurasia chi et al 2017 fang 2011 water is an important factor in maintaining the balance of this region s ecosystem however our knowledge is still limited on changes in the region s water bodies chen et al 2019 in particular there is still a lack of research on the temporal and spatial changes of water storage in the changbai mountain several studies have already reported that the external environment including climate and human activities have changed in changbai mountain over recent decades extreme precipitation frequency and temperature increased significantly snowmelt period advanced and human activities became more intense than before these have caused several ecosystem changes du et al 2018 wang et al 2019 however whether these changes have affected the swa and tws in changbai mountain remains to be further studied the objective of this study was to fill the above mentioned research gaps by investigating the interannual variations and trends of water bodies and how they were interactively affected by anthropogenic and climatic drivers in the high latitude water tower during 1984 2018 firstly the divergent trends of swa and tws in the changbai mountain were analyzed using remote sensing products secondly the correlation between eight main driving factors and changes in water bodies was simulated finally the contributions of these drivers and their interactions to changes in water bodies were identified 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site description this research was conducted in the changbai mountain which is the source of second songhua river tumen river and yalu river its area was approximately 17 16 104 km2 table 1 it ranges 39 8 45 4 n and 123 5 131 3 e fig 1 a the tumen river and yalu river are the international boundary rivers between china and north korea and russia respectively changbai mountain is an important water tower hydropower energy base and source of high quality natural mineral water in northeast china it has an obvious elevation gradient ranging from 8m to 2738 m fig 1b this area belongs to the temperate continental mountain climate affected by monsoons it is hot and rainy in summer and cold and dry in winter the climate is characterized by annual rainfall of 700 1400 mm annual average temperature of 7 3 and annual average snowfall of more than 600 mm besides the characteristics of general mountain climate there are obvious vertical climate changes in addition changbai mountain is an important functional ecological area in northeast china which has a typical vertical belt spectrum from temperate broad leaved forest to tundra in the east of eurasia the ecosystem in the area is mainly composed of korean pine broad leaved forest coniferous and broad leaved mixed forest coniferous forest betula platyphylla forest and alpine tundra five vegetation distribution zones are formed from bottom to top with an obvious law of vertical distribution 2 2 data surface water area swa dataset and land water storage dataset based on gravity recovery and climate experiment grace tws were download from the websites https global surface water appspot com and http www2 csr utexas edu grace rl06 mascons html these data are widely used by scientists all over the world and their accuracy at the regional scale has been fully verified and confirmed pekel et al 2016 pickens et al 2020 pokhrel et al 2021 tao et al 2020 daily meteorological data from 48 stations in changbai mountain was obtained for the period of 1984 2018 from china meteorological data service centre http data cma cn the variables included rainfall rf evapotranspiration et0 and mean temperature mt the highest snow depth hsd dataset for the period of 1984 2018 is provided by national cryosphere desert data center http www ncdc ac cn water use datasets from 1984 to 2010 for irrigation iwu domestic dwu production pwu and electricity generation ewu were obtained from the result of huang et al 2018 and can be download from https hess copernicus org articles 22 2117 2018 2 3 method 1 modified mann kendall method modified mann kendall mmk test was applied to analyze the long term trend of swa and grace tws throughout the entire study period the traditional mann kendall test assumes that the series is independent and not robust against autocorrelation however some time series data may frequently show statistically significant serial correlation this may lead to a disproportionate rejection of the null hypothesis without the trend whereas the null hypothesis is actually true therefore the effect of serial correlation is a main source of uncertainty in testing and interpreting trends qi et al 2017 to correct the serial correlation in the data the trend free pre whitening procedure was used a more specific process of this methodology is described by yue et al 2002 after z value α 0 01 and α 0 05 was calculated for all meteorological stations they were spatially aggregated to obtain probability maps of the statistical differences 2 correlation analysis method pearson s correlation coefficient was applied to analyze the correlativity between the water bodies and driving factors and r value was calculated using spss software 3 geodetector the geographical detector model is a statistical method used to measure spatially stratified heterogeneity and identify the driving factors for some natural phenomena and socioeconomic activities geodetector includes 4 aspects of detection as follows ① factor detector factor detector was used to identify the factors that affect the dependent variable the explanatory power of each factor is measured by q value 1 q 1 h 1 l n h σ h 2 n σ 2 1 ssw sst 2 ssw h 1 l n h σ h 2 sst n σ 2 where q is the explanatory power of one factor on the dependent variable h is the number of classifications or partitions of y or factor x n h and n are the number of units in class h and the whole region respectively the q value ranges from 0 to 1 the larger the q value is the stronger the spatial heterogeneity of y wang et al 2016 zhu et al 2020 ② risk detector risk detector is used to judge whether there is a significant difference in the attribute mean value between two sub regions t statistic is used to test 3 t y h 1 y h 2 y h 1 y h 2 v a r y h 1 n h 1 v a r y h 2 n h 2 1 2 where y represents the mean value of attributes in the sub region h n h is the number of samples in sub region h var is variance the t value is derived from the student s t test ③ ecological detector ecological detector is used to compare the effects of two factors x 1 and x 2 on the spatial distribution of attribute y which is examined by f statistic 4 f n x 1 n x 2 1 s s w x 1 n x 2 n x 1 1 s s w x 2 5 ss w x 1 h 1 l 1 n h σ h ss w x 2 h 1 l 2 n h σ h 2 where n x 1 and n x 2 represent the sample size of two factors x 1 and x 2 respectively ss w x 1 and ss w x 2 represent the sum of variance within the layer formed by x 1 and x 2 respectively l 1 and l 2 represent the number of variables x 1 and x 2 respectively ④ interaction detector interaction detector was used to identify interaction between two different factors e g x 1 and x 2 that is to say whether the combined action of factors x 1 and x 2 will increase or decrease the explanatory power of the dependent variable y or whether the influence of these factors on y is independent of each other the relationship between the two factors q x 1 x 2 can be divided into the following categories as seen in fig 2 3 results 3 1 divergent trends of surface water areas and terrestrial water storage 1 spatial distribution of water bodies in the changbai mountain open surface water was mainly distributed in the middle and lower reaches of the three basins fig 3 a the multi year average of the total swa was 3323 38 km2 in the changbai mountain during 1984 2018 the swa of ssr was the largest and that of tr was the smallest table 2 compared to 1984 the swa showed an increasing trend with only slightly decreasing areas in the middle and lower reaches of the three basins fig 3c the swa of tr showed a characteristic of decreasing as a whole some swa of ssr and yr increased in local region and the rest decreased on the whole the water storage in the west of changbai mountain was less than that in the east the multi year average of the total grace tws was 1 63 cm in changbai mountain during 2002 2018 meanwhile different from the average distribution of total swa water storage in the tr was the largest and that in the yr was the smallest table 2 the spatial tws reduced during 2002 2018 consistent with the spatial distribution of water storage the decrease in the west was obviously more than that in east fig 3d water storage was reduced by up to 9 36 cm on the west side on the changbai mountain the water storage of ssr and yr decreased most significantly during 2002 2018 2 temporal change patterns of water bodies in the changbai mountain the change of swa agrees with the normal distribution for ssr fig 4 a1 tr fig 4b1 and yr fig 4c1 the average swa during 1984 2018 was 1838 06 km2 in ssr 219 03 km2 in tr and 1266 29 km2 in yr respectively there was an increasing trend in the swa in the changbai mountain during 1984 2018 except for the ssr basin fig 4a2 the increasing trend of swa in the other two basins was all significant p 0 01 during 1984 2018 the increasing trend was 6 50 km2 yr 6 36 km2 yr and 6 93 km2 yr for ssr basin tr basin and yr basin respectively the increasing trend of swa during 2000 2010 was the most significant in ssr and yr however that of swa in tr was the most significant before 1990 and after 2010 the change of grace tws also agrees with the normal distribution for ssr fig 4a3 tr fig 4b3 and yr fig 4c3 the average grace tws during 2002 2018 was 1 21 cm in ssr 1 00 cm in tr and 2 68 cm in yr respectively contrary to the change of swa a significant decreasing trend was shown in the three basins during 2002 2018 the decreasing trend was 0 35 cm yr 0 28 cm yr and 0 63 cm yr for ssr basin fig 4a2 tr basin fig 4b2 and yr basin fig 4c2 respectively the decrease trend of tws in yr was obviously the most significant 3 2 relationship between water bodies and driving factors in the changbai mountain in order to analyze the causes of water bodies changes eight factors e g rf hsd mt et0 dwu iwu ewu pwu were selected the relationship between the change of water bodies and each factor was fitted for the changbai mountain it was found that there was not a simple linear relationship between water bodies and driving factors fig 5 therefore the change of both swa and grace tws was the result of multiple driving factors the correlation between change of water bodies and driving factors in each basin was not completely consistent the change of swa in the ssr was significantly correlated with rf p 0 01 et0 p 0 05 and iwu p 0 05 fig 6 a and that of tr was significantly correlated with ewu p 0 01 and pwu p 0 01 fig 6b whereas that of yr was significantly correlated with rf p 0 01 ewu p 0 05 and iwu p 0 01 fig 6c during the period of 1984 2018 these results indicate that changes in the swa of the tr were mainly influenced by human activities while the other two basins were mainly affected by a combination of climate change and human activities the correlation between the change of grace tws and driving factors was different from that of swa in the changbai mountain the change of grace tws was significantly correlated with pwu p 0 05 in the ssr fig 6a with iwu in the tr fig 6b and with rf et0 and iwu in the yr fig 6c during the period of 2002 2018 these results indicate that changes in the tws of the yr were mainly influenced by a combination of climate change and human activities while the other two basins were mainly affected by human activities 3 3 contribution of driving factors to water bodies change in the changbai mountain however whether the correlation was significant could not be used as a basis for the contribution of driving factors to water bodies change therefore we made an analysis on the contribution of driving factors to changes of water bodies based on the geodetector the contribution of each driving factor to the changes of swa and grace tws was analyzed in the three basins based on the geographical detector model fig 7 the first three factors that contributed the most to the change of swa in the ssr were rf q 0 40 et0 q 0 26 and iwu q 0 26 that of the tr in order were ewu q 0 62 pwu q 0 53 and mt q 0 37 while that of the yr in order were rf q 0 35 dwu q 0 24 iwu q 0 23 and et0 q 0 23 the first three factors that contributed the most to the change of grace tws were different from that of swa the contribution of hsd to change of grace tws in the three basins was relatively larger the first three factors in the ssr in order were rf q 0 53 hsd q 0 48 ewu q 0 44 or pwu q 0 44 the factors of tr were iwu q 0 57 hsd q 0 52 and pwu q 0 44 in order while that of yr were mt q 0 67 hsd q 0 66 and et0 q 0 59 in order as mentioned above the relationship between change of water bodies and driving factors in changbai mountain was not simply linear the changes of these water bodies are caused by multiple factors interaction therefore contribution of driving factors interaction to water bodies changes in the three basins of changbai mountain from 1984 to 2018 was analyzed fig 8 under the interaction of two factors the effect on water bodies change was enhanced the enhancement effect could be generalized to two types dual factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement there were two significant differences that most interactions of driving factors on aws showed a non linear enhancement and most of the interactions on grace tws showed a dual factor enhancement in the form of nonlinear enhancement the interaction factors with the most significant contribution to aws change were rf t m rf e w u and rf i w u q 0 8 in ssr and rf e w u hsd e w u and iwu e w u q 0 9 in tr with rf e w u q 0 9 in yr the results showed that the contribution of rf e w u interaction to aws change was most significant in the changbai mountain however the effect of two factor interaction on grace tws was more complex in the three basins the interaction factors with the most significant contribution to grace tws change were e t 0 i w u q 0 9 in ssr in the form of nonlinear enhancement however the most significant contributions were rf e w u rf i w u rf p w u q 1 in the form of nonlinear enhancement and iwu p w u q 1 in the form of dual factor enhancement in tr the impact characteristics of the two factor interaction was most complex in yr the interaction factors in the form of dual factor enhancement were rf h s d rf t m rf i w u hsd t m hsd p w u tm i w u tm p w u e t 0 p w u and iwu p w u q 0 9 while those in the form of nonlinear enhancement were hsd d w u and iwu d w u q 0 9 4 discussion 4 1 spatial temporal change patterns of water bodies as an important water tower in eastern asia changbai mountain is critical for regional ecology industrial production and downstream livelihood at the same time the ecological health and abundant water supply of the tumen and yalu rivers which are important international border rivers between china north korea and russia are of great practical importance for maintaining international cooperative relations however little attention has been paid to the vulnerability of water resources in the water tower this finding is presented for the first time in this study the change of water bodies in changbai mountain was the complete opposite during recent decades for a time the swa was increasing however the water storage was significantly decreasing fig 4 which seems to be a contradictory phenomenon in our opinion this phenomenon was in line with natural conditions the swa only increased near lakes or rivers and the water reserves decrease in all areas the increase of water volume in some areas did not affect the decrease of that in the whole area among the three basins the increasing trend of swa in yr was the most significant at a rate of 6 93 km2 yr and the decreasing trend of tws was also most prominent at a rate of 0 63 cm yr these results were supported by the research of wang et al 2020 except that it was not emphasized in their study and lacked research in the north korean region spatially the swa increased significantly except for some mid downstream regions meanwhile the reduction of tws on the west side was significantly higher than that on the east side fig 3 these changes may be closely related to climate change and human activities qian et al 2020 cao 2017 this view could also be proven from the perspective of the correlation of water bodies changes from driving factors fig 6 rf was the dominant factor in the change of water bodies in changbai mountain although there was no significant change in annual rainfall the frequency of extreme precipitation has increased over past decades du et al 2013 this leads to the formation of quick flow which is not conducive to groundwater recharge and storage scaife et al 2020 in addition high latitude mountains were among the regions where the most dramatic temperature increases pepin et al 2015 although no significant correlation was found between temperature and change of water bodies but the change of temperature could affect significantly et0 and hsd they were important influencing factors on water bodies change in the changbai mountain barnett et al 2005 as climate warms snow melts early and quickly however due to the presence of permafrost in the whole changbai mountain during spring most of the melt water evaporates or forms runoff resulting in stored in reservoirs or out of the basin and rarely recharges groundwater pepin et al 2015 barnett et al 2005 diffenbaugh et al 2013 in addition there was no question that water use was also a major factor in the change of water bodies a large number of reservoirs have been built in order to meet human needs for water electricity and flood control most of these reservoirs were built in mountainous regions fang et al 2019 reservoir storage leads to an increase in swa which explains why when water consumption was higher the water surface area in some regions was larger fig 5 however power generation from reservoirs was an important factor in the reduction of water storage in the changbai mountains this is because reservoirs increased low winter flows to meet the demand for power generation but most of the water flows downstream or into the ocean due to the presence of permafrost in winter limiting recharge to groundwater ge et al 2011 woo and winter 1993 evans et al 2018 power generation in other seasons would alter timing peaks and durations of high flow pulses and flooding poff and schmidt 2016 also change river recharge to groundwater additionally meeting the human demand for water resources with only surface water was insufficient so a large amount of groundwater was extracted jiang 2017 leading to a decline of the tws in the changbai mountain the reduction of water storage may cause a series of potential irrecoverable adverse effects on the changbai mountain ecosystem such as droughts pokhrel et al 2021 floods and plant wilting ma et al 2020 it may be an effective way to effectively reduce natural disasters by restoring ecosystems reducing groundwater extraction etc 4 2 anthropogenic and climatic drivers for swa and tws dynamics previous studies have highlighted that water bodies in northeast china were controlled by rainfall on the interannual scale qian et al 2020 similar results were also found in this study there was no significant trend in rainfall but the interannual variability was substantial fig 9 a our study found that rf has a large contribution to changes of water bodies but is not the absolute dominant factor in terms of contribution to the change in tws hsd was greater than that of rf fig 7 there was also no significant change trend in hsd fig 9b however a nonlinear relationship between tws and hsd could be found figs 5 and 6 the mt over the changbai mountain displayed in fig 9c exhibiting the characteristic of first increasing then decreasing and then increasing again during the study period qian et al 2020 li et al 2014 the increasing trend of mt was most significant in ssr p 0 05 the direct effect of mt on water bodies was limited however it could indirectly change water bodies by affecting snow melting and et0 there was no significant trend in et0 change in the changbai mountain it was similar to the variation of other meteorological factors and had a large interannual variation it was also one of the main drivers of water bodies change in the changbai mountain especially in the yalu river showing a significant negative correlation with water storage variation figs 5c4 6c and 7 the trend of increasing ewu in the three basins was significant between 1984 and 2018 p 0 01 and relatively flat between 2002 and 2018 fig 9e this indicator was also one of the main anthropogenic drivers of swa change in the tr and yr fig 9 irrigation is a major water user in a watershed and consumes a large amount of water each year causing large amounts of surface water to flow out of the river and groundwater to be extracted siebert et al 2010 li 2020 this indicator may be the most important anthropogenic driver as shown in fig 9f there was a slight trend of decrease in irrigation water use in the three watersheds due to the conversion of paddy fields to dry fields in some areas zheng et al 2017 2020 however it did not mean that the perturbation of this factor on the change of water bodies was decreasing rather it continued to increase there were many sloped farmland slope 25 which destroyed the forest wetland complex ecosystem leading to the decline of water conservation capacity zhang 2019 and then the decrease of tws in changbai mountain the dwu including residential and livestock decreased and then increased during 1984 2018 in the changbai mountain p 0 05 however the impact of this indicator on the change of water bodies was not significant moreover the increase of pwu in the changbai mountain was very significant especially that of ssr at a rate of 0 27 mm yr fig 9h this directly led to a significant decrease of tws in ssr the modification of water bodies in mid high latitude areas by climate change and human activities has been confirmed by many previous studies chen et al 2019 wang et al 2018 tao et al 2020 barnett et al 2005 these studies analyzed the effects of these factors on water bodies from a single factor perspective in fact the alteration of water bodies was often triggered by the interaction of multiple factors however this view has received little attention in this study we tried to innovatively analyze the contribution of the interaction of dual factors to the change of the water bodies these results identified two type effect dual factor enhancement and nonlinear enhancement fig 8 providing a new perspective to reveal the driving factors of divergent changes of water bodies in changbai mountain 4 3 uncertainty and prospects in this study eight representative driving factors were selected to analyze the individual and interactive contributions to water bodies changes some important conclusions have been obtained however there are still some complex issues which need further study for the divergent changes of water bodies in changbai mountain the critical impact of altered snowmelt process on the reduction of water storage in the context of climate warming remains to be further quantified musselman et al 2017 jodar et al 2020 musselman et al 2018 in addition it is widely recognized that vegetation changes or land use can significantly affect the local water storage however it is still a challenge to predict changes in water storage following vegetation change due to limited understanding of catchment storage dynamics cheng et al 2017 the significant impact of reduced water conservation capacity on water storage due to degradation of forest wetland complex ecosystems is also a key scientific issue that needs urgent attention barnett et al 2005 meanwhile the water storage depletion can also have adverse consequences on phreatophytes groundwater dependent natural vegetation bhanja et al 2019 therefore the relationship between vegetation or land use change and water storage is a very complex mutual feed process to alleviate ecosystem breakdown a project called mountains rivers forests farmlands lakes grasslands life community meaning that these ecological elements will be considered as a whole has been implemented by the chinese government yu et al 2019 therefore how to scientifically evaluate the impact of the project on the hydrological cycle would also be an important issue to address constructing a distributed eco hydrological model to solve the impact of vegetation changes on water storage will be the next problem we have to solve 5 conclusions this study identified the trend of divergent changes in water bodies during recent decades and their driving factors in a high latitude water tower based on these findings the following conclusions can be drawn 1 there was a significant trend of divergent changes in water bodies in the high latitude water tower during recent decades with a significant increase in surface water area and a significant decrease in water storage 2 the strong increase in water use was the dominant factor causing the divergent trends of water bodies in tr changes in water bodies in the other two basins were all the result of the combined effects of climate change and anthropogenic activities 3 it is worth mentioning that snowpack had an important influence on the change of water storage in the high latitude water tower 4 we innovatively found that the enhanced interactivity of the driving factors was the deep seated reason for the divergent trend of water bodies in high latitude water tower 5 two important underlying causes of reduced water storage may be the reduced water conservation capacity due to degradation of forest wetland complex ecosystems and altered snowmelt process in the context of climate warming in
