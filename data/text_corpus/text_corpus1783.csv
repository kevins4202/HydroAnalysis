8915,promoting the reasonable allocation of evaporation e and transpiration t at a certain time scale is important for controlling the grassland desertification nevertheless evapotranspiration et and its components on a single time scale often cannot guarantee the dynamic and reasonable distribution of e and t this study quantified et and its component distribution in different time scales of the plant growing season in desert grassland ecosystems to address this contradiction further the main driving factors of et and its components at different time scales were clarified under multi factor coupling results indicated that e was the leading component of et in the ecosystem with an average t et of 39 64 the dominant factors of t et on different time scales were air temperature ta and surface temperature ts which showed significant negative correlations p 0 05 et and its components showed obvious unimodal changes at the hourly scale the peaks occurred at 12 00 14 00 and they all increased with increasing radiation ra ts ta and saturated water vapor pressure difference vpd ta was the dominant factor with a correlation coefficient of 0 76 followed by vpd ra ts at the daily scale et and its components showed clear seasonal changes et was 1 94 mm d 1and t was 0 77 mm d 1 the dominant factors were soil moisture content swc of the 0 10 cm soil layer and ts the dominant factors affecting et and its components in the early middle and late stages of growth were relative humidity rh swc and ts at the monthly scale the cumulative values of et and its components were the largest in august and the lowest in october mainly regulated by precipitation p whereas t et had no significant correlation with p the results from this study can provide a scientific basis for vegetation restoration and environmental protection in desert grassland ecological function areas keywords desert grassland time scale effect evapotranspiration transpiration dominant factor data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water shortages and low utilization efficiency have become critical problems restricting the sustainable development of the ecological environment in desert grassland ecosystems therefore grassland planting is increasingly used for environmental remediation to solve the contradiction between climate change and vegetation restoration however the imbalance between evaporation e and transpiration t in grassland would induce a lower rate of vegetation recovery ma et al 2015 liu et al 2019 generally promoting the reasonable allocation of e and t at a certain time scale is a widely adopted method to control grassland desertification jasechko et al 2013 nevertheless on a single time scale the dynamic and reasonable distribution of e and t cannot be described by evapotranspiration et and its components therefore in order to avoid the unreasonable distribution of et components at different time scales it is urgent to quantify the allocation of et components at different time scales during the growing season of desert grasslands ecosystems wang et al 2021 evaristo et al 2015 qin et al 2023 the practices of et and its components on a single time scale were investigated in the study of the caragana microphylla lam community in the horqin grassland the daily trends of t and et were very similar with average values of 1 61 mm d 1 and 2 43 mm d 1 respectively and the daily t et was ranged from 56 to 72 qi et al 2019 a study of shrublands and grasslands by moran et al 2009 showed that the daily t et was approximately 64 and 79 respectively in a study of subtropical artificial forests et had clear seasonal variation accounting for 80 of the total annual precipitation and the daily t et was approximately 85 melanie et al 2018 moreover in a study of savannahs the annual t et was approximately 70 liu et al 2021 meanwhile the dominant influencing factors of et and its components are also different at various time scales solar radiation is the most important factor affecting et segmentation at the daily scale the changes of temperature vapor pressure difference and relative humidity caused by solar radiation and the changes of stomatal conductance under the interaction with vegetation are also important factors affecting daily et segmentation scott et al 2016 kustas et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 wang et al 2013 mcadam and brodibb 2014 hu et al 2014 on a seasonal scale et segmentation is primarily related to the phenological characteristics of plants the leaf area index and vegetation cover are the most important factors affecting et segmentation and environmental factors such as precipitation temperature and soil texture affecting plant growth and evaporative water consumption thus also affect et segmentation rigden et al 2018 wei et al 2017 scott et al 2017 sun et al 2019 when discussing the influence of various factors on et segmentation current studies usually focus on a single factor ignoring the effect of the interaction among influencing factors on et segmentation the effect of each factor on et segmentation is usually reflected at more than a single time scale for example the growth status of vegetation can not only divide et by the difference in stomatal conductance on a daily scale but also affect the consequence of et segmentation at the seasonal scale recently the affect factors of et and its components were only investigated on a single time scale therefore studying the distribution of et components and their driving forces at the hourly daily and monthly scales has important theoretical and practical significance for digging the impact of the scale effect on plant habitat and regional environmentally sustainable development the overarching purpose of this study was to obtain information on et and its components and driving factors at various time scales in desert grasslands the specific goals were 1 to quantify the allocation of et components at different time scales during the growing season of desert grasslands ecosystems and 2 to identify the dominant factors of et and its components at different time scales 2 study site materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the study was conducted in 2018 and 2019 at the yinshanbeilu grassland eco hydrology national observation and research station located in the yinshan mountains inner mongolia china altitude approximately 1600 m above sea level 41 12 10 n 111 13 01 e fig 1 the experimental site had typical grassland features and a medium temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is approximately 282 mm the mean air temperature is 2 5 c and the mean annual wind speed is 4 5 m s 1 the annual water surface evaporation is 2305 mm in 2018 and 2019 reference crop evapotranspiration eto showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the growth period with a significant decrease in eto when precipitation was high fig 2 the soils in the experimental site are chestnut soil due to differences in topography parent material water conditions saline alkali soil and aeolian sand soil are formed in some areas the soil organic matter content was 1 2 the total soil nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were 0 1 0 15 0 08 0 15 and 2 2 5 respectively and the soil ph was in range of 8 8 5 land use was dominated by grazing grassland overload in grazing areas was a serious concern and moderate to severe degradation had been widespread here krylov needlegrass was the typical grassland group species in this area and the common species used were artemisia frigida willd leymus chinensis trin tzvel and agropyron cristatum l gaertn the vegetation was low and sparse the average height of normal vegetation was 30 50 cm the coverage was in range of 25 45 miao et al 2022 and the dry matter mass of the sample was 100 200 g m 2 the growth periods of the plants in this study were divided into early april 1 to may 31 middle june 1 to august 31 and late stage september 1 to october 31 2 2 data observation 2 2 1 meteorological measurement the meteorological observation instrument was installed at a height of 3 5 m and mainly temperature and humidity sensors hmp45c vasisla helsinki finland were included which were used to observe ta and rh in addition ra was observed by four channel net radiation sensors ts was observed by an infrared radiometer si 111 campbell scientific inc usa and the soil water content swc at depths of 0 10 cm was measured a tipping bucket rain gauge was used to measure precipitation p te525ws campbell scientific inc usa and stored after calculating the average value for 30 min from 8 00 18 00 the saturated water vapor pressure difference vpd was calculated using eq 1 evaristo et al 2015 1 vpd 1 rh 100 0 611 e 17 502 t a t a 240 97 where vpd kpa is the water vapor pressure difference rh is the relative humidity and ta c is the air temperature 2 2 2 et measurement the eddy covariance system with an installation height of 3 5 m measured et continuously the prevailing wind direction at the experimental site was northwest the system mainly consists of a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer csat 3 campbell scientific logan ut usa an infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li corinc usa integrate short and longwave radiation in one sensor nr lite campbell scientific two soil heat flux plates which were buried about 10 cm below the ground surface hfp01 campbell scientific the data acquisition cr3000 campbell scientific was at a frequency of 10 hz with a measurement step of 30 min 8 00 18 00 raw data from the eddy covariance system were processed using eddypro 4 0 0 software li cor inc lincoln ne usa including outlier removal delay time correction quadratic axis rotation frequency response correction and water vapor density correction when the combined percentage of missing measurements and rejected outliers exceeded 10 of the total data volume of the variables required for the flux calculation the flux values for that half hour were eliminated han et al 2022 in the 30 min flux time series the liner interpolation method is used to supplement the missing data within the interval of less than or equal to 2 h jia et al 2016 the latent heat flux le is calculated from the covariance between the vertical wind speed and the water vapor concentration as shown in eq 2 2 le ρ c p w q where le represents the latent heat flux w m 2 ρ represents the air density kg m 3 cp represents the specific heat of air at constant pressure kj kg k 1 and w and q represent the pulsations of the vertical wind speed and water vapor content respectively energy balance closure analysis of the eddy covariance system is one of the main methods for analyzing the reliability of flux data the energy balance ratio ebr was determined using eq 3 3 ebr le h r n g 100 where ebr denotes the energy closure h denotes the sensible heat flux w m 2 g denotes the soil heat flux w m 2 and rn denotes the net radiation w m 2 the ebr in daytime during the study period 2018 2019 was approximately 91 2 fig 3 which was higher than that of other desert grassland sparse vegetation substrates wilson et al 2002 2 2 3 soil evaporation measurement the micro evaporator was cut from pvc pipes and made into two hollow cylindrical barrels one barrel had an outer diameter of 11 cm and a height of 15 cm serving as the inner barrel while the other barrel needed to have a slightly larger outer diameter and a consistent height serving as the outer barrel the outer cylinder was fixed in the bare soil and the surface was flush with the soil the inner cylinder was taken from the original soil and the inner cylinder was sealed at the bottom with a nylon gauze net and plastic film the micro evapotranspiration meter was replaced with soil after precipitation che et al 2022 within the monitoring area of the eddy covariance system a 5 m 5 m sample plot was randomly selected in each of the four directions with the flux tower as the center point and a micro evapotranspiration meter was installed the inner barrel of micro evaporation meter was removed and weighed every hour from 8 00 18 00 using an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0 01 g soil evaporation was determined using eq 4 4 e n 1 4 10 m s al where en mm is the daily or hourly e from different surface soils al cm2 is the area of the micro evapotranspiration meter and ms g is the change of water storage in the micro evapotranspiration meter 2 2 4 transpiration in arid and semi arid regions there is only a small amount of canopy interception and canopy evaporation accounts for a low proportion of evapotranspiration which can be ignored liu et al 2022 ji et al 2016 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 therefore et is mostly used as a dual source plant transpiration t and soil evaporation e structure in the study of et in grassland ecosystems in the northern part of the yinshan mountain transpiration was determined using eq 5 5 t et e where t is plant transpiration mm 2 3 data statistics and analysis linear regression exponential analysis and second order polynomial analysis were used to analyze the responses of et e and t to environmental factors owing to the low temperature at night et was low or close to 0 therefore only data on environmental factors et and its components during the day 8 00 18 00 were used the software of excel 2021 and origin 2022 were used to analyze the data 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of et and its components in desert grassland plants at different scales 3 1 1 hourly scale characteristics of et and its components the et e t and t et of the corresponding periods for each day of the growing seasons of desert grassland plants in 2018 and 2019 were averaged to obtain the characteristics of et and its components for each growing period of plants fig 4 et e and t have the same variation trends on the hourly scale showing obvious unimodal variation characteristics low values of et e and t were occurred near sunrise and at sunset however the maximum values of et e and t occurred at different times due to the differences in meteorological conditions among the growth periods the peaks of et e and t occurred between 12 00 and 14 00 and were in range of 1 70 3 20 mm 1 02 1 94 mm and 0 68 1 26 mm during the early middle and late stages respectively in different growth periods t et showed different changing rules in different time periods in the early stage of plant growth t et reached a maximum value 40 34 at around 8 00 9 00 then gradually decreased with time reaching a minimum value 39 72 at 16 00 and increasing again at 18 00 this may be due to a slight increase in rh between 16 00 and 18 00 resulting in a slight increase in t et at the middle stage of plant growth t et gradually decreased with time ranging from 39 24 to 39 82 at the later stage of plant growth t et tended to decrease with time however there were slight fluctuations during the period 39 63 40 44 reaching a minimum value at around 18 00 at this time due to the closure of plant stomata caused by solar radiation transpiration was weakened evaporation was enhanced and t et showed a downward trend good et al 2014 it is indicated that rh could increase t et to a certain extent when solar illumination was insufficient the hourly scale variation of et and its components in different growing periods of desert grassland plants before and after 3 4 days of precipitation are shown in fig 5 a f et and its components significantly changed before and after precipitation intraday peaks of et e and t in early 2018 increased rapidly from 3 53 mm 2 14 mm and 1 40 mm on april 19 to 8 41 mm 5 05 mm and 3 37 mm on april 20 all the increase rates were about 136 the peak values of et e and t in the middle period increased sharply from 4 96 3 02 and 1 94 mm on august 3 to 16 34 9 95 and 6 40 mm on august 5 the peaks of et e and t in the later period increased sharply from 1 45 mm 0 87 and 0 58 mm on september 24 to 23 82 14 21 and 9 62 mm on september 27 additionally compared with no rainfall the peak time of et e and t will be delayed 1 2 h after a precipitation event the intraday variation pattern of et and its components before and after precipitation in 2019 was similar to that of 2018 it is indicted that with the increase of soil moisture after precipitation the root system absorbed adequate soil water which increase t et under typical precipitation conditions the minimum t et appeared earlier than that under non precipitation conditions meanwhile in the early growth stage the peak value of t et under precipitation increased from 39 88 to 40 71 compared with non precipitation condition while in the middle and late growth stage the peak value of t et under precipitation decreased from 39 50 and 40 90 to 39 40 and 40 32 compared with non precipitation condition respectively e accounted for a large proportion of the et for desert grassland vegetation in arid and semiarid deserts the variation in et and its components largely depended on the degree of soil surface moisture therefore precipitation strongly influenced the et distribution jiao et al 2018 because of the low degree of shade in grassland ecosystems less solar radiation is intercepted by the canopy a large portion of solar radiation reaches the bare ground directly and e accounts for a larger proportion of et therefore when the surface soil moisture content is low e significantly changes after precipitation and et increases previous studies have also indicated that e could reach 80 of et after precipitation and e significantly decreased on about the fifth day after rainfall yunusa et al 1997 zhang et al 2008 table 1 3 1 2 daily scale characteristics of et and its components the average daily et and its components of desert grassland plants during the different growing periods in 2018 and 2019 are presented in table 2 the daily variation in et and its components over the entire growth period is shown in fig 6 et and its components showed clear seasonal variation characteristics throughout the growing season the daily et ranged from 0 05 to 6 90 mm d 1 the mean et during the two year growing season was 351 76 mm and the average daily et was 1 94 mm d 1 the mean daily et was 2 08 mm d 1 during the rainy season and 1 91 mm d 1 during the dry season t and e accounted for 40 09 and 59 91 of the total et respectively e was the dominant et of desert grassland plants and the fluctuation of e was large ranging from 0 001 to 4 18 mm d 1 whereas the fluctuation of t was low ranging from 0 002 to 2 71 mm d 1 throughout the growing season t et showed a unimodal variation with the growing season with a trend of first decreasing and then increasing however the variation was slight with a mean variation in range of 39 34 40 14 as the plants growing the area of the bare soil surface gradually decreased and t et gradually decreased reaching the lowest value at the middle of growth mid july during early growth stage the average daily t et was 39 94 in 2018 and 2019 however the average daily t et was 39 34 and 39 43 in mid growth stage and 40 14 and 39 98 in late growth stage in 2018 and 2019 respectively pervious study has been indicated that tropical rainforests had the highest t et values 70 followed by temperate deciduous forests 67 boreal forests 65 savannas 62 temperate steppes 57 temperate coniferous forests 55 and arid deserts 54 with relatively low t et values in siberian steppes 48 and mediterranean shrublands 47 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wei et al 2021 our results indicated that this desert grassland ecosystem had a growing season t et average of 39 64 the soil water in the ecosystem was consumed by e which was the largest component of the ecosystem and drove the water cycle of the ecosystem 3 1 3 monthly scale characteristics of et and its components as shown in fig 7 and table 3 the cumulative monthly values of et and its components first increased and then decreased from april to october in 2018 and 2019 in october the two year minimum cumulative value of et e and t averages were 19 92 11 89 and 8 03 mm respectively the maximum cumulative value occurred in august and the average two year maximum values of et e and t were 106 02 65 32 and 42 53 mm respectively the cumulative values in the remaining months were between 24 01 and 75 27 mm 16 14 and 45 29 mm 10 86 and 30 54 mm respectively rainfall was concentrated in july and august for both years and et p showed an overall increase and then a decrease et p was relatively low in july and august with two year average values of 2 32 and 2 48 respectively et p values were relatively large in june and october with two year average values of 7 27 and 8 02 respectively and between 3 41 and 5 66 in the other months throughout the growing season t et decreased with increasing rainfall and temperature from april to october and monthly t et was below 50 presenting the minimum values of 39 28 and 39 30 in july in 2018 and 2019 respectively in the late growing season t et reached a maximum of 40 36 and 40 31 respectively the results indicated that et and its components in this ecosystem were severely water limited most of et at the beginning of the growing season was due to come from precipitation during the non growing season which represented the hysteresis effect of precipitation the monthly et p value of the desert steppe ecosystem in the yinshanbeilu grassland was much higher than that of terrestrial ecosystems on a global scale because the degree of water restriction in this ecosystem is higher than that in other non arid ecosystems oki and kanae 2006 maxwell and condon 2016 3 2 analysis of the driving forces of et components of desert grassland plants at different time scales 3 2 1 hourly scale dominant factor as shown in figs 4 8 and 9 a the changes in et e and t gradually increased with increasing of ra ts ta vpd and p at the hourly scale with a significant positive correlation p 0 05 the e et had best agreement with the change trend of ta with a correlation coefficient of 0 76 followed by vpd ra ts with correlation coefficients of 0 66 0 65 and 0 64 respectively the changes in et e and t decreased with an increase in swc showing a significant negative correlation p 0 05 and the correlation coefficient was 0 61 however there was no significant correlation between rh and ws the dynamics of intraday hourly scale variation of et and its components showed that e was significantly greater than t throughout the plant reproductive period similar results were obtained by wang et al 2018 in an arid semi arid grassland region e accounted for a large proportion in the composition of et which is mainly affected by environmental factors in the soil vegetation atmosphere system ta and vpd reflected to some extent the ease of water entry into the atmosphere and correlated well with the et and its components at hourly time scales the results indicated that as a source of et energy ra induced stomatal opening and closing determined the variation of ta and vpd and was a determinant of et and its components on an hourly time scale t et and swc were positively correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0 85 p 0 05 however with the increase in ta ts and vpd t et and swc showed a decreasing trend presenting a significant negative correlation p 0 05 ta had the best correlation with ts with the correlation coefficients of 0 99 and 0 95 followed by vpd with the correlation coefficient of 0 88 t et and swc were not significantly correlated with p ra ws or rh whereas t et was negatively correlated with et and its components granier et al 1996 also showed that ra was one of the most important factors affecting et and its components and ra affected the variation of et and its components by changing vpd and ta zhang et al 2009 also reported that the combined influence of hourly temperature and humidity could increase the vpd between the inside and outside of plant leaves and the soil which was conducive to the escape of water and intensified et 3 2 2 daily scale dominant factor the average daily variation of environmental factors in the desert grassland during the 2018 and 2019 plant growing seasons is shown in fig 10 there were no significant differences in the observations for each environmental factor or extreme weather as shown in fig 6 figs 9 b and 10 et e and t increased with an increase in swc ta ts ra and rh at the daily scale with a significant positive correlation p 0 05 the correlation between swc and ts was the best with correlation coefficients above 0 41 followed by ta rh ra et and its components decreased with increasing of ws with a significantly negative correlation p 0 05 correlation coefficient of 0 23 however no significant correlation was found between p and vpd t et was significantly and negatively correlated with ta ts vpd ra et and its components t et had best correlations with ta and ts with correlation coefficients of 0 91 and 0 90 respectively followed by vpd correlation coefficient of 0 62 it was positively and significantly correlated with ws and swc but not with rh and p t is supplied by soil moisture throughout the plant rhizosphere at the same time e is mainly controlled by soil moisture in the surface layer 0 10 cm zhang et al 2023 and the e et decreases with a reduction in soil surface water content however the relationship between e et and surface soil water content is also complicated and is related to ground cover tiffany et al 2020 also showed that swc significantly influenced daily et and its components for desert grassland plants the driving effects of environmental factors on daily et and its components varied during the different growth periods fig 11 at the early stage of plant growth et and its components increased with increasing of rh et and its components were significantly and positively correlated p 0 05 with rh correlation coefficients 0 24 moreover et and its components were not significantly correlated with other factors t et was significantly positively correlated p 0 05 with rh and scw correlation coefficients were 0 56 and 0 27 respectively and negatively correlated with ra ts ta and vpd correlation coefficients were 0 39 0 78 0 94 and 0 84 respectively there was less precipitation during the early stage of plant growth and the plant coverage was low therefore under the conditions of stronger radiation t et reached the peak of the whole growth period and decreased slowly in a wave pattern thereafter wang et al 2010 et and its components reached their highest values of 2 26 and 2 42 mm in mid growth stage in 2018 and 2019 respectively in late growth and early growth stage their highest values were 1 30 and 1 21 mm and 1 52 and 1 21 mm respectively et and its components increased with increasing of rh ra and scw meanwhile et and its components were significantly and positively correlated p 0 05 with rh ra and scw in the early growth stage in particular et and its components had the best correlation with scw with a correlation coefficient above 0 44 et and its components were negatively correlated with ws and vpd t et was significantly negatively correlated with ts ta and vpd with correlation coefficients of 0 51 0 56 and 0 27 respectively since middle stage of plant growth the precipitation net radiation and ecosystem temperature had increased a significant increase in daily et occurred the daily et was the larger from july to august with an average daily et of 2 26 and 2 42 mm on the one hand the environmental factors affecting plant evapotranspiration such as net radiation temperature and rainfall were relatively high on the other hand because this is the main growth period of grassland the biological life activities of the ecosystem are vigorous and the water consumption of plants in the ecosystem is high with the increase in plant leaves and rainfall e and t reached their peak values but the increase in e was larger than that in t and t et reached its minimum value scott et al 2017 sun et al 2019 in the late growing season et and its components increased with increasing of ra ts ta swc and vpd also et and its components had a significantly positive correlation p 0 05 with ra ts ta swc and vpd among which the correlation with ts was the best followed by ta with correlation coefficients of 0 66 and 0 59 respectively meanwhile et and t showed a significant positive correlation however e was not significantly correlated with p rh or ws t et was positively and significantly correlated with ws p 0 05 and negatively correlated with ra ta ts and vpd t et had best correlation with ta and ts correlation coefficients of 0 79 and 0 77 respectively followed by vpd and ra however t et had no significant correlation with rh p and swc at the end of september the minimum values of e and t were 0 001 and 0 002 mm d 1 respectively the temperature was low and the vegetation had entered the wilting stage guo et al 2010 chen et al 2020 the trend of et changes in the whole growth period were basically synchronized with precipitation for example the cumulative precipitation was 32 7 mm on august 4 5 2018 and the mean daily et value ranged from 2 42 mm d 1 on the 3rd day before the precipitation period to 3 99 mm d 1 after precipitation the cumulative precipitation from august 4 7 in 2019 was 60 7 mm the mean et at daily scale within 3 days after the precipitation increased sharply from 1 05 mm d 1 before the precipitation period to 3 42 mm d 1 the maximum values of e and t both appeared around august 10 with the values of 4 18 mm d 1 and 2 71 mm d 1 respectively meanwhile the temperature and swc were higher when e and t reached the maximum the accumulated precipitation was 32 7 and 60 7 mm on august 4 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the vegetation was gradually restored in arid and high temperature environments increasing the degree of stomatal openness of vegetation and enhancing the water consumption capacity deng et al 2021 3 2 3 monthly scale dominant factor as shown in figs 7 and 12 et and its components increased with the increase of rh ts ta and p et and its components showed a significant positive correlation p 0 05 with rh ts ta and p among which the correlation with rh and p was the best with correlation coefficients above 0 71 followed by ts and ta there was a significant negative correlation p 0 05 between et e t and ws with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0 63 but et e t had no significant correlation with ra and vpd t et was significantly and negatively correlated with ta ts ra and vpd p 0 05 with correlation coefficients of 0 99 0 98 0 72 and 0 61 respectively during the whole growing season e was the dominant component of et in desert grassland ecosystems when the daily time scale was extended to the monthly scale t et decreased with the increase of rainfall and temperature in april october the monthly t et was lower than 50 and presented the minimum value in july which was 39 28 and 39 30 respectively at this time precipitation and temperature were relatively high and p significantly increased e but not t therefore t et was lower than that in other months in the late growing season the precipitation and temperature were relatively low t et reached the maximum value of 40 36 and 40 31 respectively and plants began to wilt and decline in the later growth stage the t decreased but the plant ensured similar water use capacity under drought and wet conditions by regulating its physiological processes that is t remained at a high value compared with other months jiao et al 2018 guo et al 2010 4 conclusions this study comprehensively analyzed the et and its components the change characteristics of t et and the response to environmental factors at different time scales of desert grassland ecosystems as a result the following primary conclusions were obtained 1 at the hourly daily and monthly scales e was the dominant component of et in desert grassland ecosystems and t et had a significantly negative correlation p 0 05 with ta and ts with correlation coefficients above 0 9 followed by vpd with correlation coefficients above 0 6 2 at the hourly scale et and its components showed unimodal changes reaching a peak around 12 00 14 00 and the peak of plant et and its components before and after rainfall changed greatly the main driving factor was ta with a correlation coefficient of 0 76 followed by vpd ra ts t et varied at different times of the day reaching a maximum value 40 34 around 8 00 9 00 3 at the daily scale et and its components showed clear obvious seasonal variation with et of 1 94 mm d 1 et of 2 08 mm d 1 in the rainy season and et of 1 91 mm d 1 in the dry season with swc and ts as the dominant factors the driving effects of environmental factors on daily et and its components were various at different growth stages the dominant factors at the early middle and late stages were rh swc and ts respectively t et changed unimodally with the growing season ranging from 39 34 to 40 14 presenting the lowest value in the middle of growth mid july 4 at the monthly scale the monthly cumulative value of et and its components in the growing season first increased and then decreased et and its components were the lowest in october and the highest in august et and its components were significantly and positively correlated with rh ts ta and p p 0 05 the main driving factors were rh and p p significantly increased e correlation coefficient above 0 71 while p was not significantly correlated with t credit authorship contribution statement xin han methodology data curation writing original draft funding acquisition baozhong

its components on a single time scale often cannot guarantee the dynamic and reasonable distribution of e and t this study quantified et and its component distribution in different time scales of the plant growing season in desert grassland ecosystems to address this contradiction further the main driving factors of et and its components at different time scales were clarified under multi factor coupling results indicated that e was the leading component of et in the ecosystem with an average t et of 39 64 the dominant factors of t et on different time scales were air temperature ta and surface temperature ts which showed significant negative correlations p 0 05 et and its components showed obvious unimodal changes at the hourly scale the peaks occurred at 12 00 14 00 and they all increased with increasing radiation ra ts ta and saturated water vapor pressure difference vpd ta was the dominant factor with a correlation coefficient of 0 76 followed by vpd ra ts at the daily scale et and its components showed clear seasonal changes et was 1 94 mm d 1and t was 0 77 mm d 1 the dominant factors were soil moisture content swc of the 0 10 cm soil layer and ts the dominant factors affecting et and its components in the early middle and late stages of growth were relative humidity rh swc and ts at the monthly scale the cumulative values of et and its components were the largest in august and the lowest in october mainly regulated by precipitation p whereas t et had no significant correlation with p the results from this study can provide a scientific basis for vegetation restoration and environmental protection in desert grassland ecological function areas keywords desert grassland time scale effect evapotranspiration transpiration dominant factor data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction water shortages and low utilization efficiency have become critical problems restricting the sustainable development of the ecological environment in desert grassland ecosystems therefore grassland planting is increasingly used for environmental remediation to solve the contradiction between climate change and vegetation restoration however the imbalance between evaporation e and transpiration t in grassland would induce a lower rate of vegetation recovery ma et al 2015 liu et al 2019 generally promoting the reasonable allocation of e and t at a certain time scale is a widely adopted method to control grassland desertification jasechko et al 2013 nevertheless on a single time scale the dynamic and reasonable distribution of e and t cannot be described by evapotranspiration et and its components therefore in order to avoid the unreasonable distribution of et components at different time scales it is urgent to quantify the allocation of et components at different time scales during the growing season of desert grasslands ecosystems wang et al 2021 evaristo et al 2015 qin et al 2023 the practices of et and its components on a single time scale were investigated in the study of the caragana microphylla lam community in the horqin grassland the daily trends of t and et were very similar with average values of 1 61 mm d 1 and 2 43 mm d 1 respectively and the daily t et was ranged from 56 to 72 qi et al 2019 a study of shrublands and grasslands by moran et al 2009 showed that the daily t et was approximately 64 and 79 respectively in a study of subtropical artificial forests et had clear seasonal variation accounting for 80 of the total annual precipitation and the daily t et was approximately 85 melanie et al 2018 moreover in a study of savannahs the annual t et was approximately 70 liu et al 2021 meanwhile the dominant influencing factors of et and its components are also different at various time scales solar radiation is the most important factor affecting et segmentation at the daily scale the changes of temperature vapor pressure difference and relative humidity caused by solar radiation and the changes of stomatal conductance under the interaction with vegetation are also important factors affecting daily et segmentation scott et al 2016 kustas et al 2019 zhu et al 2015 wang et al 2013 mcadam and brodibb 2014 hu et al 2014 on a seasonal scale et segmentation is primarily related to the phenological characteristics of plants the leaf area index and vegetation cover are the most important factors affecting et segmentation and environmental factors such as precipitation temperature and soil texture affecting plant growth and evaporative water consumption thus also affect et segmentation rigden et al 2018 wei et al 2017 scott et al 2017 sun et al 2019 when discussing the influence of various factors on et segmentation current studies usually focus on a single factor ignoring the effect of the interaction among influencing factors on et segmentation the effect of each factor on et segmentation is usually reflected at more than a single time scale for example the growth status of vegetation can not only divide et by the difference in stomatal conductance on a daily scale but also affect the consequence of et segmentation at the seasonal scale recently the affect factors of et and its components were only investigated on a single time scale therefore studying the distribution of et components and their driving forces at the hourly daily and monthly scales has important theoretical and practical significance for digging the impact of the scale effect on plant habitat and regional environmentally sustainable development the overarching purpose of this study was to obtain information on et and its components and driving factors at various time scales in desert grasslands the specific goals were 1 to quantify the allocation of et components at different time scales during the growing season of desert grasslands ecosystems and 2 to identify the dominant factors of et and its components at different time scales 2 study site materials and methods 2 1 site descriptions the study was conducted in 2018 and 2019 at the yinshanbeilu grassland eco hydrology national observation and research station located in the yinshan mountains inner mongolia china altitude approximately 1600 m above sea level 41 12 10 n 111 13 01 e fig 1 the experimental site had typical grassland features and a medium temperate semi arid continental monsoon climate the mean annual precipitation is approximately 282 mm the mean air temperature is 2 5 c and the mean annual wind speed is 4 5 m s 1 the annual water surface evaporation is 2305 mm in 2018 and 2019 reference crop evapotranspiration eto showed a trend of first increasing and then decreasing during the growth period with a significant decrease in eto when precipitation was high fig 2 the soils in the experimental site are chestnut soil due to differences in topography parent material water conditions saline alkali soil and aeolian sand soil are formed in some areas the soil organic matter content was 1 2 the total soil nitrogen phosphorus and potassium were 0 1 0 15 0 08 0 15 and 2 2 5 respectively and the soil ph was in range of 8 8 5 land use was dominated by grazing grassland overload in grazing areas was a serious concern and moderate to severe degradation had been widespread here krylov needlegrass was the typical grassland group species in this area and the common species used were artemisia frigida willd leymus chinensis trin tzvel and agropyron cristatum l gaertn the vegetation was low and sparse the average height of normal vegetation was 30 50 cm the coverage was in range of 25 45 miao et al 2022 and the dry matter mass of the sample was 100 200 g m 2 the growth periods of the plants in this study were divided into early april 1 to may 31 middle june 1 to august 31 and late stage september 1 to october 31 2 2 data observation 2 2 1 meteorological measurement the meteorological observation instrument was installed at a height of 3 5 m and mainly temperature and humidity sensors hmp45c vasisla helsinki finland were included which were used to observe ta and rh in addition ra was observed by four channel net radiation sensors ts was observed by an infrared radiometer si 111 campbell scientific inc usa and the soil water content swc at depths of 0 10 cm was measured a tipping bucket rain gauge was used to measure precipitation p te525ws campbell scientific inc usa and stored after calculating the average value for 30 min from 8 00 18 00 the saturated water vapor pressure difference vpd was calculated using eq 1 evaristo et al 2015 1 vpd 1 rh 100 0 611 e 17 502 t a t a 240 97 where vpd kpa is the water vapor pressure difference rh is the relative humidity and ta c is the air temperature 2 2 2 et measurement the eddy covariance system with an installation height of 3 5 m measured et continuously the prevailing wind direction at the experimental site was northwest the system mainly consists of a three dimensional ultrasonic anemometer csat 3 campbell scientific logan ut usa an infrared gas analyzer li 7500 li corinc usa integrate short and longwave radiation in one sensor nr lite campbell scientific two soil heat flux plates which were buried about 10 cm below the ground surface hfp01 campbell scientific the data acquisition cr3000 campbell scientific was at a frequency of 10 hz with a measurement step of 30 min 8 00 18 00 raw data from the eddy covariance system were processed using eddypro 4 0 0 software li cor inc lincoln ne usa including outlier removal delay time correction quadratic axis rotation frequency response correction and water vapor density correction when the combined percentage of missing measurements and rejected outliers exceeded 10 of the total data volume of the variables required for the flux calculation the flux values for that half hour were eliminated han et al 2022 in the 30 min flux time series the liner interpolation method is used to supplement the missing data within the interval of less than or equal to 2 h jia et al 2016 the latent heat flux le is calculated from the covariance between the vertical wind speed and the water vapor concentration as shown in eq 2 2 le ρ c p w q where le represents the latent heat flux w m 2 ρ represents the air density kg m 3 cp represents the specific heat of air at constant pressure kj kg k 1 and w and q represent the pulsations of the vertical wind speed and water vapor content respectively energy balance closure analysis of the eddy covariance system is one of the main methods for analyzing the reliability of flux data the energy balance ratio ebr was determined using eq 3 3 ebr le h r n g 100 where ebr denotes the energy closure h denotes the sensible heat flux w m 2 g denotes the soil heat flux w m 2 and rn denotes the net radiation w m 2 the ebr in daytime during the study period 2018 2019 was approximately 91 2 fig 3 which was higher than that of other desert grassland sparse vegetation substrates wilson et al 2002 2 2 3 soil evaporation measurement the micro evaporator was cut from pvc pipes and made into two hollow cylindrical barrels one barrel had an outer diameter of 11 cm and a height of 15 cm serving as the inner barrel while the other barrel needed to have a slightly larger outer diameter and a consistent height serving as the outer barrel the outer cylinder was fixed in the bare soil and the surface was flush with the soil the inner cylinder was taken from the original soil and the inner cylinder was sealed at the bottom with a nylon gauze net and plastic film the micro evapotranspiration meter was replaced with soil after precipitation che et al 2022 within the monitoring area of the eddy covariance system a 5 m 5 m sample plot was randomly selected in each of the four directions with the flux tower as the center point and a micro evapotranspiration meter was installed the inner barrel of micro evaporation meter was removed and weighed every hour from 8 00 18 00 using an electronic balance with an accuracy of 0 01 g soil evaporation was determined using eq 4 4 e n 1 4 10 m s al where en mm is the daily or hourly e from different surface soils al cm2 is the area of the micro evapotranspiration meter and ms g is the change of water storage in the micro evapotranspiration meter 2 2 4 transpiration in arid and semi arid regions there is only a small amount of canopy interception and canopy evaporation accounts for a low proportion of evapotranspiration which can be ignored liu et al 2022 ji et al 2016 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 therefore et is mostly used as a dual source plant transpiration t and soil evaporation e structure in the study of et in grassland ecosystems in the northern part of the yinshan mountain transpiration was determined using eq 5 5 t et e where t is plant transpiration mm 2 3 data statistics and analysis linear regression exponential analysis and second order polynomial analysis were used to analyze the responses of et e and t to environmental factors owing to the low temperature at night et was low or close to 0 therefore only data on environmental factors et and its components during the day 8 00 18 00 were used the software of excel 2021 and origin 2022 were used to analyze the data 3 results and discussion 3 1 characteristics of et and its components in desert grassland plants at different scales 3 1 1 hourly scale characteristics of et and its components the et e t and t et of the corresponding periods for each day of the growing seasons of desert grassland plants in 2018 and 2019 were averaged to obtain the characteristics of et and its components for each growing period of plants fig 4 et e and t have the same variation trends on the hourly scale showing obvious unimodal variation characteristics low values of et e and t were occurred near sunrise and at sunset however the maximum values of et e and t occurred at different times due to the differences in meteorological conditions among the growth periods the peaks of et e and t occurred between 12 00 and 14 00 and were in range of 1 70 3 20 mm 1 02 1 94 mm and 0 68 1 26 mm during the early middle and late stages respectively in different growth periods t et showed different changing rules in different time periods in the early stage of plant growth t et reached a maximum value 40 34 at around 8 00 9 00 then gradually decreased with time reaching a minimum value 39 72 at 16 00 and increasing again at 18 00 this may be due to a slight increase in rh between 16 00 and 18 00 resulting in a slight increase in t et at the middle stage of plant growth t et gradually decreased with time ranging from 39 24 to 39 82 at the later stage of plant growth t et tended to decrease with time however there were slight fluctuations during the period 39 63 40 44 reaching a minimum value at around 18 00 at this time due to the closure of plant stomata caused by solar radiation transpiration was weakened evaporation was enhanced and t et showed a downward trend good et al 2014 it is indicated that rh could increase t et to a certain extent when solar illumination was insufficient the hourly scale variation of et and its components in different growing periods of desert grassland plants before and after 3 4 days of precipitation are shown in fig 5 a f et and its components significantly changed before and after precipitation intraday peaks of et e and t in early 2018 increased rapidly from 3 53 mm 2 14 mm and 1 40 mm on april 19 to 8 41 mm 5 05 mm and 3 37 mm on april 20 all the increase rates were about 136 the peak values of et e and t in the middle period increased sharply from 4 96 3 02 and 1 94 mm on august 3 to 16 34 9 95 and 6 40 mm on august 5 the peaks of et e and t in the later period increased sharply from 1 45 mm 0 87 and 0 58 mm on september 24 to 23 82 14 21 and 9 62 mm on september 27 additionally compared with no rainfall the peak time of et e and t will be delayed 1 2 h after a precipitation event the intraday variation pattern of et and its components before and after precipitation in 2019 was similar to that of 2018 it is indicted that with the increase of soil moisture after precipitation the root system absorbed adequate soil water which increase t et under typical precipitation conditions the minimum t et appeared earlier than that under non precipitation conditions meanwhile in the early growth stage the peak value of t et under precipitation increased from 39 88 to 40 71 compared with non precipitation condition while in the middle and late growth stage the peak value of t et under precipitation decreased from 39 50 and 40 90 to 39 40 and 40 32 compared with non precipitation condition respectively e accounted for a large proportion of the et for desert grassland vegetation in arid and semiarid deserts the variation in et and its components largely depended on the degree of soil surface moisture therefore precipitation strongly influenced the et distribution jiao et al 2018 because of the low degree of shade in grassland ecosystems less solar radiation is intercepted by the canopy a large portion of solar radiation reaches the bare ground directly and e accounts for a larger proportion of et therefore when the surface soil moisture content is low e significantly changes after precipitation and et increases previous studies have also indicated that e could reach 80 of et after precipitation and e significantly decreased on about the fifth day after rainfall yunusa et al 1997 zhang et al 2008 table 1 3 1 2 daily scale characteristics of et and its components the average daily et and its components of desert grassland plants during the different growing periods in 2018 and 2019 are presented in table 2 the daily variation in et and its components over the entire growth period is shown in fig 6 et and its components showed clear seasonal variation characteristics throughout the growing season the daily et ranged from 0 05 to 6 90 mm d 1 the mean et during the two year growing season was 351 76 mm and the average daily et was 1 94 mm d 1 the mean daily et was 2 08 mm d 1 during the rainy season and 1 91 mm d 1 during the dry season t and e accounted for 40 09 and 59 91 of the total et respectively e was the dominant et of desert grassland plants and the fluctuation of e was large ranging from 0 001 to 4 18 mm d 1 whereas the fluctuation of t was low ranging from 0 002 to 2 71 mm d 1 throughout the growing season t et showed a unimodal variation with the growing season with a trend of first decreasing and then increasing however the variation was slight with a mean variation in range of 39 34 40 14 as the plants growing the area of the bare soil surface gradually decreased and t et gradually decreased reaching the lowest value at the middle of growth mid july during early growth stage the average daily t et was 39 94 in 2018 and 2019 however the average daily t et was 39 34 and 39 43 in mid growth stage and 40 14 and 39 98 in late growth stage in 2018 and 2019 respectively pervious study has been indicated that tropical rainforests had the highest t et values 70 followed by temperate deciduous forests 67 boreal forests 65 savannas 62 temperate steppes 57 temperate coniferous forests 55 and arid deserts 54 with relatively low t et values in siberian steppes 48 and mediterranean shrublands 47 schlesinger and jasechko 2014 wei et al 2021 our results indicated that this desert grassland ecosystem had a growing season t et average of 39 64 the soil water in the ecosystem was consumed by e which was the largest component of the ecosystem and drove the water cycle of the ecosystem 3 1 3 monthly scale characteristics of et and its components as shown in fig 7 and table 3 the cumulative monthly values of et and its components first increased and then decreased from april to october in 2018 and 2019 in october the two year minimum cumulative value of et e and t averages were 19 92 11 89 and 8 03 mm respectively the maximum cumulative value occurred in august and the average two year maximum values of et e and t were 106 02 65 32 and 42 53 mm respectively the cumulative values in the remaining months were between 24 01 and 75 27 mm 16 14 and 45 29 mm 10 86 and 30 54 mm respectively rainfall was concentrated in july and august for both years and et p showed an overall increase and then a decrease et p was relatively low in july and august with two year average values of 2 32 and 2 48 respectively et p values were relatively large in june and october with two year average values of 7 27 and 8 02 respectively and between 3 41 and 5 66 in the other months throughout the growing season t et decreased with increasing rainfall and temperature from april to october and monthly t et was below 50 presenting the minimum values of 39 28 and 39 30 in july in 2018 and 2019 respectively in the late growing season t et reached a maximum of 40 36 and 40 31 respectively the results indicated that et and its components in this ecosystem were severely water limited most of et at the beginning of the growing season was due to come from precipitation during the non growing season which represented the hysteresis effect of precipitation the monthly et p value of the desert steppe ecosystem in the yinshanbeilu grassland was much higher than that of terrestrial ecosystems on a global scale because the degree of water restriction in this ecosystem is higher than that in other non arid ecosystems oki and kanae 2006 maxwell and condon 2016 3 2 analysis of the driving forces of et components of desert grassland plants at different time scales 3 2 1 hourly scale dominant factor as shown in figs 4 8 and 9 a the changes in et e and t gradually increased with increasing of ra ts ta vpd and p at the hourly scale with a significant positive correlation p 0 05 the e et had best agreement with the change trend of ta with a correlation coefficient of 0 76 followed by vpd ra ts with correlation coefficients of 0 66 0 65 and 0 64 respectively the changes in et e and t decreased with an increase in swc showing a significant negative correlation p 0 05 and the correlation coefficient was 0 61 however there was no significant correlation between rh and ws the dynamics of intraday hourly scale variation of et and its components showed that e was significantly greater than t throughout the plant reproductive period similar results were obtained by wang et al 2018 in an arid semi arid grassland region e accounted for a large proportion in the composition of et which is mainly affected by environmental factors in the soil vegetation atmosphere system ta and vpd reflected to some extent the ease of water entry into the atmosphere and correlated well with the et and its components at hourly time scales the results indicated that as a source of et energy ra induced stomatal opening and closing determined the variation of ta and vpd and was a determinant of et and its components on an hourly time scale t et and swc were positively correlated with a correlation coefficient of 0 85 p 0 05 however with the increase in ta ts and vpd t et and swc showed a decreasing trend presenting a significant negative correlation p 0 05 ta had the best correlation with ts with the correlation coefficients of 0 99 and 0 95 followed by vpd with the correlation coefficient of 0 88 t et and swc were not significantly correlated with p ra ws or rh whereas t et was negatively correlated with et and its components granier et al 1996 also showed that ra was one of the most important factors affecting et and its components and ra affected the variation of et and its components by changing vpd and ta zhang et al 2009 also reported that the combined influence of hourly temperature and humidity could increase the vpd between the inside and outside of plant leaves and the soil which was conducive to the escape of water and intensified et 3 2 2 daily scale dominant factor the average daily variation of environmental factors in the desert grassland during the 2018 and 2019 plant growing seasons is shown in fig 10 there were no significant differences in the observations for each environmental factor or extreme weather as shown in fig 6 figs 9 b and 10 et e and t increased with an increase in swc ta ts ra and rh at the daily scale with a significant positive correlation p 0 05 the correlation between swc and ts was the best with correlation coefficients above 0 41 followed by ta rh ra et and its components decreased with increasing of ws with a significantly negative correlation p 0 05 correlation coefficient of 0 23 however no significant correlation was found between p and vpd t et was significantly and negatively correlated with ta ts vpd ra et and its components t et had best correlations with ta and ts with correlation coefficients of 0 91 and 0 90 respectively followed by vpd correlation coefficient of 0 62 it was positively and significantly correlated with ws and swc but not with rh and p t is supplied by soil moisture throughout the plant rhizosphere at the same time e is mainly controlled by soil moisture in the surface layer 0 10 cm zhang et al 2023 and the e et decreases with a reduction in soil surface water content however the relationship between e et and surface soil water content is also complicated and is related to ground cover tiffany et al 2020 also showed that swc significantly influenced daily et and its components for desert grassland plants the driving effects of environmental factors on daily et and its components varied during the different growth periods fig 11 at the early stage of plant growth et and its components increased with increasing of rh et and its components were significantly and positively correlated p 0 05 with rh correlation coefficients 0 24 moreover et and its components were not significantly correlated with other factors t et was significantly positively correlated p 0 05 with rh and scw correlation coefficients were 0 56 and 0 27 respectively and negatively correlated with ra ts ta and vpd correlation coefficients were 0 39 0 78 0 94 and 0 84 respectively there was less precipitation during the early stage of plant growth and the plant coverage was low therefore under the conditions of stronger radiation t et reached the peak of the whole growth period and decreased slowly in a wave pattern thereafter wang et al 2010 et and its components reached their highest values of 2 26 and 2 42 mm in mid growth stage in 2018 and 2019 respectively in late growth and early growth stage their highest values were 1 30 and 1 21 mm and 1 52 and 1 21 mm respectively et and its components increased with increasing of rh ra and scw meanwhile et and its components were significantly and positively correlated p 0 05 with rh ra and scw in the early growth stage in particular et and its components had the best correlation with scw with a correlation coefficient above 0 44 et and its components were negatively correlated with ws and vpd t et was significantly negatively correlated with ts ta and vpd with correlation coefficients of 0 51 0 56 and 0 27 respectively since middle stage of plant growth the precipitation net radiation and ecosystem temperature had increased a significant increase in daily et occurred the daily et was the larger from july to august with an average daily et of 2 26 and 2 42 mm on the one hand the environmental factors affecting plant evapotranspiration such as net radiation temperature and rainfall were relatively high on the other hand because this is the main growth period of grassland the biological life activities of the ecosystem are vigorous and the water consumption of plants in the ecosystem is high with the increase in plant leaves and rainfall e and t reached their peak values but the increase in e was larger than that in t and t et reached its minimum value scott et al 2017 sun et al 2019 in the late growing season et and its components increased with increasing of ra ts ta swc and vpd also et and its components had a significantly positive correlation p 0 05 with ra ts ta swc and vpd among which the correlation with ts was the best followed by ta with correlation coefficients of 0 66 and 0 59 respectively meanwhile et and t showed a significant positive correlation however e was not significantly correlated with p rh or ws t et was positively and significantly correlated with ws p 0 05 and negatively correlated with ra ta ts and vpd t et had best correlation with ta and ts correlation coefficients of 0 79 and 0 77 respectively followed by vpd and ra however t et had no significant correlation with rh p and swc at the end of september the minimum values of e and t were 0 001 and 0 002 mm d 1 respectively the temperature was low and the vegetation had entered the wilting stage guo et al 2010 chen et al 2020 the trend of et changes in the whole growth period were basically synchronized with precipitation for example the cumulative precipitation was 32 7 mm on august 4 5 2018 and the mean daily et value ranged from 2 42 mm d 1 on the 3rd day before the precipitation period to 3 99 mm d 1 after precipitation the cumulative precipitation from august 4 7 in 2019 was 60 7 mm the mean et at daily scale within 3 days after the precipitation increased sharply from 1 05 mm d 1 before the precipitation period to 3 42 mm d 1 the maximum values of e and t both appeared around august 10 with the values of 4 18 mm d 1 and 2 71 mm d 1 respectively meanwhile the temperature and swc were higher when e and t reached the maximum the accumulated precipitation was 32 7 and 60 7 mm on august 4 6 in 2018 and 2019 respectively the vegetation was gradually restored in arid and high temperature environments increasing the degree of stomatal openness of vegetation and enhancing the water consumption capacity deng et al 2021 3 2 3 monthly scale dominant factor as shown in figs 7 and 12 et and its components increased with the increase of rh ts ta and p et and its components showed a significant positive correlation p 0 05 with rh ts ta and p among which the correlation with rh and p was the best with correlation coefficients above 0 71 followed by ts and ta there was a significant negative correlation p 0 05 between et e t and ws with a correlation coefficient of approximately 0 63 but et e t had no significant correlation with ra and vpd t et was significantly and negatively correlated with ta ts ra and vpd p 0 05 with correlation coefficients of 0 99 0 98 0 72 and 0 61 respectively during the whole growing season e was the dominant component of et in desert grassland ecosystems when the daily time scale was extended to the monthly scale t et decreased with the increase of rainfall and temperature in april october the monthly t et was lower than 50 and presented the minimum value in july which was 39 28 and 39 30 respectively at this time precipitation and temperature were relatively high and p significantly increased e but not t therefore t et was lower than that in other months in the late growing season the precipitation and temperature were relatively low t et reached the maximum value of 40 36 and 40 31 respectively and plants began to wilt and decline in the later growth stage the t decreased but the plant ensured similar water use capacity under drought and wet conditions by regulating its physiological processes that is t remained at a high value compared with other months jiao et al 2018 guo et al 2010 4 conclusions this study comprehensively analyzed the et and its components the change characteristics of t et and the response to environmental factors at different time scales of desert grassland ecosystems as a result the following primary conclusions were obtained 1 at the hourly daily and monthly scales e was the dominant component of et in desert grassland ecosystems and t et had a significantly negative correlation p 0 05 with ta and ts with correlation coefficients above 0 9 followed by vpd with correlation coefficients above 0 6 2 at the hourly scale et and its components showed unimodal changes reaching a peak around 12 00 14 00 and the peak of plant et and its components before and after rainfall changed greatly the main driving factor was ta with a correlation coefficient of 0 76 followed by vpd ra ts t et varied at different times of the day reaching a maximum value 40 34 around 8 00 9 00 3 at the daily scale et and its components showed clear obvious seasonal variation with et of 1 94 mm d 1 et of 2 08 mm d 1 in the rainy season and et of 1 91 mm d 1 in the dry season with swc and ts as the dominant factors the driving effects of environmental factors on daily et and its components were various at different growth stages the dominant factors at the early middle and late stages were rh swc and ts respectively t et changed unimodally with the growing season ranging from 39 34 to 40 14 presenting the lowest value in the middle of growth mid july 4 at the monthly scale the monthly cumulative value of et and its components in the growing season first increased and then decreased et and its components were the lowest in october and the highest in august et and its components were significantly and positively correlated with rh ts ta and p p 0 05 the main driving factors were rh and p p significantly increased e correlation coefficient above 0 71 while p was not significantly correlated with t credit authorship contribution statement xin han methodology data curation writing original draft funding acquisition baozhong

8916,to explore the feasibility of water saving irrigation measures based on long term positioning experiments on winter wheat triticum aestivum l under different irrigation and nitrogen application treatments the main factors influencing the effect of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage on yield increase were explored in gaocheng and qingyuan china the experiment was designed as a split plot arrangement with the irrigation type as the main plot and nitrogen application rate as the sub plots the irrigation treatments consisted of two levels based on the amount of irrigation 60 mm at the jointing stage w1 and 60 mm at the jointing and anthesis stages respectively w2 the nitrogen treatments consisted of three levels 0 n0 120 n120 and 240 kg ha 1 n240 over time the soil organic matter and total nitrogen content of n0 decreased significantly resulting in a gradual increase in the difference between the yield increase effect of n0 and that of the nitrogen application treatment the effect of supplementary irrigation on winter wheat yield at the anthesis stage was significantly affected by soil water storage sws before sowing the smaller the soil water storage before sowing the larger the yield increase ratio with supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage the yield increase due to supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage was also affected by precipitation during the winter wheat growth period particularly from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage when the precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage was 31 9 mm the yield increase from supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage was significant the results indicated that in the case of sufficient sws before sowing 31 9 mm of precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage could be used as a reference value for irrigation at the anthesis stage keywords soil water storage irrigation strategies nitrogen grain yield precipitation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction irrigated areas with growing water shortages comprise half of global wheat production ramírez rodrigues et al 2016 the north china plain is one of the most important areas for wheat production in china it produces more than 70 of winter wheat with 25 of the nation s arable land nbsc 2019 the typical cropping system is a winter wheat and summer maize double cropping system and the lack of water resources is the main limiting factor for high and stable yields of winter wheat affected by the monsoon climate 70 of the precipitation in the north china plain is distributed in the summer maize season from june to september while the average precipitation in the winter wheat season is only approximately 100 mm which is much lower than the water consumption of 400 mm during the growth period of winter wheat jia et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 to overcome the difficulty of insufficient precipitation 70 of irrigation water needs to come from groundwater niu et al 2019 therefore the continuous decline in the groundwater level has become an important environmental problem that threatens the sustainable development of agriculture yang et al 2019 the formulation of a water saving irrigation scheme is very important to completely solve the water shortage problem zhang et al 2020 the efficient utilization of the summer precipitation stored in the soil before wheat sowing natural precipitation coinciding with wheat growth and the reduction of irrigation water use are important challenges to be addressed for water saving cultivation technology of winter wheat the amount of soil moisture before sowing plays an important role in wheat yield and sufficient soil moisture can significantly improve the yield of winter wheat li et al 2005 however soil moisture is not the only factor that determines wheat yields it is difficult to achieve a high yield without irrigation or precipitation some studies have shown that at a certain growth stage a moderate water deficit does not cause crop yield reduction but significantly improves water use efficiency wang et al 2018a 2018b xu et al 2018 combined with appropriate agronomic measures deficit irrigation can achieve coordinated improvement in yield and water use efficiency while saving water polania et al 2016 farmers in the north china plain usually irrigate winter wheat three or four times per season zhang et al 2017 in order to deal with the necessity of multiple instances of irrigation large amount of irrigation needed and low water use efficiency of winter wheat in the traditional production mode of the north china plain a large number of theoretical and technical studies on water saving irrigation have been carried out for many years fessehazion et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the spring filling irrigation twice mode is widely accepted and popularized because it takes into account both saving water and obtaining a high yield liu et al 2020 this irrigation mode means that based on sufficient moisture sowing crops are irrigated twice with water at the jointing and anthesis stages and the amount of irrigation is determined according to the seedling and moisture level required xu et al 2018 by reducing the number of instances and amount of irrigation especially in the growth stage that is less sensitive to drought irrigation water consumption can be reduced without significantly reducing yield chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 geerts and raes 2009 however the groundwater level in the north china plain has continued to decline resulting in a series of ecological and geological disasters in recent years therefore the management of groundwater exploitation will be stricter and the establishment of a more water saving irrigation technology system is urgently needed to ensure a high and stable yield of wheat further reducing the amount of irrigation needed before the jointing period of winter wheat the climate in the north china plain is dry and windy with less precipitation and high ground evaporation jointing is the key stage of water demand for winter wheat because it grows rapidly has a large water demand and is very sensitive to soil water content kibe et al 2006 therefore irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat is necessary to ensure its growth and development at this time the irrigation effect is optimal and there is little room for regulation after the jointing stage of winter wheat precipitation increases gradually leaving more room for the regulation of irrigation at the anthesis stage therefore reducing irrigation at the anthesis stage is of great significance for reducing total irrigation improving water use efficiency and alleviating the decline in groundwater level however systematic long term research is rare in this study the field test results of two experimental stations in the north china plain were analyzed the study aimed to 1 evaluate the effects of nitrogen application level soil water storage sws and precipitation on the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage and 2 explore the dividing line of precipitation for the yield increase ratio the results proved the yield increasing effect and influencing factors of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage of winter wheat and provided a theoretical basis for water saving and high yield technology of winter wheat in the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment was conducted at two experimental stations of hebei agricultural university in hebei province china these stations were established in qingyuan and gaocheng respectively the north china plain where the two experimental stations are located has a semi arid monsoon climate with 70 of the annual rainfall occurring from july to september qingyuan is located at 38 47 n latitude and 115 33 e longitude with an average elevation of 19 m annual temperature of 12 c accumulated sunshine hours of 2558 h and average annual precipitation of 451 mm the location of gaocheng is 38 00 n latitude and 114 50 e longitude with an average elevation of 50 m annual temperature of 12 5 c annual accumulated sunshine hours of 2711 4 h and average annual precipitation of 494 mm this area has a typical double cropping system for winter wheat and summer maize a meteorological station for collecting data was built near the experimental station the precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat is shown in table 1 the properties of the 0 20 cm soil were measured before winter wheat sowing at the start of the experiment table 2 2 2 experimental design the experiment was a 2 3 two irrigation levels and three nitrogen application levels design with six treatment combinations which were replicated thrice the experiment was designed as a split plot arrangement with irrigation amount as the main plot 30 17 m and nitrogen application rate as the sub plot 15 17 m the irrigation treatments comprised two levels based on the irrigation amount 60 mm at the jointing stage w1 60 mm at the jointing and anthesis stage respectively w2 the nitrogen treatments consisted of three levels 0 n0 120 n120 and 240 kg ha 1 n240 a distance of 1 m was maintained between each main plot to prevent mutual interference a water meter was used to accurately control the amount of irrigation and groundwater was used for flood irrigation after the maize harvest in october crushed straw was plowed into the soil the field was leveled before sowing to ensure uniform irrigation chemical fertilizer of 59 kg ha 1 phosphorus and 125 kg ha 1 potassium was applied before sowing each year nitrogen fertilizer urea ch4n2o at w1 and w2 was applied half before sowing and half at the jointing stage the total amount of nitrogen fertilizer in w0 was applied before sowing after fertilization the field was rotated with a tractor drawn rotary cultivator two or three times a local winter wheat cultivar gaoyou 2018 was sown with a tractor drawn seed drill at a seed rate of 150 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 15 cm during the growth season in qingyuan seeds were sown on 2015 10 12 2016 10 5 2017 10 30 2018 10 15 2019 10 6 and 2020 10 5 and were harvested on 2016 6 12 2017 6 9 2018 6 8 2019 6 8 2020 6 7 and 2021 6 6 respectively in gaocheng seeds were sown on 2016 10 5 2017 10 5 2018 10 5 2019 10 7 and 2020 10 8 and were harvested on 2017 6 6 2018 6 4 2019 6 5 2020 6 4 and 2021 6 4 respectively pests diseases and weeds were controlled in accordance with local agricultural production measures 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 measurement of sws crop evapotranspiration soil samples n 3 per replicate plot for each treatment were collected by drilling in a 0 200 cm soil layer with 20 cm sections wang et al 2015 the soil samples were placed in aluminum specimen boxes and dried to a constant weight at 105 c soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method gardner 1986 1 soil water content wet soil mass dry soil mass dry soil mass 100 sws was calculated as follows 2 sws mm soil water content soil bulk density soil depth 10 eta was calculated as follows peng et al 2020 3 eta i p swd r cr d where eta is seasonal crop evapotranspiration mm i is irrigation mm swd is sws mm at the time of sowing minus that at maturity for the 0 200 cm depth r is the surface runoff mm cr is the capillary rise to the root zone and d is drainage from the root zone r was considered negligible because it was blocked by the boundary dikes around each plot because the groundwater table was 4 m below the ground surface cr and d were also considered to be negligible fang et al 2018 all abbreviations are presented in table s1 2 3 2 measurement of soil organic matter and total nitrogen soil samples n 3 per replicate plot for each treatment were collected by drilling in a 0 20 cm soil layer before sowing the three soil samples were evenly mixed and screened with a 2 mm screen to remove miscellaneous roots plant residues and stones soil organic matter som was measured using the k2cr2o7 oxidation method li et al 2021 soil total nitrogen stn was analyzed using the semi kjeldahl method li et al 2021 2 3 3 grain yield and water productivity at maturity grain yield was calculated based on 3 m2 harvest areas in each plot and reported on a 12 5 wet basis wang 2017 yr was calculated using the following equation 4 yr yw2 yw1 yw1 100 where yr is the yield increase ratio yw1 is the grain yield kg ha 1 of w1 and yw2 is the grain yield kg ha 1 of w2 wp was calculated using the following equation 5 wp y eta where wp is the water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 and y is the grain yield kg ha 1 2 4 statistical analysis all original data were assembled and analyzed and all figures were drawn using excel 2016 all statistical tests were conducted using spss software version 19 0 spss chicago illinois usa a four way anova model was used to analyze the effects of site season irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage and storage precipitation pearson s correlation coefficients were used to analyze the relationships between grain yield water consumption and wp the least significant difference lsd test was used to compare the differences between the means of these parameters at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 multifactorial anova analysis the yield increase ratio was affected by six sources of variation except for the site si nitrogen application rate n interaction in addition to the yield increase ratio other indices were assessed using four factor analysis of variance table 3 the effects of si season se irrigation amount w and nitrogen application rate n on yield were highly significant p 0 001 similar results were observed for the som and stn contents but they were not affected by w there were six types of two factor mutual interactions and their effects on each index were different yield was affected by five types of two factor mutual interactions except for si w three types of two factor mutual interactions affected som and stn si se si n and se n the effects of si w n and si se w n were not significant for all indices in addition si se w and se w n had significant effects on the yield and si se n had a significant impact on all indices 3 2 grain yield during all growing seasons the yield of w2 under the different nitrogen application treatments was higher than that of w1 indicating that supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage had a clear yield promoting effect fig 1 over the experimental years although the difference in yield between w2 and w1 changed the yield of w2 was always higher than that of w1 the yield difference between w1 and w2 without nitrogen application did not disappear with passing years indicating that the lack of soil nitrogen in the short term 5 6 years did not have a significant impact on yield in addition the yield increased significantly with the increasing nitrogen application rate and over time the difference between the different nitrogen application treatments intensified indicating that soil nitrogen deficiency significantly reduced the yield 3 3 effect of nitrogen application rate on yield increase the yield increase due to supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage of winter wheat varied significantly from year to year at both sites the maximum value in gaocheng was 30 9 for n240 during 2020 2021 whereas that in qingyuan was 43 3 for n120 during the same growing season fig 2 the minimum value in gaocheng was 1 6 for n0 during 2017 2018 whereas that in qingyuan was 1 9 for n0 during the same growing season the nitrogen application rate also had a significant effect on the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage in most growing seasons the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation increased with increasing nitrogen application rates and the interannual variation trends of the different nitrogen application treatments were the same 3 4 interannual variation of som and stn the annual changes in som and stn contents in the plow layer under different nitrogen application treatments are shown in figs 3 and 4 over time the som and stn contents of n0 compared to those of n120 and n240 gradually decreased indicating that soil fertility decreased significantly the decrease in nitrogen application reduced the crop yield decreased the biomass and amount of straw returned to the field and finally led to a lower supplementation of som the som and stn of n120 also decreased slightly but the soil fertility remained high which met the needs of wheat growth 3 5 analysis of the yield increase ratio the yield increase ratio analysis was based on combined data from the two sites 3 5 1 effect of water storage on the yield increase ratio there was a significant negative correlation between water storage in the 2 m soil body before sowing and the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage fig 5a the larger the water storage the smaller the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage when the water storage was 470 mm the yield increase ratio was 20 or 30 however when water storage was 500 mm the yield increase ratio decreased to 4 the results indicate that in the case of sufficient sws the amount of irrigation should be reduced appropriately at the anthesis stage 3 5 2 effect of precipitation on the yield increase ratio the average precipitation during the growth period was 100 mm which did not meet the growth requirements of winter wheat fig 5b precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat was significantly and negatively correlated with the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation during the anthesis stage when precipitation was 100 mm the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage reached 40 when precipitation during the winter wheat growth period reached 250 mm the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage was 5 precipitation from jointing to anthesis was significantly and negatively correlated with the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage fig 5c when precipitation was low the yield increase ratio decreased significantly with an increase in precipitation when more precipitation occurred the yield increase ratio decreased slightly the calculation results showed that the intersection of the two regression lines was 31 9 6 2 indicating that when the precipitation from jointing to anthesis was 31 9 mm the yield increase effect of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage was significant when the precipitation was 31 9 mm the effect of supplementary irrigation on yield increase at the anthesis stage was not significant decreasing from an average value of 22 2 precipitation 31 9 mm to an average value of 4 precipitation 31 9 mm the precipitation from anthesis to maturity was negatively correlated with the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage however this was not significant fig 5d the above results show that more precipitation after anthesis could slightly alleviate the soil water deficit at the late growth stage but this was not significant compared with the precipitation from jointing to anthesis 3 6 yield water consumption and wp of the two irrigation modes when the precipitation from jointing to anthesis was 31 9 mm using 2018 2019 as an example there was no difference in the yield of n0 under the different irrigation modes whereas the yields of n240 and n120 in the w2 mode were significantly higher than those in the w1 mode table 4 the consumption of soil water in w2 decreased significantly due to an increase in irrigation water the three nitrogen application treatments in gaocheng under the w1 irrigation mode were higher than those under the w2 irrigation mode in qingyuan the results of the other treatments were similar to those in gaocheng except that the difference between w1n0 and w2n240 was not significant in contrast to soil water consumption the total water consumption of wheat at each nitrogen application level in w2 was significantly higher than that in w1 the increase in irrigation led to an increase in the wheat population and late ripening which in turn led to an increase in total water consumption as the increase in water consumption in w2 did not produce a corresponding increase in yield the wp of each nitrogen application treatment in w1 was either higher or significantly higher than that in w2 the effective utilization of soil water storage is an efficient method for improving the wp of winter wheat correlation analysis table 5 showed that grain yield was significantly positively correlated with soil water consumption p 0 05 and wp p 0 01 and positively correlated with total water consumption however this correlation was not significant soil water consumption was significantly negatively correlated with total water consumption p 0 01 and significantly positively correlated with wp p 0 01 total water consumption was negatively correlated with wp however this correlation was not significant 4 discussion under the current water shortage conditions improving the utilization rate of sws is an effective measure for water saving cultivation reducing the amount of irrigation can improve the sws utilization rate a study in the north china plain showed that irrigation before sowing made the field capacity of 200 cm soil reach 85 no irrigation during wheat growth which can also achieve a higher yield and substantially improve the water saving potential sun et al 2019 although the results required more appropriate rainfall they demonstrated the importance of soil water storage before sowing sws before sowing which depends on irrigation and precipitation in spring can meet the water demand of wheat to a certain extent therefore the level of sws is likely to have an impact on the effects of irrigation and precipitation sowing winter wheat with sufficient sws can significantly improve the yield and wp blum 2009 li et al 2005 reported that given sufficient sws 75 mm irrigation at the jointing and anthesis stages can yield 7500 kg ha 1 and high wp this study showed that the yield increase ratio caused by irrigation at the anthesis stage of winter wheat decreased with an increase in sws at 0 2 m before sowing this declining trend was more considerable in the sws range of 480 500 mm in general an increase in sws reduces the demand for wheat irrigation water thus reducing the yield increase effect of irrigation in contrast when sws is insufficient the demand for irrigation water increases to offset the impact of the water deficit irrigation at the anthesis stage significantly improved the yield precipitation also played an important role in this process the main sources of soil water before winter wheat sowing were basic sws summer precipitation residues and irrigation an increase or decrease in any of the three components sws irrigation and precipitation affects the yield increase effect of the other factors which is a trade off process the amount of stored soil water directly affects the water consumption structure of wheat under sufficient sws conditions the total water consumption of winter wheat increases significantly in this case the water consumption is mainly soil water followed by precipitation and irrigation ma et al 2013 under rainfed conditions sws plays a greater role turner et al 2014 however it should be noted that the sws before sowing is not the only determinant of wheat yield achieving a high yield is difficult if spring time supplementary irrigation is not timely or appropriate even under sufficient sws sowing conditions the yield of wheat without irrigation in spring was significantly lower than that with irrigation li et al 2010 although high yields can be achieved without irrigation during the entire growth period higher precipitation is also an important reason for high yields sun et al 2019 the scientific and coordinated application of water and nitrogen fertilizers can achieve the optimal effect boost the benefit of water and nitrogen coupling effect and maximize wheat yield and water and nitrogen utilization efficiency appropriate water content can significantly improve nitrogen use efficiency whereas excessive irrigation and drought can limit fertilizer efficiency zhang et al 2018 sufficient nitrogen supply can allow crops to fully absorb water and give full play to the yield increase effect of irrigation wang et al 2018a 2018b rasmussen et al 2015 reported that when the nitrogen application rate was increased from 20 to 150 kg ha 1 it promoted the growth of wheat roots in the soil layer below 50 cm and increased the absorption of sws by the plants li et al 2023 reported that when the amount of irrigation was increased from 0 to 1200 m3 ha 1 without nitrogen application the yield increase ratio was only 32 7 whereas when nitrogen was applied at 240 kg ha 1 the yield increase ratio increased to 43 8 in the present study the grain yield of the n0 group decreased over cultivation years although the biomass also decreased the nitrogen removed by the crops under n0 treatment was much higher than that in the natural supply the soil remained in a deficit state for a long time and the soil nitrogen content was gradually exhausted because the nitrogen supply was not meeting the crop demand the yield increase effect of irrigation at the anthesis stage was seriously restricted after the fourth or fifth year of the experiment the difference between the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage without nitrogen application gradually increased there are two main reasons for the decrease in the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation due to insufficient soil nitrogen supply capacity 1 inadequate soil nitrogen supply capacity reduces the germination rate of wheat and causes population reduction and 2 inadequate soil nitrogen supply capacity leads to poor development of wheat weak plants weak photosynthetic capacity and small organs leading to low water transport efficiency turner 2004 wang et al 2018a 2018b irrigation and precipitation are the main methods used to replenish soil water both precipitation and irrigation meet the growth requirements of crops and compensate for each other early research found that not all precipitation can effectively supplement crop water demand therefore the concept of effective precipitation was proposed that is precipitation that can steadily increase soil relative humidity dougherty et al 1996 however some studies have shown that small precipitation events should not be ignored as they also play an important role in agricultural ecosystems lauenroth and bradford 2012 petrie et al 2015 sala and lauenroth 1982 therefore all precipitation events in this study were considered available precipitation precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat affects irrigation wei et al 2018 the critical period of water demand is the period that is most sensitive to water shortages during crop growth although drought in most growth periods leads to crop yield reduction the degree of yield reduction caused by drought varies in different periods the jointing stage of winter wheat is the key stage of ear development and is sensitive to water shortages the north china plain is dry with less rain from the overwintering to jointing stages therefore irrigation at the jointing stage is a necessary safeguard measure to meet the needs of topdressing previous studies have shown that the yield increase caused by irrigation at the jointing stage is significant ji et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the booting and anthesis stages of wheat are also key periods of water demand however the precipitation level increases gradually after the jointing stage in the north china plain therefore irrigation at the anthesis stage can be regulated to a certain extent moreover moderate drought during the anthesis stage can promote grain filling the transport and distribution of assimilates and improve the transport of nutrients from stems and leaves to the grains in the north china plain the interannual variation in precipitation and its distribution are very large during the jointing and anthesis periods of winter wheat as shown in table 6 the variation range of precipitation during the jointing and anthesis periods of winter wheat over 32 years 1990 2021 in gaocheng and qingyuan were 1 7 90 4 mm and 2 0 61 5 mm respectively with the average values of 29 2 and 25 7 mm respectively precipitation and irrigation are equivalent for crops and the amount of precipitation directly affects irrigation therefore in the present study the yield increase ratio of irrigation at the anthesis stage varied significantly in different years and by location the minimum and maximum values were 1 6 and 43 3 respectively calculation of the critical value using the double line method has been performed in many studies bai et al 2013 tang et al 2009 the critical value can be calculated using the intersection of two straight lines which is a simple and effective method there were two different linear relationships between precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage and the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage the calculated critical value was 31 9 mm slightly higher than the 32 year average of 29 3 mm and 25 7 mm in gaocheng and qingyuan respectively when the precipitation at the anthesis stage was 31 9 mm the effect of irrigation on the increase in yield was not significant which is consistent with the results of previous studies zhao et al 2020 therefore this precipitation level can be used as a criterion to determine whether to irrigate plants at the anthesis stage when the precipitation from jointing to anthesis is 31 9 mm irrigation at the anthesis stage should be avoided or reduced this can significantly reduce crop water consumption and improve the wp by ensuring high yield based on meteorological data from 32 years in the gaocheng area the precipitation between the jointing and anthesis stages was 31 9 mm during 13 years and the probability of occurrence was 40 6 in qingyuan the precipitation was 31 9 mm from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage during 12 years with a probability of occurrence of 37 5 therefore winter wheat in the north china plain could be irrigated with water 60 mm only during the jointing stage in spring which has strong practicability in some years 5 conclusions the som and stn contents in the n0 treatment decreased significantly over time resulting in insufficient soil fertility nitrogen and water had significant effects on the yield increase effect of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage in different ways sufficient soil nitrogen supply significantly improved the yield increase effect of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage of winter wheat higher pre sowing sws can reduce the yield increase effect of irrigation at the anthesis stage but effectively improves wp precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage was closely related to the yield increase caused by supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage when precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage was 31 9 mm supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage did not significantly increase the yield this demonstrates the feasibility of implementing water saving irrigation strategies and provides a basis for adjusting irrigation strategies in different years by precipitation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

8916,to explore the feasibility of water saving irrigation measures based on long term positioning experiments on winter wheat triticum aestivum l under different irrigation and nitrogen application treatments the main factors influencing the effect of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage on yield increase were explored in gaocheng and qingyuan china the experiment was designed as a split plot arrangement with the irrigation type as the main plot and nitrogen application rate as the sub plots the irrigation treatments consisted of two levels based on the amount of irrigation 60 mm at the jointing stage w1 and 60 mm at the jointing and anthesis stages respectively w2 the nitrogen treatments consisted of three levels 0 n0 120 n120 and 240 kg ha 1 n240 over time the soil organic matter and total nitrogen content of n0 decreased significantly resulting in a gradual increase in the difference between the yield increase effect of n0 and that of the nitrogen application treatment the effect of supplementary irrigation on winter wheat yield at the anthesis stage was significantly affected by soil water storage sws before sowing the smaller the soil water storage before sowing the larger the yield increase ratio with supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage the yield increase due to supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage was also affected by precipitation during the winter wheat growth period particularly from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage when the precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage was 31 9 mm the yield increase from supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage was significant the results indicated that in the case of sufficient sws before sowing 31 9 mm of precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage could be used as a reference value for irrigation at the anthesis stage keywords soil water storage irrigation strategies nitrogen grain yield precipitation data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction irrigated areas with growing water shortages comprise half of global wheat production ramírez rodrigues et al 2016 the north china plain is one of the most important areas for wheat production in china it produces more than 70 of winter wheat with 25 of the nation s arable land nbsc 2019 the typical cropping system is a winter wheat and summer maize double cropping system and the lack of water resources is the main limiting factor for high and stable yields of winter wheat affected by the monsoon climate 70 of the precipitation in the north china plain is distributed in the summer maize season from june to september while the average precipitation in the winter wheat season is only approximately 100 mm which is much lower than the water consumption of 400 mm during the growth period of winter wheat jia et al 2014 zhou et al 2018 to overcome the difficulty of insufficient precipitation 70 of irrigation water needs to come from groundwater niu et al 2019 therefore the continuous decline in the groundwater level has become an important environmental problem that threatens the sustainable development of agriculture yang et al 2019 the formulation of a water saving irrigation scheme is very important to completely solve the water shortage problem zhang et al 2020 the efficient utilization of the summer precipitation stored in the soil before wheat sowing natural precipitation coinciding with wheat growth and the reduction of irrigation water use are important challenges to be addressed for water saving cultivation technology of winter wheat the amount of soil moisture before sowing plays an important role in wheat yield and sufficient soil moisture can significantly improve the yield of winter wheat li et al 2005 however soil moisture is not the only factor that determines wheat yields it is difficult to achieve a high yield without irrigation or precipitation some studies have shown that at a certain growth stage a moderate water deficit does not cause crop yield reduction but significantly improves water use efficiency wang et al 2018a 2018b xu et al 2018 combined with appropriate agronomic measures deficit irrigation can achieve coordinated improvement in yield and water use efficiency while saving water polania et al 2016 farmers in the north china plain usually irrigate winter wheat three or four times per season zhang et al 2017 in order to deal with the necessity of multiple instances of irrigation large amount of irrigation needed and low water use efficiency of winter wheat in the traditional production mode of the north china plain a large number of theoretical and technical studies on water saving irrigation have been carried out for many years fessehazion et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the spring filling irrigation twice mode is widely accepted and popularized because it takes into account both saving water and obtaining a high yield liu et al 2020 this irrigation mode means that based on sufficient moisture sowing crops are irrigated twice with water at the jointing and anthesis stages and the amount of irrigation is determined according to the seedling and moisture level required xu et al 2018 by reducing the number of instances and amount of irrigation especially in the growth stage that is less sensitive to drought irrigation water consumption can be reduced without significantly reducing yield chartzoulakis and bertaki 2015 geerts and raes 2009 however the groundwater level in the north china plain has

water saving irrigation technology system is urgently needed to ensure a high and stable yield of wheat further reducing the amount of irrigation needed before the jointing period of winter wheat the climate in the north china plain is dry and windy with less precipitation and high ground evaporation jointing is the key stage of water demand for winter wheat because it grows rapidly has a large water demand and is very sensitive to soil water content kibe et al 2006 therefore irrigation at the jointing stage of winter wheat is necessary to ensure its growth and development at this time the irrigation effect is optimal and there is little room for regulation after the jointing stage of winter wheat precipitation increases gradually leaving more room for the regulation of irrigation at the anthesis stage therefore reducing irrigation at the anthesis stage is of great significance for reducing total irrigation improving water use efficiency and alleviating the decline in groundwater level however systematic long term research is rare in this study the field test results of two experimental stations in the north china plain were analyzed the study aimed to 1 evaluate the effects of nitrogen application level soil water storage sws and precipitation on the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage and 2 explore the dividing line of precipitation for the yield increase ratio the results proved the yield increasing effect and influencing factors of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage of winter wheat and provided a theoretical basis for water saving and high yield technology of winter wheat in the north china plain 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site a field experiment was conducted at two experimental stations of hebei agricultural university in hebei province china these stations were established in qingyuan and gaocheng respectively the north china plain where the two experimental stations are located has a semi arid monsoon climate with 70 of the annual rainfall occurring from july to september qingyuan is located at 38 47 n latitude and 115 33 e longitude with an average elevation of 19 m annual temperature of 12 c accumulated sunshine hours of 2558 h and average annual precipitation of 451 mm the location of gaocheng is 38 00 n latitude and 114 50 e longitude with an average elevation of 50 m annual temperature of 12 5 c annual accumulated sunshine hours of 2711 4 h and average annual precipitation of 494 mm this area has a typical double cropping system for winter wheat and summer maize a meteorological station for collecting data was built near the experimental station the precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat is shown in table 1 the properties of the 0 20 cm soil were measured before winter wheat sowing at the start of the experiment table 2 2 2 experimental design the experiment was a 2 3 two irrigation levels and three nitrogen application levels design with six treatment combinations which were replicated thrice the experiment was designed as a split plot arrangement with irrigation amount as the main plot 30 17 m and nitrogen application rate as the sub plot 15 17 m the irrigation treatments comprised two levels based on the irrigation amount 60 mm at the jointing stage w1 60 mm at the jointing and anthesis stage respectively w2 the nitrogen treatments consisted of three levels 0 n0 120 n120 and 240 kg ha 1 n240 a distance of 1 m was maintained between each main plot to prevent mutual interference a water meter was used to accurately control the amount of irrigation and groundwater was used for flood irrigation after the maize harvest in october crushed straw was plowed into the soil the field was leveled before sowing to ensure uniform irrigation chemical fertilizer of 59 kg ha 1 phosphorus and 125 kg ha 1 potassium was applied before sowing each year nitrogen fertilizer urea ch4n2o at w1 and w2 was applied half before sowing and half at the jointing stage the total amount of nitrogen fertilizer in w0 was applied before sowing after fertilization the field was rotated with a tractor drawn rotary cultivator two or three times a local winter wheat cultivar gaoyou 2018 was sown with a tractor drawn seed drill at a seed rate of 150 kg ha 1 with a row spacing of 15 cm during the growth season in qingyuan seeds were sown on 2015 10 12 2016 10 5 2017 10 30 2018 10 15 2019 10 6 and 2020 10 5 and were harvested on 2016 6 12 2017 6 9 2018 6 8 2019 6 8 2020 6 7 and 2021 6 6 respectively in gaocheng seeds were sown on 2016 10 5 2017 10 5 2018 10 5 2019 10 7 and 2020 10 8 and were harvested on 2017 6 6 2018 6 4 2019 6 5 2020 6 4 and 2021 6 4 respectively pests diseases and weeds were controlled in accordance with local agricultural production measures 2 3 sampling and measurement 2 3 1 measurement of sws crop evapotranspiration soil samples n 3 per replicate plot for each treatment were collected by drilling in a 0 200 cm soil layer with 20 cm sections wang et al 2015 the soil samples were placed in aluminum specimen boxes and dried to a constant weight at 105 c soil water content was determined using the gravimetric method gardner 1986 1 soil water content wet soil mass dry soil mass dry soil mass 100 sws was calculated as follows 2 sws mm soil water content soil bulk density soil depth 10 eta was calculated as follows peng et al 2020 3 eta i p swd r cr d where eta is seasonal crop evapotranspiration mm i is irrigation mm swd is sws mm at the time of sowing minus that at maturity for the 0 200 cm depth r is the surface runoff mm cr is the capillary rise to the root zone and d is drainage from the root zone r was considered negligible because it was blocked by the boundary dikes around each plot because the groundwater table was 4 m below the ground surface cr and d were also considered to be negligible fang et al 2018 all abbreviations are presented in table s1 2 3 2 measurement of soil organic matter and total nitrogen soil samples n 3 per replicate plot for each treatment were collected by drilling in a 0 20 cm soil layer before sowing the three soil samples were evenly mixed and screened with a 2 mm screen to remove miscellaneous roots plant residues and stones soil organic matter som was measured using the k2cr2o7 oxidation method li et al 2021 soil total nitrogen stn was analyzed using the semi kjeldahl method li et al 2021 2 3 3 grain yield and water productivity at maturity grain yield was calculated based on 3 m2 harvest areas in each plot and reported on a 12 5 wet basis wang 2017 yr was calculated using the following equation 4 yr yw2 yw1 yw1 100 where yr is the yield increase ratio yw1 is the grain yield kg ha 1 of w1 and yw2 is the grain yield kg ha 1 of w2 wp was calculated using the following equation 5 wp y eta where wp is the water productivity kg ha 1 mm 1 and y is the grain yield kg ha 1 2 4 statistical analysis all original data were assembled and analyzed and all figures were drawn using excel 2016 all statistical tests were conducted using spss software version 19 0 spss chicago illinois usa a four way anova model was used to analyze the effects of site season irrigation amount and nitrogen application rate linear regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage and storage precipitation pearson s correlation coefficients were used to analyze the relationships between grain yield water consumption and wp the least significant difference lsd test was used to compare the differences between the means of these parameters at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 multifactorial anova analysis the yield increase ratio was affected by six sources of variation except for the site si nitrogen application rate n interaction in addition to the yield increase ratio other indices were assessed using four factor analysis of variance table 3 the effects of si season se irrigation amount w and nitrogen application rate n on yield were highly significant p 0 001 similar results were observed for the som and stn contents but they were not affected by w there were six types of two factor mutual interactions and their effects on each index were different yield was affected by five types of two factor mutual interactions except for si w three types of two factor mutual interactions affected som and stn si se si n and se n the effects of si w n and si se w n were not significant for all indices in addition si se w and se w n had significant effects on the yield and si se n had a significant impact on all indices 3 2 grain yield during all growing seasons the yield of w2 under the different nitrogen application treatments was higher than that of w1 indicating that supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage had a clear yield promoting effect fig 1 over the experimental years although the difference in yield between w2 and w1 changed the yield of w2 was always higher than that of w1 the yield difference between w1 and w2 without nitrogen application did not disappear with passing years indicating that the lack of soil nitrogen in the short term 5 6 years did not have a significant impact on yield in addition the yield increased significantly with the increasing nitrogen application rate and over time the difference between the different nitrogen application treatments intensified indicating that soil nitrogen deficiency significantly reduced the yield 3 3 effect of nitrogen application rate on yield increase the yield increase due to supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage of winter wheat varied significantly from year to year at both sites the maximum value in gaocheng was 30 9 for n240 during 2020 2021 whereas that in qingyuan was 43 3 for n120 during the same growing season fig 2 the minimum value in gaocheng was 1 6 for n0 during 2017 2018 whereas that in qingyuan was 1 9 for n0 during the same growing season the nitrogen application rate also had a significant effect on the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage in most growing seasons the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation increased with increasing nitrogen application rates and the interannual variation trends of the different nitrogen application treatments were the same 3 4 interannual variation of som and stn the annual changes in som and stn contents in the plow layer under different nitrogen application treatments are shown in figs 3 and 4 over time the som and stn contents of n0 compared to those of n120 and n240 gradually decreased indicating that soil fertility decreased significantly the decrease in nitrogen application reduced the crop yield decreased the biomass and amount of straw returned to the field and finally led to a lower supplementation of som the som and stn of n120 also decreased slightly but the soil fertility remained high which met the needs of wheat growth 3 5 analysis of the yield increase ratio the yield increase ratio analysis was based on combined data from the two sites 3 5 1 effect of water storage on the yield increase ratio there was a significant negative correlation between water storage in the 2 m soil body before sowing and the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage fig 5a the larger the water storage the smaller the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage when the water storage was 470 mm the yield increase ratio was 20 or 30 however when water storage was 500 mm the yield increase ratio decreased to 4 the results indicate that in the case of sufficient sws the amount of irrigation should be reduced appropriately at the anthesis stage 3 5 2 effect of precipitation on the yield increase ratio the average precipitation during the growth period was 100 mm which did not meet the growth requirements of winter wheat fig 5b precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat was significantly and negatively correlated with the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation during the anthesis stage when precipitation was 100 mm the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage reached 40 when precipitation during the winter wheat growth period reached 250 mm the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage was 5 precipitation from jointing to anthesis was significantly and negatively correlated with the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage fig 5c when precipitation was low the yield increase ratio decreased significantly with an increase in precipitation when more precipitation occurred the yield increase ratio decreased slightly the calculation results showed that the intersection of the two regression lines was 31 9 6 2 indicating that when the precipitation from jointing to anthesis was 31 9 mm the yield increase effect of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage was significant when the precipitation was 31 9 mm the effect of supplementary irrigation on yield increase at the anthesis stage was not significant decreasing from an average value of 22 2 precipitation 31 9 mm to an average value of 4 precipitation 31 9 mm the precipitation from anthesis to maturity was negatively correlated with the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage however this was not significant fig 5d the above results show that more precipitation after anthesis could slightly alleviate the soil water deficit at the late growth stage but this was not significant compared with the precipitation from jointing to anthesis 3 6 yield water consumption and wp of the two irrigation modes when the precipitation from jointing to anthesis was 31 9 mm using 2018 2019 as an example there was no difference in the yield of n0 under the different irrigation modes whereas the yields of n240 and n120 in the w2 mode were significantly higher than those in the w1 mode table 4 the consumption of soil water in w2 decreased significantly due to an increase in irrigation water the three nitrogen application treatments in gaocheng under the w1 irrigation mode were higher than those under the w2 irrigation mode in qingyuan the results of the other treatments were similar to those in gaocheng except that the difference between w1n0 and w2n240 was not significant in contrast to soil water consumption the total water consumption of wheat at each nitrogen application level in w2 was significantly higher than that in w1 the increase in irrigation led to an increase in the wheat population and late ripening which in turn led to an increase in total water consumption as the increase in water consumption in w2 did not produce a corresponding increase in yield the wp of each nitrogen application treatment in w1 was either higher or significantly higher than that in w2 the effective utilization of soil water storage is an efficient method for improving the wp of winter wheat correlation analysis table 5 showed that grain yield was significantly positively correlated with soil water consumption p 0 05 and wp p 0 01 and positively correlated with total water consumption however this correlation was not significant soil water consumption was significantly negatively correlated with total water consumption p 0 01 and significantly positively correlated with wp p 0 01 total water consumption was negatively correlated with wp however this correlation was not significant 4 discussion under the current water shortage conditions improving the utilization rate of sws is an effective measure for water saving cultivation reducing the amount of irrigation can improve the sws utilization rate a study in the north china plain showed that irrigation before sowing made the field capacity of 200 cm soil reach 85 no irrigation during wheat growth which can also achieve a higher yield and substantially improve the water saving potential sun et al 2019 although the results required more appropriate rainfall they demonstrated the importance of soil water storage before sowing sws before sowing which depends on irrigation and precipitation in spring can meet the water demand of wheat to a certain extent therefore the level of sws is likely to have an impact on the effects of irrigation and precipitation sowing winter wheat with sufficient sws can significantly improve the yield and wp blum 2009 li et al 2005 reported that given sufficient sws 75 mm irrigation at the jointing and anthesis stages can yield 7500 kg ha 1 and high wp this study showed that the yield increase ratio caused by irrigation at the anthesis stage of winter wheat decreased with an increase in sws at 0 2 m before sowing this declining trend was more considerable in the sws range of 480 500 mm in general an increase in sws reduces the demand for wheat irrigation water thus reducing the yield increase effect of irrigation in contrast when sws is insufficient the demand for irrigation water increases to offset the impact of the water deficit irrigation at the anthesis stage significantly improved the yield precipitation also played an important role in this process the main sources of soil water before winter wheat sowing were basic sws summer precipitation residues and irrigation an increase or decrease in any of the three components sws irrigation and precipitation affects the yield increase effect of the other factors which is a trade off process the amount of stored soil water directly affects the water consumption structure of wheat under sufficient sws conditions the total water consumption of winter wheat increases significantly in this case the water consumption is mainly soil water followed by precipitation and irrigation ma et al 2013 under rainfed conditions sws plays a greater role turner et al 2014 however it should be noted that the sws before sowing is not the only determinant of wheat yield achieving a high yield is difficult if spring time supplementary irrigation is not timely or appropriate even under sufficient sws sowing conditions the yield of wheat without irrigation in spring was significantly lower than that with irrigation li et al 2010 although high yields can be achieved without irrigation during the entire growth period higher precipitation is also an important reason for high yields sun et al 2019 the scientific and coordinated application of water and nitrogen fertilizers can achieve the optimal effect boost the benefit of water and nitrogen coupling effect and maximize wheat yield and water and nitrogen utilization efficiency appropriate water content can significantly improve nitrogen use efficiency whereas excessive irrigation and drought can limit fertilizer efficiency zhang et al 2018 sufficient nitrogen supply can allow crops to fully absorb water and give full play to the yield increase effect of irrigation wang et al 2018a 2018b rasmussen et al 2015 reported that when the nitrogen application rate was increased from 20 to 150 kg ha 1 it promoted the growth of wheat roots in the soil layer below 50 cm and increased the absorption of sws by the plants li et al 2023 reported that when the amount of irrigation was increased from 0 to 1200 m3 ha 1 without nitrogen application the yield increase ratio was only 32 7 whereas when nitrogen was applied at 240 kg ha 1 the yield increase ratio increased to 43 8 in the present study the grain yield of the n0 group decreased over cultivation years although the biomass also decreased the nitrogen removed by the crops under n0 treatment was much higher than that in the natural supply the soil remained in a deficit state for a long time and the soil nitrogen content was gradually exhausted because the nitrogen supply was not meeting the crop demand the yield increase effect of irrigation at the anthesis stage was seriously restricted after the fourth or fifth year of the experiment the difference between the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage without nitrogen application gradually increased there are two main reasons for the decrease in the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation due to insufficient soil nitrogen supply capacity 1 inadequate soil nitrogen supply capacity reduces the germination rate of wheat and causes population reduction and 2 inadequate soil nitrogen supply capacity leads to poor development of wheat weak plants weak photosynthetic capacity and small organs leading to low water transport efficiency turner 2004 wang et al 2018a 2018b irrigation and precipitation are the main methods used to replenish soil water both precipitation and irrigation meet the growth requirements of crops and compensate for each other early research found that not all precipitation can effectively supplement crop water demand therefore the concept of effective precipitation was proposed that is precipitation that can steadily increase soil relative humidity dougherty et al 1996 however some studies have shown that small precipitation events should not be ignored as they also play an important role in agricultural ecosystems lauenroth and bradford 2012 petrie et al 2015 sala and lauenroth 1982 therefore all precipitation events in this study were considered available precipitation precipitation during the growth period of winter wheat affects irrigation wei et al 2018 the critical period of water demand is the period that is most sensitive to water shortages during crop growth although drought in most growth periods leads to crop yield reduction the degree of yield reduction caused by drought varies in different periods the jointing stage of winter wheat is the key stage of ear development and is sensitive to water shortages the north china plain is dry with less rain from the overwintering to jointing stages therefore irrigation at the jointing stage is a necessary safeguard measure to meet the needs of topdressing previous studies have shown that the yield increase caused by irrigation at the jointing stage is significant ji et al 2014 xu et al 2018 the booting and anthesis stages of wheat are also key periods of water demand however the precipitation level increases gradually after the jointing stage in the north china plain therefore irrigation at the anthesis stage can be regulated to a certain extent moreover moderate drought during the anthesis stage can promote grain filling the transport and distribution of assimilates and improve the transport of nutrients from stems and leaves to the grains in the north china plain the interannual variation in precipitation and its distribution are very large during the jointing and anthesis periods of winter wheat as shown in table 6 the variation range of precipitation during the jointing and anthesis periods of winter wheat over 32 years 1990 2021 in gaocheng and qingyuan were 1 7 90 4 mm and 2 0 61 5 mm respectively with the average values of 29 2 and 25 7 mm respectively precipitation and irrigation are equivalent for crops and the amount of precipitation directly affects irrigation therefore in the present study the yield increase ratio of irrigation at the anthesis stage varied significantly in different years and by location the minimum and maximum values were 1 6 and 43 3 respectively calculation of the critical value using the double line method has been performed in many studies bai et al 2013 tang et al 2009 the critical value can be calculated using the intersection of two straight lines which is a simple and effective method there were two different linear relationships between precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage and the yield increase ratio of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage the calculated critical value was 31 9 mm slightly higher than the 32 year average of 29 3 mm and 25 7 mm in gaocheng and qingyuan respectively when the precipitation at the anthesis stage was 31 9 mm the effect of irrigation on the increase in yield was not significant which is consistent with the results of previous studies zhao et al 2020 therefore this precipitation level can be used as a criterion to determine whether to irrigate plants at the anthesis stage when the precipitation from jointing to anthesis is 31 9 mm irrigation at the anthesis stage should be avoided or reduced this can significantly reduce crop water consumption and improve the wp by ensuring high yield based on meteorological data from 32 years in the gaocheng area the precipitation between the jointing and anthesis stages was 31 9 mm during 13 years and the probability of occurrence was 40 6 in qingyuan the precipitation was 31 9 mm from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage during 12 years with a probability of occurrence of 37 5 therefore winter wheat in the north china plain could be irrigated with water 60 mm only during the jointing stage in spring which has strong practicability in some years 5 conclusions the som and stn contents in the n0 treatment decreased significantly over time resulting in insufficient soil fertility nitrogen and water had significant effects on the yield increase effect of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage in different ways sufficient soil nitrogen supply significantly improved the yield increase effect of supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage of winter wheat higher pre sowing sws can reduce the yield increase effect of irrigation at the anthesis stage but effectively improves wp precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage was closely related to the yield increase caused by supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage when precipitation from the jointing stage to the anthesis stage was 31 9 mm supplementary irrigation at the anthesis stage did not significantly increase the yield this demonstrates the feasibility of implementing water saving irrigation strategies and provides a basis for adjusting irrigation strategies in different years by precipitation declaration of competing interest the authors declare that

8917,as a relatively successful agroforestry system whether the addition of more intercropped species in the rubber tea agroforestry system extends the benefits is still unknown but worth exploring because diverse cash crop production helps farmers resist market risks and may bring the ecological functions of rubber agroforestry systems closer to those of natural forests therefore understanding the effects of plant interspecific competition on both plants and soil with the increase in intercropped species number in such agroforestry systems is vital for the improvement of rubber tea agroforestry systems for these reasons we selected a monocultural rubber plantation rubber tea rubber orange tea and jungle like rubber tea agroforestry systems for studying plant water absorbing patterns plant water use efficiency and the nutrient status of plants and soil through stable isotope 13c 2h and 18o techniques and nutrient diagnosis c n p k ca and mg of plant organs leaves stems and roots soil and litter we found that rubber trees primarily absorbed water from deeper soil layers with increases in their intercropped species number and the formation of increasingly obvious hydrologic niche differentiation between rubber trees and the intercropped plants in addition soil nutrient status first improved but then declined with an increase in the number of intercropped species however only a slight impact was observed on the nutrient status and water use efficiency of rubber trees even in the complex rubber tea agroforestry system however the intercropped species experienced resource shortages especially p shortages since their water absorbing zones almost overlapped therefore we suggest that more diverse intercropped species compositions in rubber tea agroforestry systems would offset the intercropping benefits for both plants and soil however appropriate phosphate fertilizer application in complex agroforestry systems is necessary if the construction of high species richness rubber agroforestry systems is desired keywords agroforestry system hydrological niche nutrient diagnosis plant competition plant soil interaction stable isotopic tracer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rubber based agroforestry systems are sustainable intercropping systems where farmers grow multiple crops or livestock alongside rubber trees to improve their income and or subsistence while also reaping the subsequent ecological benefits hua et al 2021 for example developing rubber based agroforestry systems can help increase soil organic matter which is beneficial for increasing soil fertility reducing water and soil loss maintaining local climate stability and improving biodiversity chen et al 2017 in addition the yield of latex from rubber trees which is an important but scarce strategic resource crucial for making tires mats ropes and other rubber products can be greatly improved in most rubber based agroforestry systems wu et al 2016 lu 2020 the abundant agricultural products in this agroforestry system can help increase the land use rate and help improve the incomes of rubber farmers therefore rubber based agroforestry provides a solution for the already degraded lands in rubber cultivation areas and provides a way to coordinate economic development and eco environmental protection in such areas zeng et al 2021 however a serious problem in the promotion of rubber based agroforestry systems is that the management of plant interspecific competition requires proper professional knowledge and evaluation of resource dynamics and complexities one of the major challenges for rubber agroforestry systems is the root competition between rubber trees and intercropped species wu et al 2016 this competition has significant impacts on the growth and productivity of both rubber trees and other crops rubber tree roots are known to be deep and extensive while the roots of intercropped species may grow closer to the surface making them more susceptible to competition for nutrients and water yang et al 2021 to mitigate root competition several strategies can be employed such as adjusting the planting density and spacing of the trees and intercropped crops to minimize competition for resources using species that have different root systems and nutrient requirements to complement the rubber trees and pruning the shoots of intercropped crops to weaken their competitive ability feng 2007 by employing appropriate management practices it is possible to achieve a balance between rubber tree growth and productivity and the growth and productivity of intercropped species resulting in a sustainable and productive agroforestry system langenberger et al 2016 however most means of mitigating root competition do not always work and are time consuming tasks trinder et al 2013 yang et al 2021 therefore rubber based agroforestry systems require more empirical evidence from many studies instead of haphazard planting to be successful rubber based agroforestry systems have been implemented in many countries including indonesia malaysia thailand and vietnam penot et al 2017 and some suitable economic crops have been found to intercrop with rubber trees after decades of research and experimentation such as sugarcane pinto et al 2006 bananas rodrigo et al 1997 coffee and cocoa snoeck et al 2013 and tea feng 2007 in china many studies have shown that the rubber tea agroforestry system is promising guo et al 2006 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2022 for example rubber tea intercropping could improve the production of both latex and tea resulting in better economic benefits guo et al 2006 meanwhile the quality of tea is improving because the amino acid and theine contents in tea leaves increase when tea grows under shaded conditions feng 2007 compared with monocultural rubber tea plantations the rubber tea agroforestry system which is built with double row spacing technology could better coordinate light heat moisture and soil nutrients langenberger et al 2016 because the canopies of rubber and tea are at different vertical heights in such agroforestry ecosystems the plants can make full use of light and then more photosynthate can be produced feng 2007 additionally the community structure between rubber and tea can help reduce wind speed in the forest the decrease in wind speed will inevitably reduce the intensity of evaporation and transpiration increase the relative humidity and soil moisture and protect rubber trees from physical damage including broken trunks and defoliation which harm rubber growth and yield zhu et al 2019 in addition soil nutrients could increase in a rubber tea agroforestry system guo et al 2006 feng 2007 zhu et al 2019 because of the superposition of the two layers of rubber and tea the residues of the biological community such as dead branches and leaves increase therefore soil organic matter would also be improved and thus the retention of water and fertilizer within the soil would be enhanced zhu et al 2019 due to the benefits mentioned above the rubber tea agroforestry system has been extensively promoted in xishuangbanna prefecture located in southwestern china s yunnan province however the sales of natural rubber and tea were not good in recent years because of the impacts of the covid 19 epidemic some rubber plantation companies and even small rubber holders have started to intercrop diverse crops with rubber trees whether the benefits of rubber tea intercropping as one of the relatively successful agroforestry systems could be improved further by the addition of more species is a question worth exploring species richness is crucial in designing and managing rubber agroforestry systems hua et al 2021 it contributes to ecosystem stability and function improves agricultural productivity supports biodiversity conservation helps the ecosystem adapt to climate change impacts provides economic and social benefits and enhances cultural and spiritual values beukema et al 2007 warren thomas et al 2020 zaro et al 2020 huang et al 2022 therefore considering and managing species richness is essential for achieving environmental sustainability increasing productivity and promoting socioeconomic development in rubber agroforestry systems however interspecific competition is still a major challenge in this agroforestry system yang et al 2021 for example during the pronounced dry season late march to mid may in xishuangbanna rubber trees undergo leaf flushing leaf expansion and the flowering period this period is also known as the golden season for spring tea production which implies that rubber trees and tea trees need sufficiently abundant water and nutrients for growth during this period if strong competition occurs resulting from the addition of more intercropped species the spring tea quality and yield and the latex yield of rubber trees may also decline therefore improving the understanding of the water and nutrient competition among species in diverse rubber tea agroforestry systems is vital for the sustainable management of high diversity agroforestry systems however reports on interspecific water and nutrient competition root interactions and how these processes affect the aboveground ecophysiological functions of plants are still rare song et al 2022 generally roots are the main plant organ used for both water and nutrient absorption and thus overlapping rhizosphere soil becomes the main place of belowground competition among different plant species isaac and borden 2019 therefore any physiological and ecological changes in plant roots such as growth development and distribution are closely related to the competitive uptake of the belowground resources however the belowground parts and processes of plants that are not visible such as root activity root distribution in the soil profile belowground nutrient interactions among plant species and nutrient element movement characteristics are difficult to determine thus root research on multiple species is very difficult especially in terms of absorbing roots stable isotope tracers can be used to study plant resource use by analyzing the isotopic signatures of the consumer and diets dawson et al 2002 this method would be useful for studying plant belowground competition trinder et al 2013 with improvements in measurement techniques and analysis methods for stable isotopes the use of stable isotope methods is increasingly accepted by researchers worldwide phillips et al 2014 water as the most necessary resource for plants and its movements and variations in soil plants and the atmosphere have been widely explored through 2h and 18o isotopes and using both 2h and 18o isotopes to trace plant water sources has become the industry standard as it is a convenient quantitative precise and nondestructive method dawson et al 2002 because soil water is absorbed primarily through root hairs i e absorbing roots gilroy and jones 2000 it might be possible to reconstruct the distribution of plant absorbing roots by understanding plant water absorbing patterns thus we can also obtain much more important information about plant nutrient use because absorbable forms of nutrients for plants mainly exist in soil solution and root hairs absorb the majority of nutrients from soil solutions gilroy and jones 2000 in brief detecting dynamic variations in root hair distribution in plant communities through stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes tracers helps us better understand belowground competition dynamics to help improve the sustainability and maximize the potential of rubber tea agroforestry systems we selected a rubber monocultural plantation rm three agroforestry systems including rubber tea rt intercropping rubber orange tea rot intercropping and a complex jungle like rubber tea j rt agroforestry system a secondary forest to study plant belowground competition dynamics competition effects on plant nutrient status and plantsoil interactions at these sites we mainly applied stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope 2h and 18o techniques to study plant hydrological niche differentiation and stable carbon isotopes 13c to study plant water use efficiency wue and we measured carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k calcium ca and magnesium mg concentrations of different plant organs i e leaf stem and root litter and soil at these study sites to analyze how competition affected the nutrient status of plants and soil across the dry and rainy seasons from 2017 to 2018 previous studies showed that interspecific water competition could help improve the water use of rubber trees and enhance the water retention capacity of the soil in the rubber tea agroforestry system wu et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 however intense competition would also offset such benefits of interspecific interactions therefore we hypothesized that 1 rubber trees have a deeper water absorbing zone than the intercrops and thus form complementary plant hydrological niches among species but the hydrological niches of the intercropped species of rubber tree are compressed with an increase in intercropped plant species since rubber trees have a better developed root system 2 increasing the number of intercropped species will result in intense competition thus increasing the consumption of soil water and nutrients and the intercropping benefits for soil would therefore be offset by intense competition and 3 plant nutrient status is affected by environmental resources and the stronger competitor will exhibit a higher nutrient status than its neighboring species but intense competition will result in resource limitations and ultimately lower nutrient status for plants in multispecies agroforestry systems than in simple agroforestry systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this study was performed near menglun town 21 55 44 n 101 15 21 e located in xishuangbanna prefecture in yunnan province the rainy season november to april and dry season may to october are characteristic in this region due to the tropical monsoon this region experiences an average annual air temperature of 21 7 c and an average annual precipitation of 1475 mm it is estimated that the rainy season accounts for more than 85 of the total precipitation zhu et al 2019 in this study a monoculture rubber tree plantation rm and three agroforestry systems including rubber tea rt rubber orange tea rot and jungle like rubber tea j rt intercropping patterns were selected fig s1 each study site was equipped with a standard permanent quadrat 20 m 20 m that was used for periodic sampling in the monoculture rubber tree plantation rubber trees were arranged in 3 m wide double rows and the trees were spaced two meters apart within each row with a ten meter gap separating each pair of double rows fig s1a similarly rubber trees were planted in all agroforestry systems using the same pattern as that in monoculture rubber plantations fig s1 tea trees were arranged in 4 rows in the middle of the 10 m wide gap between the double rows of rubber trees they were spaced approximately 1 m apart within a row and rows were spaced 1 m apart in the rt agroforestry system fig s1b tea trees were also planted in four rows in the 10 m wide gap between the double rows of rubber trees in the rot agroforestry system planted rows of tea trees were separated by one row of orange trees the orange trees were spaced two meters apart which divided the planted rows of tea trees into two parts each part contained two rows of tea trees and the intervals between the orange row and tea row were approximately 2 m see fig s1c in the j rt agroforestry system tea trees were planted only in two rows in the middle of the 10 m wide gap between rows of rubber trees similar to rt and rot see fig s1d the other species in the j rt agroforestry system were distributed naturally plantations of rubber trees were established in approximately 1990 and tea and orange trees were intercropped with rubber trees in 2004 since 2005 the j rt agroforestry system has been an abandoned rt agroforestry system with ongoing secondary succession species other than rubber trees and tea trees are naturally found during secondary succession these species were divided into three groups tree species ficus langkokensis litsea panamonja small tree or shrub species camellia sinensis alchornea davidi rauvolfia verticillata and herbs pteridrys cnemidaria adiantum capillus veneris dicliptera chinensis pseuderanthemum polyanthum indosasa hispida it is worth mentioning that bamboo indosasa hispida grew densely and could be seen everywhere in the j rt agroforestry system commonly approximately 1 kg compound fertilizer of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium urea potassium chloride and superphosphate would be applied in the middle of each two rubber trees in the monocultural rubber plantation in the middle of march and september feng 2007 however no fertilizer was applied in the rubber agroforestry systems during the study period in this study even in the permanent quadrat of the rubber monoculture which had a history of fertilization no fertilizer was applied during the study period in the established quadrat the slope aspect was 97 105 degrees and the slope gradient was approximately 23 degrees the rubber tree clone was rrim600 2 2 sampling a total of sixteen 5 m 5 m blocks were created for the 20 m 20 m study quadrat fig s1 and four of them were selected randomly for soil samplings at each sampling time in each sampling block soil from 0 to 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 50 cm 50 75 cm and 75 105 cm depths was sampled with an earth boring auger it is necessary to explain that we took soil samples at those six different soil layers with larger intervals between layers at greater depths this is because our previous experiments have shown that the soil profile in these study sites exhibits large vertical variations in physicochemical properties in the shallow soil layers while the differences in deep soil are relatively small a small amount of soil from different soil layers was collected in a 15 ml screw top glass vial which was sealed with parafilm and placed in a freezer at 20 c an approximately 80 g portion of soil was placed in a plastic ziplock bag to measure the soil water content and a final portion was analyzed for soil nutrients to sample the xylem of rubber trees four individuals were randomly selected an increment borer was used to collect samples from the trunk xylem of rubber trees at a height of 1 2 m in addition we sampled the shoots of the small tree and shrub species and the taproot of herb species removing their green tissues to obtain xylem each species was sampled three to four times to obtain enough xylem samples and then the xylem samples were collected in 15 ml glass vials immediately covered with parafilm and stored in a freezer at 20 c leaf and stem samples were collected at the same time as xylem sampling shoots were collected using a 10 m tree pruner and then the leaves and stems of the shoots were stored separately in different envelopes in addition the lateral roots of trees and shrubs from the soil at a depth of 0 10 cm were sampled and the entire root networks of herb species were sampled the main consideration of such sampling of plant roots is to minimize the impacts on plant growth and ensure sustainable sampling after being collected the roots were thoroughly rinsed using purified water and then dried in an oven to constant weight moreover litter was collected in each quadrat in an s shaped pattern and a total of four packs of litter were collected we cleaned and packed the litter samples in dry cotton cloth and then dried them in an oven to constant weight we sampled four times during the dry season november 13 2017 january 15 2018 february 5 2018 and march 15 2018 and three times during the rainy season may 14 2018 july 12 2018 and september 25 2018 therefore for nutrient analysis we obtained 84 plant samples 1 3 4 7 one plant species three organs four repeats and seven sampling times from the rubber monoculture 168 plant samples 2 3 4 7 two plant species three organs four repeats and seven sampling times from the rubber tea agroforestry system 252 plant samples 3 3 4 7 three plant species three organs four repeats and seven sampling times from the rubber orange tea agroforestry system and 420 plant samples from the jungle like rubber tea agroforestry system therefore we obtained a total of 924 plant samples for plant nutrient analysis in addition we sampled soil from six soil layers four times on each sampling day thus we obtained 168 soil samples 6 4 7 six soil layers four repeats and seven sampling times at each study site for a total of 672 soil samples for soil nutrient analysis 2 3 pretreatment and measuring methods an ultralow temperature liquid nitrogen 196 c vacuum distillation and extraction system was used to extract the soil and xylem water and the extracted water samples were sealed in 2 ml autosampler vials we measured the δ 2h and δ 18o values of the extracted water using a mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa for the δ 2h and δ 18o values the measurement accuracies were better than 1 and 0 1 respectively and expressed through the vienna standard mean ocean water standard soil water contents swcs were determined by the oven drying method a minimum of 48 h was required for the leaves stems and roots to dry to constant weight an air drying period of one week was performed on soil samples to measure the concentrations of nutrients then all of the samples were crushed and homogenized to a fine powder until they could pass through an 80 mesh sieve the total c and n concentrations in each sample were determined using an elemental analyzer vario max cn elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanau germany a thermoelectric atomic emission spectrometer thermo fisher waltham usa was used to measure the total p k ca and mg concentrations in all samples we measured only the total concentrations of these nutrients to comprehensively determine their seasonal variation 2 4 water related calculations in this study the swc value is defined as the mass of water per mass of dry soil to determine the water sources of rubber trees the isotopic mass balance is used as well as multiple linear mixing models mlmms phillips 2005 the formulas are as follows 1 δ

the 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 50 cm 50 75 cm and 75 105 cm soil layers respectively in eq 3 f 1 f 6 are the water consumption of plants in the six studied soil layers in this study there are six sources for determining plant water uptake however since mlmms are typically used to estimate only two or three sources contributing to a mixture or a consumer s diet a more advanced and powerful mlmm called mixsiar was applied mixsiar incorporates bayesian statistical methods that allow for the incorporation of more sources and more complex ecological questions parnell et al 2013 phillips et al 2014 using mixsiar the possible water use proportions of plants in this study were calculated mixsiar runs on soil water isotope data in means and sds format and the isotope data of plant xylem water were treated as mixture data because isotopic discrimination in water taken up by roots is too small to be detected phillips 2005 discrimination was set to 0 for plant species with samples from many individuals error structures were defined as the residual process but for plant species with sampling of only one individual the error structures were defined as the process only other settings were the system defaults since the result of mixsiar is a range of possible solutions the final solution was defined as the mean of those possible solutions 2 5 statistical analyses to simplify the analysis of the various complex datasets principal component analysis pca as a dimensionality reduction analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of soil data throughout the six soil layers and that of plant data from different organs through this method it was possible to simplify the nutrient data for both plant and soil samples into several groups the first step was to determine the pearson correlations between the sampling periods to assess the feasibility of the pca kaisermeyerolkin kmo and bartlett s tests of sphericity were applied our data were considered unsuitable for pca when the kmo values were less than 0 50 or when bartlett s p values were greater than 0 05 a scree plot was used eigenvalue 1 to identify the number of principal components composite scores were calculated by adding up each component item s weights if there was more than one principal component song et al 2013 variance analyses were performed using normalized dimension reduced data e g pca scores for each study site we tested differences among sites using the general linear model and dunn s multiple comparisons using a general linear model with fixed effects of season and site we assessed the differences in litter nutrient concentrations among the seasons and sites similarly the differences in the leaf δ 13c values among plant species or among the study sites were also analyzed through a general linear model with species or site as the fixed effect in cases where significant differences were found between groups dunn s multiple comparisons were used all data were normal as determined by lilliefors 95 confidence bounds for normal quantile plots homogeneity of variance was assessed using levene s test r 3 6 3 r core team 2014 was used for all statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 plant water absorption patterns more than half of the water absorbed by rubber trees in rm came from the intermediate layer of soil 15 50 cm green bars in fig 1a however in the agroforestry systems deep soil layers 50 105 cm blue bars in fig 1b d g provided much 44 6 on average of the absorbed water for rubber trees conversely in agroforestry systems rubber tree intercrops were dependent on shallow and surface water for their growth i e 58 7 on average from the 0 15 cm depth soil layer yellow bars in fig 1c e f h l especially in the j rt agroforestry system 58 on average fig 1h l in the j rt agroforestry system the water absorption patterns of the intercropped plants including trees shrubs and herbs of rubber trees exhibited high similarity fig 1h l because bamboo which belongs to the true grass family poaceae is very tall relative to other herb species it was listed separately however as a special grass species spread throughout the j rt agroforestry system fig s1 bamboo mainly absorbed surface and shallow soil water 49 2 on average from the 0 15 cm soil layer fig 1i similar to the other neighboring plants of rubber trees this is mainly because bamboos have a shallow rhizomatous root system that grows horizontally and can spread out several meters from the original plant but bamboo roots do not penetrate deep into the soil tong et al 2019 kaushal et al 2020 tea trees in all agroforestry systems exhibited similar water absorption patterns in the rt agroforestry system water was primarily absorbed by tea trees from the surface and shallow soil layers 63 7 from the 0 15 cm soil layer fig 1c and the results were similar for tea trees in the j rt agroforestry system 64 5 from the 0 15 cm soil layer fig 1h in rot agroforestry tea trees required a large amount of water from the surface 38 3 on average from the 0 5 cm soil layer as well as from deep soil layers 45 9 on average from the 50 105 cm soil layers but intermediate soil water the 15 50 cm soil layers contributed very little 15 8 on average to the water absorption of tea trees fig 1e compared to tea trees in the rot agroforestry system rubber trees absorbed moisture from the deep and intermediate soil layers 57 2 on average from the 15 105 cm soil layers fig 1d and orange trees absorbed a large amount of water from the surface soil layers 69 6 on average from the 0 5 cm soil layer fig 1f as the number of intercropped species increased seasonal variations in plant water absorption patterns tended decrease such as rubber trees in the j rt agroforestry system mainly absorbing deep soil water 53 on average from the 50 105 cm soil layers fig 1g in both the dry and the rainy seasons the water absorption patterns of all intercropped species of rubber trees in this complex agroforestry system were relatively stable 58 on average from the 0 15 cm soil layers the yellow bars in fig h l 3 2 plant leaf δ13c values in the rubber agroforestry systems rubber trees exhibited higher leaf δ 13c values than their neighboring species rubber tree leaf δ 13c values differed slightly among study sites only rubber trees in the j rt agroforestry system had significantly higher p 0 05 leaf δ 13c values than rubber trees in the rot agroforestry system red bars in fig 2 when comparing the δ 13c values among agroforestry systems it can be seen that those in the rt agroforestry system were the highest followed by those in the rot and the lowest leaf δ 13c values of tea trees appeared in the j rt agroforestry system fig 2 the leaf δ 13c values of tea trees showed an obvious decrease with an increasing number of neighboring species green bars in fig 2 in addition the leaf δ 13c values of tea trees were not significantly higher than those of orange trees under rot intercropping in the j rt agroforestry system the leaf δ 13c values of tea trees were significantly higher p 0 01 than those of bamboo but similar to those of the other shrub species shrub species exhibited significantly higher p 0 01 leaf δ 13c values than tree and herb species in addition the differences in leaf δ 13c values between bamboo and other herb species were not obvious 3 3 status of soil nutrients and water the kaisermeyerolkin measure of sampling adequacy kmo values 0 814 p 0 001 in the scree plot and the percentage of variance explained by the first nine principal components 83 771 were high fig s2 data on soil nutrient concentrations and soil water content in different soil layers were suitable for pca therefore nine principal components were extracted based on the loadings of each principal component i e pc1 pc9 for different variables in the rotated component matrix table 1 pc1 was labeled as soil k levels pc2 was labeled as soil mg levels pc3 was labeled as soil ca levels pc4 was labeled as swc levels pc5 was labeled as soil p levels pc6 was labeled as levels of c and n in 50 105 cm soil pc7 was labeled as levels of c and n in 15 50 cm soil pc8 was labeled as levels of c and n in 5 15 cm soil and pc9 was labeled as levels of c and n in 0 5 cm soil subsequently a general linear model was applied to test for differences in these nine components among the study sites based on the z scores generated by pca based on the comparison results the concentration of k within the rt intercropping soil was the most abundant fig 3a followed by that in the rm rot and j rt agroforestry systems similarly soil mg was most abundant in the rt agroforestry system followed by the j rt agroforestry system rot agroforestry system and rm fig 3b soil ca was also most abundant in the rt agroforestry system followed by the j rt agroforestry system and the rm and rot agroforestry systems fig 3c however the concentration levels of soil p were the highest in rm relative to rubber agroforestry systems and there was no significant difference among the agroforestry systems fig 3d differences in the swc among the sites were significant p 0 01 and the swcs were highest in the rot agroforestry system followed by the rt rm and j rt agroforestry systems fig 3e in the 0 5 cm and 15 50 cm soil layers no significant differences were found in the soil c and n levels fig 3f h nevertheless the soil c and n concentrations in the rm were significantly lower p 0 01 than those in the rubber agroforestry system in the 5 15 and 50 105 cm soil layers fig 3g i in general soil resources including nutrients and water were most abundant in the rt intercropping system followed by the rot rm and complex j rt agroforestry systems based on the composite scores of the pca results fig 3j 3 4 plant nutrient status the kmo values 0 714 in the scree plot and the percentage of variance explained by the first five principal components 71 727 indicated that the nutrient data of plant organs in different study sites were suitable for pca fig s3 therefore five principal components were extracted based on the loadings of each principal component i e pc1 pc5 for different variables in the rotated component matrix table 2 pc1 was labeled as the concentration levels of mg and ca of the whole plant pc2 was labeled as p concentration levels of plant roots and stems pc3 was labeled as c concentration levels of the whole plant pc4 was labeled as n concentration levels of plant roots and stems and pc5 was labeled as n p and k concentration levels of plant leaves subsequently a general linear model was applied to assess the differences in these five components for the different plants among the study sites based on the z scores generated by pca comparisons of the ca and mg concentrations among different study sites revealed no significant differences in rubber tree nutrient status fig 4a rubber trees had the highest p concentrations in roots and stems under rot intercropping followed by rt and rm and the lowest concentrations were found in the j rt agroforestry system fig 4b however the c concentration levels of the whole rubber tree were the highest in the j rt agroforestry system with little difference among the study sites fig 4c the n concentration levels in the roots and stems of the rubber trees were lowest in the rm with little difference fig 4d the n p and k concentrations in leaves were highest in the rot agroforestry system followed by the rm and then the j rt and rt agroforestry systems fig 4e comparisons of the nutrient status of tea trees among different study sites revealed that the ca and mg concentrations of tea trees did not differ significantly fig 5a the roots and stems of tea trees planted in the j rt agroforestry system had significantly lower p concentration levels p 0 01 fig 5b and the c concentration of whole tea trees fig 5c and the n concentration of tea roots and stems were significantly higher p 0 01 fig 5d in addition compared to those in the rt and j rt agroforestry systems the n p and k concentrations of tea leaves were significantly lower in the rot system p 0 01 fig 5e in general the nutrient status of rubber trees was better in the rt and rot agroforestry systems than in the j rt agroforestry system based on a comparison of the composite scores of the nutrient status of tea trees in the rt agroforestry system rubber trees exhibited significantly higher p 0 01 ca and mg concentration levels p concentration levels in roots and stems and n p and k concentration levels in leaves than tea trees fig s4a b e but their c concentration levels and n concentration levels in roots and stems were significantly lower p 0 01 than those of tea trees fig s4c d in general the composite scores of rubber trees were higher than those of tea trees fig s4f orange trees in the rot intercropping system exhibited higher ca and mg concentrations than rubber trees and tea trees fig s5a the p concentration levels in rubber roots and stems were the highest followed by those of tea tree and orange tree fig s5b the c concentration levels of tea tree were the highest followed by those of rubber tree and orange tree with no significant differences between them fig s5c the n concentration levels in the rubber tree roots and stems were the lowest and those in the tea tree and orange tree exhibited no significant differences fig s5d in addition rubber tree leaves had the highest concentrations of n p and k followed by orange tree and tea tree leaves fig s5e in general rubber trees had significantly higher p 0 01 composite scores followed by orange trees and tea trees fig s5f in the j rt agroforestry system rubber trees exhibited higher ca and mg concentration levels p concentration levels in roots and stems and c concentration levels than the other species fig s6a c bamboo exhibited the lowest nutrient levels in all components fig s6a f tea tree exhibited nutrient levels similar to those of the tree and shrub species other than rubber tree and itself fig s6a f in general the composite scores were the highest for rubber trees followed by other shrubs other herbs tea trees other trees and bamboo fig s6f 3 5 litter nutrient status an obvious phenomenon was that the litter c n p k ca and mg concentrations seemed to always be lower in the j rt agroforestry system fig 6a f especially compared with those in the other two agroforestry systems even in the rm the nutrient status of the litter was not as low as that in the complex jungle like agroforestry system and some nutrients such as p and mg were even more abundant than those in the j rt agroforestry system fig 6c f in addition the litter c n ratios did not differ significantly among the study sites fig 6g whereas the litter c p ratios differed significantly among the study sites p 0 01 they were higher in j rt than in the other types of rubber agroforestry systems which showed no significant difference fig 6h 4 discussion 4 1 plant water use and hydrological niche differentiation plant hydrological niches refer to the specific conditions of water availability and soil moisture in which certain plant species grow and thrive silvertown et al 2015 therefore hydrological niche differentiation can be defined as plants absorbing water at different rooting depths and thus displaying resource partitioning silvertown et al 2015 in the agroforestry systems the amount of water absorbed by rubber trees from deep soil layers was generally much greater but the intercropped neighboring species in the agroforestry systems preferred to uptake surface and shallow soil water fig 1 this is easy to understand since the construction of agroforestry systems almost always considers the complementary rooting depths of all plant species that is belowground niche differentiation in agroforestry systems is generated by combining deep rooted and shallow rooted species therefore water and nutrients can be accessed by each species at different depths in the soil and can then assist species with deep roots and shallow roots in acquiring resources homulle et al 2021 undoubtedly rubber trees are deeper rooted species than their intercropped species in rubber based agroforestry systems as evidenced by their vertical root length density yang et al 2021 and we also found that almost all intercropped species were shallow rooted species since their primary water source came from the surface and shallow soil layers fig 1 even the naturally growing species including the tree species in the j rt agroforestry system species selection plays an important role in determining the complementarity of root absorption zones in plants and belowground interspecific competition between rubber trees and their intercropped species plays a vital role in the formation and trend of such complementarity obvious evidence was that rubber trees took up increasingly deeper water with the increase in the number of neighboring species fig 1a b d g from the rubber monoculture to the simple rubber based agroforestry systems and then to the complex j rt agroforestry system obviously the plasticity and self distinction of the root system kwasniewski et al 2016 determine such changes in rubber trees however such water uptake of tea trees was small we assume that there are two reasons for this 1 tea trees have a relatively fixed water absorbing zone since the distribution of the root systems of mature tea trees is limited feng 2007 and 2 the upper portion of the soil profile is limited and plant absorbing roots cannot extend above the surface wu et al 2022 through the water uptake performance of the intercropped species in the rot agroforestry system and the performance of these species including tea trees in the j rt agroforestry system we found that the neighboring species in the same agroforestry system exhibited similar water absorption patterns this is a noteworthy finding as it suggests that the similarities in water uptake are not coincidental rather it is likely that the developed root systems of rubber trees took advantage of deep soil resources thereby limiting and compressing the water absorbing zones of their neighboring species wu et al 2022 as a result the absorbing roots of the neighboring species were concentrated in the upper soil layers this discovery is particularly important because it implies that intercropped species in agroforestry systems interact with one another and adapt to their environments in unique ways from this perspective rubber trees could be the most competitive species in agroforestry systems because deep layer resource use could benefit deep rooted plants more under competition mcnickle and dybzinski 2013 the water supply of shallow soil is notoriously unstable but the content of deep soil water is always adequate even in the dry season wu et al 2020 therefore such a deep layer use strategy could help rubber trees avoid damage to their permanent tissues from water shortages vilagrosa et al 2012 in addition increasing deep growing root hairs could increase the interface between soil and plant roots in the vertical direction and then help deep layer users increase their potential for nutrient capture from leaching pierret et al 2016 however plants are also exposed to some risks under the fixed deep layer use strategy for example 1 the water table increases because of intense rainwater infiltration during the rainy season and oxygen deficits in the deep soil layers could thereby suppress the activities of deep growing roots pierret et al 2016 wu et al 2022 2 many soil nutrients decrease with depth which would not benefit deep rooted species during the growing season del bianco and kepinski 2018 wu et al 2020 and 3 when rainwater enters the soil nutrients can be retained by soil organic matter in the surface and shallow soil decreasing leaching into the deep soil abdalla et al 2019 and soil organic matter always increases with increasing species composition in the plant community wu et al 2020 these reasons probably explain why the rubber trees still absorbed a certain amount of water from the surface and shallow soil layers especially during the rainy season and then exhibited significant seasonal variations p 0 01 fig 1 clearly plant root hairs play an important role in guiding rubber tree resource utilization depth as they detect the availability of both water and nutrients kwasniewski et al 2016 in terms of water use efficiency wue in c3 plants leaf δ 13c values are an important parameter and a higher δ 13c always corresponds to a higher wue bchir et al 2016 sensuła 2016 commonly low wue i e low δ 13c plants exhibit strong competitive ability since low wue plants have a higher transpiration rate per unit photosynthesis than do high wue plants resulting from increased water consumption campitelli et al 2016 lorts and lasky 2020 therefore through comparisons of the leaf δ 13c values of rubber trees at different study sites we found that rubber tree wue was not significantly affected by interspecific competition fig 2 instead the intercropped or neighboring species of rubber trees exhibited lower wues this result indicates that these neighboring species have a greater ability to acquire contested surface and shallow soil water than do rubber trees it is worth emphasizing that the greater water competing ability of neighboring species for shallow soil water does not necessarily mean that they have a competitive advantage in accessing underground resources overall rubber trees for example have a deeper rhizosphere range which could increase the probability of nutrient ion acquisition within the soil profile additionally based on the performance of the tea trees which showed decreasing wue as species richness increased we can assume that an increase in plant species richness leads to more intense water competition and a stronger enhancement of the water competitive ability of tea trees this can be considered an adjustment of the resource use strategies of tea trees since their neighboring species except rubber trees all exhibited overlapping water absorption zones in the rot and j rt agroforestry systems 4 2 intercropping benefits and competition effects on soil water and nutrients increasing soil fertility through intercropping relative to monoculture could increase soil organic matter som total nitrogen and soil macroaggregates cong et al 2015 li et al 2021 plant competition has been shown to improve soil c and n storage when plant species are more diverse wang et al 2020 competition might stimulate increased plant litter and root exudation as a result cong et al 2015 laganière et al 2015 as species composition increases soil organism diversity increases van der putten et al 2013 leading to an increase in the soil carbon and nitrogen contents brooker et al 2015 in this study our observations of higher levels of soil c and n in the agroforestry systems than those under rubber monoculture also supported the above findings especially for shallow 5 15 cm fig 3 g and deep 50 105 cm fig 3i soil layers which were the obviously differentiated water absorption zones between the intercropped species and rubber trees however plant interspecific competition belowground would consume much more soil nutrients since root length would be maximized to prevent nutrients from being shared with neighbors under nutrient competition craine and dybzinski 2013 plants may increase root density in shallow soil or increase rooting depths to maximize the nutrient ion acquisition probability during the movement of soil water trinder et al 2013 consistent with this we found that soil nutrients generally first increased and then decreased with increasing species richness fig 3a d this result implied that intercropping benefits would be offset by increasingly intense competition among plants and the key driver of this trade off was the complexity of species composition or species richness as a soil resource water can also be a source of competition but water availability is generally influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors craine and dybzinski 2013 based on our observation results soil water also first increased and then decreased as species richness increased fig 3e the increase in swc may result from increasing vegetation coverage which could decrease soil evaporation and improve rainfall interception and from increasing soil c and n since soil organic matter would lead to better soil porosity and in turn enhance soil water infiltration and soil water retention zhu et al 2019 2022 however improved soil porosity makes soil loose enough for plant roots to more easily take up soil water zeng et al 2021 in short the soil in agroforestry systems can let water flow through hold water for later uptake and help plants absorb water more easily since the wue of the intercropped species of rubber trees was lower fig 2 the agroforestry system consumed much more water from soil with the increase in the intercropped species richness in the agroforestry system therefore the swcs were the lowest in the j rt agroforestry system which had the highest species richness in general soil resources initially increase but later decrease with an increase in the diversity of intercropped species in rubber based agroforestry systems fig 3j however the key mechanisms behind this are still unclear and additional research is needed to fully understand the effects of intercropping on soil structure and function across a range of soil types and environmental conditions this is particularly important in relation to the long term sustainability of these systems 4 3 plant and litter nutrient status in response to belowground competition the c levels of whole rubber trees were greatly improved in the j rt agroforestry system fig 4c the levels of n in rubber tree roots and stems fig 4d were improved in all rubber based agroforestry systems but the p levels of those organs of rubber trees were the lowest in this agroforestry system fig 4b meanwhile the levels of ca and mg in whole rubber trees fig 4a and the concentrations of leaf n p and k in rubber trees varied little or not at all across study sites fig 4e notably the stems and roots of terrestrial plants are considered their nutrient storage organs where they store nutrients that are nonlimiting to growth and from which they draw nutrients when growth demands exceed soil nutrient uptake mengel et al 2001 meanwhile plant leaves are typically in charge of generating energy and organic compounds for plant growth and ecophysiological activity through photosynthesis fernández marín et al 2020 therefore plant nutrients especially n and p are typically enriched in leaves due to their importance in metabolism relating to the status variations in soil nutrients from the monoculture to the simple and complex agroforestry systems fig 3 the decreasing p status of rubber tree nutrient storage organs fig 4b was probably affected by the decline in soil p fig 3d and by nutrient transport to rubber tree leaves to maintain photosynthesis and the normal ecophysiological functions of rubber trees therefore the n p and k as important nutrients in rubber leaves varied little from the rubber monoculture to the agroforestry systems fig 4e in addition variations in plant tissue c reflect differences in photosynthetic product distribution and utilization han et al 2011 xing et al 2021 therefore the higher c levels of the whole rubber tree but fewer nutrients within the soil and rubber tree tissues indicated that rubber trees have a higher resource use efficiency in the j rt agroforestry systems similarly with the increase in species richness tea trees exhibited less nutrient storage but more photosynthetic products than rubber trees fig 5 therefore we conclude that intense competition among the species enhanced plant nutrient use efficiency however it is worth emphasizing that facilitating functions do not always exist since the relationships between soil nutrients and plant resource uptake in intercropping systems are complex different plants can have complementary or competitive effects on each other s nutrient absorption in the intercropping system and in some cases plants may cooperate to promote nutrient uptake wang et al 2022 in terrestrial ecosystems plant litter plays an important role in energy and nutrient cycling zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 therefore litter quality can partly reflect the nutrient status of the plant community in this study the nutrients and even the carbon concentrations increased in the simple rubber agroforestry systems i e rt and rot and then decreased to the level observed under monoculture in the complex j rt agroforestry system fig 6a f in addition negative correlations existed between the litter c n c p ratios and decomposition rates chapin et al 2011 therefore the litter c n ratios exhibited no significant difference among the study sites indicating that n release from the litter was not changed by competition but the significantly higher p 0 01 ratios of litter c p in the j rt agroforestry system indicated that p release from the litter would be smaller relative to the other sites therefore the p shortage resulting from the increasing species richness was obvious in the j rt agroforestry system although p shortages are common in tropical forests plants can still grow quickly in diverse forests with high species richness turner et al 2018 nevertheless high p and water environments may also intensify asymmetric interspecific competition in intercropping systems zhu x et al 2022 in short biodiversity had a facilitative effect on agroecosystem productivity and plant plant facilitation was driven by interspecific rhizosphere interactions that were associated with soil acidification and microbial community promotion under p deficient conditions zhu s g et al 2022 2023 however in complex rubber based agroforestry systems p shortages and the related improvement measures cannot be ignored as p shortages can significantly impact latex yield and pose a high risk the selection of species intercropped with rubber trees should be performed carefully since rubber trees exhibit a greater nutrient absorption advantage as suggested by the generally higher nutrient status of rubber trees than of their intercropped species figs s4 6 however in terms of the performance of plants and soil the complex j rt agroforestry system shares some similarities with tropical forests zeng et al 2021 for example it has poor soil quality but better soil physical properties rapid nutrient turnover and higher nutrient and wue in plants park 2002 5 conclusion complementary water absorbing patterns commonly exist between rubber trees and tea trees when they are planted together and with an increase in the composition of other species the hydrologic niche differentiation between rubber trees and the intercropped plants becomes more obvious primarily because rubber trees take up deeper soil water as the number of competitors increases however negative competition effects offset the intercropping benefits for soil nutrients and water typically soil resources first increase and then decrease with increasing species richness however the wue and nutrient status of rubber trees may be slightly affected even in complex agroforestry systems while the intercropped species would experience resource shortages since their water absorbing zones mostly overlap and the p shortage is serious undoubtedly rubber trees are the most competitive species in agroforestry systems therefore we suggest that the construction or improvement of rubber based agroforestry systems avoid interplanting too many species however for specific purposes such as restoration from rubber plantations to tropical forests we suggest applying appropriate phosphate fertilizer to agroforestry systems to facilitate the growth of restoration species declaration of

8917,as a relatively successful agroforestry system whether the addition of more intercropped species in the rubber tea agroforestry system extends the benefits is still unknown but worth exploring because diverse cash crop production helps farmers resist market risks and may bring the ecological functions of rubber agroforestry systems closer to those of natural forests therefore understanding the effects of plant interspecific competition on both plants and soil with the increase in intercropped species number in such agroforestry systems is vital for the improvement of rubber tea agroforestry systems for these reasons we selected a monocultural rubber plantation rubber tea rubber orange tea and jungle like rubber tea agroforestry systems for studying plant water absorbing patterns plant water use efficiency and the nutrient status of plants and soil through stable isotope 13c 2h and 18o techniques and nutrient diagnosis c n p k ca and mg of plant organs leaves stems and roots soil and litter we found that rubber trees primarily absorbed water from deeper soil layers with increases in their intercropped species number and the formation of increasingly obvious hydrologic niche differentiation between rubber trees and the intercropped plants in addition soil nutrient status first improved but then declined with an increase in the number of intercropped species however only a slight impact was observed on the nutrient status and water use efficiency of rubber trees even in the complex rubber tea agroforestry system however the intercropped species experienced resource shortages especially p shortages since their water absorbing zones almost overlapped therefore we suggest that more diverse intercropped species compositions in rubber tea agroforestry systems would offset the intercropping benefits for both plants and soil however appropriate phosphate fertilizer application in complex agroforestry systems is necessary if the construction of high species richness rubber agroforestry systems is desired keywords agroforestry system hydrological niche nutrient diagnosis plant competition plant soil interaction stable isotopic tracer data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction rubber based agroforestry systems are sustainable intercropping systems where farmers grow multiple crops or livestock alongside rubber trees to improve their income and or subsistence while also reaping the subsequent ecological benefits hua et al 2021 for example developing rubber based agroforestry systems can help increase soil organic matter which is beneficial for increasing soil fertility reducing water and soil loss maintaining local climate stability and improving biodiversity chen et al 2017 in addition the yield of latex from rubber trees which is an important but scarce strategic resource crucial for making tires mats ropes and other rubber products can be greatly improved in most rubber based agroforestry systems wu et al 2016 lu 2020 the abundant agricultural products in this agroforestry system can help increase the land use rate and help improve the incomes of rubber farmers therefore rubber based agroforestry provides a solution for the already degraded lands in rubber cultivation areas and provides a way to coordinate economic development and eco environmental protection in such areas zeng et al 2021 however a serious problem in the promotion of rubber based agroforestry systems is that the management of plant interspecific competition requires proper professional knowledge and evaluation of resource dynamics and complexities one of the major challenges for rubber agroforestry systems is the root competition between rubber trees and intercropped species wu et al 2016 this competition has significant impacts on the growth and productivity of both rubber trees and other crops rubber tree roots are known to be deep and extensive while the roots of intercropped species may grow closer to the surface making them more susceptible to competition for nutrients and water yang et al 2021 to mitigate root competition several strategies can be employed such as adjusting the planting density and spacing of the trees and intercropped crops to minimize competition for resources using species that have different root systems and nutrient requirements to complement the rubber trees and pruning the shoots of intercropped crops to weaken their competitive ability feng 2007 by employing appropriate management practices it is possible to achieve a balance between rubber tree growth and productivity and the growth and productivity of intercropped species resulting in a sustainable and productive agroforestry system langenberger et al 2016 however most means of mitigating root competition do not always work and are time consuming tasks trinder et al 2013 yang et al 2021 therefore rubber based agroforestry systems require more empirical evidence from many studies instead of haphazard planting to be successful rubber based agroforestry systems have been implemented in many countries including indonesia malaysia thailand and vietnam penot et al 2017 and some suitable economic crops have been found to intercrop with rubber trees after decades of research and experimentation such as sugarcane pinto et al 2006 bananas rodrigo et al 1997 coffee and cocoa snoeck et al 2013 and tea feng 2007 in china many studies have shown that the rubber tea agroforestry system is promising guo et al 2006 wu et al 2017 huang et al 2022 for example rubber tea intercropping could improve the production of both latex and tea resulting in better economic benefits guo et al 2006 meanwhile the quality of tea is improving because the amino acid and theine contents in tea leaves increase when tea grows under shaded conditions feng 2007 compared with monocultural rubber tea plantations the rubber tea agroforestry system which is built with double row spacing technology could better coordinate light heat moisture and soil nutrients langenberger et al 2016 because the canopies of rubber and tea are at different vertical heights in such agroforestry ecosystems the plants can make full use of light and then more photosynthate can be produced feng 2007 additionally the community structure between rubber and tea can help reduce wind speed in the forest the decrease in wind speed will inevitably reduce the intensity of evaporation and transpiration increase the relative humidity and soil moisture and protect rubber trees from physical damage including broken trunks and defoliation which harm rubber growth and yield zhu et al 2019 in addition soil nutrients could increase in a rubber tea agroforestry system guo et al 2006 feng 2007 zhu et al 2019 because of the superposition of the two layers of rubber and tea the residues of the biological community such as dead branches and leaves increase therefore soil organic matter would also be improved and thus the retention of water and fertilizer within the soil would be enhanced zhu et al 2019 due to the benefits mentioned above the rubber tea agroforestry system has been extensively promoted in xishuangbanna prefecture located in southwestern china s yunnan province however the sales of natural rubber and tea were not good in recent years because of the impacts of the covid 19 epidemic some rubber plantation companies and even small rubber holders have started to intercrop diverse crops with rubber trees whether the benefits of rubber tea intercropping as one of the relatively successful agroforestry systems could be improved further by the addition of more species is a question worth exploring species richness is crucial in designing and managing rubber agroforestry systems hua et al 2021 it contributes to ecosystem stability and function improves agricultural productivity supports biodiversity conservation helps the ecosystem adapt to climate change impacts provides economic and social benefits and enhances cultural and spiritual values beukema et al 2007 warren thomas et al 2020 zaro et al 2020 huang et al 2022 therefore considering and managing species richness is essential for achieving environmental sustainability increasing productivity and promoting socioeconomic development in rubber agroforestry systems however interspecific competition is still a major challenge in this agroforestry system yang et al 2021 for example during the pronounced dry season late march to mid may in xishuangbanna rubber trees undergo leaf flushing leaf expansion and the flowering period this period is also known as the golden season for spring tea production which implies that rubber trees and tea trees need sufficiently abundant water and nutrients for growth during this period if strong competition occurs resulting from the addition of more intercropped species the spring tea quality and yield and the latex yield of rubber trees may also decline therefore improving the understanding of the water and nutrient competition among species in diverse rubber tea agroforestry systems is vital for the sustainable management of high diversity agroforestry systems however reports on interspecific water and nutrient competition root interactions and how these processes affect the aboveground ecophysiological functions of plants are still rare song et al 2022 generally roots are the main plant organ used for both water and nutrient absorption and thus overlapping rhizosphere soil becomes the main place of belowground competition among different plant species isaac and borden 2019 therefore any physiological and ecological changes in plant roots such as growth development and distribution are closely related to the competitive uptake of the belowground resources however the belowground parts and processes of plants that are not visible such as root activity root distribution in the soil profile belowground nutrient interactions among plant species and nutrient element movement characteristics are difficult to determine thus root research on multiple species is very difficult especially in terms of absorbing roots stable isotope tracers can be used to study plant resource use by analyzing the isotopic signatures of the consumer and diets dawson et al 2002 this method would be useful for studying plant belowground competition trinder et al 2013 with improvements in measurement techniques and analysis methods for stable isotopes the use of stable isotope methods is increasingly accepted by researchers worldwide phillips et al 2014 water as the most necessary resource for plants and its movements and variations in soil plants and the atmosphere have been widely explored through 2h and 18o isotopes and using both 2h and 18o isotopes to trace plant water sources has become the industry standard as it is a convenient quantitative precise and nondestructive method dawson et al 2002 because soil water is absorbed primarily through root hairs i e absorbing roots gilroy and jones 2000 it might be possible to reconstruct the distribution of plant absorbing roots by understanding plant water absorbing patterns thus we can also obtain much more important information about plant nutrient use because absorbable forms of nutrients for plants mainly exist in soil solution and root hairs absorb the majority of nutrients from soil solutions gilroy and jones 2000 in brief detecting dynamic variations in root hair distribution in plant communities through stable hydrogen and oxygen isotopes tracers helps us better understand belowground competition dynamics to help improve the sustainability and maximize the potential of rubber tea agroforestry systems we selected a rubber monocultural plantation rm three agroforestry systems including rubber tea rt intercropping rubber orange tea rot intercropping and a complex jungle like rubber tea j rt agroforestry system a secondary forest to study plant belowground competition dynamics competition effects on plant nutrient status and plantsoil interactions at these sites we mainly applied stable hydrogen and oxygen isotope 2h and 18o techniques to study plant hydrological niche differentiation and stable carbon isotopes 13c to study plant water use efficiency wue and we measured carbon c nitrogen n phosphorus p potassium k calcium ca and magnesium mg concentrations of different plant organs i e leaf stem and root litter and soil at these study sites to analyze how competition affected the nutrient status of plants and soil across the dry and rainy seasons from 2017 to 2018 previous studies showed that interspecific water competition could help improve the water use of rubber trees and enhance the water retention capacity of the soil in the rubber tea agroforestry system wu et al 2017 zhu et al 2019 however intense competition would also offset such benefits of interspecific interactions therefore we hypothesized that 1 rubber trees have a deeper water absorbing zone than the intercrops and thus form complementary plant hydrological niches among species but the hydrological niches of the intercropped species of rubber tree are compressed with an increase in intercropped plant species since rubber trees have a better developed root system 2 increasing the number of intercropped species will result in intense competition thus increasing the consumption of soil water and nutrients and the intercropping benefits for soil would therefore be offset by intense competition and 3 plant nutrient status is affected by environmental resources and the stronger competitor will exhibit a higher nutrient status than its neighboring species but intense competition will result in resource limitations and ultimately lower nutrient status for plants in multispecies agroforestry systems than in simple agroforestry systems 2 materials and methods 2 1 study sites this study was performed near menglun town 21 55 44 n 101 15 21 e located in xishuangbanna prefecture in yunnan province the rainy season november to april and dry season may to october are characteristic in this region due to the tropical monsoon this region experiences an average annual air temperature of 21 7 c and an average annual precipitation of 1475 mm it is estimated that the rainy season accounts for more than 85 of the total precipitation zhu et al 2019 in this study a monoculture rubber tree plantation rm and three agroforestry systems including rubber tea rt rubber orange tea rot and jungle like rubber tea j rt intercropping patterns were selected fig s1 each study site was equipped with a standard permanent quadrat 20 m 20 m that was used for periodic sampling in the monoculture rubber tree plantation rubber trees were arranged in 3 m wide double rows and the trees were spaced two meters apart within each row with a ten meter gap separating each pair of double rows fig s1a similarly rubber trees were planted in all agroforestry systems using the same pattern as that in monoculture rubber plantations fig s1 tea trees were arranged in 4 rows in the middle of the 10 m wide gap between the double rows of rubber trees they were spaced approximately 1 m apart within a row and rows were spaced 1 m apart in the rt agroforestry system fig s1b tea trees were also planted in four rows in the 10 m wide gap between the double rows of rubber trees in the rot agroforestry system planted rows of tea trees were separated by one row of orange trees the orange trees were spaced two meters apart which divided the planted rows of tea trees into two parts each part contained two rows of tea trees and the intervals between the orange row and tea row were approximately 2 m see fig s1c in the j rt agroforestry system tea trees were planted only in two rows in the middle of the 10 m wide gap between rows of rubber trees similar to rt and rot see fig s1d the other species in the j rt agroforestry system were distributed naturally plantations of rubber trees were established in approximately 1990 and tea and orange trees were intercropped with rubber trees in 2004 since 2005 the j rt agroforestry system has been an abandoned rt agroforestry system with ongoing secondary succession species other than rubber trees and tea trees are naturally found during secondary succession these species were divided into three groups tree species ficus langkokensis litsea panamonja small tree or shrub species camellia sinensis alchornea davidi rauvolfia verticillata and herbs pteridrys cnemidaria adiantum capillus veneris dicliptera chinensis pseuderanthemum polyanthum indosasa hispida it is worth mentioning that bamboo indosasa hispida grew densely and could be seen everywhere in the j rt agroforestry system commonly approximately 1 kg compound fertilizer of nitrogen phosphorus and potassium urea potassium chloride and superphosphate would be applied in the middle of each two rubber trees in the monocultural rubber plantation in the middle of march and september feng 2007 however no fertilizer was applied in the rubber agroforestry systems during the study period in this study even in the permanent quadrat of the rubber monoculture which had a history of fertilization no fertilizer was applied during the study period in the established quadrat the slope aspect was 97 105 degrees and the slope gradient was approximately 23 degrees the rubber tree clone was rrim600 2 2 sampling a total of sixteen 5 m 5 m blocks were created for the 20 m 20 m study quadrat fig s1 and four of them were selected randomly for soil samplings at each sampling time in each sampling block soil from 0 to 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 50 cm 50 75 cm and 75 105 cm depths was sampled with an earth boring auger it is necessary to explain that we took soil samples at those six different soil layers with larger intervals between layers at greater depths this is because our previous experiments have shown that the soil profile in these study sites exhibits large vertical variations in physicochemical properties in the shallow soil layers while the differences in deep soil are relatively small a small amount of soil from different soil layers was collected in a 15 ml screw top glass vial which was sealed with parafilm and placed in a freezer at 20 c an approximately 80 g portion of soil was placed in a plastic ziplock bag to measure the soil water content and a final portion was analyzed for soil nutrients to sample the xylem of rubber trees four individuals were randomly selected an increment borer was used to collect samples from the trunk xylem of rubber trees at a height of 1 2 m in addition we sampled the shoots of the small tree and shrub species and the taproot of herb species removing their green tissues to obtain xylem each species was sampled three to four times to obtain enough xylem samples and then the xylem samples were collected in 15 ml glass vials immediately covered with parafilm and stored in a freezer at 20 c leaf and stem samples were collected at the same time as xylem sampling shoots were collected using a 10 m tree pruner and then the leaves and stems of the shoots were stored separately in different envelopes in addition the lateral roots of trees and shrubs from the soil at a depth of 0 10 cm were sampled and the entire root networks of herb species were sampled the main consideration of such sampling of plant roots is to minimize the impacts on plant growth and ensure sustainable sampling after being collected the roots were thoroughly rinsed using purified water and then dried in an oven to constant weight moreover litter was collected in each quadrat in an s shaped pattern and a total of four packs of litter were collected we cleaned and packed the litter samples in dry cotton cloth and then dried them in an oven to constant weight we sampled four times during the dry season november 13 2017 january 15 2018 february 5 2018 and march 15 2018 and three times during the rainy season may 14 2018 july 12 2018 and september 25 2018 therefore for nutrient analysis we obtained 84 plant samples 1 3 4 7 one plant species three organs four repeats and seven sampling times from the rubber monoculture 168 plant samples 2 3 4 7 two plant species three organs four repeats and seven sampling times from the rubber tea agroforestry system 252 plant samples 3 3 4 7 three plant species three organs four repeats and seven sampling times from the rubber orange tea agroforestry system and 420 plant samples from the jungle like rubber tea agroforestry system therefore we obtained a total of 924 plant samples for plant nutrient analysis in addition we sampled soil from six soil layers four times on each sampling day thus we obtained 168 soil samples 6 4 7 six soil layers four repeats and seven sampling times at each study site for a total of 672 soil samples for soil nutrient analysis 2 3 pretreatment and measuring methods an ultralow temperature liquid nitrogen 196 c vacuum distillation and extraction system was used to extract the soil and xylem water and the extracted water samples were sealed in 2 ml autosampler vials we measured the δ 2h and δ 18o values of the extracted water using a mass spectrometer thermo fisher scientific usa for the δ 2h and δ 18o values the measurement accuracies were better than 1 and 0 1 respectively and expressed through the vienna standard mean ocean water standard soil water contents swcs were determined by the oven drying method a minimum of 48 h was required for the leaves stems and roots to dry to constant weight an air drying period of one week was performed on soil samples to measure the concentrations of nutrients then all of the samples were crushed and homogenized to a fine powder until they could pass through an 80 mesh sieve the total c and n concentrations in each sample were determined using an elemental analyzer vario max cn elementar analysensysteme gmbh hanau germany a thermoelectric atomic emission spectrometer thermo fisher waltham usa was used to measure the total p k ca and mg concentrations in all samples we measured only the total concentrations of these nutrients to comprehensively determine their seasonal variation 2 4 water related calculations in this study the swc value is defined as the mass of water per mass of dry soil to determine the water sources of rubber trees the isotopic mass balance is used as well as multiple linear mixing models mlmms phillips 2005 the formulas are as follows 1 δ 2 h plant f 1 δ 2 h s 1 f 2 δ 2 h s 2 f 3 δ 2 h s 3 f 4 δ 2 h s 4 f 5 δ 2 h s 5 f 6 δ 2 h s 6 2 δ 18 o plant f 1 δ 18 o s 1 f 2 δ 18 o s 2 f 3 δ 18 o s 3 f 4 δ 18 o s 4 f 5 δ 18 o s 5 f 6 δ 18 o s 6 3

the 0 5 cm 5 15 cm 15 30 cm 30 50 cm 50 75 cm and 75 105 cm soil layers respectively in eq 3 f 1 f 6 are the water consumption of plants in the six studied soil layers in this study there are six sources for determining plant water uptake however since mlmms are typically used to estimate only two or three sources contributing to a mixture or a consumer s diet a more advanced and powerful mlmm called mixsiar was applied mixsiar incorporates bayesian statistical methods that allow for the incorporation of more sources and more complex ecological questions parnell et al 2013 phillips et al 2014 using mixsiar the possible water use proportions of plants in this study were calculated mixsiar runs on soil water isotope data in means and sds format and the isotope data of plant xylem water were treated as mixture data because isotopic discrimination in water taken up by roots is too small to be detected phillips 2005 discrimination was set to 0 for plant species with samples from many individuals error structures were defined as the residual process but for plant species with sampling of only one individual the error structures were defined as the process only other settings were the system defaults since the result of mixsiar is a range of possible solutions the final solution was defined as the mean of those possible solutions 2 5 statistical analyses to simplify the analysis of the various complex datasets principal component analysis pca as a dimensionality reduction analysis was used to reduce the dimensionality of soil data throughout the six soil layers and that of plant data from different organs through this method it was possible to simplify the nutrient data for both plant and soil samples into several groups the first step was to determine the pearson correlations between the sampling periods to assess the feasibility of the pca kaisermeyerolkin kmo and bartlett s tests of sphericity were applied our data were considered unsuitable for pca when the kmo values were less than 0 50 or when bartlett s p values were greater than 0 05 a scree plot was used eigenvalue 1 to identify the number of principal components composite scores were calculated by adding up each component item s weights if there was more than one principal component song et al 2013 variance analyses were performed using normalized dimension reduced data e g pca scores for each study site we tested differences among sites using the general linear model and dunn s multiple comparisons using a general linear model with fixed effects of season and site we assessed the differences in litter nutrient concentrations among the seasons and sites similarly the differences in the leaf δ 13c values among plant species or among the study sites were also analyzed through a general linear model with species or site as the fixed effect in cases where significant differences were found between groups dunn s multiple comparisons were used all data were normal as determined by lilliefors 95 confidence bounds for normal quantile plots homogeneity of variance was assessed using levene s test r 3 6 3 r core team 2014 was used for all statistical analyses 3 results 3 1 plant water absorption patterns more than half of the water absorbed by rubber trees in rm came from the intermediate layer of soil 15 50 cm green bars in fig 1a however in the agroforestry systems deep soil layers 50 105 cm blue bars in fig 1b d g provided much 44 6 on average of the absorbed water for rubber trees conversely in agroforestry systems rubber tree intercrops were dependent on shallow and surface water for their growth i e 58 7 on average from the 0 15 cm depth soil layer yellow bars in fig 1c e f h l especially in the j rt agroforestry system 58 on average fig 1h l in the j rt agroforestry system the water absorption patterns of the intercropped plants including trees shrubs and herbs of rubber trees exhibited high similarity fig 1h l because bamboo which belongs to the true grass family poaceae is very tall relative to other herb species it was listed separately however as a special grass species spread throughout the j rt agroforestry system fig s1 bamboo mainly absorbed surface and shallow soil water 49 2 on average from the 0 15 cm soil layer fig 1i similar to the other neighboring plants of rubber trees this is mainly because bamboos have a shallow rhizomatous root system that grows horizontally and can spread out several meters from the original plant but bamboo roots do not penetrate deep into the soil tong et al 2019 kaushal et al 2020 tea trees in all agroforestry systems exhibited similar water absorption patterns in the rt agroforestry system water was primarily absorbed by tea trees from the surface and shallow soil layers 63 7 from the 0 15 cm soil layer fig 1c and the results were similar for tea trees in the j rt agroforestry system 64 5 from the 0 15 cm soil layer fig 1h in rot agroforestry tea trees required a large amount of water from the surface 38 3 on average from the 0 5 cm soil layer as well as from deep soil layers 45 9 on average from the 50 105 cm soil layers but intermediate soil water the 15 50 cm soil layers contributed very little 15 8 on average to the water absorption of tea trees fig 1e compared to tea trees in the rot agroforestry system rubber trees absorbed moisture from the deep and intermediate soil layers 57 2 on average from the 15 105 cm soil layers fig 1d and orange trees absorbed a large amount of water from the surface soil layers 69 6 on average from the 0 5 cm soil layer fig 1f as the number of intercropped species increased seasonal variations in plant water absorption patterns tended decrease such as rubber trees in the j rt agroforestry system mainly absorbing deep soil water 53 on average from the 50 105 cm soil layers fig 1g in both the dry and the rainy seasons the water absorption patterns of all intercropped species of rubber trees in this complex agroforestry system were relatively stable 58 on average from the 0 15 cm soil layers the yellow bars in fig h l 3 2 plant leaf δ13c values in the rubber agroforestry systems rubber trees exhibited higher leaf δ 13c values than their neighboring species rubber tree leaf δ 13c values differed slightly among study sites only rubber trees in the j rt agroforestry system had significantly higher p 0 05 leaf δ 13c values than rubber trees in the rot agroforestry system red bars in fig 2 when comparing the δ 13c values among agroforestry systems it can be seen that those in the rt agroforestry system were the highest followed by those in the rot and the lowest leaf δ 13c values of tea trees appeared in the j rt agroforestry system fig 2 the leaf δ 13c values of tea trees showed an obvious decrease with an increasing number of neighboring species green bars in fig 2 in addition the leaf δ 13c values of tea trees were not significantly higher than those of orange trees under rot intercropping in the j rt agroforestry system the leaf δ 13c values of tea trees were significantly higher p 0 01 than those of bamboo but similar to those of the other shrub species shrub species exhibited significantly higher p 0 01 leaf δ 13c values than tree and herb species in addition the differences in leaf δ 13c values between bamboo and other herb species were not obvious 3 3 status of soil nutrients and water the kaisermeyerolkin measure of sampling adequacy kmo values 0 814 p 0 001 in the scree plot and the percentage of variance explained by the first nine principal components 83 771 were high fig s2 data on soil nutrient concentrations and soil water content in different soil layers were suitable for pca therefore nine principal components were extracted based on the loadings of each principal component i e pc1 pc9 for different variables in the rotated component matrix table 1 pc1 was labeled as soil k levels pc2 was labeled as soil mg levels pc3 was labeled as soil ca levels pc4 was labeled as swc levels pc5 was labeled as soil p levels pc6 was labeled as levels of c and n in 50 105 cm soil pc7 was labeled as levels of c and n in 15 50 cm soil pc8 was labeled as levels of c and n in 5 15 cm soil and pc9 was labeled as levels of c and n in 0 5 cm soil subsequently a general linear model was applied to test for differences in these nine components among the study sites based on the z scores generated by pca based on the comparison results the concentration of k within the rt intercropping soil was the most abundant fig 3a followed by that in the rm rot and j rt agroforestry systems similarly soil mg was most abundant in the rt agroforestry system followed by the j rt agroforestry system rot agroforestry system and rm fig 3b soil ca was also most abundant in the rt agroforestry system followed by the j rt agroforestry system and the rm and rot agroforestry systems fig 3c however the concentration levels of soil p were the highest in rm relative to rubber agroforestry systems and there was no significant difference among the agroforestry systems fig 3d differences in the swc among the sites were significant p 0 01 and the swcs were highest in the rot agroforestry system followed by the rt rm and j rt agroforestry systems fig 3e in the 0 5 cm and 15 50 cm soil layers no significant differences were found in the soil c and n levels fig 3f h nevertheless the soil c and n concentrations in the rm were significantly lower p 0 01 than those in the rubber agroforestry system in the 5 15 and 50 105 cm soil layers fig 3g i in general soil resources including nutrients and water were most abundant in the rt intercropping system followed by the rot rm and complex j rt agroforestry systems based on the composite scores of the pca results fig 3j 3 4 plant nutrient status the kmo values 0 714 in the scree plot and the percentage of variance explained by the first five principal components 71 727 indicated that the nutrient data of plant organs in different study sites were suitable for pca fig s3 therefore five principal components were extracted based on the loadings of each principal component i e pc1 pc5 for different variables in the rotated component matrix table 2 pc1 was labeled as the concentration levels of mg and ca of the whole plant pc2 was labeled as p concentration levels of plant roots and stems pc3 was labeled as c concentration levels of the whole plant pc4 was labeled as n concentration levels of plant roots and stems and pc5 was labeled as n p and k concentration levels of plant leaves subsequently a general linear model was applied to assess the differences in these five components for the different plants among the study sites based on the z scores generated by pca comparisons of the ca and mg concentrations among different study sites revealed no significant differences in rubber tree nutrient status fig 4a rubber trees had the highest p concentrations in roots and stems under rot intercropping followed by rt and rm and the lowest concentrations were found in the j rt agroforestry system fig 4b however the c concentration levels of the whole rubber tree were the highest in the j rt agroforestry system with little difference among the study sites fig 4c the n concentration levels in the roots and stems of the rubber trees were lowest in the rm with little difference fig 4d the n p and k concentrations in leaves were highest in the rot agroforestry system followed by the rm and then the j rt and rt agroforestry systems fig 4e comparisons of the nutrient status of tea trees among different study sites revealed that the ca and mg concentrations of tea trees did not differ significantly fig 5a the roots and stems of tea trees planted in the j rt agroforestry system had significantly lower p concentration levels p 0 01 fig 5b and the c concentration of whole tea trees fig 5c and the n concentration of tea roots and stems were significantly higher p 0 01 fig 5d in addition compared to those in the rt and j rt agroforestry systems the n p and k concentrations of tea leaves were significantly lower in the rot system p 0 01 fig 5e in general the nutrient status of rubber trees was better in the rt and rot agroforestry systems than in the j rt agroforestry system based on a comparison of the composite scores of the nutrient status of tea trees in the rt agroforestry system rubber trees exhibited significantly higher p 0 01 ca and mg concentration levels p concentration levels in roots and stems and n p and k concentration levels in leaves than tea trees fig s4a b e but their c concentration levels and n concentration levels in roots and stems were significantly lower p 0 01 than those of tea trees fig s4c d in general the composite scores of rubber trees were higher than those of tea trees fig s4f orange trees in the rot intercropping system exhibited higher ca and mg concentrations than rubber trees and tea trees fig s5a the p concentration levels in rubber roots and stems were the highest followed by those of tea tree and orange tree fig s5b the c concentration levels of tea tree were the highest followed by those of rubber tree and orange tree with no significant differences between them fig s5c the n concentration levels in the rubber tree roots and stems were the lowest and those in the tea tree and orange tree exhibited no significant differences fig s5d in addition rubber tree leaves had the highest concentrations of n p and k followed by orange tree and tea tree leaves fig s5e in general rubber trees had significantly higher p 0 01 composite scores followed by orange trees and tea trees fig s5f in the j rt agroforestry system rubber trees exhibited higher ca and mg concentration levels p concentration levels in roots and stems and c concentration levels than the other species fig s6a c bamboo exhibited the lowest nutrient levels in all components fig s6a f tea tree exhibited nutrient levels similar to those of the tree and shrub species other than rubber tree and itself fig s6a f in general the composite scores were the highest for rubber trees followed by other shrubs other herbs tea trees other trees and bamboo fig s6f 3 5 litter nutrient status an obvious phenomenon was that the litter c n p k ca and mg concentrations seemed to always be lower in the j rt agroforestry system fig 6a f especially compared with those in the other two agroforestry systems even in the rm the nutrient status of the litter was not as low as that in the complex jungle like agroforestry system and some nutrients such as p and mg were even more abundant than those in the j rt agroforestry system fig 6c f in addition the litter c n ratios did not differ significantly among the study sites fig 6g whereas the litter c p ratios differed significantly among the study sites p 0 01 they were higher in j rt than in the other types of rubber agroforestry systems which showed no significant difference fig 6h 4 discussion 4 1 plant water use and hydrological niche differentiation plant hydrological niches refer to the specific conditions of water availability and soil moisture in which certain plant species grow and thrive silvertown et al 2015 therefore hydrological niche differentiation can be defined as plants absorbing water at different rooting depths and thus displaying resource partitioning silvertown et al 2015 in the agroforestry systems the amount of water absorbed by rubber trees from deep soil layers was generally much greater but the intercropped neighboring species in the agroforestry systems preferred to uptake surface and shallow soil water fig 1 this is easy to understand since the construction of agroforestry systems almost always considers the complementary rooting depths of all plant species that is belowground niche differentiation in agroforestry systems is generated by combining deep rooted and shallow rooted species therefore water and nutrients can be accessed by each species at different depths in the soil and can then assist species with deep roots and shallow roots in acquiring resources homulle et al 2021 undoubtedly rubber trees are deeper rooted species than their intercropped species in rubber based agroforestry systems as evidenced by their vertical root length density yang et al 2021 and we also found that almost all intercropped species were shallow rooted species since their primary water source came from the surface and shallow soil layers fig 1 even the naturally growing species including the tree species in the j rt agroforestry system species selection plays an important role in determining the complementarity of root absorption zones in plants and belowground interspecific competition between rubber trees and their intercropped species plays a vital role in the formation and trend of such complementarity obvious evidence was that rubber trees took up increasingly deeper water with the increase in the number of neighboring species fig 1a b d g from the rubber monoculture to the simple rubber based agroforestry systems and then to the complex j rt agroforestry system obviously the plasticity and self distinction of the root system kwasniewski et al 2016 determine such changes in rubber trees however such water uptake of tea trees was small we assume that there are two reasons for this 1 tea trees have a relatively fixed water absorbing zone since the distribution of the root systems of mature tea trees is limited feng 2007 and 2 the upper portion of the soil profile is limited and plant absorbing roots cannot extend above the surface wu et al 2022 through the water uptake performance of the intercropped species in the rot agroforestry system and the performance of these species including tea trees in the j rt agroforestry system we found that the neighboring species in the same agroforestry system exhibited similar water absorption patterns this is a noteworthy finding as it suggests that the similarities in water uptake are not coincidental rather it is likely that the developed root systems of rubber trees took advantage of deep soil resources thereby limiting and compressing the water absorbing zones of their neighboring species wu et al 2022 as a result the absorbing roots of the neighboring species were concentrated in the upper soil layers this discovery is particularly important because it implies that intercropped species in agroforestry systems interact with one another and adapt to their environments in unique ways from this perspective rubber trees could be the most competitive species in agroforestry systems because deep layer resource use could benefit deep rooted plants more under competition mcnickle and dybzinski 2013 the water supply of shallow soil is notoriously unstable but the content of deep soil water is always adequate even in the dry season wu et al 2020 therefore such a deep layer use strategy could help rubber trees avoid damage to their permanent tissues from water shortages vilagrosa et al 2012 in addition increasing deep growing root hairs could increase the interface between soil and plant roots in the vertical direction and then help deep layer users increase their potential for nutrient capture from leaching pierret et al 2016 however plants are also exposed to some risks under the fixed deep layer use strategy for example 1 the water table increases because of intense rainwater infiltration during the rainy season and oxygen deficits in the deep soil layers could thereby suppress the activities of deep growing roots pierret et al 2016 wu et al 2022 2 many soil nutrients decrease with depth which would not benefit deep rooted species during the growing season del bianco and kepinski 2018 wu et al 2020 and 3 when rainwater enters the soil nutrients can be retained by soil organic matter in the surface and shallow soil decreasing leaching into the deep soil abdalla et al 2019 and soil organic matter always increases with increasing species composition in the plant community wu et al 2020 these reasons probably explain why the rubber trees still absorbed a certain amount of water from the surface and shallow soil layers especially during the rainy season and then exhibited significant seasonal variations p 0 01 fig 1 clearly plant root hairs play an important role in guiding rubber tree resource utilization depth as they detect the availability of both water and nutrients kwasniewski et al 2016 in terms of water use efficiency wue in c3 plants leaf δ 13c values are an important parameter and a higher δ 13c always corresponds to a higher wue bchir et al 2016 sensuła 2016 commonly low wue i e low δ 13c plants exhibit strong competitive ability since low wue plants have a higher transpiration rate per unit photosynthesis than do high wue plants resulting from increased water consumption campitelli et al 2016 lorts and lasky 2020 therefore through comparisons of the leaf δ 13c values of rubber trees at different study sites we found that rubber tree wue was not significantly affected by interspecific competition fig 2 instead the intercropped or neighboring species of rubber trees exhibited lower wues this result indicates that these neighboring species have a greater ability to acquire contested surface and shallow soil water than do rubber trees it is worth emphasizing that the greater water competing ability of neighboring species for shallow soil water does not necessarily mean that they have a competitive advantage in accessing underground resources overall rubber trees for example have a deeper rhizosphere range which could increase the probability of nutrient ion acquisition within the soil profile additionally based on the performance of the tea trees which showed decreasing wue as species richness increased we can assume that an increase in plant species richness leads to more intense water competition and a stronger enhancement of the water competitive ability of tea trees this can be considered an adjustment of the resource use strategies of tea trees since their neighboring species except rubber trees all exhibited overlapping water absorption zones in the rot and j rt agroforestry systems 4 2 intercropping benefits and competition effects on soil water and nutrients increasing soil fertility through intercropping relative to monoculture could increase soil organic matter som total nitrogen and soil macroaggregates cong et al 2015 li et al 2021 plant competition has been shown to improve soil c and n storage when plant species are more diverse wang et al 2020 competition might stimulate increased plant litter and root exudation as a result cong et al 2015 laganière et al 2015 as species composition increases soil organism diversity increases van der putten et al 2013 leading to an increase in the soil carbon and nitrogen contents brooker et al 2015 in this study our observations of higher levels of soil c and n in the agroforestry systems than those under rubber monoculture also supported the above findings especially for shallow 5 15 cm fig 3 g and deep 50 105 cm fig 3i soil layers which were the obviously differentiated water absorption zones between the intercropped species and rubber trees however plant interspecific competition belowground would consume much more soil nutrients since root length would be maximized to prevent nutrients from being shared with neighbors under nutrient competition craine and dybzinski 2013 plants may increase root density in shallow soil or increase rooting depths to maximize the nutrient ion acquisition probability during the movement of soil water trinder et al 2013 consistent with this we found that soil nutrients generally first increased and then decreased with increasing species richness fig 3a d this result implied that intercropping benefits would be offset by increasingly intense competition among plants and the key driver of this trade off was the complexity of species composition or species richness as a soil resource water can also be a source of competition but water availability is generally influenced by both biotic and abiotic factors craine and dybzinski 2013 based on our observation results soil water also first increased and then decreased as species richness increased fig 3e the increase in swc may result from increasing vegetation coverage which could decrease soil evaporation and improve rainfall interception and from increasing soil c and n since soil organic matter would lead to better soil porosity and in turn enhance soil water infiltration and soil water retention zhu et al 2019 2022 however improved soil porosity makes soil loose enough for plant roots to more easily take up soil water zeng et al 2021 in short the soil in agroforestry systems can let water flow through hold water for later uptake and help plants absorb water more easily since the wue of the intercropped species of rubber trees was lower fig 2 the agroforestry system consumed much more water from soil with the increase in the intercropped species richness in the agroforestry system therefore the swcs were the lowest in the j rt agroforestry system which had the highest species richness in general soil resources initially increase but later decrease with an increase in the diversity of intercropped species in rubber based agroforestry systems fig 3j however the key mechanisms behind this are still unclear and additional research is needed to fully understand the effects of intercropping on soil structure and function across a range of soil types and environmental conditions this is particularly important in relation to the long term sustainability of these systems 4 3 plant and litter nutrient status in response to belowground competition the c levels of whole rubber trees were greatly improved in the j rt agroforestry system fig 4c the levels of n in rubber tree roots and stems fig 4d were improved in all rubber based agroforestry systems but the p levels of those organs of rubber trees were the lowest in this agroforestry system fig 4b meanwhile the levels of ca and mg in whole rubber trees fig 4a and the concentrations of leaf n p and k in rubber trees varied little or not at all across study sites fig 4e notably the stems and roots of terrestrial plants are considered their nutrient storage organs where they store nutrients that are nonlimiting to growth and from which they draw nutrients when growth demands exceed soil nutrient uptake mengel et al 2001 meanwhile plant leaves are typically in charge of generating energy and organic compounds for plant growth and ecophysiological activity through photosynthesis fernández marín et al 2020 therefore plant nutrients especially n and p are typically enriched in leaves due to their importance in metabolism relating to the status variations in soil nutrients from the monoculture to the simple and complex agroforestry systems fig 3 the decreasing p status of rubber tree nutrient storage organs fig 4b was probably affected by the decline in soil p fig 3d and by nutrient transport to rubber tree leaves to maintain photosynthesis and the normal ecophysiological functions of rubber trees therefore the n p and k as important nutrients in rubber leaves varied little from the rubber monoculture to the agroforestry systems fig 4e in addition variations in plant tissue c reflect differences in photosynthetic product distribution and utilization han et al 2011 xing et al 2021 therefore the higher c levels of the whole rubber tree but fewer nutrients within the soil and rubber tree tissues indicated that rubber trees have a higher resource use efficiency in the j rt agroforestry systems similarly with the increase in species richness tea trees exhibited less nutrient storage but more photosynthetic products than rubber trees fig 5 therefore we conclude that intense competition among the species enhanced plant nutrient use efficiency however it is worth emphasizing that facilitating functions do not always exist since the relationships between soil nutrients and plant resource uptake in intercropping systems are complex different plants can have complementary or competitive effects on each other s nutrient absorption in the intercropping system and in some cases plants may cooperate to promote nutrient uptake wang et al 2022 in terrestrial ecosystems plant litter plays an important role in energy and nutrient cycling zechmeister boltenstern et al 2015 therefore litter quality can partly reflect the nutrient status of the plant community in this study the nutrients and even the carbon concentrations increased in the simple rubber agroforestry systems i e rt and rot and then decreased to the level observed under monoculture in the complex j rt agroforestry system fig 6a f in addition negative correlations existed between the litter c n c p ratios and decomposition rates chapin et al 2011 therefore the litter c n ratios exhibited no significant difference among the study sites indicating that n release from the litter was not changed by competition but the significantly higher p 0 01 ratios of litter c p in the j rt agroforestry system indicated that p release from the litter would be smaller relative to the other sites therefore the p shortage resulting from the increasing species richness was obvious in the j rt agroforestry system although p shortages are common in tropical forests plants can still grow quickly in diverse forests with high species richness turner et al 2018 nevertheless high p and water environments may also intensify asymmetric interspecific competition in intercropping systems zhu x et al 2022 in short biodiversity had a facilitative effect on agroecosystem productivity and plant plant facilitation was driven by interspecific rhizosphere interactions that were associated with soil acidification and microbial community promotion under p deficient conditions zhu s g et al 2022 2023 however in complex rubber based agroforestry systems p shortages and the related improvement measures cannot be ignored as p shortages can significantly impact latex yield and pose a high risk the selection of species intercropped with rubber trees should be performed carefully since rubber trees exhibit a greater nutrient absorption advantage as suggested by the generally higher nutrient status of rubber trees than of their intercropped species figs s4 6 however in terms of the performance of plants and soil the complex j rt agroforestry system shares some similarities with tropical forests zeng et al 2021 for example it has poor soil quality but better soil physical properties rapid nutrient turnover and higher nutrient and wue in plants park 2002 5 conclusion complementary water absorbing patterns commonly exist between rubber trees and tea trees when they are planted together and with an increase in the composition of other species the hydrologic niche differentiation between rubber trees and the intercropped plants becomes more obvious primarily because rubber trees take up deeper soil water as the number of competitors increases however negative competition effects offset the intercropping benefits for soil nutrients and water typically soil resources first increase and then decrease with increasing species richness however the wue and nutrient status of rubber trees may be slightly affected even in complex agroforestry systems while the intercropped species would experience resource shortages since their water absorbing zones mostly overlap and the p shortage is serious undoubtedly rubber trees are the most competitive species in agroforestry systems therefore we suggest that the construction or improvement of rubber based agroforestry systems avoid interplanting too many species however for specific purposes such as restoration from rubber plantations to tropical forests we suggest applying appropriate phosphate fertilizer to agroforestry systems to facilitate the growth of restoration species declaration of

saline soil covers an area of 405 million ha which is approximately one third of the irrigated agricultural land irshad et al 2022 in the bohai lowland of the north china plain ncp it is one of the principal types of low yield soil covers approximately 36 million ha zhang 2018 huo et al 2017 in this region soil with salinity levels of 1 0 3 0 g kg 1 and 3 0 5 0 g kg 1 accounts for 55 8 and 0 7 of the total area respectively wang et al 2012 salinization affects the ecological environment and restricts sustainable land use development and agricultural production the development and utilization of coastal saline alkali soil are great significance for agricultural development foxtail millet setaria italica is an environment friendly crop with high drought stress resistance short life cycle dual grain and forage use wide adaptability and low water consumption making it the prospective model crop for investigating the effects of salinity plants additionally it has been demonstrated to have the highest water productivity wp among all crops that to provide the support for high water efficient agriculture zou et al 2019 hence it will become the crucial crop for the adjustment of planting structures in groundwater depleted regions of the ncp and for the utilization of coastal saline alkali soil in saline alkali land crops usually face the dual pressures of drought and salinity zhao et al 2016 in stressful environments plants adjust and improve their growth and development by altering their multifarious molecular cellular biochemical and physiological processes taramani et al 2020 under soil salinity and water deficit plants respond by osmotic regulation as their fundamental physiological process which is mainly carried out by osmotic regulators such as k proline and soluble sugars shao et al 2006 capell et al 2004 li et al 2003 plant drought resistance and osmotic adjustment ability are usually evaluated using these small molecules as prominent physiological indicators wang et al 2003 yordanov et al 2003 plants can absorb water from water deficient soil by increasing the content of osmotic regulators the proline content is closely related to the soil water stress threshold and plant drought resistance shao et al 2006 various drought related indicators such as cell membrane stability osmotic pressure naturalize tendency water potential and morphological characteristics are used to evaluate plant stress tolerance priyanka et al 2021 na accumulation which is followed by inhibition the absorption of k and ca from the soil is one of the unfavourable responses of salinity on plants brini et al 2009 then causes crop production reduction marcinska et al 2013 as it is an important drought tolerant crop species studying the characteristics of salt and water tolerance of foxtail millet in saline alkali areas is necessary for agricultural and research purposes however few studies have investigated its threshold degree of water and salt stress and the mechanism underlying its high stress resistance from the perspective of plant osmotic potential thus the aims for the study we carried out were to 1 investigate the effect of salt stress on flag leaf osmoregulation grain yield and water utilization of foxtail millet plants grown under drought stress or well watered conditions and 2 determine the soil salinity threshold for millet grain yield and wp under varying water conditions our findings will establish a scientific and theoretical foundation for the successful planting and cultivation of foxtail millet in the ncp and the promotion of its cultivation in coastal saline soil 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site two year study was established in 2020 and 2021 in a rain shelter at the nanpi eco agricultural experiment station of the chinese academy of sciences 116 40 e 38 00 n altitude 13 m the experimental station was located in the bohai lowland of the ncp a coastal lowland plain area with a semi humid temperate continental monsoon climate and high salinity and drought levels the region receives average sunshine 2938 6 h multi year mean radiation is 5592 3 mj cm 2 total accumulated

growing seasons is shown in fig 1 before sowing chloridic soil world reference base salt content 1 00 g kg 1 0 31 ds m field capacity fc 0 34 cm3 cm 3 at the soil depth of 0 20 cm was collected in the study fields air dried and sieved using a 2 00 mm mesh sieve to remove foreign matter such as stone and weeds an extraction ratio of 1 5 ec1 5 was used to measure soil salinity the available k available p available n and organic matter contest of the sampled saline soil were 120 54 mg kg 1 20 88 mg kg 1 71 86 mg kg 1 and 15 36 g kg 1 respectively based on the soil bulk density 1 5 g cm 3 43 5 kg of the sieved soil was placed in a test barrel with equal diameter and height 0 40 m the basic soil ion concentrations are presented in table 1 the soil physical properties for 0 20 cm of study site was from zhang et al 2018 2 2 experimental design the barrel planting experiment was conducted during the foxtail millet growing periods in 2020 and 2021 with six replicates in 2020 the experiment conditions included two soil water levels w1 45 5 fc and w2 75 5 fc and four soil salinity s levels 1 0 1 6 2 2 and 2 8 g kg 1 which were equal to 0 31 0 50 0 69 and 0 88 ds m respectively the salinity gradient interval was too large to determine the salinity threshold for millet growth and water utilization therefore to acquire more detailed information it was adjusted to 0 2 g kg 1 in 2021 resulting in 10 soil salinity levels 1 0 1 2 1 4 1 6 1 8 2 0 2 2 2 4 2 6 and 2 8 g kg 1 which were equal to 0 31 0 38 0 44 0 50 0 56 0 63 0 69 0 75 0 81 and 0 88 ds m respectively the salt

the corresponding soil salinity levels after the barrels were filled with the soil mixed with sea salt water was added to each barrel to attain two soil water levels before water addition 2 5 g of compound fertilizer n p2o5 k2o 28 15 10 was added to each barrel throughout the growing season the weighing method was used to maintain a constant soil water content in 2020 the irrigation amounts for s1 0 s1 6 s2 2 treatments were 300 89 mm 275 75 mm 131 2 mm for w1 and 414 1 mm 340 00 mm 255 58 mm for w2 respectively in 2021 the irrigation amounts for the s1 0 s1 2 s1 4 s1 6 s1 8 s2 0 and s2 2 treatments were 247 89 mm 248 93 mm 238 90 mm 236 28 mm 176 85 mm 162 53 mm and 160 30 mm for w1 and 353 70 mm 339 54 mm 340 10 mm 279 63 mm 299 68 mm 272 55 mm and 223 23 mm for w2 respectively the

sciences hebei china the variety was obtained by crossing millet sterile series a2 with complex 1 no 5 the plants were sown on july 1 2020 and 2021 and harvested on october 5 2020 and october 7 2021 respectively the plant density was 200 grains per barrel and the sowing depth was 3 5 cm 2 3 sampling methods and measurements six replicates were used for each combination of soil salinity and water level three barrels were used to sample and measure the contents of osmotic regulators salt ions of flag leaves and aboveground biomass whereas the other three barrels were used for the determination of grain yield and yield components 2 3 1 survival rate the number of seedlings was counted 3 and 6 days after sowing das afterward it was counted every 6 days until 30 das the survival rate was calculated as the ratio of the seedling number counted each time to the number of seeds sown under the corresponding treatment 2 3 2 osmoregulation substances of flag leaves three flag leaves were sampled in the period from 9 00 am to 11 00 am to measure their leaf water potential using a wp4 dewpoint potential meter decagon pullman wa usa at the grain filling stage the flag leaves were cut as quickly as possible and transferred to a sample box the data were logged when the temperature in the sample box reached the dewpoint five flag leaves per treatment with three replicates were sampled at 9 00 am to measure the proline and soluble sugar contents at the flowering and grain filling stages the samples were immediately placed in ice box using a polyethylene bags and transported to the laboratory to reduce water loss they were washed rapidly in distilled water and dried between filter paper layers mahdy et al 2022 the proline content was determined according to gao 2000 briefly the leaves were extracted with 3 sulfosalicylic acid color was developed using 2 5 acid ninhydrin extracted with toluene and used a spectrophotometer uv 2450 shimadzu china to measure the proline content at 520 nm the soluble sugar content in the ethanol extract of fresh flag leaves of foxtail millet plants was determined by the anthrone technique described in cerning 1975 and hussein et al 2022

least significant difference lsd test was used for multiple comparisons to determine whether there was a significant effect all data analyses were performed at a significance level of α 0 05 3 results 3 1 survival rate the survival rate was significantly reduced by salinity under both water stress and well watered conditions fig 2 in the 2021 foxtail millet growing season the survival rate first increased at 0 12 das and then decreased at 12 24 das except for treatments s2 4 s2 6 and s2 8 at 3 das no plants survived under w1 and w2 conditions in treatments s1 8 s2 8 but the survival rate for treatments s1 0 s1 2 s1 4 and s1 6 was significantly lower 4 5 26 5 47 52 85 48 respectively under w2 compared with w1 at 3 das the survival rate at 24 das tended to be stable ranging from 23 47 to 34 67 for s1 0 s1 8 except for s1 8 in w1 3 2 osmotic regulators of flag leaves 3 2 1 leaf water potential the water potential of flag leaves at the grain filling stage decreased with the increase in soil salinity fig 3 the improved water conditions helped improve the leaf water potential but could not offset the leaf water potential loss under 75 fc when the soil salinity increased by 0 2 g kg 1 3 2 2 proline content the proline content increased with the increase in soil salinity fig 4 improved water conditions resulted in a decrease in proline content compared with w1 the proline content was lower in w2 10 54 61 48 and 2 74 50 10 at the flowering and grain filling stages respectively in both 2020 and 2021 the proline content was stable after treatment s1 6 at the grain filling stage except for s1 6 in w2 in 2020 3 2 3 soluble sugar content in 2021 the soluble sugar content climbed up to the maximum and then declined at the flowering and grain filling stages fig 5 the improved water conditions helped delay the maximum gap in leaves which the maximum gap appeared in s1 4 28 79 at flowering stage for w1 and in s1 6 19 03 at grain filling stage for w2 3 2 4 the k na and k na ratio in foxtail millet flag leaves with increasing soil salinity the na content significantly increased and the k content and k na ratio significantly decreased fig 6 the na content was lower in w2 2 94 7 03 and 7 74 9 96 for s1 8 and s2 0 respectively than in w1 from the heading to the grain filling stages compared with s1 0 the k content significantly increased by 5 39 19 13 4 50 20 21 and 6 32 23 24 for s1 6 s1 8 and s2 0 respectively except for s1 6 at the flowering stage compared with s1 0 the k na ratio significantly increased at grain filling stage for s1 6 s2 0 3 3 aboveground biomass yield and yield components the aboveground biomass significantly increased in w2 compared to that in w1 at the flowering stage in both growing seasons in 2020 it increased by 31 09 45 20 and 301 11 in s1 0 s1 6 s2 2 respectively and in 2021 it increased by 15 31 22 10 28 48 42 73 66 31 67 82 respectively in treatments s1 0 to s2 2 fig 7 the decline range increased with the increase in soil salinity the aboveground biomass significantly decreased 8 71 81 16 in treatments s1 0 s2 0 in w1 than in w2 at the flowering and mature stages moreover at the mature stage in 2021 aboveground biomass was decreased in w1 whereas it was stable for treatments s1 0 s1 4 in w2 soil salinity significantly affected the grain weight per spike spike numbers foxtail millet yield and hi table 2 the grain weight per spike 27 15 90 08 and 3 67 64 78 in w1 and w2 respectively and spike number per barrel 32 61 97 83 and 6 68 95 83 in w1 and w2 respectively were significantly lower in s1 6 and s2 2 than in s1 0 compared with w1 w2 caused an increase in grain yield 12 58 110 85 in 2020 and 1 54 97 20 in 2021 but a decrease in hi 1 66 7 25 in 2020 3 4 evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration of foxtail millet decreased with increasing soil salinity in both w1 and w2 except for s1 8 in w1 in 2021 fig 8 compared with s1 0 the evapotranspiration in s1 6 s2 2 and s2 8 significantly decreased by 8 36 72 70 in w1 except for s1 6 and by 4 69 52 44 in w2 in both growing seasons 3 5 water productivity the wpy and wpbm were significantly low when water was applied table 3 in w2 wpy decreased by 9 23 17 30 in 2020 and by 1 54 33 72 in 2021 except for s2 2 and wpbm decreased by 2 36 5 79 in 2020 and by 5 88 47 49 in 2021 compared with w1 in 2021 compared with treatment s1 0 treatments s1 8 s2 2 significantly decreased wpy by 16 91 87 92 under w1 condition and by 23 49 78 52 under w2 and wpbm by 19 09 62 86 under w1 condition and by 18 96 74 18 under w2 3 6 combined effects of soil water content and soil salinity on yield and wpy yield and soil salinity exhibited a quadratic relationship fig 9 according to which sy50 occurred at 1 87 g kg 1 soil salinity under w1 and at 1 91 g kg 1 soil salinity under w2 the yield differences between w1 and w2 showed the following relationships with soil salinity in 2021 yw2 w1 130 69x2 329 05x 112 67 therefore the yield loss of foxtail millet under w2 was 22 67 g m 2 lower than that under w1 with an increase of 1 0 g kg 1 soil salinity at the 1 0 g kg 1 level the wpy differences between w1 and w2 showed the following relationship with soil salinity in 2021 wpw2 w1 0 35x2 1 62x 1 80 the wpy was the same for w1 and w2 when soil salinity was 1 85 g kg 1 consequently the wpy loss of foxtail millet in w2 was 0 53 kg m 3 higher than that in w1 with an increase of 1 0 g kg 1 soil salinity at the 1 0 g kg 1 level 4 discussion the grain yield and survival rate are representative agronomic indicators of salinity tolerance increasing the plant survival rate is crucial for enhancing crop yield in saline alkali soils in the present study the survival rate of foxtail millet in s1 2 s1 8 was lower under w2 fig 2 than under w1 this suggests that providing additional water during the survival period of foxtail millet was not necessary to promote its survival in contrast higher soil water content reduced plant survival in soils with lower salinity 1 2 1 8 g kg 1 however with the increase in salinity more water was needed to maintain the normal survival rate this phenomenon may be explained by two reasons the first reason is that foxtail millet absorbed only 26 of water for its weight development during germination far below that reported to be absorbed by maize 48 wheat 45 and sorghum 40 zhang 2007 therefore higher soil moisture levels may impede foxtail millet survival the second reason is that extreme environmental conditions inhibit plant growth which is rapidly restored when conditions become favorable yuan et al 2022 thus plants grown in soils with high salinity show an improved survival rate upon the improvement of the swc roots are the first organ to come into direct contact with the high salt concentrations in the soil therefore excessive na accumulation in roots impairs root development and lateral root formation qin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in the present study the salt may have leached deeper into the soil with irrigation to maintain the high soil water content thereby decreasing the root na content and promoting survival the accumulation of na in plants inhibits their intake of other essential macronutrients such as k and ca from the soil brini et al 2009 moreover chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis are also adversely affected by na accumulation in plants jiang et al 2017 which may have resulted in leaf senescence and decreased plant aboveground biomass and yield in the present study our results showed that maintaining higher field capacity decreased the na accumulation under higher soil salinity which resulted in an optimal k na ratio houshmand et al 2005 mahlooji et al 2018 root cells resist salt toxicity by mechanisms that restrict na uptake mainly by down regulating the na influx at the soil root boundary via non selective cation channels or high affinity potassium transporters hanin et al 2016 another study also showed that under saline conditions salinity tolerant plants maintain low na concentrations in the cytosol of their root and shoot cells through na exclusion extrusion or compartmentation munns et al 2020 as another salt tolerance mechanism the presence of proline can enhance plant salt tolerance by protecting the cell membrane and enzymes munns 2002 which restricted the na uptake in the present study furthermore water deficit and salinity lead to negative reversible or irreversible physiological alterations during plant development plants employ various biochemical and physiological mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels to adapt to different environmental stresses hussein et al 2022 swati et al 2011 osmotic stress impedes water absorption by the plant roots consequently the root cells adopt osmoregulation processes such as the accumulation of soluble compounds to support plant growth hasegawa 2000 siddiqui et al 2017 therefore studying the fundamental molecular mechanisms of the formation and function of salt tolerance structures in plants could help understand and improve the ability of crops to counteract environmental stress yuan et al 2021 our results showed that higher salt salinity resulted in greater yield differences between the two soil water conditions fig 9 according to the obtained equations fig 9 sy50 occurred at 1 87 g kg 1 soil salinity under w1 and at 1 91 g kg 1 soil salinity under w2 condition barely offsetting 0 04 g kg 1 salt toxicity when increased by 30 fc adversity stress negatively impacts plant nutrient uptake thereby reducing plant growth grain yield and quality ma et al 2021 crop cultivation and yield in saline soils are limited mainly by the reduction in plant physiological and biochemical abilities which negatively affect their ability to absorb nutrients and water as well as their photosynthetic rates perez lopez et al 2013 an appropriate n nutritional status can improve millet tolerance to drought and enhance certain morphological traits thereby increasing its yields cossani et al 2012 hussain et al 2015 reported a 36 56 and 42 decrease in n p and k uptake respectively in crops under salinity stress which may be the main reason for crop yield reduction under salt and drought stress taramani et al 2020 reported that a significant reduction in pearl millet height evapotranspiration proline content and na k ratio resulted from limited nutrient uptake under both water and salinity stress conditions which supported the results of our study 5 conclusion this study investigated the relationship between grain yield and soil water utilization in foxtail millet by examining its osmoregulation mechanisms in addition to providing new insights into saline soil utilization this study highlights that the threshold of the yield half attenuation concentration for foxtail millet was under 45 and 75 field capacity and salinity conditions when soil salinity exceeded 1 85 g kg 1 the improved water content could counteract the effect of salt for wpy when subjected to water and salt stress foxtail millet induced osmoregulation and inhibited soil evapotranspiration which decreased yield and wp mainly because of the low aboveground biomass this study focused on flag leaf osmoregulation and soil water consumption in foxtail millet and did not focus on root development under water and salt stress the relationship of root signal transduction pathways with mineral elements in particular k and na in the soil should be considered in further studies therefore future research should seek to understand the influence of salt stress on plant roots using foxtail millet cultivars exposed to both water and salinity stress this could help improve the understanding of the osmoregulation mechanisms of foxtail millet and potentially lead to the development of cultivars that can better tolerate these types of stressors declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflicts of interest

8918,salinity and water deficit are major abiotic environmental stresses affecting crop quality in arid and semi arid areas particularly salinity stress induces several detrimental physiological effects on crops including toxic ion accumulation disturbed osmotic potential and reduced grain yield however how salinity stress reduces growth loss and maintains water productivity wp by

salinity threshold drought data availability the authors do not have permission to share data 1 introduction a stable amount of arable area is key for ensuring food security in a country worldwide saline soil covers an area of 405 million ha which is approximately one third of the irrigated agricultural land irshad et al 2022 in the bohai lowland of the north china plain ncp it is one of the principal types of low yield soil covers approximately 36 million ha zhang 2018 huo et al 2017 in this region soil with salinity levels of 1 0 3 0 g kg 1 and 3 0 5 0 g kg 1 accounts for 55 8 and 0 7 of the total area respectively wang et al 2012 salinization affects the ecological environment and restricts sustainable land use development and agricultural production the development and utilization of coastal saline alkali soil are great significance for agricultural development foxtail millet setaria italica is an environment friendly crop with high drought stress resistance short life cycle dual grain and forage use wide adaptability and low water consumption making it the prospective model crop for investigating the effects of salinity plants additionally it has been demonstrated to have the highest water productivity wp among all crops that to provide the support for high water efficient agriculture zou et al 2019 hence it will become the crucial crop for the adjustment of planting structures in groundwater depleted regions of the ncp and for the utilization of coastal saline alkali soil in saline alkali land crops usually face the dual pressures of drought and salinity zhao et al 2016 in stressful environments plants adjust and improve their growth and development by altering their multifarious molecular cellular biochemical and physiological processes taramani et al 2020 under soil salinity and water deficit plants respond by osmotic regulation as their fundamental physiological process which is mainly carried out by osmotic regulators such as k proline and soluble sugars shao et al 2006 capell et al 2004 li et al 2003 plant drought resistance and osmotic adjustment ability are usually evaluated using these small molecules as prominent physiological indicators wang et al 2003 yordanov et al 2003 plants can absorb water from water deficient soil by increasing the content of osmotic regulators the proline content is closely related to the soil water stress threshold and plant drought resistance shao et al 2006 various drought related indicators such as cell membrane stability osmotic pressure naturalize tendency water potential and morphological characteristics are used to evaluate plant stress tolerance priyanka et al 2021 na accumulation which is followed by inhibition the absorption of k and ca from the soil is one of the unfavourable responses of salinity on plants brini et al 2009 then causes crop production reduction marcinska et al 2013 as it is an important drought tolerant crop species studying the characteristics of salt and water tolerance of foxtail millet in saline alkali areas is necessary for agricultural and research purposes however few studies have investigated its threshold degree of water and salt stress and the mechanism underlying its high stress resistance from the perspective of plant osmotic potential thus the aims for the study we carried out were to 1 investigate the effect of salt stress on flag leaf osmoregulation grain yield and water utilization of foxtail millet plants grown under drought stress or well watered conditions and 2 determine the soil salinity threshold for millet grain yield and wp under varying water conditions our findings will establish a scientific and theoretical foundation for the successful planting and cultivation of foxtail millet

experiment conditions included two soil water levels w1 45 5 fc and w2 75 5 fc and four soil salinity s levels 1 0 1 6 2 2 and 2 8 g kg 1 which were equal to 0 31 0 50 0 69 and 0 88 ds m respectively the salinity gradient interval was too large to determine the salinity threshold for millet growth and water utilization therefore to acquire more detailed information it was adjusted to 0 2 g kg 1 in

respectively the plant density was 200 grains per barrel and the sowing depth was 3 5 cm 2 3 sampling methods and measurements six replicates were used for each combination of soil salinity and water level three barrels were used to sample and measure the contents of osmotic regulators salt ions of flag leaves and aboveground biomass whereas the other three barrels were used for the determination of grain yield and yield components 2 3 1 survival rate the number of seedlings was counted 3 and 6 days after sowing das afterward it was counted every 6 days until 30 das the survival rate was calculated as the ratio of the seedling number counted each time to the number of seeds sown under the corresponding treatment 2 3 2 osmoregulation substances of flag leaves three flag leaves were

3 1 survival rate the survival rate was significantly reduced by salinity under both water stress and well watered conditions fig 2 in the 2021 foxtail millet growing season the survival rate first increased at 0 12 das and then decreased at 12 24 das except for treatments s2 4 s2 6 and s2 8 at 3 das no plants survived under w1 and w2 conditions in treatments s1 8 s2 8 but the survival rate for

water conditions helped delay the maximum gap in leaves which the maximum gap appeared in s1 4 28 79 at flowering stage for w1 and in s1 6 19 03 at grain filling stage for w2 3 2 4 the k na and k na ratio in foxtail millet flag leaves with increasing soil salinity the na content significantly increased and the k content and k na ratio significantly decreased fig 6 the na content was lower in w2 2 94 7 03 and 7 74 9 96 for s1 8 and s2 0 respectively than in w1 from the heading to the grain filling stages compared with s1 0 the k content significantly increased by 5 39 19 13 4 50 20 21 and 6 32 23 24 for s1 6 s1 8 and s2 0 respectively except for s1 6 at the flowering stage compared with s1 0 the k na ratio significantly increased at grain filling stage for s1 6 s2 0 3 3 aboveground biomass yield and yield components the aboveground biomass significantly increased in w2 compared to that in w1 at the flowering stage in both growing seasons in 2020 it increased by 31 09 45 20 and 301 11 in s1 0 s1 6 s2 2 respectively and in 2021 it increased by 15 31 22 10 28 48 42 73 66 31 67 82 respectively in treatments s1 0 to s2 2 fig 7 the decline range increased with the increase in soil salinity the aboveground biomass significantly decreased 8 71 81 16 in treatments s1 0 s2 0 in w1 than in w2 at the flowering and mature stages moreover at the mature stage in 2021 aboveground biomass was decreased in w1 whereas it was stable for treatments s1 0 s1 4 in w2 soil salinity significantly affected the grain weight per spike spike numbers foxtail millet yield and hi table 2 the grain weight per spike 27 15 90 08 and 3 67 64 78 in w1 and w2 respectively and spike number per barrel 32 61 97 83 and 6 68 95 83 in w1 and w2 respectively were significantly lower in s1 6 and s2 2 than in s1 0 compared with w1 w2 caused an increase in grain yield 12 58 110 85 in 2020 and 1 54 97 20 in 2021 but a decrease in hi 1 66 7 25 in 2020 3 4 evapotranspiration the evapotranspiration of foxtail millet decreased with increasing soil salinity in both w1 and w2 except for s1 8 in w1 in 2021 fig 8 compared with s1 0 the evapotranspiration in s1 6 s2 2 and s2 8 significantly decreased by 8 36 72 70 in w1 except for s1 6 and by 4 69 52 44 in w2 in both growing seasons 3 5 water productivity the wpy and wpbm were significantly low when water was applied table 3 in w2 wpy decreased by 9 23 17 30 in 2020 and by 1 54 33 72 in 2021 except for s2 2 and wpbm decreased by 2 36 5 79 in 2020 and by 5 88 47 49 in 2021 compared with w1 in 2021 compared with treatment s1 0 treatments s1 8 s2 2 significantly decreased wpy by 16 91 87 92 under w1 condition and by 23 49 78 52 under w2 and wpbm by 19 09 62 86 under w1 condition and by 18 96 74 18 under w2 3 6 combined effects of soil water content and soil salinity on yield and wpy yield and soil salinity exhibited a quadratic relationship fig 9 according to which sy50 occurred at 1 87 g kg 1 soil salinity under w1 and at 1 91 g kg 1 soil salinity under w2 the yield differences between w1 and w2 showed the following relationships with soil salinity in 2021 yw2 w1 130 69x2 329 05x 112 67 therefore the yield loss of foxtail millet under w2 was 22 67 g m 2 lower than that under w1 with an increase of 1 0 g kg 1 soil salinity at the 1 0 g kg 1 level the wpy differences between w1 and w2 showed the following relationship with soil salinity in 2021 wpw2 w1 0 35x2 1 62x 1 80 the wpy was the same for w1 and w2 when soil salinity was 1 85 g kg 1 consequently the wpy loss of foxtail millet in w2 was 0 53 kg m 3 higher than that in w1 with an increase of 1 0 g kg 1 soil salinity at the 1 0 g kg 1 level 4 discussion the grain yield and survival rate are representative agronomic indicators of salinity tolerance increasing the plant survival rate is crucial for enhancing crop yield in saline alkali soils in the present study the survival rate of foxtail millet in s1 2 s1 8 was lower under w2 fig 2 than under w1 this suggests that providing additional water during the survival period of foxtail millet was not necessary to promote its survival in contrast higher soil water content reduced plant survival in soils with lower salinity 1 2 1 8 g kg 1 however with the increase in salinity more water was needed to maintain the normal survival rate this phenomenon may be explained by two reasons the first reason is that foxtail millet absorbed only 26 of water for its weight development during germination far below that reported to be absorbed by maize 48 wheat 45 and sorghum 40 zhang 2007 therefore higher soil moisture levels may impede foxtail millet survival the second reason is that extreme environmental conditions inhibit plant growth which is rapidly restored when conditions become favorable yuan et al 2022 thus plants grown in soils with high salinity show an improved survival rate upon the improvement of the swc roots are the first organ to come into direct contact with the high salt concentrations in the soil therefore excessive na accumulation in roots impairs root development and lateral root formation qin et al 2019 wang et al 2020 in the present study the salt may have leached deeper into the soil with irrigation to maintain the high soil water content thereby decreasing the root na content and promoting survival the accumulation of na in plants inhibits their intake of other essential macronutrients such as k and ca from the soil brini et al 2009 moreover chlorophyll synthesis and photosynthesis are also adversely affected by na accumulation in plants jiang et al 2017 which may have resulted in leaf senescence and decreased plant aboveground biomass and yield in the present study our results showed that maintaining higher field capacity decreased the na accumulation under higher soil salinity which resulted in an optimal k na ratio houshmand et al 2005 mahlooji et al 2018 root cells resist salt toxicity by mechanisms that restrict na uptake mainly by down regulating the na influx at the soil root boundary via non selective cation channels or high affinity potassium transporters hanin et al 2016 another study also showed that under saline conditions salinity tolerant plants maintain low na concentrations in the cytosol of their root and shoot cells through na exclusion extrusion or compartmentation munns et al 2020 as another salt tolerance mechanism the presence of proline can enhance plant salt tolerance by protecting the cell membrane and enzymes munns 2002 which restricted the na uptake in the present study furthermore water deficit and salinity lead to negative reversible or irreversible physiological alterations during plant development plants employ various biochemical and physiological mechanisms at the cellular and molecular levels to adapt to different environmental stresses hussein et al 2022 swati et al 2011 osmotic stress impedes water absorption by the plant roots consequently the root cells adopt osmoregulation processes such as the accumulation of soluble compounds to support plant growth hasegawa 2000 siddiqui et al 2017 therefore studying the fundamental molecular mechanisms of the formation and function of salt tolerance structures in plants could help understand and improve the ability of crops to counteract environmental stress yuan et al 2021 our results showed that higher salt salinity resulted in greater yield differences between the two soil water conditions fig 9 according to the obtained equations fig 9 sy50 occurred at 1 87 g kg 1 soil salinity under w1 and at 1 91 g kg 1 soil salinity under w2 condition barely offsetting 0 04 g kg 1 salt toxicity when increased by 30 fc adversity stress negatively impacts plant nutrient uptake thereby reducing plant growth grain yield and quality ma et al 2021 crop cultivation and yield in saline soils are limited mainly by the reduction in plant physiological and biochemical abilities which negatively affect their ability to absorb nutrients and water as well as their photosynthetic rates perez lopez et al 2013 an appropriate n nutritional status can improve millet tolerance to drought and enhance certain morphological traits thereby increasing its yields cossani et al 2012 hussain et al 2015 reported a 36 56 and 42 decrease in n p and k uptake respectively in crops under salinity stress which may be the main reason for crop yield reduction under salt and drought stress taramani et al 2020 reported that a significant reduction in pearl millet height evapotranspiration proline content and na k ratio resulted from limited nutrient uptake under both water and salinity stress conditions which supported the results of our study 5 conclusion this study investigated the relationship between grain yield and soil water utilization in foxtail millet by examining its osmoregulation mechanisms in addition to providing new insights into saline soil utilization this study highlights that the threshold of the yield half attenuation concentration for foxtail millet was under 45 and 75 field capacity and salinity conditions when soil salinity exceeded 1 85 g kg 1 the improved water content could counteract the effect of salt for wpy when subjected to water and salt stress foxtail millet induced osmoregulation and inhibited soil evapotranspiration which decreased yield and wp mainly because of the low aboveground biomass this study focused on flag leaf osmoregulation and soil water consumption in foxtail millet and did not focus on root development under water and salt stress the relationship of root signal transduction pathways with mineral elements in particular k and na in the soil should be considered in further studies therefore future research should seek to understand the influence of salt stress on plant roots using foxtail millet cultivars exposed to both water and salinity stress this could help improve the understanding of the osmoregulation mechanisms of foxtail millet and potentially lead to the development of cultivars that can better tolerate these types of stressors declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflicts of interest

8919,applying nitrogen fertilizer is commonly used to increase yields of surface irrigated crops despite often low application efficiency ae and distribution uniformity du surface fertigation the application of fertiliser dissolved in irrigation water is a promising technique for improved on farm performance this study evaluated surface fertigation strategies in a field experiment and by modelling with winsrfr the field experiment was conducted in the north china plain in 2017 2019 the aim was to test different practices and for model validation then to develop optimisation scenarios the study found first that conventional practices resulted in low ae of irrigation around 40 in wheat season and 60 in maize season du however was satisfactory in both wheat and maize seasons averaging 80 second surge border irrigation showed no significant advantage in terms of performance compared to the conventional practice of continuous border irrigation third the winsrfr model offered satisfactory accuracy compared to field measured data and soil infiltration parameters such as the kostiakov k showed temporal variation during the crop seasons fourth improved fertigation scenarios were developed by optimising the cut off ratio in tandem with changes in border length and fertigation timing the optimised strategies resulted in ae and du increasing to some 90 keywords surface fertigation border irrigation surge irrigation winsrfr data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface irrigation is widely used for cereal crops such as wheat and maize due to its ease of use lack of high tech components and relatively low investment cost however surface irrigation can also pose problems including non uniform water distribution and low application efficiency y li et al 2020 on surface irrigated fields broadcasting is the most common method of fertiliser application fertiliser is thus spread over a field before irrigation to be dissolved and redistributed with the flow of irrigation water zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013b while easy this method has disadvantages such as volatilisation of nitrogen fertiliser while exposed to the air and irregular field distribution due to the non uniform flush of irrigation water bai et al 2013 these issues coupled with the deep percolation experienced on many irrigated fields bring a substantial risk of both fertiliser losses and nitrogen pollution ebrahimian et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2019 surface fertigation is a method by which a dissolved fertiliser solution is added to irrigation water it is considered an advancement on the fertiliser broadcasting method the advantages of surface fertigation are reduced labour and input costs while theoretically the technique provides a more uniform distribution of n throughout a surface irrigated field ebrahimian et al 2014 extensive research has examined the on farm performance of surface fertigation and related topics abbasi et al 2012 dai et al 2017 garcía saldaña landeros sánchez 2019 with indicators of fertigation performance being n application efficiency and n distribution uniformity across a field zerihun et al 2003 some studies have explored optimised application strategies to improve fertigation performance in terms of the transportation of solute in the water during irrigation events adamsen et al 2005 other studies have evaluated the nitrogen balance based on n transport and transformation processes in the soil after fertigation crevoisier et al 2008 each of these lines of research found that fertigation performance depended on irrigation performance as the distribution uniformity of fertiliser was close to that of the irrigation water therefore improving surface irrigation performance seems a primary means to enhance fertigation performance bautista and schlegel 2020 one method proposed to improve surface irrigation performance is the surge technique herein water is applied to a field intermittently rather than continuously kifle et al 2017 wallender and rayej 1985 the method has been promoted in many areas and is widely used with furrow farming systems as it is easy to automate and presumed to be water saving adusumilli et al 2016 horst et al 2007 previous studies on surge irrigation focused mainly on the mechanism of how infiltration changes and then the proper operation of the surge technique onishi et al 2019 research on surge fertigation however is lacking with the exception of studies using the surge irrigation fertigation uniformity model sifum to explore nitrogen distribution uniformity in surge irrigated furrow fields for high medium and low intake soils boldt et al 1994 modelling is a helpful tool for analysing irrigation system performance several models have been developed to simulate water and solute movement and evaluate irrigation and fertigation performance brunetti et al 2018 ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 fuentes et al 2022 hamdi ahmadabad et al 2020 zhang et al 2013a these models can also be used to explore on farm practices to improve irrigation and fertigation performance particularly winsrfr a surface irrigation hydraulic simulation model has been widely used in recent years bautista et al 2009 mazarei et al 2020 salahou salahou et al 2018 applied winsrfr to determine the optimum inflow cut off distance under different inflow rate conditions in closed ended border irrigation systems nie nie et al 2017 analysed the effects of variability in soil infiltration properties on the performance of closed ended border irrigation by comparing winsrfr simulation results to field measurements however the model is susceptible to the parameters calibrated from field data such as soil infiltration properties derived by inverse modelling moreover no fixed set of parameters in the infiltration model can accurately determine the best application practices in all scenarios due to crop differences and field variation bai et al 2010 mansuri 2018 xu xu et al 2019 studied temporal variation in such parameters in western china finding that soil infiltration rates varied by irrigation season and this impacted irrigation system performance mazarei mazarei et al 2021 used winsrfr to evaluate the eﬀects of temporal variability in inﬁltration and roughness coefficients on water movement and irrigation performance the north china plain is one of china s most critical grain producing regions but faces severe groundwater depletion and diffuse pollution due to poor irrigation and fertiliser application practices on the region s many smallholder fields wang et al 2019 most farmers here use border irrigation and fertiliser broadcasting method y li et al 2020 as elsewhere however their efficiency is low previous research on border irrigation systems found that system performance was affected by border size slope inflow rate hydraulic roughness and soil infiltration properties anwar et al 2016 khanna and malano 2006 some studies nie et al 2021 found that cut off time the time from the start of irrigation to the end affected irrigation performance the most while others found optimisation of border size chen et al 2012 and inflow rate liu et al 2020 to be essential to improve border irrigation performance bai bai et al 2010 also found that hydraulic roughness and soil infiltration properties could be optimised through field experiment trials however in most cases farmers fields proved challenging to modify as field layout largely depended on physical conditions and water source location furthermore pumps had to be upgraded if a variable inflow rate was needed bringing increased investment costs and often greater energy consumption limited research has considered the challenges farmers face in optimising irrigation practices in their fields additionally most research on surface fertigation has been limited to a single crop without considering the usual plant rotations such as the winter wheat summer maize rotation practiced by farmers in the north china plain the current study investigated the performance of surface fertigation to improve irrigation and fertilisation practices in farmers fields specifically its objectives were two 1 to assess irrigation and fertigation performance with a field experiment and by modelling for the prevailing crop rotation in the north china plain and 2 to develop improved application strategies for border fertigation considering conventional practices and the real world conditions on farmers fields 2 methodology for better uptake of the farming practices developed by research it is helpful to start by considering farmers current practices and conducting field experiments to determine how these practices might be improved following this approach the present study sought to develop surface fertigation practices appropriate for farmers to use in their fields fig 1 we followed a stepwise procedure in step 1 we analysed farmers conventional practices and preferences by conducting participatory research in farmers fields including group discussions with farmers and monitoring programme in one of their fields this step was reported by sun et al 2022 and the outcome of that study served as the basis for step 2 based on the monitoring results from step 1 we conducted the field experiment in which surface fertigation was applied using self developed fertigation equipment fig 2 lower left in step 3 we used the data collected during the field experiment to calibrate and validate a simulation model in winsrfr in particular we used the model to gain insight into the performance of the experimental practices various fertigation scenarios were developed in step 4 considering the cut off ratio border length and fertigation timing by discussing these with area farmers we drew inferences on feasible practices for application in their fields 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 experiment site and crop calendar the field experiment was conducted at an experiment station next to the monitored farmer field in the southern north china plain 35 18 n 113 54 e the dominant cropping pattern here was a winter wheat summer maize rotation which was representative of the region as a whole the soil at the experiment site was classified as silt loam and loam to a depth of 100 cm which was determined to be the effective root zone the soil bulk density was similar throughout this 100 cm layer with a mean value of 1 49 g cm3 gong et al 2019 the field capacity and saturated soil water content were approximately 0 30 and 0 42 cm3 cm3 respectively 2 1 2 experimental set up by reflecting the actual conditions in the monitored farmer field 247 m in length with 2 1 m width and the farmers preferences in the area we implemented a winter wheat summer maize rotation field experiment from 2017 to 2019 also a blocked ended border irrigation system was formed with strips measuring 200 m 3 5 m and an average longitudinal slope of 1 1000 plots a to j see fig 2 between these borders a 2 m wide strip was left unused to minimise interference from adjacent treatment plots before the wheat and maize were planted the field was levelled and soil ridges were constructed according to the designed border size after the borders were formed the seed was sown and compound synthetic fertiliser was applied using the deep placement method two irrigation methods were used in the field experiment continuous irrigation in which water was applied in one go per irrigation event and surge irrigation in which water was applied intermittently in three phases per event of the ten plots a d was designated for surge irrigation and e j for continuous irrigation continuous border irrigation is the conventional irrigation method farmers use on their fields the irrigation water was supplied by groundwater and a gauge was used to measure the inflow rate at each irrigation event inflow rates differed slightly from event to event because of fluctuations in the groundwater table and pump capacity for each irrigation event advance and recession times were recorded with a stopwatch every 20 m from border head to end for continuous irrigation the distance based cut off ratio defined as the distance proportion of the border when inflow was cut off was fixed at 0 95 in the wheat season and 0 90 in the maize season for surge irrigation the same cut off ratios were used for the wheat and maize seasons that is 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 respectively for the three phases in the surge irrigation events during the field experiment 10 irrigation events were executed including 7 fertigation events over 2 years and 4 growing seasons fig 3 presents the irrigation schedule and crop calendar for the fertigation events urea with good water solubility was applied with a total nitrogen content of 46 the application rate was set at 90 kg ha or 135 kg ha according to the crop n requirement on these dates fertigation was implemented by first pouring the required amount of urea into the storage tank and then adding the required volume of water to prepare a urea solution a fertiliser injection opening was placed in the irrigation pipeline fig 2 during the fertigation events a small peristaltic pump was used to transfer the fertiliser solution from the tank and inject it into the irrigation pipeline from there it flowed into the border with the irrigation water to explore the effect of different fertigation operation strategies on performance we varied the number of injection pulses in the various irrigation events for example we used five pulses in the fertigation event in march 2018 and three pulses in july 2018 appendices 1 and 2 present details for all irrigation and fertigation events though our fertigation strategy differed per event we used the same strategy for each event s continuous and surge applications in other words the initial fertiliser solution concentration c 0 and injection rate q in were set uniformly on the same date for both the continuous and surge plots five sampling points were set out in each test border at 10 50 100 150 and 190 m from the border head see fig 2 soil samples were collected using an auger at each measuring point along each border with a sampling interval of 20 cm from the surface to 2 m deep we collected soil samples before each irrigation event and 2 and 7 days after the soil water content was determined with the oven drying method according to other research tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 the urea applied in the soil rapidly transforms into ammonium nitrogen most ammonium nitrogen is then converted into nitrate nitrogen in concentrations much higher than the ammonium therefore we analysed only the nitrate nitrogen content in soils after fertigation using the automated discrete analyser cleverchem anna dechem tech germany 2 2 modelling with winsrfr 2 2 1 model description and data requirement winsrfr developed by the usda agricultural research service is a hydraulic flow model for analysing and evaluating surface irrigation systems it offers four main functionalities event analysis to assess surface irrigation performance based on the model inversion of soil infiltration and hydraulic roughness operation analysis to analyse and assess performance trade offs between different combinations of flow rates and cut off times with known border dimensions slope and soil characteristics physical design to optimise performance according to an irrigation system s dimensions length and width simulation world to simulate surface irrigation scenarios the simulation world is the core engine of the modelling package in winsrfr 5 1 simulation of fertigation and surge irrigation is possible at the advanced user level bautista et al 2016 furthermore the modelling package allows the selection of several infiltration models this study used one of the most widely applied infiltration functions for surface irrigation the two parameter kostiakov infiltration equation 1 i k t α where i is the cumulative depth of infiltration mm t is the infiltration time hr k is the fitted coefficient parameter mm h and α is the fitted exponent parameter there are various options for modelling overland water flow this study used the zero inertia form of the one dimensional shallow water unsteady open channel flow equation winsrfr s newly released fertigation module simulates solute transport with surface water flow and its ultimate distribution along the length of a field surface it assumes that the fertiliser is injected at the field inlet at a known flux q in l min and concentration c 0 g l mixing perfectly with the irrigation water before application bautista and schlegel 2020 our study obtained the hydraulic and infiltration parameters using inverse simulation in the event analysis module of winsrfr merriam keller post irrigation volume balance analysis which relies on water advance and recession data was chosen in the module because of its reliability first we provided the measured data table 1 for system geometry inflow rate cut off time and advance and recession time then we selected a reasonable value for manning s roughness according to the default value in the model after that an initial estimate was set for α in the range of similar studies wang 2018 and the model estimated the k value after running the model we compared simulated advance and recession curves with observed curves the n and α were calibrated by rerunning the model until good fits were achieved between the two curves then the parameters were obtained by the so called trial and error method 2 2 2 model performance criteria the simulated advance and recession times were compared to the measured values using statistical criteria to evaluate model accuracy for such evaluation krause krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 recommended the use of the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and the peak weighted root mean square error prmse appendix 3 presents the formula for these 2 3 performance indicators and data analysis the indicators used to evaluate irrigation fertigation performance were application efficiency ae distribution uniformity of water du w and distribution uniformity of fertiliser du f burt et al 1997 zerihun et al 2003 these were defined as follows 2 ae volume of water added to the root zone total volume of water applied 3 du w average of the lowest 25 of applied irrigation depths average applied irrigation depth in the whole field 4 du f average of the lowest 25 of a pplied fertiliser amount average applied fertiliser amount in the whole field irrigation depth w mm in the soil profile was calculated based on soil moisture observations before and after each irrigation event as follows 5 w i 1 n ρ i θ i h i where ρ i and h i are the soil bulk density and soil depth of soil layer i θ i is the change in soil gravimetric content after irrigation and n is 10 for wheat and 5 for maize one way analysis of variation anova was used to test the temporal variability of the soil infiltration and hydraulic roughness parameters statistically significant differences were identified using least significant difference lsd tests at a 5 probability level infiltration profiles and contour maps were used to visualise water and fertiliser distribution in the soil along the borders 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation and fertigation performance in the experiment table 2 presents all irrigation and fertigation performance indicators calculated from the measured soil moisture and nitrate content the average values of ae in wheat season 45 for continuous and 42 for surge treatments were lower than those in maize season 61 for continuous and 52 for surge treatments this is because more water was applied in the wheat irrigation events than in the maize irrigations for distribution uniformity du w a mean value beyond 80 was found for wheat and maize possibly due to sufficient water being stored in the root zone du f was slightly worse than du w ranging from 61 to 71 but followed the same change trend as du w because the fertiliser was perfectly mixed with the water before irrigation and applied within the irrigation stream du f and du w were highly related another study z t li et al 2020 similarly found that nitrate nitrogen was easily dissolved and moved with infiltrated water however du f was lower in the maize season of 2019 this was because in the jul 2019 and aug 2019 maize fertigation events only one fertigation injection pulse was used fertigation performance therefore decreased in terms of uniformity especially in the surge fertigation test strips to 55 in jul 2019 and 49 in aug 2019 by comparison in the sep 2018 event du f was 80 and 84 respectively for continuous and surge fertigation it is therefore recommended to apply fertigation using multiple injection pulses if possible fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of soil nitrate nitrogen before and after continuous and surge fertigation after fertigation the nitrate nitrogen content in the topsoil layer 0 40 cm was uniformly distributed increasing gradually from the bottom to the top of the borders as seen in the figure soil nitrate nitrogen content increased more after continuous fertigation than surge fertigation and exhibited more uniformity in the continuous treatment test strips in a previous study sun et al 2022 we found that the conventional fertiliser broadcasting method produced a non uniform distribution of nitrogen in the field as irrigation water flushed the solid fertiliser particles on the soil surface to the tail end of the blocked ended borders bai et al 2013 the uniform distribution of nitrogen in each soil layer after fertigation suggests that surface fertigation yielded better fertiliser application in the field 3 2 modelling with winsrfr 3 2 1 temporal variation of soil infiltration at field scale we conducted 10 irrigation fertigation events in 2018 and 2019 for each event the surge method was applied in plots a d and the continuous method in plots e j because roughness and infiltration rates in the topsoil layer varied in the plots with surge irrigation we used only data from the continuous irrigation plots for inversion modelling with the measured advance and recession times we calibrated the infiltration and roughness parameters by trial and error appendix 3 and validated the winsrfr model the statistical criteria indicated that the values for hydraulic roughness n and the kostiakov k and α were well calibrated recession times showed low accuracy likely due to observational error during the field experiment recession times were difficult to accurately determine under the growing crop and with an unsteady water pool walker 2005 table 3 presents the anova results for temporal variation with a confidence level of 0 05 based on these we can conclude that there was significant temporal variation during the growing season and between the crop years for one thing wheat and maize differed in plant densities and land preparation the value of hydraulic roughness was smaller for maize 0 13 on average than for wheat 0 16 on average furthermore rainfall was intensive in summer coinciding with the maize growing season see fig 3 therefore the initial soil moisture was higher in the maize growing season than in the wheat growing season compared to wheat the kostiakov k value was lower for maize 63 73 mm h on average while the kostiakov α was higher for maize 0 704 on average mean k and α values for wheat were 115 77 mm h and 0 553 respectively both results are in the same range as findings from other studies bo et al 2012 chen et al 2012 from the analysis of variance we can also conclude that there were differences between the 2018 and 2019 wheat seasons the α values for wheat were higher in 2018 than in 2019 similarly maize α was higher in 2018 because the rainfall was more plentiful in 2018 788 mm compared to 2019 418 mm this significantly influenced soil infiltrability related mainly to surface seal formation liu et al 2011 such effects thus need to be considered when optimising the design and operation of surface irrigation systems not only concerning irrigation scheduling but also in relation to soil infiltration properties different types of rainfall could influence infiltration properties and therefore affect irrigation management practices in gravity systems javadi et al 2019 3 2 2 fertigation performance by simulation we calculated performance indicators for the fertigation events based on the kostiakov parameters determined from the event analysis in winsrfr table 4 the application efficiency ae for wheat was less than that for maize for both the continuous and the surge treatments the same was found for the distribution uniformity of irrigation water du w and fertiliser du f the results aligned with the indicators calculated with the field measured data see table 3 they show that performance in terms of ae and du w was better in the maize season than in the wheat season from the simulation we also know that percolation dp was much higher in the wheat events averaging 141 mm for continuous fertigation and 142 mm for surge fertigation compared to just 38 mm and 57 mm respectively for maize see table 4 further we can conclude that the performance of the surge treatments did not differ from that of the continuous treatments as ae du w and du f were not improved these averaged respectively 39 70 and 66 for surge fertigated wheat compared to 39 81 and 71 on average respectively for continuous fertigated wheat results for the maize season were similar the unreasonable cut off ratio for each phase of the surge event likely explains this field experiments elsewhere ding 2006 found that surge irrigation can intensify deep seepage at the head of a border with insufficient seepage at the tail end if no proper cut off time was set thus we can conclude that the performance of surge irrigation is highly dependent on a rational operational strategy otherwise surge irrigation may not yield any improvement over continuous border irrigation from our results there would seem to be no need to replace conventional continuous border irrigation with surge irrigation especially as the latter is more complicated fig 5 presents simulated water infiltration profiles along the border for wheat and maize s continuous and surge irrigation fertigation events infiltration was more significant for wheat than maize confirming the wheat season s lower ae and higher percolation depth dp furthermore considerable percolation occurred at the head of the border likely due to the low inflow rate and unreasonable cut off ratio used mahdizadeh et al 2014 for maize fig 5c water infiltration was more uniform but a bit more water was stored at the tail end of the border indicating that the cut off time was slightly extended the better performance of maize irrigation fertigation can be attributed to the fact that the kostiakov k parameter was smaller in maize season than in wheat season resulting in lower soil infiltration capacity while reducing irrigation fertigation time also this implies that a reduced cut off time should be considered for maize irrigation fertigation the infiltration depth was the same for the continuous and surge events for both the wheat fig 5a and c and maize fig 5b and d seasons however the distribution along the border was uneven in the surge treatments except in the event of march 2018 in most cases the plots were not well irrigated in the surge treatments as too little water reached the tail end of the border and there was excessive percolation at the head the visualised information further indicates that the surge irrigation technique relies on a rational choice of the cut off time for each surge phase otherwise its performance may not be comparable to conventional border irrigation using the fertigation module in winsrfr we analysed the fertigation events in terms of fertiliser density distribution in the irrigation stream along the border on the fertigated plots where the continuous application technique was used the applied density for all of the multi pulse fertiliser injection events showed a smooth and stable distribution implying excellent fertigation performance fig 6a in july 2019 however the distribution curve jumps up and then falls at a distance of 160 m this is mainly because in this event there was only one fertiliser injection pulse near the end of the fertigation event this was also indicated by the du f for which the minimum value of 57 was calculated in this case fertiliser free water probably reached the end of the field it began receding from the blocked ended border which then caused an accumulation of the fertiliser solution near the end of the field we can conclude that more injection pulses would have produced a more uniform fertiliser application over the land that means if possible fertigation should be applied during the entire irrigation event confirming our experimental findings for the surge application too multi pulse fertiliser injection performed better than the single pulse fertigation event july 2019 however the distribution density fluctuated more in all surge fertigation treatments than in continuous ones this indicates that surge fertigation was not advantageous compared to the continuous technique needless to say in all of the surge fertigation events fertiliser distribution rapidly decreased near the end of the field this may have been due to the lack of water reaching the end of the border 3 3 optimisation of irrigation and fertigation operation the above analysis shows that cut off time and fertigation application timing have a considerable impact on the application efficiency ae and distribution uniformity du as well as applied irrigation water depth dapp these findings align with the conclusion reached in other studies that operations strategy greatly influences performance anwar et al 2016 mazarei et al 2020 we therefore explored options regarding operational variables to improve on farm performance by simulation in winsrfr as surge fertigation showed no distinct advantage compared to continuous fertigation we only developed scenarios for continuous boder fertigation field size and inflow rate are both variables not easily changed in reality to improve irrigation performance thus we set the border width and slope to reflect actual field conditions in the simulation using the 3 5 m width and 1 slope of the experiment field and a 2 m width and 2 5 slope to represent a typical farmer s field the inflow rate was set at 12 5 l s being the regular pump capacity in the region in addition four specific border lengths were considered in the simulation 200 m 150 m 100 m and 50 m for the experiment field and 250 m 200 m 150 m and 100 m for the farmer s field reflecting preferences of local farmers and actual field conditions as reported in the participatory study sun et al 2022 as the advance and recession times differed for each event due to the temporal variability of soil infiltration and roughness the cut off time varied for each irrigation event the cut off ratio was therefore considered in the simulation also it should be noted that full irrigation was considered in the scenarios rather than deficit irrigation that is the applied irrigation depth has to meet the required irrigation depth along the entire plot mean values were taken per crop for the infiltration parameters k and α and roughness n fig 7 presents the performance indicators ae and du and the applied irrigation water depth dapp for the different scenarios specified in table 5 for the field experiment conditions appendix 4 presents the indicators for the scenarios applying farmers field conditions generally speaking ae declined with increasing cut off ratios meaning increased irrigation time du and dapp in contrast rose with increased cut off ratios understandably when the irrigation time was increased more water was applied to the field resulting in a larger dapp and reduced ae also the irrigation water was distributed more uniformly in the root zone using more water we can conclude that limited improvement was achieved by optimising the cut off time a better method to improve performance might be by changing the border length and width of the field and if possible the field slope irrigation performed better under maize with a high ae found for all border lengths for wheat however only the shorter length plots showed good performance the generally poor irrigation performance for wheat was due to the high soil infiltration rate and roughness which resulted in significant infiltration in the short maize plots 100 m and 50 m a cut off ratio of at least 0 9 was needed to achieve the required irrigation depth while a cut off ratio of 0 8 yielded good performance for the long borders however the irrigation performance was low for the long wheat border regardless of adjustments made in the cut off ratio we can thus conclude that reducing border length is a useful first step to improving wheat irrigation performance table 5 presents the scenarios investigated for optimising irrigation strategy for the experiment and farmer s fields for wheat decreasing border length and the cut off ratio was generally effective in improving irrigation performance however for maize the trend was less clear cut especially in the farmer s field from m250 2 to m100 2 this was because the field had a steeper slope compared to the experiment field and the soil infiltration capacity and roughness were lower than for wheat this meant the irrigation stream flowed relatively fast resulting in insufficient and less uniform infiltration along the border these effects were more pronounced when the cut off ratio was reduced because the applied water decreased causing an irrigation depth shortage in which the required depth could not be satisfied along the border this indicates that reducing the border length can be a feasible method to increase performance for fields with high roughness and infiltration rates wheat fields or flat fields experiment fields overall these findings suggest using short border lengths for wheat irrigation w50 1 and w100 2 and long border lengths for maize irrigation m150 1 and m250 2 then a desirable ae and du can be achieved of around 90 for both in addition the applied irrigation water depth dapp can be significantly reduced to 94 mm for wheat and 80 mm for maize but note that this irrigation depth was calculated for full irrigation to a fixed required depth future research is recommended that considers changing irrigation requirements dependent on a combination of crop growth weather and soil water conditions after we optimised irrigation we developed fertigation scenarios these were named first applying fertigation only in the first half of an irrigation event second applying fertigation only in the second half of an irrigation event and whole applying fertigation during an entire irrigation event fig 8 presents the fertigation performance du f obtained for these scenarios under the experiment field conditions fertigation during the whole treatment event provided the best distribution uniformity around 90 for both wheat and maize our simulation results thus confirm our findings from the field experiment in which du f was higher when more fertiliser injection pulses were used the simulation results are also consistent with previous studies abbasi et al 2012 adamsen et al 2005 dai et al 2017 table 6 presents the different irrigation and fertigation scenarios including conventional practice on the farmer s field the experiment field and the optimised simulated scenarios for both the field experiment conditions and farmer s field conditions it can be concluded that fertigation performed better than broadcasting regarding fertiliser distribution uniformity sun et al 2022 furthermore applying fertigation during the entire irrigation event was the best strategy achieving a du f of around 90 reducing border length and cut off ratio were found to be efficient strategies to achieve good irrigation performance especially in wheat season it is thus recommended to use short borders to irrigate wheat fields a possible approach would be to split long borders into several sections and irrigate each section separately to improve distribution uniformity it is recommended to apply fertigation throughout the entire irrigation event however in practice it is difficult to apply fertigation constantly for any length of time due to limited tank volume this suggests the need to develop improved fertigation equipment or a giant fertigation tank that can provide a constant supply of fertiliser solution during an entire irrigation event although the practical techniques were provided based on the experiment and modelling how the farmers perceive and apply the technology in their fields is still unknown from the current study thus it is recommended to do a further investigation or demonstration in the farmers fields in the region 4 conclusions this study investigated the performance of different surface irrigation and fertigation techniques using a field experiment and modelling with winsrfr for the wheat maize farming system used in the north china plain the aim was to develop strategies for improved practices in farmers fields we investigated the impact of cut off ratio optimisation in tandem with adjustments in the length of the border strip and the timing of fertiliser injection during the irrigation event the scenarios were developed based on the actual field conditions in the region and on the preferences of local farmers we can draw four main conclusions 1 the field experiment demonstrated that irrigation and fertigation performance is better in maize season than in wheat season there were only a few irrigation events in which the values for all irrigation performance indicators reached 80 during the 2019 wheat maize rotation the lower ae and du values found in the wheat season were due to the considerable amount of water that had to be applied due to the high soil infiltration capacity and roughness 2 surge border irrigation showed no significant advantage in terms of performance compared to continuous border irrigation thus we can conclude that there is no need to replace the conventional irrigation method used by farmers with the surge method which is also more complicated 3 manning s roughness was on average 0 16 in the wheat season and 0 13 in the maize season the variation in roughness was caused mainly by differences in tillage practices and crop development in addition the mean kostiakov k was 115 77 mm h in the wheat season and 63 73 mm h in the maize season mainly due to a difference in rainfall it is thus essential to consider temporal variation in infiltration when modelling management practices 4 decreasing cut off time and field length are efficient methods to improve irrigation performance regarding fertigation incorporating fertiliser throughout the entire irrigation event achieved the best fertigation performance with a distribution uniformity of around 90 finally as the required irrigation depth varies during the crop season further research is recommended to improve irrigation water use efficiency considering the changing irrigation requirements depending on crop development weather conditions and soil water flow in addition a study to further evaluate how the farmers perceive

8919,applying nitrogen fertilizer is commonly used to increase yields of surface irrigated crops despite often low application efficiency ae and distribution uniformity du surface fertigation the application of fertiliser dissolved in irrigation water is a promising technique for improved on farm performance this study evaluated surface fertigation strategies in a field experiment and by modelling with winsrfr the field experiment was conducted in the north china plain in 2017 2019 the aim was to test different practices and for model validation then to develop optimisation scenarios the study found first that conventional practices resulted in low ae of irrigation around 40 in wheat season and 60 in maize season du however was satisfactory in both wheat and maize seasons averaging 80 second surge border irrigation showed no significant advantage in terms of performance compared to the conventional practice of continuous border irrigation third the winsrfr model offered satisfactory accuracy compared to field measured data and soil infiltration parameters such as the kostiakov k showed temporal variation during the crop seasons fourth improved fertigation scenarios were developed by optimising the cut off ratio in tandem with changes in border length and fertigation timing the optimised strategies resulted in ae and du increasing to some 90 keywords surface fertigation border irrigation surge irrigation winsrfr data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface irrigation is widely used for cereal crops such as wheat and maize due to its ease of use lack of high tech components and relatively low investment cost however surface irrigation can also pose problems including non uniform water distribution and low application efficiency y li et al 2020 on surface irrigated fields broadcasting is the most common method of fertiliser application fertiliser is thus spread over a field before irrigation to be dissolved and redistributed with the flow of irrigation water zhang et al 2020 zhang et al 2013b while easy this method has disadvantages such as volatilisation of nitrogen fertiliser while exposed to the air and irregular field distribution due to the non uniform flush of irrigation water bai et al 2013 these issues coupled with the deep percolation experienced on many irrigated fields bring a substantial risk of both fertiliser losses and nitrogen pollution ebrahimian et al 2013 mohammadi et al 2019 surface fertigation is a method by which a dissolved fertiliser solution is added to irrigation water it is considered an advancement on the fertiliser broadcasting method the advantages of surface fertigation are reduced labour and input costs while theoretically the technique provides a more uniform distribution of n throughout a surface irrigated field ebrahimian et al 2014 extensive research has examined the on farm performance of surface fertigation and related topics abbasi et al 2012 dai et al 2017 garcía saldaña landeros sánchez 2019 with indicators of fertigation performance being n application efficiency and n distribution uniformity across a field zerihun et al 2003 some studies have explored optimised application strategies to improve fertigation performance in terms of the transportation of solute in the water during irrigation events adamsen et al 2005 other studies have evaluated the nitrogen balance based on n transport and transformation processes in the soil after fertigation crevoisier et al 2008 each of these lines of research found that fertigation performance depended on irrigation performance as the distribution uniformity of fertiliser was close to that of the irrigation water therefore improving surface irrigation performance seems a primary means to enhance fertigation performance bautista and schlegel 2020 one method proposed to improve surface irrigation performance is the surge technique herein water is applied to a field intermittently rather than continuously kifle et al 2017 wallender and rayej 1985 the method has been promoted in many areas and is widely used with furrow farming systems as it is easy to automate and presumed to be water saving adusumilli et al 2016 horst et al 2007 previous studies on surge irrigation focused mainly on the mechanism of how infiltration changes and then the proper operation of the surge technique onishi et al 2019 research on surge fertigation however is lacking with the exception of studies using the surge irrigation fertigation uniformity model sifum to explore nitrogen distribution uniformity in surge irrigated furrow fields for high medium and low intake soils boldt et al 1994 modelling is a helpful tool for analysing irrigation system performance several models have been developed to simulate water and solute movement and evaluate irrigation and fertigation performance brunetti et al 2018 ebrahimian and liaghat 2011 fuentes et al 2022 hamdi ahmadabad et al 2020 zhang et al 2013a these models can also be used to explore on farm practices to improve irrigation and fertigation performance particularly winsrfr a surface irrigation hydraulic simulation model has been widely used in recent years bautista et al 2009 mazarei et al 2020 salahou salahou et al 2018 applied winsrfr to determine the optimum inflow cut off distance under different inflow rate conditions in closed ended border irrigation systems nie nie et al 2017 analysed the effects of variability in soil infiltration properties on the performance of closed ended border irrigation by comparing winsrfr simulation results to field measurements however the model is susceptible to the parameters calibrated from field data such as soil infiltration properties derived by inverse modelling moreover no fixed set of parameters in the infiltration model can accurately determine the best application practices in all scenarios due to crop differences and field variation bai et al 2010 mansuri 2018 xu xu et al 2019 studied temporal variation in such parameters in western china finding that soil infiltration rates varied by irrigation season and this impacted irrigation system performance mazarei mazarei et al 2021 used winsrfr to evaluate the eﬀects of temporal variability in inﬁltration and roughness coefficients on water movement and irrigation performance the north china plain is one of china s most critical grain producing regions but faces severe groundwater depletion and diffuse pollution due to poor irrigation and fertiliser application practices on the region s many smallholder fields wang et al 2019 most farmers here use border irrigation and fertiliser broadcasting method y li et al 2020 as elsewhere however their efficiency is low previous research on border irrigation systems found that system performance was affected by border size slope inflow rate hydraulic roughness and soil infiltration properties anwar et al 2016 khanna and malano 2006 some studies nie et al 2021 found that cut off time the time from the start of irrigation to the end affected irrigation performance the most while others found optimisation of border size chen et al 2012 and inflow rate liu et al 2020 to be essential to improve border irrigation performance bai bai et al 2010 also found that hydraulic roughness and soil infiltration properties could be optimised through field experiment trials however in most cases farmers fields proved challenging to modify as field layout largely depended on physical conditions and water source location furthermore pumps had to be upgraded if a variable inflow rate was needed bringing increased investment costs and often greater energy consumption limited research has considered the challenges farmers face in optimising irrigation practices in their fields additionally most research on surface fertigation has been limited to a single crop without considering the usual plant rotations such as the winter wheat summer maize rotation practiced by farmers in the north china plain the current study investigated the performance of surface fertigation to improve irrigation and fertilisation practices in farmers fields specifically its objectives were two 1 to assess irrigation and fertigation performance with a field experiment and by modelling for the prevailing crop rotation in the north china plain and 2 to develop improved application strategies for border fertigation considering conventional practices and the real world conditions on farmers fields 2 methodology for better uptake of the farming practices developed by research it is helpful to start by considering farmers current practices and conducting field experiments to determine how these practices might be improved following this approach the present study sought to develop surface fertigation practices appropriate for farmers to use in their fields fig 1 we followed a stepwise procedure in step 1 we analysed farmers conventional practices and preferences by conducting participatory research in farmers fields including group discussions with farmers and monitoring programme in one of their fields this step was reported by sun et al 2022 and the outcome of that study served as the basis for step 2 based on the monitoring results from step 1 we conducted the field experiment in which surface fertigation was applied using self developed fertigation equipment fig 2 lower left in step 3 we used the data collected during the field experiment to calibrate and validate a simulation model in winsrfr in particular we used the model to gain insight into the performance of the experimental practices various fertigation scenarios were developed in step 4 considering the cut off ratio border length and fertigation timing by discussing these with area farmers we drew inferences on feasible practices for application in their fields 2 1 field experiment 2 1 1 experiment site and crop calendar the field experiment was conducted at an experiment station next to the monitored farmer field in the southern north china plain 35 18 n 113 54 e the dominant cropping pattern here was a winter wheat summer maize rotation which was representative of the region as a whole the soil at the experiment site was classified as silt loam and loam to a depth of 100 cm which was determined to be the effective root zone the soil bulk density was similar throughout this 100 cm layer with a mean value of 1 49 g cm3 gong et al 2019 the field capacity and saturated soil water content were approximately 0 30 and 0 42 cm3 cm3 respectively 2 1 2 experimental set up by reflecting the actual conditions in the monitored farmer field 247 m in length with 2 1 m width and the farmers preferences in the area we implemented a winter wheat summer maize rotation field experiment from 2017 to 2019 also a blocked ended border irrigation system was formed with strips measuring 200 m 3 5 m and an average longitudinal slope of 1 1000 plots a to j see fig 2 between these borders a 2 m wide strip was left unused to minimise interference from adjacent treatment plots before the wheat and maize were planted the field was levelled and soil ridges were constructed according to the designed border size after the borders were formed the seed was sown and compound synthetic fertiliser was applied using the deep placement method two irrigation methods were used in the field experiment continuous irrigation in which water was applied in one go per irrigation event and surge irrigation in which water was applied intermittently in three phases per event of the ten plots a d was designated for surge irrigation and e j for continuous irrigation continuous border irrigation is the conventional irrigation method farmers use on their fields the irrigation water was supplied by groundwater and a gauge was used to measure the inflow rate at each irrigation event inflow rates differed slightly from event to event because of fluctuations in the groundwater table and pump capacity for each irrigation event advance and recession times were recorded with a stopwatch every 20 m from border head to end for continuous irrigation the distance based cut off ratio defined as the distance proportion of the border when inflow was cut off was fixed at 0 95 in the wheat season and 0 90 in the maize season for surge irrigation the same cut off ratios were used for the wheat and maize seasons that is 0 3 0 6 and 0 9 respectively for the three phases in the surge irrigation events during the field experiment 10 irrigation events were executed including 7 fertigation events over 2 years and 4 growing seasons fig 3 presents the irrigation schedule and crop calendar for the fertigation events urea with good water solubility was applied with a total nitrogen content of 46 the application rate was set at 90 kg ha or 135 kg ha according to the crop n requirement on these dates fertigation was implemented by first pouring the required amount of urea into the storage tank and then adding the required volume of water to prepare a urea solution a fertiliser injection opening was placed in the irrigation pipeline fig 2 during the fertigation events a small peristaltic pump was used to transfer the fertiliser solution from the tank and inject it into the irrigation pipeline from there it flowed into the border with the irrigation water to explore the effect of different fertigation operation strategies on performance we varied the number of injection pulses in the various irrigation events for example we used five pulses in the fertigation event in march 2018 and three pulses in july 2018 appendices 1 and 2 present details for all irrigation and fertigation events though our fertigation strategy differed per event we used the same strategy for each event s continuous and surge applications in other words the initial fertiliser solution concentration c 0 and injection rate q in were set uniformly on the same date for both the continuous and surge plots five sampling points were set out in each test border at 10 50 100 150 and 190 m from the border head see fig 2 soil samples were collected using an auger at each measuring point along each border with a sampling interval of 20 cm from the surface to 2 m deep we collected soil samples before each irrigation event and 2 and 7 days after the soil water content was determined with the oven drying method according to other research tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 the urea applied in the soil rapidly transforms into ammonium nitrogen most ammonium nitrogen is then converted into nitrate nitrogen in concentrations much higher than the ammonium therefore we analysed only the nitrate nitrogen content in soils after fertigation using the automated discrete analyser cleverchem anna dechem tech germany 2 2 modelling with winsrfr 2 2 1 model description and data requirement winsrfr developed by the usda agricultural research service is a hydraulic flow model for analysing and evaluating surface irrigation systems it offers four main functionalities event analysis to assess surface irrigation

simulate surface irrigation scenarios the simulation world is the core engine of the modelling package in winsrfr 5 1 simulation of fertigation and surge irrigation is possible at the advanced user level bautista et al 2016 furthermore the modelling package allows the selection of several infiltration models this study used one of the most widely applied infiltration functions for surface irrigation the two parameter kostiakov infiltration equation 1 i k t α where i is the cumulative depth of infiltration mm t is the infiltration time hr k is the fitted coefficient parameter mm h and α is the fitted exponent parameter there are various options for modelling overland water flow this study used the zero inertia form of the one dimensional shallow water unsteady open channel flow equation winsrfr s newly released fertigation module simulates solute transport with surface water flow and its ultimate distribution along the length of a field surface it assumes that the fertiliser is injected at the field inlet at a known flux q in l min and concentration c 0 g l mixing perfectly with the irrigation water before application bautista and schlegel 2020 our study obtained the hydraulic and infiltration parameters using inverse simulation in the event analysis module of winsrfr merriam keller post irrigation volume balance analysis which relies on water advance and recession data was chosen in the module because of its reliability first we provided the measured data table 1 for system geometry inflow rate cut off time and advance and recession time then we selected a reasonable value for manning s roughness according to the default value in the model after that an initial estimate was set for α in the range of similar studies wang 2018 and the model estimated the k value after running the model we compared simulated advance and recession curves with observed curves the n and α were calibrated by rerunning the model until good fits were achieved between the two curves then the parameters were obtained by the so called trial and error method 2 2 2 model performance criteria the simulated advance and recession times were compared to the measured values using statistical criteria to evaluate model accuracy for such evaluation krause krause et al 2005 moriasi et al 2007 recommended the use of the coefficient of determination r 2 root mean square error rmse and the peak weighted root mean square error prmse appendix 3 presents the formula for these 2 3 performance indicators and data analysis the indicators used to evaluate irrigation fertigation performance were application efficiency ae distribution uniformity of water du w and distribution uniformity of fertiliser du f burt et al 1997 zerihun et al 2003 these were defined as follows 2 ae volume of water added to the root zone total volume of water applied 3 du w average of the lowest 25 of applied irrigation depths average applied irrigation depth in the whole field 4 du f average of the lowest 25 of a pplied fertiliser amount average applied fertiliser amount in the whole field irrigation depth w mm in the soil profile was calculated based on soil moisture observations before and after each irrigation event as follows 5 w i 1 n ρ i θ i h i where ρ i and h i are the soil bulk density and soil depth of soil layer i θ i is the change in soil gravimetric content after irrigation and n is 10 for wheat and 5 for maize one way analysis of variation anova was used to test the temporal variability of the soil infiltration and hydraulic roughness parameters statistically significant differences were identified using least significant difference lsd tests at a 5 probability level infiltration profiles and contour maps were used to visualise water and fertiliser distribution in the soil along the borders 3 results and discussion 3 1 irrigation and fertigation performance in the experiment table 2 presents all irrigation and fertigation performance indicators calculated from the measured soil moisture and nitrate content the average values of ae in wheat season 45 for continuous and 42 for surge treatments were lower than those in maize season 61 for continuous and 52 for surge treatments this is because more water was applied in the wheat irrigation events than in the maize irrigations for distribution uniformity du w a mean value beyond 80 was found for wheat and maize possibly due to sufficient water being stored in the root zone du f was slightly worse than du w ranging from 61 to 71 but followed the same change trend as du w because the fertiliser was perfectly mixed with the water before irrigation and applied within the irrigation stream du f and du w were highly related another study z t li et al 2020 similarly found that nitrate nitrogen was easily dissolved and moved with infiltrated water however du f was lower in the maize season of 2019 this was because in the jul 2019 and aug 2019 maize fertigation events only one fertigation injection pulse was used fertigation performance therefore decreased in terms of uniformity especially in the surge fertigation test strips to 55 in jul 2019 and 49 in aug 2019 by comparison in the sep 2018 event du f was 80 and 84 respectively for continuous and surge fertigation it is therefore recommended to apply fertigation using multiple injection pulses if possible fig 4 presents the spatial distribution of soil nitrate nitrogen before and after continuous and surge fertigation after fertigation the nitrate nitrogen content in the topsoil layer 0 40 cm was uniformly distributed increasing gradually from the bottom to the top of the borders as seen in the figure soil nitrate nitrogen content increased more after continuous fertigation than surge fertigation and exhibited more uniformity in the continuous treatment test strips in a previous study sun et al 2022 we found that the conventional fertiliser broadcasting method produced a non uniform distribution of nitrogen in the field as irrigation water flushed the solid fertiliser particles on the soil surface to the tail end of the blocked ended borders bai et al 2013 the uniform distribution of nitrogen in each soil layer after fertigation suggests that surface fertigation yielded better fertiliser application in the field 3 2 modelling with winsrfr 3 2 1 temporal variation of soil infiltration at field scale we conducted 10 irrigation fertigation events in 2018 and 2019 for each event the surge method was applied in plots a d and the continuous method in plots e j because roughness and infiltration rates in the topsoil layer varied in the plots with surge irrigation we used only data from the continuous irrigation plots for inversion modelling with the measured advance and recession times we calibrated the infiltration and roughness parameters by trial and error appendix 3 and validated the winsrfr model the statistical criteria indicated that the values for hydraulic roughness n and the kostiakov k and α were well calibrated recession times showed low accuracy likely due to observational error during the field experiment recession times were difficult to accurately determine under the growing crop and with an unsteady water pool walker 2005 table 3 presents the anova results for temporal variation with a confidence level of 0 05 based on these we can conclude that there was significant temporal variation during the growing season and between the crop years for one thing wheat and maize differed in plant densities and land preparation the value of hydraulic roughness was smaller for maize 0 13 on average than for wheat 0 16 on average furthermore rainfall was intensive in summer coinciding with the maize growing season see fig 3 therefore the initial soil moisture was higher in the maize growing season than in the wheat growing season compared to wheat the kostiakov k value was lower for maize 63 73 mm h on average while the kostiakov α was higher for maize 0 704 on average mean k and α values for wheat were 115 77 mm h and 0 553 respectively both results are in the same range as findings from other studies bo et al 2012 chen et al 2012 from the analysis of variance we can also conclude that there were differences between the 2018 and 2019 wheat seasons the α values for wheat were higher in 2018 than in 2019 similarly maize α was higher in 2018 because the rainfall was more plentiful in 2018 788 mm compared to 2019 418 mm this significantly influenced soil infiltrability related mainly to surface seal formation liu et al 2011 such effects thus need to be considered when optimising the design and operation of surface irrigation systems not only concerning irrigation scheduling but also in relation to soil infiltration properties different types of rainfall could influence infiltration properties and therefore affect irrigation management practices in gravity systems javadi et al 2019 3 2 2 fertigation performance by simulation we calculated performance indicators for the fertigation events based on the kostiakov parameters determined from the event analysis in winsrfr table 4 the application efficiency ae for wheat was less than that for maize for both the continuous and the surge treatments the same was found for the distribution uniformity of irrigation water du w and fertiliser du f the results aligned with the indicators calculated with the field measured data see table 3 they show that performance in terms of ae and du w was better in the maize season than in the wheat season from the simulation we also know that percolation dp was much higher in the wheat events averaging 141 mm for continuous fertigation and 142 mm for surge fertigation compared to just 38 mm and 57 mm respectively for maize see table 4 further we can conclude that the performance of the surge treatments did not differ from that of the continuous treatments as ae du w and du f were not improved these averaged respectively 39 70 and 66 for surge fertigated wheat compared to 39 81 and 71 on average respectively for continuous fertigated wheat results for the maize season were similar the unreasonable cut off ratio for each phase of the surge event likely explains this field experiments elsewhere ding 2006 found that surge irrigation can intensify deep seepage at the head of a border with insufficient seepage at the tail end if no proper cut off time was set thus we can conclude that the performance of surge irrigation is highly dependent on a rational operational strategy otherwise surge irrigation may not yield any improvement over continuous border irrigation from our results there would seem to be no need to replace conventional continuous border irrigation with surge irrigation especially as the latter is more complicated fig 5 presents simulated water infiltration profiles along the border for wheat and maize s continuous and surge irrigation fertigation events infiltration was more significant for wheat than maize confirming the wheat season s lower ae and higher percolation depth dp furthermore considerable percolation occurred at the head of the border likely due to the low inflow rate and unreasonable cut off ratio used mahdizadeh et al 2014 for maize fig 5c water infiltration was more uniform but a bit more water was stored at the tail end of the border indicating that the cut off time was slightly extended the better performance of maize irrigation fertigation can be attributed to the fact that the kostiakov k parameter was smaller in maize season than in wheat season resulting in lower soil infiltration capacity while reducing irrigation fertigation time also this implies that a reduced cut off time should be considered for maize irrigation fertigation the infiltration depth was the same for the continuous and surge events for both the wheat fig 5a and c and maize fig 5b and d seasons however the distribution along the border was uneven in the surge treatments except in the event of march 2018 in most cases the plots were not well irrigated in the surge treatments as too little water reached the tail end of the border and there was excessive percolation at the head the visualised information further indicates that the surge irrigation technique relies on a rational choice of the cut off time for each surge phase otherwise its performance may not be comparable to conventional border irrigation using the fertigation module in winsrfr we analysed the fertigation events in terms of fertiliser density distribution in the irrigation stream along the border on the fertigated plots where the continuous application technique was used the applied density for all of the multi pulse fertiliser injection events showed a smooth and stable distribution implying excellent fertigation performance fig 6a in july 2019 however the distribution curve jumps up and then falls at a distance of 160 m this is mainly because in this event there was only one fertiliser injection pulse near the end of the fertigation event this was also indicated by the du f for which the minimum value of 57 was calculated in this case fertiliser free water probably reached the end of the field it began receding from the blocked ended border which then caused an accumulation of the fertiliser solution near the end of the field we can conclude that more injection pulses would have produced a more uniform fertiliser application over the land that means if possible fertigation should be applied during the entire irrigation event confirming our experimental findings for the surge application too multi pulse fertiliser injection performed better than the single pulse fertigation event july 2019 however the distribution density fluctuated more in all surge fertigation treatments than in continuous ones this indicates that surge fertigation was not advantageous compared to the continuous technique needless to say in all of the surge fertigation events fertiliser distribution rapidly decreased near the end of the field this may have been due to the lack of water reaching the end of the border 3 3 optimisation of irrigation and fertigation operation the above analysis shows that cut off time and fertigation application timing have a considerable impact on the application efficiency ae and distribution uniformity du as well as applied irrigation water depth dapp these findings align with the conclusion reached in other studies that operations strategy greatly influences performance anwar et al 2016 mazarei et al 2020 we therefore explored options regarding operational variables to improve on farm performance by simulation in winsrfr as surge fertigation showed no distinct advantage compared to continuous fertigation we only developed scenarios for continuous boder fertigation field size and inflow rate are both variables not easily changed in reality to improve irrigation performance thus we set the border width and slope to reflect actual field conditions in the simulation using the 3 5 m width and 1 slope of the experiment field and a 2 m width and 2 5 slope to represent a typical farmer s field the inflow rate was set at 12 5 l s being the regular pump capacity in the region in addition four specific border lengths were considered in the simulation 200 m 150 m 100 m and 50 m for the experiment field and 250 m 200 m 150 m and 100 m for the farmer s field reflecting preferences of local farmers and actual field conditions as reported in the participatory study sun et al 2022 as the advance and recession times differed for each event due to the temporal variability of soil infiltration and roughness the cut off time varied for each irrigation event the cut off ratio was therefore considered in the simulation also it should be noted that full irrigation was considered in the scenarios rather than deficit irrigation that is the applied irrigation depth has to meet the required irrigation depth along the entire plot mean values were taken per crop for the infiltration parameters k and α and roughness n fig 7 presents the performance indicators ae and du and the applied irrigation water depth dapp for the different scenarios specified in table 5 for the field experiment conditions appendix 4 presents the indicators for the scenarios applying farmers field conditions generally speaking ae declined with increasing cut off ratios meaning increased irrigation time du and dapp in contrast rose with increased cut off ratios understandably when the irrigation time was increased more water was applied to the field resulting in a larger dapp and reduced ae also the irrigation water was distributed more uniformly in the root zone using more water we can conclude that limited improvement was achieved by optimising the cut off time a better method to improve performance might be by changing the border length and width of the field and if possible the field slope irrigation performed better under maize with a high ae found for all border lengths for wheat however only the shorter length plots showed good performance the generally poor irrigation performance for wheat was due to the high soil infiltration rate and roughness which resulted in significant infiltration in the short maize plots 100 m and 50 m a cut off ratio of at least 0 9 was needed to achieve the required irrigation depth while a cut off ratio of 0 8 yielded good performance for the long borders however the irrigation performance was low for the long wheat border regardless of adjustments made in the cut off ratio we can thus conclude that reducing border length is a useful first step to improving wheat irrigation performance table 5 presents the scenarios investigated for optimising irrigation strategy for the experiment and farmer s fields for wheat decreasing border length and the cut off ratio was generally effective in improving irrigation performance however for maize the trend was less clear cut especially in the farmer s field from m250 2 to m100 2 this was because the field had a steeper slope compared to the experiment field and the soil infiltration capacity and roughness were lower than for wheat this meant the irrigation stream flowed relatively fast resulting in insufficient and less uniform infiltration along the border these effects were more pronounced when the cut off ratio was reduced because the applied water decreased causing an irrigation depth shortage in which the required depth could not be satisfied along the border this indicates that reducing the border length can be a feasible method to increase performance for fields with high roughness and infiltration rates wheat fields or flat fields experiment fields overall these findings suggest using short border lengths for wheat irrigation w50 1 and w100 2 and long border lengths for maize irrigation m150 1 and m250 2 then a desirable ae and du can be achieved of around 90 for both in addition the applied irrigation water depth dapp can be significantly reduced to 94 mm for wheat and 80 mm for maize but note that this irrigation depth was calculated for full irrigation to a fixed required depth future research is recommended that considers changing irrigation requirements dependent on a combination of crop growth weather and soil water conditions after we optimised irrigation we developed fertigation scenarios these were named first applying fertigation only in the first half of an irrigation event second applying fertigation only in the second half of an irrigation event and whole applying fertigation during an entire irrigation event fig 8 presents the fertigation performance du f obtained for these scenarios under the experiment field conditions fertigation during the whole treatment event provided the best distribution uniformity around 90 for both wheat and maize our simulation results thus confirm our findings from the field experiment in which du f was higher when more fertiliser injection pulses were used the simulation results are also consistent with previous studies abbasi et al 2012 adamsen et al 2005 dai et al 2017 table 6 presents the different irrigation and fertigation scenarios including conventional practice on the farmer s field the experiment field and the optimised simulated scenarios for both the field experiment conditions and farmer s field conditions it can be concluded that fertigation performed better than broadcasting regarding fertiliser distribution uniformity sun et al 2022 furthermore applying fertigation during the entire irrigation event was the best strategy achieving a du f of around 90 reducing border length and cut off ratio were found to be efficient strategies to achieve good irrigation performance especially in wheat season it is thus recommended to use short borders to irrigate wheat fields a possible approach would be to split long borders into several sections and irrigate each section separately to improve distribution uniformity it is recommended to apply fertigation throughout the entire irrigation event however in practice it is difficult to apply fertigation constantly for any length of time due to limited tank volume this suggests the need to develop improved fertigation equipment or a giant fertigation tank that can provide a constant supply of fertiliser solution during an entire irrigation event although the practical techniques were provided based on the experiment and modelling how the farmers perceive and apply the technology in their fields is still unknown from the current study thus it is recommended to do a further investigation or demonstration in the farmers fields in the region 4 conclusions this study investigated the performance of different surface irrigation and fertigation techniques using a field experiment and modelling with winsrfr for the wheat maize farming system used in the north china plain the aim was to develop strategies for improved practices in farmers fields we investigated the impact of cut off ratio optimisation in tandem with adjustments in the length of the border strip and the timing of fertiliser injection during the irrigation event the scenarios were developed based on the actual field conditions in the region and on the preferences of local farmers we can draw four main conclusions 1 the field experiment demonstrated that irrigation and fertigation performance is better in maize season than in wheat season there were only a few irrigation events in which the values for all irrigation performance indicators reached 80 during the 2019 wheat maize rotation the lower ae and du values found in the wheat season were due to the considerable amount of water that had to be applied due to the high soil infiltration capacity and roughness 2 surge border irrigation showed no significant advantage in terms of performance compared to continuous border irrigation thus we can conclude that there is no need to replace the conventional irrigation method used by farmers with the surge method which is also more complicated 3 manning s roughness was on average 0 16 in the wheat season and 0 13 in the maize season the variation in roughness was caused mainly by differences in tillage practices and crop development in addition the mean kostiakov k was 115 77 mm h in the wheat season and 63 73 mm h in the maize season mainly due to a difference in rainfall it is thus essential to consider temporal variation in infiltration when modelling management practices 4 decreasing cut off time and field length are efficient methods to improve irrigation performance regarding fertigation incorporating fertiliser throughout the entire irrigation event achieved the best fertigation performance with a distribution uniformity of around 90 finally as the required irrigation depth varies during the crop season further research is recommended to improve irrigation water use efficiency considering the changing irrigation requirements depending on crop development weather conditions and soil water flow in addition a study to further evaluate how the farmers perceive
