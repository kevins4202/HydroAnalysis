of protected areas pas is one of the most important instruments to control the loss of biological diversity and to safeguard threatened species and ecosystems all over the world pas are designed to protect local and regional biodiversity from anthropogenic pressures and impacts margules and pressey 2000 according to the protected planet report unep wcmc and iucn 2016 pas cover almost 15 of the world s terrestrial and inland waters nevertheless their relevant global extension is likely to increase in the future due to the increased awareness about their importance in developing countries when properly managed pas may play an important role on poverty alleviation and sustainable development of local populations naughton treves et al 2005 andam et al 2010 canavire bacarreza and hanauer 2013 moreover the management of pas requires a long term political view and financial commitments that are often not attained bruner et al 2004 hockings et al 2006 biodiversity and ecosystem services ess are intrinsically related while pas are fundamental assets that support the flows of a wide set of valuable services and particularly those that are not directly marketable whose maintenance can be justified by their functional values millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 regulating services are often involved in relationships trade off and or synergies with other ess bennett et al 2009 and for this reason can be considered as suitable indicators for assessing ecological resilience bennett et al 2005 however their environmental value is frequently ignored as it is not incorporated in the market dynamics turner and daily 2008 for this reason severe losses of regulating services were observed when provisioning services were boosted particularly on floodplain environments jia et al 2014 palomo et al 2014 gaglio et al 2017a floodplains host ecotones with an exceptional biological diversity particularly when high levels of spatial and temporal heterogeneity is present ward et al 1999 ward and tockner 2001 the water terrestrial interface supports a large number of species which are benefited from intermediate disturbance conditions crandall et al 2003 regulated by flood dynamics tockner and ward 1999 thomaz et al 2007 floodplains also perform regulating functions of great importance for the surrounding environment they can significantly regulate floods impact through water absorption and nutrients retention weng et al 2003 forshay and stanley 2005 hoffmann et al 2009 avoiding damages to human settlements and protecting groundwater quality due to their high productivity güneralp et al 2014 floodplain ecosystems can store significant amounts of carbon in soil and living biomass playing a role in the climate change mitigation and being an important carbon sink for other terrestrial ecosystems robertson et al 1999 cartisano et al 2013 climate change is expected to exacerbate not only biodiversity changes sala et al 2000 araújo and rahbek 2006 but also the capacity of ecosystems to provide goods and services pecl et al 2017 especially in the mediterranean regions sala et al 2000 climate change is expected to potentially accelerate changes in species distribution araújo and rahbek 2006 reshuffling the geographic distributions of plant and animal species world wide parmesan and yohe 2003 however even if current estimates in biodiversity changes are very variable bellard et al 2012 there is the need to improve knowledge about potential changes in biodiversity sala et al 2000 and es provision pecl et al 2017 in order to be prepared for adapting management decisions able to address those changes maragno et al 2018 the aim of this study is to assess the effects of pa designation on spatial and temporal changes of regulating ess climate regulation based on carbon storage water supply and water regulation in a protected floodplain of central portugal the nature reserve of paul do boquilobo nrpb in order to describe the es flow before and after the establishment of pa in 1980 in this study area three dates with their respective land use land cover lulc maps were considered 1960 1990 and 2015 moreover future projections of land use and climate change to 2050 were combined with the aims a to simulate the response of ess to such modifications using two invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs models namely the carbon storage and sequestration and the seasonal water yield models sharp et al 2016 and b to use the simulation results to evaluate future management measures for the study area it worths mentioning that unlike the seasonal water yield model the formulas of carbon storage and sequestration model are not climate dependent therefore the outcomes regarding the climate change effects concern only the water budget and its related services 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the nature reserve of paul do boquilobo nrpb 39 23 n and 8 32 w is a natural floodplain of 817 ha with an altitude between 15 m and 32 m a s l it is located in the catchment area of almonda river a tributary of tagus river in the municipality of torres novas and golegã district of santarem central portugal fig 1 the annual precipitation is about 713 mm yr 1 and the area can be classified within the dry sub humid c1 category according to the thornthwaite moisture classification feddema 2005 the tagus valley has been subjected to land reclamation works during the last decades of the 19th century with the aim to gain new arable land to counterbalance the impact of human pressures on this environment the nrpb was declared pa based on the national law no 198 80 of july 24 green area in fig 1 this area hosts one of the most important communities of herons in portugal and is a popular spot for wintering water birds such as ducks coots and waders it is the only national reproductive site for aythya ferina one of the main sites for refuge species such as anas penelope and anas clypeata and one of the few potential sites for nesting of chlidonias hybrid in addition several fish species like the endemics chondrostoma oligolepis and iberochondrostoma lusitanicum use the reserve for reproduction icnf instituto da conservação da natureza e das florestas 2005 the nrpb is currently characterized by riparian corridors with predominance of salix populus and fraxinus species in favor of protecting such biodiversity assets the forestry and nature conservation institute icnf implemented a management plan following the iucn directives where a core area of total protection was established core pa in fig 1 while the part of nrpb not belonging to the core pa was considered as areas of partial or complementary protection nrpb plays an important hydrologic role for all the surrounding ecosystems during the wet periods the area functions as an area of water retention during the frequent floods of the almonda river protecting the surrounding croplands during dry periods the nrpb provides valuable water supply for irrigation by recharging local aquifers baptista and santos 2016 2 2 lulc maps and future lulc scenarios the lulc maps for 1967 and 1990 are products of the map of agricultural and forested land of portugal 1 25000 scale with 12 5 m resolution which were elaborated by the survey and planning service of the ministry of economy of portugal for the respective years the 2015 map was generated from aerial orthophotometry 1 5000 scale in association with the habitat map drawn according to the habitat directive of the european union 92 43 eec european commission 1992 after correction using data from field surveys delivering a 2 5 m resolution all the maps were harmonized according to a common lulc classification as reported in table 1 an additional classification for the riparian forests was also carried out since fast growth rates are reported for these ecosystems or for the species that compose them giese et al 2000 rheinhardt et al 2012 and thus they were further classified in young and mature see definitions in table 1 moreover two future alternative lulc scenarios for 2050 were developed a business scenario bus and a naturalization scenario nat the two future scenarios were projected reclassifying the 2015 scenario which was used as baseline the bus scenario was obtained reclassifying all the private lands of 2015 scenario to croplands it was assumed that all the private lands inside nrpb will be exploited in such way to maximize market ess i e for food and fiber provision and consequently the income of the owners i e though conversion to irrigated crops olive groves and poplar plantations while the natural evolution of ecosystems is guaranteed inside the core protected area as proposed in the management plan of instituto da conservação da natureza e das florestas icnf the recommendations of the management plan would guarantee the protection of the ecological evolution process towards climax conditions inside the total protected area furthermore the presence of a cork oak forest area would be also promoted on the lands belonging to the state outside the core area as traditional landscape feature supported by the management plan santos et al 2016 the nat scenario was projected reclassifying all the cropland mapped in 2015 scenario to natural land coverages the projection assumes that all the private lands will be purchased by the nrpb under the premises of the management plan provisions that are currently in place icnf instituto da conservação da natureza e das florestas 2005 thus a process of landscape naturalization in most of the nature reserve will occur since it will be owned by the government larger areas would undergo naturalization processes except for olive groves in the northern part of the reserve croplands and poplar plantations would be replaced by mediterranean grasslands and oak forests would be maintained in the western part to preserve traditional landscape riparian forest would expand from buffer zones nearby the watercourses and the existing young riparian forest would evolve to climax stage i e mature riparian forest it was assumed that such evolution could occur in 30 years 2050 thus some young riparian forest areas from the 2015 scenario will evolve to mature stage in future scenarios considering that no human impacts or intervention affects them the aforementioned two future lulc scenarios describe the two opposite extreme gradients that define the maximum range of lulc changes in the study area and consequently the respective two extreme possible trends of ess changes 2 3 climate data for the past and future scenarios without climate change the climate raster data of the period 1950 2000 of mean monthly precipitation p minimum mean and maximum temperature tmin tmean tmax from worldclim database http worldclim org hijmans et al 2005 and reference evapotranspiration eto of asce standardized method allen et al 2005 for short reference crop clipped grass from aschonitis et al 2017 were used data of 1 km resolution the mean monthly rasters data of eto tmin tmean tmax and p were also used to build a simplified eto model for the study area eto 6 3837tmean 0 6466p 2 5109 tmax tmin r2 0 99 p 0 001 this model was used to build rasters of future eto conditions considering the tmin tmean tmax and p raster values of 2050 estimated by the hadgem2 es model collins et al 2008 for the rcp85 scenario worst scenario of greenhouse gas emissions the difference between the past and the future conditions for the p tmean tmax tmin and eto are given in fig 2 a e respectively 2 4 invest model the effects of protection initiatives on regulating ess was analyzed using invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs version 3 3 3 package sharp et al 2016 the model simulated a climate regulation based on carbon storage and sequestration model of carbon storage and sequestration climate regulation and b water supply and water regulation model of seasonal water yield using the three lulc maps of nprb that correspond to the dates 1967 1990 and 2015 plus the business and naturalization lulc future scenarios for 2015 and 2050 the models were run for each past date and future projections to allow a comparison of the outputs since the nrpb was declared pa in 1980 the changes in lulc and regulating ess occurred between 1967 and 1990 period can assess the first consequences of the protection initiative while those occurred during between 1990 and 2015 can estimate the effects of its management similarly the comparisons of the future lulc scenarios bus and nat with or without climate change versus the past scenarios can assess the effects of future lulc designation and climate change on ess the main data sources used for the simulations are presented in table 2 2 4 1 climate regulation carbon sequestration is the mechanism through which natural ecosystems withdraw carbon from the atmosphere that is stored in their living and dead biomass of the soil the amount of carbon stored in natural ecosystems can significantly mitigate climate change due to the excess of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere the amount of carbon stored and sequestered based on the different lulc and climate scenarios was estimated using the tool carbon storage and sequestration climate regulation of invest biophysical model sharp et al 2016 the tool estimates the amount of carbon currently stored in a landscape and the amount of carbon sequestered over time by integrating four carbon pools aboveground biomass belowground biomass soil dead organic matter with land cover maps input data for carbon pools is provided in table s1 pereira et al 2014 optionally the model can provide monetary values of sequestered carbon for the period 2015 2050 the computation of monetary value net present value considered a social cost per metric ton of carbon of 220us moore and diaz 2015 and a market discount rate in price of carbon of 7 as suggested by the model values for terrestrial carbon pools were obtained from the portuguese national inventory pereira et al 2014 except for soil carbon content in grasslands which was derived from local survey data no value for carbon storage and sequestration was attributed to water ecosystems despite the important role of the marsh in storing such a resource when no direct correspondence was evident between own and national inventory lulc classifications the values were selected from the most coherent class carbon storage values for mixed lulc classes were calculated by combining the most representative habitats for example the carbon storage of young riparian forest was calculated as the weighted average of quercus spp 50 and other broadleaf 25 poplar 25 willow aboveground and belowground carbon content of mature riparian forest were calculated by considering the mean annual increment mai of total living biomass expressed as m3 ha 1 these values were converted in mg c ha 1 considering the gravity weight t m3 of the respective species quercus spp 0 85 poplar spp 0 85 and willow spp 0 75 and a default carbon fraction of 47 of biomass as suggested by ipcc 2006 guidelines carbon content was therefore allocated in above and below ground biomass pools according to the shoot to root ratio of the respective lulc types both mai and shoot to root ratio for forest type were also provided by pereira et al 2014 2 4 2 water regulation and supply natural systems can regulate hydrological flows by retaining water amounts in soil and groundwater affecting evapotranspiration and infiltration the water regulation services refer to the regulation of water flows on earth surface for maintaining the normal conditions in the watershed while the water supply service is related to the infiltration retention and storage of water in streams lakes and aquifers de groot et al 2002 the seasonal water yield tool of invest model was used to analyze the water budget of rnpb this model computes spatial indices that quantify the relative contribution of a land parcel to the generation of both base flow and quick flow integrating the calculation of punctual water yield with the position of each pixel on the landscape sharp et al 2016 the model requires a set of spatially explicit inputs describing climate soil topography and biophysical factors table 2 it provides outputs for local recharge actual evapotranspiration and run off computed on an annual time scale but using monthly values moreover the map of soil conservation service scs runoff curve number cn was processed in arcgis 10 3 esri to obtain the contribution of soil to retain excess water calculated as following nrcs 1986 s m p r 25400 c n 254 where spmr is the potential maximum soil moisture retention after runoff begins mm and cn is the curve number dimensionless for a specific hydrological soil group and lulc type the spmr represents the ability of soil to retain water while cn represents a measure of the capacity of the different land use land cover and soil types to generate rainfall runoff usda scs 1972 cn value depends on ground coverage soil type and topography regions generating more runoff are assumed to generate greater flood risk maragno et al 2018 the spmr can be a suitable proxy for water flood mitigation e g chen et al 2014 3 results 3 1 lulc changes the lulc composition of the reserve suffered significant changes during time even after the pa classification decree table 3 during 1967 the landscape of nrpb was predominantly devoted to agricultural activities where natural environments were almost absent pastures were located mainly in the central areas of the reserve and accounted for 18 9 of the total area rice fields were present on a large part of the naturally flooded areas and irrigated crops were the most abundant lulc class after the pa classification decree a permanent wetland was created to provide new habitats for aquatic and terrestrial species this led also to the development of riparian forest ecosystems surrounding the wetland and along the course of the almonda river as evident in 1990 map fig 3 however agricultural activities maintained with the growing interest and spread of maize crops in 2015 due to the management decision of acquiring property permanent aquatic habitats covered the 8 2 of the total area as results of protection initiative aiming to the conservation of aquatic species many of these ecosystems were recorded as a valuable habitat according to 92 43 eec directive including those corresponding to the habitat codes 3130 3150 3260 3280 3290 table s 2 in supplementary material riparian forests increased up to cover the 17 3 of the nrpb in 2015 leading to the classification of three riparian habitats no 91b0 92a0 and 9240 mediterranean tall humid grasslands were also restored no 6420 together with pastures activities agricultural activities suffered a strong simplification with the complete loss of rice fields non irrigated crops orchards and vineyards corn monocultures irrigated crops currently cover more than half of the nrpb as regards the bus scenario of lulc changes in 2050 the irrigated crops were hypothesized to spread again up to 65 2 of the total area inside the area under total protection permanent wetlands would be maintained and young riparian forests would evolve to mature stages poplar stands would be planted over all the north west part of the nrpb the projection performed according to the nat scenario of lulc changes in 2050 would lead to complete agricultural abandonment except for few hectares covered by olive groves the abandoned cropland would evolve to mediterranean grasslands which would cover the larger part or the reserve this scenario would lead to the maximum coverage with previously mentioned habitats included in 92 43 ecc directive 3 2 climate regulation services the amount of stored carbon increased in time as a consequence of lulc changes occurred during 1965 2015 table 4 fig 4 the period 1967 1990 during which the protection initiative started unfold a large gain 10 5 of carbon stored into the ecosystems despite the creation of wetlands in the core area during 1990 2015 an additional but lower gain was estimated 2 9 in this period the further increase of wetlands and irrigated crop areas was overcompensated by expansion of riparian habitats among the lulc classes irrigated crops showed the highest contribution to carbon sequestration for all the three considered dates 39 8 40 5 and 47 3 of the total stored carbon for 1965 1990 and 2015 respectively gains of c amount were also predicted in both future lulc scenarios bus and nat without climate change effects surprisingly even the transition from 2015 to 2050 according to the business scenario would lead to a considerable c increase 6 9 with the contribution of irrigated crops being 56 4 of the total stored carbon despite the expansion of irrigated crops and the loss of riparian forests the latter would switch to a mature stage i e transition from young riparian forest to mature riparian forest sequestering high amounts of c from the atmosphere on the other hand the transition from 2015 to 2050 according to the nat scenario would lead to even larger carbon stock gain 18 6 with riparian forests and grasslands being the largest contributors to carbon sequestration 36 4 and 27 9 contribution for mature and young riparian forests respectively and 32 4 contribution of grasslands of the total stored carbon the hypothesized net present values of future carbon sequestration 2015 2050 based on social cost of carbon emission were assessed to be 313 845 us and 848 577 us for the bus and nat scenarios in total respectively this means that a value range of 534 732 us will depend on the selection of future lulc management plan bus or nat of the area 3 3 water regulation and supply the effects of lulc changes on water budget distribution were evaluated for each date 1965 1990 2015 of the period 1965 2015 fig 5 table 5 actual evapotranspiration aet and runoff were observed to be the most and less contributing water budget components respectively as expected in a flat and dry environment however the lulc changes that occurred over time slightly affected the water budget table 5 but with a decreasing trend of recharge and runoff accompanied by an increasing trend of aet in time due the respective increase of spmr indicating a better water retention and a better exploitation of water resources for covering evapotranspiration requirements in fact despite the loss of terrestrial areas estimated values of total spmr increased as a consequence of the larger contributions of forests rather than arable land considering the two lulc scenarios of 2050 bus and nat without climate change table 5 fig 5 it is observed that bus scenario presents similar hydrologic responses recharge aet runoff spmr with the lulc responses of 1990 and 2015 lulc conditions on the other hand the nat scenario shows an evident decrease of recharge and runoff and increase of aet due the evident increase of spmr indicating that the nat lulc conditions lead to even higher water retention and much better exploitation of water resources for covering evapotranspiration requirements comparing the two lulc scenarios of 2050 bus and nat with climate change table 5 fig 6 with respective scenarios without climate change it is observed reduction of 75 5 in recharge 0 8 in aet and 35 in runoff for the bus scenario and reduction of 98 in recharge 2 2 in aet and 37 6 in runoff for the nat scenario due to climate change the projected 16 1 decrease of annual precipitation for 2050 according to rcp85 is the reason for the aforementioned reductions and especially for recharge and runoff in the case of nat scenario the reduction of recharge and runoff is even higher compared to bus due to the higher spmr 4 discussion 4 1 possible conflicts of ess supply the identification of conflicts and synergies among ess gained an increasing interest in literature during the recent years under the lens of environmental and pas management for example palomo et al 2014 highlighted a positive contribution of doñana national park on maintaining ess delivery because of the isolation of pa with respect to the lulc changes which occurred outside onaindia et al 2013 described the spatial congruence of biodiversity carbon storage and water flow regulation arguing that biodiversity conservation would ensure the provision of regulation services by the maintenance of native forest ecosystems synergy between biodiversity and carbon storage was confirmed in many other studies e g steinbeiss et al 2008 williams et al 2008 hall et al 2012 peh et al 2016 vergílio et al 2016 to such an extent that some high biodiversity areas could be protected by carbon based conservation strategies strassburg et al 2010 moreover a relatively high overlap between carbon and soil ess was detected in literature izquierdo and clark 2012 gissi et al 2014 gissi et al 2018 for example the carbon stored in aboveground biomass was positively correlated with both water supply and water regulation in rodríguez et al 2015 flood prevention seems positively correlated with biodiversity conservation egoh et al 2009 newton et al 2012 and carbon storage chan et al 2006 even though correlations values are generally low on the other hand conservation efforts may lead to controversial outcomes castro et al 2015 found that the higher levels of protection do not ensure the provision of multiple ess fedrigotti et al 2016 found that forest expansion at the expense of grasslands and croplands i e renaturalization in alpine environments may reduce the economic contribution of ess negative outcomes were also detected in deltaic environment gaglio et al 2017a and tropical mountain areas garcía márquez et al 2017 gaglio et al 2017b izquierdo and clark 2012 observed slight negative correlation between water yield and biodiversity as well as with carbon storage this study demonstrated that conservation actions affected the ess provision in the nrpb over time during 1967 2015 while the future designed lulc scenarios for 2050 with and without climate change effects revealed that management decisions have important effects on ess supply the ess analysis highlighted that the efforts for biodiversity conservation through pas can lead to parallel positive responses in terms of climate mitigation and flood prevention in floodplains such as nrpb however some conflicts may arise in water regulation services carvalho santos et al 2016a b as indicated by table 5 all the lulc conditions after 1965 including the future scenarios led to reduction of recharge and runoff and increase of water retention which is desirable for floodplains and vulnerable environments to floods in general on the other hand respective lulc changes may have a negative impact in places where groundwater resources are limited or minimum ecological flows in surface waters are difficult to guarantee these observations are in line with the findings of quintas soriano et al 2014 who described that non protected areas are more relevant providers of groundwater recharge service in comparison to the protected landscapes conversely the increase of real evapotranspiration due to the increase of water retention may boost the biomass production and consequently the provisioning services e g food and timber production counterbalancing the economic loss from water regulation services on the other hand even this pathway of ess exploitation is not a secure plan since aet was slightly reduced in the of bus and nat scenarios considering the climate change effects overall the analysis of ess trends in nrpb revealed that the mere biodiversity conservation may not be effective in maintaining some ess and that an active management is required future management of nrpb should consider the relationships among ess raised in this analysis and the role of conservation strategies if only biodiversity conservation is fostered e g nat scenario the contribution of the reserve to climate change mitigation and the capacity to buffer flooding will increase though this would cause a decrease of water supply especially if rcp85 will occur with unpredictable consequences on the preservation of the aquatic environment contrarily the maintenance of a limited extension of agricultural land and pastures on the nrpb managed with non intensive practices could be an ecological solution to maintain a balanced water budget this result is in line with the findings of felipe lucia and comin 2015 who demonstrated that a mosaic of different lulc types can support ess and biodiversity in agricultural floodplains in any case the relevance of our study resides in make trade offs between ess explicit in order to inform decision makers towards the potential consequences of different actions gissi and garramone 2018 special consideration should be given to the riparian ecosystems of nrpb particularly mature riparian forest provide high values of evapotranspiration and spmr as well as carbon storage soil conservation and nutrient retention dindaroğlu et al 2015 on the other hand such forest transitions in lowland areas may cause a dramatic decrease of local recharge capacity therefore the management and regulation strategies concerning these ecosystems are fundamental for the provision of ess at regional scale garrastazú et al 2015 sáenz et al 2016 vidal abarca et al 2016 as far as climate change is concerned it was observed that decision making in land use will be challenging when considering future climate projections when conservation measures included the total renaturing of the reserve the trade off between water infiltration and flood prevention capacity results were exacerbated these findings are confirmed also by other studies in fact increase of flood attenuation potential of floodplains under climate change was predicted also by moor et al 2015 other studies carried out in mediterranean basins evaluated that water supply service may be reduced up to 49 bangash et al 2013 or almost 100 terrado et al 2014 4 2 limitations of the modelling approach even though spatially explicit models are probably among the finest tools to map ess provision their application presents some limitations generally related to both the reliability of input data and to the simplifications that lie under the assumptions on which models are based on bagstad et al 2013 hou et al 2013 moreover when models are based on a low number of input parameters their sensitivity to these factors can be high especially when data is obtained from national inventories which represent desirable sources when no field data is available on the other hand national inventory datasets may not capture adequately the variability in fine spatial scales additionally some model simplifications are necessary to be accepted when describing very complex phenomena such as those that regulate ecological functioning for instance the carbon storage and sequestration model assumes that none of the lulc types gains or loses carbon over time or under the effects of climate change the only changes in carbon storage captured by the model over time are those due to changes from one lulc type to another as suggested by invest 3 3 3 users guide this problem can be at least partially addressed classifying some lulc types into age classes as it was made in this work similar problems have been observed in other studies bottalico et al 2016 moreover the model does not include greenhouse gas emissions related to agricultural activities e g tillage fertilizer and pesticide applications that affect the net carbon sequestration capacity of croplands and should be considered under a life cycle perspective similar limitations appear also in the case of hydrological parameters e g crop factors soil hydrologic groups which are necessary in the seasonal water yield tool crop factors of the same crops land uses which are given in various databases e g database of invest model or fao may differ significantly from place to place either due to local soil climate conditions or due to different cultivation practices aschonitis et al 2018 additionally in the case of soil hydrologic groups it is not taken into account the evolution in soil conditions from the lulc changes 5 conclusions the present study highlighted the relevance of conservation initiatives in ess provision and the significance of modeling approaches for their explanation the spatially explicit assessment of ess using modeling approaches like invest can inform and support managers on environmental decisions considering trade off between ess that are strongly associated to the human well being of local populations from the results of the study it was concluded that floodplain riparian habitats like nrpb display a high capacity for the delivery of multiple ess the limitation of human activities such as agriculture and grazing could be desirable to optimize the delivery of ess which are related to carbon and water retention on the other hand significant conflicts between specific water regulation services may appear by the application of pa initiatives possible reductions of water recharge to groundwaters and runoff such as those observed in the specific study may not be desirable in places where groundwater resources are limited or minimum ecological flows in surface waters are difficult to be maintained thus the use of modeling approaches to assess complex ess interactions taking also into account the possible effects of climate change can be a valuable tool for the description of ecological mechanisms that underlie trade offs and synergies among ess and for supporting decision making this is particularly important when considering protected areas where the assessment of the services delivered is urgently needed in order to provide arguments for biodiversity conservation

2013 moreover the management of pas requires a long term political view and financial commitments that are often not attained bruner et al 2004 hockings et al 2006 biodiversity and ecosystem services ess are intrinsically related while pas are fundamental assets that support the flows of a wide set of valuable services and particularly those that are not directly marketable whose maintenance can be justified by their functional values millennium ecosystem assessment 2005 regulating services are often involved in relationships trade off and or synergies with other ess bennett et al 2009 and for this reason can be considered as suitable indicators for assessing ecological resilience bennett et al 2005 however their environmental value is frequently ignored as it is not incorporated in the market dynamics turner and daily 2008 for this reason severe losses of regulating services were observed when provisioning services were boosted particularly on floodplain environments jia et al 2014 palomo et al 2014 gaglio et al 2017a floodplains host ecotones with an exceptional biological diversity particularly when high levels of spatial and temporal heterogeneity is present ward et al 1999

other terrestrial ecosystems robertson et al 1999 cartisano et al 2013 climate change is expected to exacerbate not only biodiversity changes sala et al 2000 araújo and rahbek 2006 but also the

management decisions able to address those changes maragno et al 2018 the aim of this study is to assess the effects of pa designation on spatial and temporal changes of regulating ess climate regulation based on carbon storage water supply and water regulation in a protected floodplain of central portugal the nature reserve of paul do boquilobo nrpb in order to describe the es flow before and after the establishment of pa in 1980 in this study area three dates with their respective land use land cover lulc maps were considered 1960 1990 and 2015 moreover future projections of land use and climate change to 2050 were combined with the aims a to simulate the response of ess to such modifications using two invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs models namely the carbon storage and sequestration and the seasonal water yield models sharp et al 2016 and b to use the simulation results to evaluate future management measures for the study area it worths mentioning that unlike the seasonal water yield model the formulas of carbon storage and sequestration model are not climate dependent therefore the outcomes regarding the climate change effects concern only the water budget and its related services 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the nature reserve of paul do boquilobo nrpb 39 23 n and 8 32 w is a natural floodplain of 817 ha with an altitude between 15 m and 32 m a s l it is located in the catchment area of almonda river a tributary of tagus river in the municipality of torres novas and golegã district of santarem central portugal fig 1 the annual precipitation is about 713 mm yr 1 and the area can be classified within the dry sub humid c1 category according to the thornthwaite moisture classification feddema 2005 the tagus valley has been subjected to land reclamation works during the last decades of the 19th century with the aim to gain new arable land to counterbalance the impact of human pressures on this environment the nrpb was declared pa based on the national law no 198 80 of july 24 green area in fig 1 this area hosts one of the most important communities of herons in portugal and is a popular spot for wintering water birds such as ducks coots and waders it is the only national reproductive site for aythya ferina one of the main sites for refuge species such as anas penelope and anas clypeata and one of the few potential sites for nesting of chlidonias hybrid in addition several fish species like the endemics chondrostoma oligolepis and iberochondrostoma lusitanicum use the reserve for reproduction icnf instituto da conservação da natureza e das florestas 2005 the nrpb is currently characterized by riparian corridors with predominance of salix populus and fraxinus species in favor of protecting such biodiversity assets the forestry and nature conservation institute icnf implemented a management plan following the iucn directives where a core area of total protection was established core pa in fig 1 while the part of nrpb not belonging to the core pa was considered as areas of partial or complementary protection nrpb plays an important hydrologic role for all the surrounding ecosystems during the wet periods the area functions as an area of water retention during the frequent floods of the almonda river protecting the surrounding croplands during dry periods the nrpb provides valuable water supply for irrigation by recharging local aquifers baptista and santos 2016 2 2 lulc maps and future lulc scenarios the lulc maps for 1967 and 1990 are products of the map of agricultural and forested land of portugal 1 25000 scale with 12 5 m resolution which were elaborated by the survey and planning service of the ministry of economy of portugal for the respective years the 2015 map was generated from aerial orthophotometry 1 5000 scale in association with the habitat map drawn according to the habitat directive of the european union 92 43 eec european commission 1992 after correction using data from field surveys delivering a 2 5 m resolution all the maps were harmonized according to a common lulc classification as reported in table 1 an additional classification for the riparian forests was also carried out since fast growth rates are reported for these ecosystems or for the species that compose them giese et al 2000 rheinhardt et al 2012 and thus they were further classified in young and mature see definitions in table 1 moreover two future alternative lulc scenarios for 2050 were developed a business scenario bus and a naturalization scenario nat the two future scenarios were projected reclassifying the 2015 scenario which was used as baseline the bus scenario was obtained reclassifying all the private lands of 2015 scenario to croplands it was assumed that all the private lands inside nrpb will be exploited in such way to maximize market ess i e for food and fiber provision and consequently the income of the owners i e though conversion to irrigated crops olive groves and poplar plantations while the natural evolution of ecosystems is guaranteed inside the core protected area as proposed in the management plan of instituto da conservação da natureza e das florestas icnf the recommendations of the management plan would guarantee the protection of the ecological evolution process towards climax conditions inside the total protected area furthermore the presence of a cork oak forest area would be also promoted on the lands belonging to the state outside the core area as traditional landscape feature supported by the management plan santos et al 2016 the nat scenario was projected reclassifying all the cropland mapped in 2015 scenario to natural land coverages the projection assumes that all the private lands will be purchased by the nrpb under the premises of the management plan provisions that are currently in place icnf instituto da conservação da natureza e das florestas 2005 thus a process of landscape naturalization in most of the nature reserve will occur since it will be owned by the government larger areas would undergo naturalization processes except for olive groves in the northern part of the reserve croplands and poplar plantations would be replaced by mediterranean grasslands and oak forests would be maintained in the western part to preserve traditional landscape riparian forest would expand from buffer zones nearby the watercourses and the existing young riparian forest would evolve to climax stage i e mature riparian forest it was assumed that such evolution could occur in 30 years 2050 thus some young riparian forest areas from the 2015 scenario will evolve to mature stage in future scenarios considering that no human impacts or intervention affects them the aforementioned two future lulc scenarios describe the two opposite extreme gradients that define the maximum range of lulc changes in the study area and consequently the respective two extreme possible trends of ess changes 2 3 climate data for the past and future scenarios without climate change the climate raster data of the period 1950 2000 of mean monthly precipitation p minimum mean and maximum temperature tmin tmean tmax from worldclim database http worldclim org hijmans et al 2005 and reference evapotranspiration eto of asce standardized method allen et al 2005 for short reference crop clipped grass from aschonitis et al 2017 were used data of 1 km resolution the mean monthly rasters data of eto tmin tmean tmax and p were also used to build a simplified eto

tmax tmin and eto are given in fig 2 a e respectively 2 4 invest model the effects of protection initiatives on regulating ess was analyzed using invest integrated valuation of ecosystem services and trade offs version 3 3 3 package sharp et al 2016 the model simulated a climate regulation based on carbon storage and sequestration model of carbon storage and sequestration climate regulation and b water supply and water regulation model of seasonal water yield using the three lulc maps of nprb that correspond to the dates 1967 1990 and 2015 plus the business and naturalization lulc future scenarios for 2015 and 2050 the models were run for each past date and future projections to allow a comparison of the outputs since the nrpb was declared pa in 1980 the changes in lulc and regulating ess occurred between 1967 and 1990 period can assess the first consequences of the protection initiative while those occurred during between 1990 and 2015 can estimate the effects of its management similarly the comparisons of the future lulc scenarios bus and nat with or without climate change versus the past scenarios can assess the effects of future lulc designation and climate change on ess the main data sources used for the simulations are presented in table 2 2 4 1 climate regulation carbon sequestration is the mechanism through which natural ecosystems withdraw carbon from the atmosphere that is stored in their living and dead biomass of the soil the amount of carbon stored in natural ecosystems can significantly mitigate climate change due to the excess of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere the amount of carbon stored and sequestered based on the different lulc and climate scenarios was estimated using the tool carbon storage and sequestration climate regulation of invest biophysical model sharp et al 2016 the tool estimates the amount of carbon currently stored in a landscape and the amount of carbon sequestered over time by integrating four carbon pools aboveground biomass belowground biomass soil dead organic matter with land cover maps input data for carbon pools is provided in table s1 pereira et al 2014 optionally the model can provide monetary values of sequestered carbon for the period 2015 2050 the computation of monetary value net present value considered a social cost per metric ton of carbon of 220us moore and diaz 2015 and a market discount rate in price of carbon of 7 as suggested by the model values for terrestrial carbon pools were obtained from the portuguese national inventory pereira et al 2014 except for soil carbon content in grasslands which was derived from local survey data no value for carbon storage and sequestration was attributed to water ecosystems despite the important role of the marsh in storing such a resource when no direct correspondence was evident between own and national inventory lulc classifications the values were selected from the most coherent class carbon storage values for mixed lulc classes were calculated by combining the most representative habitats for example the carbon storage of young riparian forest was calculated as the weighted average of quercus spp 50 and other broadleaf 25 poplar 25 willow aboveground and belowground carbon content of mature riparian forest were calculated by considering the mean annual increment mai of total living biomass expressed as m3 ha 1 these values were converted in mg c ha 1 considering the gravity weight t m3 of the respective species quercus spp 0 85 poplar spp 0 85 and willow spp 0 75 and a default carbon fraction of 47 of biomass as suggested by ipcc 2006 guidelines carbon content was therefore allocated in above and below ground biomass pools according to the shoot to root ratio of the respective lulc types both mai and shoot to root ratio for forest type were also provided by pereira et al 2014 2 4 2 water regulation and supply natural systems can regulate hydrological flows by retaining water amounts in soil and groundwater affecting evapotranspiration and infiltration the water regulation services refer to the regulation of water flows on earth surface for maintaining the normal conditions in the watershed while the water supply service is related to the infiltration retention and storage of water in streams lakes and aquifers de groot et al 2002 the seasonal water yield tool of invest model was used to analyze the water budget of rnpb this model computes spatial indices that quantify the relative contribution of a land parcel to the generation of both base flow and quick flow integrating the calculation of punctual water yield with the position of each pixel on the landscape sharp et al 2016 the model requires a set of spatially explicit inputs describing climate soil topography and biophysical factors table 2 it provides outputs for local recharge actual evapotranspiration and run off computed on an annual time scale but using monthly values moreover the map of soil conservation service scs runoff curve number cn was processed in arcgis 10 3 esri to obtain the contribution of soil to retain excess water calculated as following nrcs 1986 s m p r 25400 c n 254 where spmr is the potential maximum soil moisture retention after runoff begins mm and cn is the curve number dimensionless for a specific hydrological soil group and lulc type the spmr represents the ability of soil to retain water while cn represents a measure of the capacity of the different land use land cover and soil types to generate rainfall runoff usda scs 1972 cn value depends on ground coverage soil type and topography regions generating more runoff are assumed to generate greater flood risk maragno et al 2018 the spmr can be a suitable proxy for water flood mitigation e g chen et al 2014 3 results 3 1 lulc changes the lulc composition of the reserve suffered significant changes during time even after the pa classification decree table 3 during 1967 the landscape of nrpb was predominantly devoted to agricultural activities where natural environments were almost absent pastures were located mainly in the central areas of the reserve and accounted for 18 9 of the total area rice fields were present on a large part of the naturally flooded areas and irrigated crops were the most abundant lulc class after the pa classification decree a permanent wetland was created to provide new habitats for aquatic and terrestrial species this led also to the development of riparian forest ecosystems surrounding the wetland and along the course of the almonda river as evident in 1990 map fig 3 however agricultural activities maintained with the growing interest and spread of maize crops in 2015 due to the management decision of acquiring property permanent aquatic habitats covered the 8 2 of the total area as results of protection initiative aiming to the conservation of aquatic species many of these ecosystems were recorded as a valuable habitat according to 92 43 eec directive including those corresponding to the habitat codes 3130 3150 3260 3280 3290 table s 2 in supplementary material riparian forests increased up to cover the 17 3 of the nrpb in 2015 leading to the classification of three riparian habitats no 91b0 92a0 and 9240 mediterranean tall humid grasslands were also restored no 6420 together with pastures activities agricultural activities suffered a strong simplification with the complete loss of rice fields non irrigated crops orchards and vineyards corn monocultures irrigated crops currently cover more than half of the nrpb as regards the bus scenario of lulc changes in 2050 the irrigated crops were hypothesized to spread again up to 65 2 of the total area inside the area under total protection permanent wetlands would be maintained and young riparian forests would evolve to mature stages poplar stands would be planted over all the north west part of the nrpb the projection performed according to the nat scenario of lulc changes in 2050 would lead to complete agricultural abandonment except for few hectares covered by olive groves the abandoned cropland would evolve to mediterranean grasslands which would cover the larger part or the reserve this scenario would lead to the maximum coverage with previously mentioned habitats included in 92 43 ecc directive 3 2 climate regulation services the amount of stored carbon increased in time as a consequence of lulc changes occurred during 1965 2015 table 4 fig 4 the period 1967 1990 during which the protection initiative started unfold a large gain 10 5 of carbon stored into the ecosystems despite the creation of wetlands in the core area during 1990 2015 an additional but lower gain was estimated 2 9 in this period the further increase of wetlands and irrigated crop areas was overcompensated by expansion of riparian habitats among the lulc classes irrigated crops showed the highest contribution to carbon sequestration for all the three considered dates 39 8 40 5 and 47 3 of the total stored carbon for 1965 1990 and 2015 respectively gains of c amount were also predicted in both future lulc scenarios bus and nat without climate change effects surprisingly even the transition from 2015 to 2050 according to the business scenario would lead to a considerable c increase 6 9 with the contribution of irrigated crops being 56 4 of the total stored carbon despite the expansion of irrigated crops and the loss of riparian forests the latter would switch to a mature stage i e transition from young riparian forest to mature riparian forest sequestering high amounts of c from the atmosphere on the other hand the transition from 2015 to 2050 according to the nat scenario would lead to even larger carbon stock gain 18 6 with riparian forests and grasslands being the largest contributors to carbon sequestration 36 4 and 27 9 contribution for mature and young riparian forests respectively and 32 4 contribution of grasslands of the total stored carbon the hypothesized net present values of future carbon sequestration 2015 2050 based on social cost of carbon emission were assessed to be 313 845 us and 848 577 us for the bus and nat scenarios in total respectively this means that a value range of 534 732 us will depend on the selection of future lulc management plan bus or nat of the area 3 3 water regulation and supply the effects of lulc changes on water budget distribution were evaluated for each date 1965 1990 2015 of the period 1965 2015 fig 5 table 5 actual evapotranspiration aet and runoff were observed to be the most and less contributing water budget components respectively as expected in a flat and dry environment however the lulc changes that occurred over time slightly affected the water budget table 5 but with a decreasing trend of recharge and runoff accompanied by an increasing trend of aet in time due the respective increase of spmr indicating a better water retention and a better exploitation of water resources for covering evapotranspiration requirements in fact despite the loss of terrestrial areas estimated values of total spmr increased as a consequence of the larger contributions of forests rather than arable land considering the two lulc scenarios of 2050 bus and nat without climate change table 5 fig 5 it is observed that bus scenario presents similar hydrologic responses recharge aet runoff spmr with the lulc responses of 1990 and 2015 lulc conditions on the other hand the nat scenario shows an evident decrease of recharge and runoff and increase of aet due the evident increase of spmr indicating that the nat lulc conditions lead to even higher water retention and much better exploitation of water resources for covering evapotranspiration requirements comparing the two lulc scenarios of 2050 bus and nat with climate change table 5 fig 6 with respective scenarios without climate change it is observed reduction of 75 5 in recharge 0 8 in aet and 35 in runoff for the bus scenario and reduction of 98 in recharge 2 2 in aet and 37 6 in runoff for the nat scenario due to climate change the projected 16 1 decrease of annual precipitation for 2050 according to rcp85 is the reason for the aforementioned reductions and especially for recharge and runoff in the case of nat scenario the reduction of recharge and runoff is even higher compared to bus due to the higher spmr 4 discussion 4 1 possible conflicts of ess supply the identification of conflicts and synergies among ess gained an increasing interest in literature during the recent years under the lens of environmental and pas management for example palomo et al 2014 highlighted a positive contribution of doñana national park on maintaining ess delivery because of the isolation of pa with respect to the lulc changes which occurred outside onaindia et al 2013 described the spatial congruence of biodiversity carbon storage and water flow regulation arguing that biodiversity conservation would ensure the provision of regulation services by the maintenance of native forest ecosystems synergy between biodiversity and carbon storage was confirmed in many other studies e g steinbeiss et al 2008 williams et al 2008 hall et al 2012 peh et al 2016 vergílio et al 2016 to such an extent that some high biodiversity areas could be protected by carbon based conservation strategies strassburg et al 2010 moreover a relatively high overlap between carbon and soil ess was detected in literature izquierdo and clark 2012 gissi et al 2014 gissi et al 2018 for example the carbon stored in aboveground biomass was positively correlated with both water supply and water regulation in rodríguez et al 2015 flood prevention seems positively correlated with biodiversity conservation egoh et al 2009 newton et al 2012 and carbon storage chan et al 2006 even though correlations values are generally low on the other hand conservation efforts may lead to controversial outcomes castro et al 2015 found that the higher levels of protection do not ensure the provision of multiple ess fedrigotti et al 2016 found that forest expansion at the expense of grasslands and croplands i e renaturalization in alpine environments may reduce the economic contribution of ess negative outcomes were also detected in deltaic environment gaglio et al 2017a and tropical mountain areas garcía márquez et al 2017 gaglio et al 2017b izquierdo and clark 2012 observed slight negative correlation between water yield and biodiversity as well as with carbon storage this study demonstrated that conservation actions affected the ess provision in the nrpb over time during 1967 2015 while the future designed lulc scenarios for 2050 with and without climate change effects revealed that management decisions have important effects on ess supply the ess analysis highlighted that the efforts for biodiversity conservation through pas can lead to parallel positive responses in terms of climate mitigation and flood prevention in floodplains such as nrpb however some conflicts may arise in water regulation services carvalho santos et al 2016a b as indicated by table 5 all the lulc conditions after 1965 including the future scenarios led to reduction of recharge and runoff and increase of water retention which is desirable for floodplains and vulnerable environments to floods in general on the other hand respective lulc changes may have a negative impact in places where groundwater resources are limited or minimum ecological flows in surface waters are difficult to guarantee these observations are in line with the findings of quintas soriano et al 2014 who described that non protected areas are more relevant providers of groundwater recharge service in comparison to the protected landscapes conversely the increase of real evapotranspiration due to the increase of water retention may boost the biomass production and consequently the provisioning services e g food and timber production counterbalancing the economic loss from water regulation services on the other hand even this pathway of ess exploitation is not a secure plan since aet was slightly reduced in the of bus and nat scenarios considering the climate change effects overall the analysis of ess trends in nrpb revealed that the mere biodiversity conservation may not be effective in maintaining some ess and that an active management is required future management of nrpb should consider the relationships among ess raised in this analysis and the role of conservation strategies if only biodiversity conservation is fostered e g nat scenario the contribution of the reserve to climate change mitigation and the capacity to buffer flooding will increase though this would cause a decrease of water supply especially if rcp85 will occur with unpredictable consequences on the preservation of the aquatic environment contrarily the maintenance of a limited extension of agricultural land and pastures on the nrpb managed with non intensive practices could be an ecological solution to maintain a balanced water budget this result is in line with the findings of felipe lucia and comin 2015 who demonstrated that a mosaic of different lulc types can support ess and biodiversity in agricultural floodplains in any case the relevance of our study resides in make trade offs between ess explicit in order to inform decision makers towards the potential consequences of different actions gissi and garramone 2018 special consideration should be given to the riparian ecosystems of nrpb particularly mature riparian forest provide high values of evapotranspiration and spmr as well as carbon storage soil conservation and nutrient retention dindaroğlu et al 2015 on the other hand such forest transitions in lowland areas may cause a dramatic decrease of local recharge capacity therefore the management and regulation strategies concerning these ecosystems are fundamental for the provision of ess at regional scale garrastazú et al 2015 sáenz et al 2016 vidal abarca et al 2016 as far as climate change is concerned it was observed that decision making in land use will be challenging when considering future climate projections when conservation measures included the total renaturing of the reserve the trade off between water infiltration and flood prevention capacity results were exacerbated these findings are confirmed also by other studies in fact increase of flood attenuation potential of floodplains under climate change was predicted also by moor et al 2015 other studies carried out in mediterranean basins evaluated that water supply service may be reduced up to 49 bangash et al 2013 or almost 100 terrado et al 2014 4 2 limitations of the modelling approach even though spatially explicit models are probably among the finest tools to map ess provision their application presents some limitations generally related to both the reliability of input data and to the simplifications that lie under the assumptions on which models are based on bagstad et al 2013 hou et al 2013 moreover when models are based on a low number of input parameters their sensitivity to these factors can be high especially when data is obtained from national inventories which represent desirable sources when no field data is available on the other hand national inventory datasets may not capture adequately the variability in fine spatial scales additionally some model simplifications are necessary to be accepted when describing very complex phenomena such as those that regulate ecological functioning for instance the carbon storage and sequestration model assumes that none of the lulc types gains or loses carbon over time or under the effects of climate change the only changes in carbon storage captured by the model over time are those due to changes from one lulc type to another as suggested by invest 3 3 3 users guide this problem can be at least partially addressed classifying some lulc types into age classes as it was made in this work similar problems have been observed in other studies bottalico et al 2016 moreover the model does not include greenhouse gas emissions related to agricultural activities e g tillage fertilizer and pesticide applications that affect the net carbon sequestration capacity of croplands and should be considered under a life cycle perspective similar limitations appear also in the case of hydrological parameters e g crop factors soil hydrologic groups which are necessary in the seasonal water yield tool crop factors of the same crops land uses which are given in various databases e g database of invest model or fao may differ significantly from place to place either due to local soil climate conditions or due to different cultivation practices aschonitis et al 2018 additionally in the case of soil hydrologic groups it is not taken into account the evolution in soil conditions from the lulc changes 5 conclusions the present study highlighted the relevance of conservation initiatives in ess provision and the significance of modeling approaches for their explanation the spatially explicit assessment of ess using modeling approaches like invest can inform and support managers on environmental decisions considering trade off between ess that are strongly associated to the human well being of local populations from the results of the study it was concluded that floodplain riparian habitats like nrpb display a high capacity for the delivery of multiple ess the limitation of human activities such as agriculture and grazing could be desirable to optimize the delivery of ess which are related to carbon and water retention on the other hand significant conflicts between specific water regulation services may appear by the application of pa initiatives possible reductions of water recharge to groundwaters and runoff such as those observed in the specific study may not be desirable in places where groundwater resources are limited or minimum ecological flows in surface waters are difficult to be maintained thus the use of modeling approaches to assess complex ess interactions taking also into account the possible effects of climate change can be a valuable tool for the description of ecological mechanisms that underlie trade offs and synergies among ess and for supporting decision making this is particularly important when considering protected areas where the assessment of the services delivered is urgently needed in order to provide arguments for biodiversity conservation

25056,tree populations in regions undergoing restoration are generally made up of few individuals isolated from neighboring populations and are found within a matrix of inhospitable human modified landscapes resulting negative genetic consequences such as inbreeding depression and genetic drift require mitigation strategies to maintain sufficient genetic diversity in restoration areas such strategies often involve seed sampling from many source trees with different provenances however the efficacy of these approaches has not been validated we present an individual based spatial simulation model to evaluate the effects of 1 differing levels of initial genetic diversity and 2 different area sizes on short tens of years and mid term hundreds of years restored population viability we demonstrate this approach and the use of our model with case study of centrolobium tomentosum a tropical tree species widely used in restoration projects in the atlantic forest of brazil our model and analysis framework can be applied in studies of tree species with different characteristics from tropical and temperate forests to assess population persistence in restoration sites as a function of genetic diversity and population size this knowledge can support planning of both restoration projects and management actions increasing the probability of restoration success while also reducing associated costs keywords ecological restoration genetic diversity individual based model population viability 1 introduction ecological restoration endeavors to recover and improve ecological processes to attain functional and resilient communities that can adapt to changing conditions alexander et al 2011 restoration is now acknowledged as a global environmental priority and many international initiatives are aiming to restore millions of hectares around the world suding et al 2015 holl 2017 broad scale re conversion of pasturelands and agricultural fields to native forest ecosystems is seen as necessary to mitigate future extinctions in regions with high levels of habitat loss and fragmentation banks leite et al 2014 newmark et al 2017 the goal of such restoration is to support conservation re establish plant populations with sufficient genetic diversity to persist overtime and to increase landscape connectivity to facilitate plant and animal gene flow in human modified landscapes chazdon et al 2015 brancalion et al 2018 despite the myriad of benefits that restoration may provide the probability of population persistence following forest restoration planting is uncertain and can be affected by multiple factors including micro site limitations for recruitment bertacchi et al 2016 competition with invasive species d antonio and meyerson 2002 pollination and dispersal limitation dixon 2009 climate change harris et al 2006 and genetic mediated processes such as inbreeding depression thomas et al 2014 improving our understanding of the conditions under which persistence is more likely is critical to successful restoration and effective conservation suding et al 2015 the use of computer models is one potential solution for this problem epperson et al 2010 the process through which data and models of populations are evaluated to estimate likelihoods of population persistence over an arbitrary amount of time is called population viability analysis pva boyce 1992 some research groups developed forest models with varied applications such as to predict succession dynamics of forest communities pacala et al 1996 understand individual tree growth hauhs et al 1995 and community dynamics bugmann 2001 and evaluate the interaction of trees with environmental factors seidl et al 2012 also an increasing number of forest landscape simulation models are available as reviewed by scheller and mladenoff 2007 however there is an unfortunate lack of simulation programs that combine population dynamics and spatial and temporal genetic variation of tree species which have long life spans and overlapping generations also most pvas assessments ignore or inadequately model genetic factors as the effect of inbreeding depression on total fitness frankham et al 2014 mid and long term persistence of restored tree populations depends on the capacity of species and populations to evolve in response to environmental changes this capacity in turn depends on intra specific population levels of genetic diversity booy et al 2000 populations with reduced genetic diversity tend to show reduced fitness limited potential for adaptation reed and frankham 2003 and have a higher probability of extinction due to diseases or environmental stochasticity mills 2012 thus using seeds with high genetic diversity in restoration projects is one of the main strategies for effective restoration and successful conservation in the face of environmental change zucchi et al 2018 however our understanding of how to use genetic data in restoration projects remains incomplete thomas et al 2014 basey et al 2015 efforts to include genetic diversity in forest restoration often involve the selection of specific source populations and a diversity of trees from which seeds are collected for sapling production mother trees for seed harvesting bozzano et al 2014 basey et al 2015 restoration practitioners typically aim to ensure the long term persistence of reintroduced populations by using seeds from local populations which increases the probability that individuals will be adapted to local environmental conditions practitioners also aim to maximize the genetic diversity of the founding population through the selection of many different mother trees hufford and mazer 2003 mckay et al 2005 restoration projects that aim to increase genetic diversity and local adaptation in seedling populations nonetheless face significant challenges when implemented at small geographic scales because small areas comprise small populations because of their relatively low effective population size these populations are at risk of loss of genetic diversity similar to populations negatively affected by habitat loss and fragmentation sezen et al 2007 chazdon 2014 the loss of genetic diversity can be observed as a reduction in heterozygosity and allelic diversity through time the smaller the population the faster the manifestation of the negative effects of drift on genetic diversity is expected mills 2012 the loss of genetic diversity in these populations due to inbreeding depression further increases the risk of local extinction frankham 2005 and consequently restoration failure to address this issue researchers and practitioners have provided different recommendations for the minimum population size necessary to avoid the negative effects of genetic drift and inbreeding depression in the context of restoration in both the short term 5 generations and long term 100 years it has been suggested as a general rule that seeds should be sampled from at least 30 vencovsky 1986 or 50 trees basey et al 2015 to recover sufficient genetic diversity in tree populations with an effective population size ne 100 however there is a lack of studies validating or testing the efficacy and feasibility of these recommendations due to constraints in both ecological limited number of mother trees of low density species in fragmented landscapes and financial terms time and resources spent to find numerous mother trees and collect their seeds brancalion et al 2012 for example in tropical forest restoration efforts where over 100 native tree species have been reintroduced in restoration plantations rodrigues et al 2011 reaching the targeted number of mother trees per species i e 30 50 can be difficult also as the current recommendations for forest restoration is to plant 20 in ha in small restoration areas 5 ha up to two or three seedling from each mother tree would be planted if the general rule is followed improved evaluation of the probability of success of restoration approaches that vary in the number of mother trees used and the effective population size targeted is needed to effectively deploy limited restoration resources in this study we present a novel individual based model to simulate the spatio temporal genetic and population dynamics of trees in restoration plantations in response to different restoration strategies and over long time scales using this model we specifically examine how different levels of initial genetic diversity and population size influence long term restoration success defined as short and mid term population persistence currently there are few programs that simulate the population dynamics of tree species which have long life spans and overlapping generations and that also model spatial and temporal genetic variation also most of these models ignore or inadequately capture genetic factors such as the effect of inbreeding depression on total fitness frankham et al 2014 in our expository treatment of our newly developed model we present a case study application based on restoration of a tropical tree in the atlantic forest of brazil 2 the model the description of our model follows the odd overview design concepts detail protocol of grimm et al 2006 2010 this model was designed to investigate the influence of initial genetic diversity and area size on population persistence initial genetic diversity within a restoration plantation is represented by the minimum number of mother trees from which seeds were collected in addition to initial area size this is one of the parameters over which management agencies have the greatest control when designing and implementing restoration strategies in this context we set out to address the following two specific questions 1 how does are size and initial genetic diversity affect the loss of genetic diversity of restored tree populations and 2 what is the minimum number of mother trees from which seeds should be collected for a restoration forest plantation to ensure sustainable levels of genetic diversity in the restored population 2 1 entities state variables and scales the entities of this model are individual trees each individual is characterized by the following three state variables 1 spatial location 2 age and 3 multi locus genotype spatial location describes the geographic x and y coordinates on a two dimensional lattice tree age varies from zero to a maximum species age and increases by one unit i e year per time step simulations begin with all individuals at three years old as in a recent plantation seeds have age of zero and germinated seedlings have age of one individuals are considered juveniles before they reach reproductive age and adults are reproductive until the end of life with the same reproduction rate fig s1 each genotype is composed of multiple independent multi allelic co dominant loci with no linkage disequilibrium fig s2 alleles are represented by a pair of integer numbers each of which can take a value between one to the maximum number of alleles initially defined the time step in the model is one year the spatial extent of the simulated area consists of a single isolated rectangular forest fragment patch undergoing restoration the area shape always a narrow rectangle was designed to simulate narrow riparian forests where there is no light limitation and that have received special attention over the past 30 years due to their importance to river protection rodrigues et al 2009 these forests patches are typically long and narrow and are intensively affected by edge effects didham and lawton 1999 davies colley et al 2000 and tend to retain the characteristics of early successional systems as they age tabarelli et al 2008 2 2 process overview the model starts by defining initial conditions including age spatial location and genotypes of individual trees in the initial planted population the following model parameters are also specified simulation duration time number of simulation repetitions rep number of loci in the input dataset lattice dimensions xdim ydim pollen dpollen and seed dseed dispersal distances number of seeds produced by each tree avseed maximum age an individual can reach maxage at what age the individual becomes an adult adultage maximum number of pollen donors for each offspring maxfathers germination probability germ selection factor selection and the time steps when output files should be saved output years each cycle starts with the determination of each individual s survival rate as a function of age this model consider hermaphrodite tree species so all individuals can be either mother or father of an offspring and self fertilization is possible the reproduction step starts by defining for each mature tree i e mother which mature trees i e potential fathers are present within the pollen dispersal range if the number of potential mates is fewer than the maxfathers all mates contribute to pollination otherwise a number of potential mates equivalent to maxfathers are randomly selected to be pollen donors by default potential mates as sampled with a uniform probability distribution but other probability distributions may be implemented alleles are inherited following mendelian inheritance seed location is defined by the seed dispersal range and a randomly selected dispersal direction if a seed falls at the same location of an existing adult or out of the study area it does not survive otherwise each seed has the predefined initial probability of germination which can be decreased as a function of its inbreeding coefficient richards 2000 in species that produce a large number of seeds from which only a few germinate and survive to juvenile phase genetic drift tends to have a stronger effect than selection thus selection on germination and survival is not strong enough to purge deleterious alleles efficiently keller and walter 2002 in these situations inbreeding depression can affect seed and seedling viability naito et al 2005 germination success richards 2000 and survival rates ishida 2006 the assumptions for estimating the inbreeding effects on fitness in this model are 1 an increase in inbreeding by 10 leads to a reduction in fitness components of 5 10 frankel and soulé 1981 2 a large number of loci are affected by inbreeding depression ayroles et al 2009 chaves et al 2011 and 3 a sample of loci allows us to infer the inbreeding coefficient of a population chaves et al 2011 when a new seed successfully germinates it is added to the tracking list of active individuals with an age of one probability of survival to the next year for both juveniles and reproductive individuals is assessed in each time step as an increasing function of tree age fig s1 dead individuals are removed from the tracking list and hence the population at the end of the simulation a table summarizing information on the location genotype age and survival probability for all living individuals is produced genotypic output data are converted to the fstat goudet 1995 format and genetic summary statistics are calculated for all individuals with age 1 using the software hierfstat goudet 2005 summary statistics calculated include number of individuals total number of alleles allelic richness observed and expected heterozygosity under hardy weinberg equilibrium hwe and the inbreeding coefficient with confidence interval 2 3 design concepts 2 3 1 basic concepts the basic principles of this model are that the population is isolated from others no migration mutation rates are negligible individuals only mate with others within the pollen dispersal range i e the population is not panmictic and germination probability is influenced by the inbreeding coefficient of each seed mortality in all other life stages is age dependent fig s1 2 3 2 emergence population size is the total number of individuals with minimum age of 1 year old and is a consequence of mating rules see below survival probabilities and the amount of space available this means that population size is an emergent property of the simulation the frequency and number of alleles vary as a result of genetic drift which is random although influenced by the assumptions of dispersal and overall model spatial scale thus allele frequencies and their spatial distribution are an emergent property 2 3 3 stochasticity randomness in the model operates through mating and survival mates are sampled at random from the adults available within the pollen dispersal range other than distance from the mother tree there are no other rules for mating preference seed genotypes are the result of random sampling of the parents genotypes each seed s location is defined in the seed dispersal range from the mother tree according to the rules described in the seed dispersal sub model which includes randomness in dispersal direction death is probabilistic and depends on the age of the individual fig s1 2 4 initialization at the beginning of each simulation the parameters of the initial population planted in the area must be defined the initial population consists of saplings all the same age that may descend from different number of mother trees their genotypes are drawn depending on the number of mother trees from which they descended and may vary from a pool of individuals in hwe to a full sibling pool the saplings can be planted uniformly randomly or aggregated in one or more clusters as defined by the user 2 5 input the input dataset consists of a tab delimited data table comprised of desired initial individual locations x y genotypes and age fig s2 there is no limitation on number of individuals and the size of the restoration area except for those imposed by the memory limitations of each user s computer system 2 6 sub models the model contains four sub models 1 reproduction 2 seed dispersal 3 seed germination and 4 age specific mortality 2 6 1 reproduction this sub model simulates sexual reproduction among individuals in the pollen dispersal distance range the model does not simulate asexual reproduction or gene flow from other non explicitly simulated populations reproduction occurs once per annual time step all adult individuals are considered to be reproductive and all have the same potential for pollen and seed production we assume that there is no pollen limitation pollen donors are randomly sampled from the pool of individuals in the pollen dispersal distance range we assumed mendelian inheritance of alleles as the model s loci represent independent nuclear genetic marker loci i e no linkage selfing was allowed in the simulations as the mother tree is included in the pollen donors 2 6 2 seed dispersal we assumed isotropy no preferential direction for dispersal so the seed location is defined by the dispersal distance function and a random value from one to 2π radians for the direction all seeds produced in a year germinate or die we do not consider soil seed bank formation 2 6 3 seed germination we modelled the probability of seed germination as a function of inbreeding thus in this sub model the probability of germination is estimated using all neutral loci wherein if the inbreeding coefficient fis is greater than zero an increase in inbreeding leads to a reduction of germination rate in the scale defined by the selection factor grate g 1 selection fis where g is the probability of germination with no inbreeding so a selection factor of 0 5 means that an increase in inbreeding by 10 leads to a reduction of 5 in germination rate frankel and soulé 1981 if inbreeding coefficient is zero or negative it has no effect on germination rate 2 6 4 survival the probability of mortality increased as a function of age table 1 up until the maximum age for that species at which point all individuals die to determine whether an individual dies at each time step a random number is sampled from a uniform distribution between zero and one if the number is larger than the survival probability srate associated with the individual s age then the individual dies 2 7 model development we wrote the program script in the scientific computing language r r core team 2015 general model schematic is described in fig 1 and the program script can be found in supplementary material and also at github https github com sujiips restoration pva git 2 8 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were performed to quantify the relative importance of each model process on simulation results and to assess how uncertainty in parameter values affects simulation dynamics all simulations for sensitivity analysis used a restoration area of five hectares with a presumed seed source of a large population and using reference parameter values from centrolobium tomentosum fabaceae a tree species from an intermediate stage of ecological succession from a tropical forest each simulation was run for 500 time steps and each scenario for a unique set of parameters was replicated 250 times this number of replicates was found to capture sufficient variation in system dynamics i e cv 0 05 fig s3 we performed a local sensitivity analysis railsback and grimm 2011 which involved varying parameter values one at a time parameter values were varied between 5 and 5 railsback and grimm 2011 except for some parameters e g adult age and maximum pollen dispersal distance for which a 5 variation was too small to produce noticeable response in these situations a higher percentage of variation was selected table 2 3 model application we demonstrate application of our model using a simulated restoration experiment using c tomentosum fabaceae in the tropical atlantic forest of brazil this species was selected because it is widely used in restoration projects in brazil and because demographic and genetic data are readily available c tomentosum is frequently used for forest restoration because it is a common gap colonizing species reproduces once a year grows quickly produce high quality timber and has symbiotic associations with nitrogen fixation microorganisms which facilitate its rapid colonization carvalho 2005 pagano 2008 this species has a wide distribution over the atlantic forest and some parts of cerrado two of the most threatened global hotspots for biodiversity conservation we investigated the consequences of varying three experimental factors on genetic diversity and short and mid terms population viability in forest patches that have undergone restoration planting these factors were 1 initial population size 2 size of the restoration area and 3 initial genetic composition number of alleles and genotypic frequencies initial genetic composition was determined by the number of mother trees from which seeds were collected we estimated mean number of alleles effective number of alleles allelic richness inbreeding coefficient and probability of extinction to evaluate the effects of the experimental factors on each population for the purposes of this experiment simulated forest patches represent riparian areas long and narrow with a fixed 30 m width as are many restoration plantations rodrigues et al 2009 simulations were run over 500 years and output files were saved at 30 50 100 250 and 500 years we simulated patch areas of 5 ha 10 ha and 20 ha initial population size varied with patch area because the current recommendations for forest restoration is to plant 20 in ha the tree spatial distribution in the forest patch the mean number of alleles per locus the inbreeding coefficient and the seed dispersal pattern used to produce the initial population were based on data obtained from real populations in well established 27 and 57 years old restoration plantations sujii 2015 sujii et al 2017 to produce the input datasets we first created a simulated a large initial population n 1000 with all loci in hardy weinberg equilibrium hwe and the same number of loci and alleles per locus that would be used in the simulations 10 loci 5 alleles per locus initial populations were composed of seedlings all of the same age as in a restoration plantation seedlings in the input dataset were the result of simulated reproduction events between seed sources and pollen donors from the original population therefore the input dataset represents a sample of seeds collected from a large population as is typically the case in applied restoration projects the genetic composition of each initial population was determined by the number of seed sources and pollen donors in some initial populations seedlings were all the result of self fertilization as the offspring of one isolated tree in other initial populations different number of seed sources and pollen donors contributed with alleles for the offspring seed sources 1 5 10 or 30 individuals pollen donors 5 10 or 20 in ividuals initial populations created with larger number of seed sources and pollen donors had higher initial genetic diversity for simulations with saplings from one mother tree and five pollen donors we sampled one individual from the original population to be the mother and five individuals to be the pollen donors this mother was the source of the first allele of each locus of each sapling used in the plantation the second allele of each locus was randomly sampled from the five pollen donors for the simulations with saplings from more than one mother tree we applied the same procedure as for one mother but using additional sampled individuals as mothers the assumed maximum tree age is 89 years based on mean growth rate functions for both canopy and emergent trees laurance et al 2004 growth rates for c tomentosum was estimated using diameter measures of trees from nine restoration areas with different known ages 6 96 years silva 2013 the probability of surviving to the next time step was estimated using a demographic study of adult individuals from a natural remnant forest fragment barreto 2009 silva 2013 and follows a weibull distribution as there were no available data for seedlings and sapling survival rates a linear function was used such that for each year of increase in age between one and six survival rate increases by 0 2 after the age of six we use empirical data on survival barreto 2009 silva 2013 fig s1 as c tomentosum is a hermaphrodite species and all individuals can be either mother or father of an offspring self fertilization is also possible the main pollinators are large bees with long distance flight capacity the maximum distance of pollen flow 1000 m was based on information on flight patterns and mean maximum flight distances of large bees which are the main pollinators of c tomentosum pasquet et al 2008 hagen et al 2011 the pollen donors are randomly sampled from the pool of individuals in the pollen dispersal distance range following the pollinators foraging behaviour keasar et al 1996 the species has a mixed mating system and the maximum number of pollen donors for each mother tree was selected to be 20 trees c tomentosum has one or two seeds enclosed in a large 9 g each thorny samara winged fruit that does not remain in permanent seed banks and are dispersed by wind for short distances at most 100 m away from the mother tree following a weibull distribution so most seeds fall under the canopy of the mother tree cavalho 2005 aidar and joly 2003 sujii 2015 the germination probability is 0 7 carvalho 2005 a summary of all parameter values can be found in table 1 4 results 4 1 sensitivity analysis we found that our model is not overly sensitive to any of the parameters tested given the range of values we examined table 2 each parameter had different effects on the mean number of alleles a the inbreeding coefficient fis and the proportion of extinct populations the parameters with the strongest effect were maximum age that a tree can reach germination rate selection pressure value and average number of seeds produced by each tree on the number of alleles table 2 4 2 model application complete output files from the simulated restoration experiment are available at github https github com sujiips restoration pva both initial population size and initial genetic composition affected population viability and long term maintenance of genetic diversity table 3 as expected larger populations resulted in smaller effects of genetic drift measured here as loss of total number of alleles fig 2 a in populations from small areas all simulated scenarios lead to allele loss and an increase in inbreeding coefficient regarding genetic diversity if planted saplings were produced from seeds of a single isolated tree initial genetic diversity was already low and the number of alleles tended to one in all simulation conditions fig 2 an increase either in the number of mother trees or pollen donors resulted in greater initial genetic diversity and reduced the rate allele loss especially in larger initial populations 200 and 400 individuals results of simulations with five or more mother trees were similar in mid term in the short term 250 years initial populations generated with seeds from five mother trees had a relatively reduced number of alleles there was no difference in allelic diversity effective number of alleles and allelic richness between 10 and 20 pollen donors fig 2 fig s4 initial genetic composition had a strong effect on the inbreeding coefficient in populations from the small areas sampling seeds from only one isolated tree resulted in a larger increase in inbreeding and in stronger bottleneck effects than sampling seeds that were result of outcrossing fig 2 selection against overall homozygosity at the germination phase kept the inbreeding coefficient small or moderate even with fixation of alleles at some loci fig 2 the probability of extinction was greater in populations from smaller areas also populations founded by seeds from only one isolated mother tree had higher proportion of extinct populations populations initiated with seeds from 30 seed sources also had high proportion of extinct populations although the mean number of alleles and the mean fis were similar to simulations with five and 10 seed sources fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 model development the model we present is a tool for understanding the effects of initial genetic diversity and population size on the long term viability of tree populations in forest restoration projects it can be applied in studies of tree species with different characteristics from tropical and temperate forests this model is particularly useful when rare and threatened species are reintroduced in restoration sites to support their conservation which relies on the potential of reintroduced populations to persist overtime duquesnel et al 2017 restoration practitioners can associate their current knowledge and new field data with the results from simulations of varied scenarios which may comprise species with different characteristics and a more comprehensive range of area sizes in order to guide planning and implementation of new restoration areas the use of spatially explicit stochastic space time simulations has many advantages over spatial mathematical models including the capacity to include biological complexity such as stochasticity individual level variation adaptive traits as well as spatial processes e g dispersal that are difficult to reliably model using purely mathematical approaches epperson et al 2010 individual based models are particularly useful for planning reintroduction and conservation of endangered species in restoration areas covington et al 2001 bruford et al 2010 especially if restoration and conservation practitioners and modellers work together wood et al 2015 habitat loss and population disruption by fragmentation are two of the main causes of species extinction fahrig 1997 forest restoration is a relevant complement to species conservation plans because it enables the increase in forest area and the reintroduction of endangered species nevertheless endangered species are usually found in small population sizes and in low densities which hampers seed sampling both for ex situ and in situ conservation the model we have presented is a valuable tool for decision making as it can be used to help design seed sampling strategies for effective and genetically informed restoration efforts it is important to note that for many tree species some of the parameters required by our model are not readily available one of the unfortunate paradoxes of working with endangered and hence rare species nonetheless data on threatened species autoecology and population structure are becoming increasingly available kattge et al 2011 sousa baena et al 2014 canhos et al 2014 de lima et al 2015 information can also be extrapolated from species with similar ecological and demographic characteristics and simulations covering the uncertainty range of the parameter can be performed this model accounts for overlapping generations and effects of inbreeding depression which are present in many tree species angeloni et al 2011 the effects of inbreeding depression were summarized in this model in the germination process that is when the negative effects of inbreeding are strong and were more carefully measured ishida 2006 naito et al 2005 chaves et al 2011 although there is evidence that inbreeding may reduce survival and reproduction in different life stages hufford and hamrick 2003 naito et al 2005 there is a lack of studies testing the magnitude of the effect on later life stages further investigation into the effects of inbreeding depression on different life stages is required this model was designed for simulations of populations in the short and mid term tens of generations because it does not account for mutation and for changes in selective pressures over time it focuses on only one isolated population but it is possible to evaluate effects of inter population gene flow when a migration parameter is included these limitations may be overcome using the results obtained from our model as input or assumptions for other simulation programs that account for mutation migration and natural selection in changing environments 5 2 model application restoration projects must consider both the spatial attributes of the restoration area and the initial effective population size to reduce the risk of genetic bottlenecks and to increase the probability of long term population persistence allendorf et al 2013 in general smaller restoration areas contain smaller populations thus in long narrow riparian restoration areas such as those targeted for c tomentosum high initial genetic composition i e diversity of the seed pool is necessary to maintain such diversity and assure long term population viability the results from our case study indicate that increasing the number of seed sources from one to five can be enough to reduce the bottleneck effect and sampling seeds from trees that can receive pollen from at least five other trees avoids the fixation of alleles in the medium term given our results for c tomentosum and species with similar reproductive characteristics we recommend for forest managers to avoid sampling seeds from isolated trees and to use more than five trees from large well preserved populations as seed sources in all sizes of restoration area planting seeds from only one isolated tree results in a very strong bottleneck effect higher extinction rate and genetic diversity loss increasing either the number of mother trees or the number of pollen donors increase the initial levels of genetic diversity which is beneficial for slowing down the loss of alleles over time higher initial genetic diversity also resulted in lower levels of inbreeding in a mid term we found that restoration projects using c tomentosum or using other species with similar life history traits should use seeds taken from at least ten mother trees to ensure successful restoration beyond this number e g up to 30 we did not identify any additional long term benefits in terms of the maintenance of genetic diversity and reduction in inbreeding the higher proportion of extinct populations observed in simulations with seeds from 30 mother trees may be a result of the random sample of a few seeds from each tree more simulations with defined seed sampling designs are required to explain this result our finding of a minimum of 10 trees is lower than current recommendations in the literature where greater than 30 trees are recommended vencovsky 1986 basey et al 2015 the recommendation for 30 trees aims to conserve a minimum effective population size of 100 which was not addressed in our study instead we focused on how the different levels of initial genetic diversity influenced long term maintenance of genetic diversity in restoration populations without explicit consideration of effective population size we show that under situations where conservation resources are limited and management objectives involve identifying suitable trade offs between population viability and minimizing costs seeds taken from ten trees will be sufficient this is a preliminary study with only one species and a limited number of simulated scenarios to exemplify one application of the model the overall pattern observed here should not be used isolated to support forest restoration and management actions more extensive studies however may help to improve the use of the proposed model in ecological restoration programs in addition as all simulated areas showed reduction in genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding coefficient estimates to ensure long term sustainability restoration programs should emphasize connectivity among newly restored patches and existing forest patches rudnick et al 2012 fao 2015 connectivity among forest fragments is essential to gene flow among remnant and other restoration areas increase metapopulation size and reduce the negative effects of small population sizes observed in our simulations frankham 2015 although we did not explicitly examine this question in this study future work in this area should examine the interactions between initial genetic diversity and spatial connectivity in fragmented landscape at different spatial scales and over varying conservation planning horizons 6 final remarks simulation approaches have been used previously in forest restoration to assess the impact of ecophysiological parameters on species resilience of forest stands pietsch and hasenauer 2002 to understand the influence of management on forest structure over time covington et al 2001 and to predict habitat quality in restoration plantations pausas et al 1997 simulations are a useful tool for evaluating restoration success when empirical manipulation of the system is either too costly or limited by the rarity and conservation status of the taxa being examined nonetheless integration of simulation and empirical studies will further serve to inform decision making processes and ultimately improve the probability of success and long term persistence of restoration efforts to our knowledge this is the first model to simulate restored population persistence using a combined population biology and population genetics approach as a novel approach it will require further adaptations and development to address other specific restoration projects this model and the approach on which it is based have great potential to support seed collection to

25056,tree populations in regions undergoing restoration are generally made up of few individuals isolated from neighboring populations and are found within a matrix of inhospitable human modified landscapes resulting negative genetic consequences such as inbreeding depression and genetic drift require mitigation strategies to maintain sufficient genetic diversity in restoration areas such strategies often involve seed sampling from many source trees with different provenances however the efficacy of these approaches has not been validated we present an individual based spatial simulation model to evaluate the effects of 1 differing levels of initial genetic diversity and 2 different area sizes on short tens of years and mid term hundreds of years restored population viability we demonstrate this approach and the use of our model with case study of centrolobium tomentosum a tropical tree species widely used in restoration projects in the atlantic forest of brazil our model and analysis framework can be applied in studies of tree species with different characteristics from tropical and temperate forests to assess population persistence in restoration sites as a function of genetic diversity and population size this knowledge can support planning of both restoration projects and management actions increasing the probability of restoration success while also reducing associated costs keywords ecological restoration genetic diversity individual based model population viability 1 introduction ecological restoration endeavors to recover and improve ecological processes to attain functional and resilient communities that can adapt to changing conditions alexander et al 2011 restoration is now acknowledged as a global environmental priority and many international initiatives are aiming to restore millions of hectares around the world suding et al 2015 holl 2017 broad scale re conversion of pasturelands and agricultural fields to native forest ecosystems is seen as necessary to mitigate future extinctions in regions with high levels of habitat loss and fragmentation banks leite et al 2014 newmark et al 2017 the goal of such restoration is to support conservation re establish plant populations with sufficient genetic diversity to persist overtime and to increase landscape connectivity to facilitate plant and animal gene flow in human modified landscapes chazdon et al 2015 brancalion et al 2018 despite the myriad of benefits that restoration may provide the probability of population persistence following forest restoration planting is uncertain and can be affected by multiple factors including micro site limitations for recruitment bertacchi et al 2016 competition with invasive species d antonio and meyerson 2002 pollination and dispersal limitation dixon 2009 climate change harris et al 2006 and genetic mediated processes such as inbreeding depression thomas et al 2014 improving our understanding of the conditions under which persistence is more likely is critical to successful restoration and effective conservation suding et al 2015 the use of computer models is one potential solution for this problem epperson et al 2010 the process through which data and models of populations are evaluated to estimate likelihoods of population persistence over an arbitrary amount of time is called population viability analysis pva boyce 1992 some research groups developed forest models with varied applications such as to predict succession dynamics of forest communities pacala et al 1996 understand individual tree growth hauhs et al 1995 and community dynamics bugmann 2001 and evaluate the interaction of trees with environmental factors seidl et al 2012 also an increasing number of forest landscape simulation models are available as reviewed by scheller and mladenoff 2007 however there is an unfortunate lack of simulation programs that combine population dynamics and spatial and temporal genetic variation of tree species which have long life spans and overlapping generations also most pvas assessments ignore or inadequately model genetic factors as the effect of inbreeding depression on total fitness frankham et al 2014 mid and long term persistence of restored tree populations depends on the capacity of species and populations to evolve in response to environmental changes this capacity in turn depends on intra specific population levels of genetic diversity booy et al 2000 populations with reduced genetic diversity tend to show reduced fitness limited potential for adaptation reed and frankham 2003 and have a higher probability of extinction due to diseases or environmental stochasticity mills 2012 thus using seeds with high genetic diversity in restoration projects is one of the main strategies for effective restoration and successful conservation in the face of environmental change zucchi et al 2018 however our understanding of how to use genetic data in restoration projects remains incomplete thomas et al 2014 basey et al 2015 efforts to include genetic diversity in forest restoration often involve the selection of specific source populations and a diversity of trees from which seeds are collected for sapling production mother trees for seed harvesting bozzano et al 2014 basey et al 2015 restoration practitioners typically aim to ensure the long term persistence of reintroduced populations by using seeds from local populations which increases the probability that individuals will be adapted to local environmental conditions practitioners also aim to maximize the genetic diversity of the founding population through the selection of many different mother trees hufford and mazer 2003 mckay et al 2005 restoration projects that aim to increase genetic diversity and local adaptation in seedling populations nonetheless face significant challenges when implemented at small geographic scales because small areas comprise small populations because of their relatively low effective population size these populations are at risk of loss of genetic diversity similar to populations negatively affected by habitat loss and fragmentation sezen et al 2007 chazdon 2014 the loss of genetic diversity can be observed as a reduction in heterozygosity and allelic diversity through time the smaller the population the faster the manifestation of the negative effects of drift on genetic diversity is expected mills 2012 the loss of genetic diversity in these populations due to inbreeding depression further increases the risk of local extinction frankham 2005 and consequently restoration failure to address this issue researchers and practitioners have provided different recommendations for the minimum population size necessary to avoid the negative effects of genetic drift and inbreeding depression in the context of restoration in both the short term 5 generations and long term 100 years it has been suggested as a general rule that seeds should be sampled from at least 30 vencovsky 1986 or 50 trees basey et al 2015 to recover sufficient genetic diversity in tree populations with an effective population size ne 100 however there is a lack of studies validating or testing the efficacy and feasibility of these recommendations due to constraints in both ecological limited number of mother trees of low density species in fragmented landscapes and financial terms time and resources spent to find numerous mother trees and collect their seeds brancalion et al 2012 for example in tropical forest restoration efforts where over 100 native tree species have been reintroduced in restoration plantations rodrigues et al 2011 reaching the targeted number of mother trees per species i e 30 50 can be difficult also as the current recommendations for forest restoration is to plant 20 in ha in small restoration areas 5 ha up to two or three seedling from each mother tree would be planted if the general rule is followed improved evaluation of the probability of success of restoration approaches that vary in the number of mother trees used and the effective population size targeted is needed to effectively deploy limited restoration resources in this study we present a novel individual based model to simulate the spatio temporal genetic and population dynamics of trees in restoration plantations in response to different restoration strategies and over long time scales using this model we specifically examine how different levels of initial genetic diversity and population size influence long term restoration success defined as short and mid term population persistence currently there are few programs that simulate the population dynamics of tree species which have long life spans and overlapping generations and that also model spatial and temporal genetic variation also most of these models ignore or inadequately capture genetic factors such as the effect of inbreeding depression on total fitness frankham et al 2014 in our expository treatment of our newly developed model we present a case study application based on restoration of a tropical tree in the atlantic forest of brazil 2 the model the description of our model follows the odd overview design concepts detail protocol of grimm et al 2006 2010 this model was designed to investigate the influence of initial genetic diversity and area size on population persistence initial genetic diversity within a restoration plantation is represented by the minimum number of mother trees from which seeds were collected in addition to initial area size this is one of the parameters over which management agencies have the greatest control when designing and implementing restoration strategies in this context we set out to address the following two specific questions 1 how does are size and initial genetic diversity affect the loss of genetic diversity of restored tree populations and 2 what is the minimum number of mother trees from which seeds should be collected for a restoration forest plantation to ensure sustainable levels of genetic diversity in the restored population 2 1 entities state variables and scales the entities of this model are individual trees each individual is characterized by the following three state variables 1 spatial location 2 age and 3 multi locus genotype spatial location describes the geographic x and y coordinates on a two dimensional lattice tree age varies from zero to a maximum species age and increases by one unit i e year per time step simulations begin with all individuals at three years old as in a recent plantation seeds have age of zero and germinated seedlings have age of one individuals are considered juveniles before they reach reproductive age and adults are reproductive until the end of life with the same reproduction rate fig s1 each genotype is composed of multiple independent multi allelic co dominant loci with no linkage disequilibrium fig s2 alleles are represented by a pair of integer numbers each of which can take a value between one to the maximum number of alleles initially defined the time step in the model is one year the spatial extent of the simulated area consists of a single isolated rectangular forest fragment patch undergoing restoration the area shape always a narrow rectangle was designed to simulate narrow riparian forests where there is no light limitation and that have received special attention over the past 30 years due to their importance to river protection rodrigues et al 2009 these forests patches are typically long and narrow and are intensively affected by edge effects didham and lawton 1999 davies colley et al 2000 and tend to retain the characteristics of early successional systems as they age tabarelli et al 2008 2 2 process overview the model starts by defining initial conditions including age spatial location and genotypes of individual trees in the initial planted population the following model parameters are also specified simulation duration time number of simulation repetitions rep number of loci in the input dataset lattice dimensions xdim ydim pollen dpollen and seed dseed dispersal distances number of seeds produced by each tree avseed maximum age an individual can reach maxage at what age the individual becomes an adult adultage maximum number of pollen donors for each offspring maxfathers germination probability germ selection factor selection and the time steps when output files should be saved output years each cycle starts with the determination of each individual s survival rate as a function of age this model consider hermaphrodite tree species so all individuals can be either mother or father of an offspring and self fertilization is possible the reproduction step starts by defining for each mature tree i e mother which mature trees i e potential fathers are present within the pollen dispersal range if the number of potential mates is fewer than the maxfathers all mates contribute to pollination otherwise a number of potential mates equivalent to maxfathers are randomly selected to be pollen donors by default potential mates as sampled with a uniform probability distribution but other probability distributions may be implemented alleles are inherited following mendelian inheritance seed location is defined by the seed dispersal range and a randomly selected dispersal direction if a seed falls at the same location of an existing adult or out of the study area it does not survive otherwise each seed has the predefined initial probability of germination which can be decreased as a function of its inbreeding coefficient richards 2000 in species that produce a large number of seeds from which only a few germinate and survive to juvenile phase genetic drift tends to have a stronger effect than selection thus selection on germination and survival is not strong enough to purge deleterious alleles efficiently keller and walter 2002 in these situations inbreeding depression can affect seed and seedling viability naito et al 2005 germination success richards 2000 and survival rates ishida 2006 the assumptions for estimating the inbreeding effects on fitness in this model are 1 an increase in inbreeding by 10 leads to a reduction in fitness components of 5 10 frankel and soulé 1981 2 a large number of loci are affected by inbreeding depression ayroles et al 2009 chaves et al 2011 and 3 a sample of loci allows us to infer the inbreeding coefficient of a population chaves et al 2011 when a new seed successfully germinates it is added to the tracking list of active individuals with an age of one probability of survival to the next year for both juveniles and reproductive individuals is assessed in each time step as an increasing function of tree age fig s1 dead individuals are removed from the tracking list and hence the population at the end of the simulation a table summarizing information on the location genotype age and survival probability for all living individuals is produced genotypic output data are converted to the fstat goudet 1995 format and genetic summary statistics are calculated for all individuals with age 1 using the software hierfstat goudet 2005 summary statistics calculated include number of individuals total number of alleles allelic richness observed and expected heterozygosity under hardy weinberg equilibrium hwe and the inbreeding coefficient with confidence interval 2 3 design concepts 2 3 1 basic concepts the basic principles of this model are that the population is isolated from others no migration mutation rates are negligible individuals only mate with others within the pollen dispersal range i e the population is not panmictic and germination probability is influenced by the inbreeding coefficient of each seed mortality in all other life stages is age dependent fig s1 2 3 2 emergence population size is the total number of individuals with minimum age of 1 year old and is a consequence of mating rules see below survival probabilities and the amount of space available this means that population size is an emergent property of the simulation the frequency and number of alleles vary as a result of genetic drift which is random although influenced by the assumptions of dispersal and overall model spatial scale thus allele frequencies and their spatial distribution are an emergent property 2 3 3 stochasticity randomness in the model operates through mating and survival mates are sampled at random from the adults available within the pollen dispersal range other than distance from the mother tree there are no other rules for mating preference seed genotypes are the result of random sampling of the parents genotypes each seed s location is defined in the seed dispersal range from the mother tree according to the rules described in the seed dispersal sub model which includes randomness in dispersal direction death is probabilistic and depends on the age of the individual fig s1 2 4 initialization at the beginning of each simulation the parameters of the initial population planted in the area must be defined the initial population consists of saplings all the same age that may descend from different number of mother trees their genotypes are drawn depending on the number of mother trees from which they descended and may vary from a pool of individuals in hwe to a full sibling pool the saplings can be planted uniformly randomly or aggregated in one or more clusters as defined by the user 2 5 input the input dataset consists of a tab delimited data table comprised of desired initial individual locations x y genotypes and age fig s2 there is no limitation on number of individuals and the size of the restoration area except for those imposed by the memory limitations of each user s computer system 2 6 sub models the model contains four sub models 1 reproduction 2 seed dispersal 3 seed germination and 4 age specific mortality 2 6 1 reproduction this sub model simulates sexual reproduction among individuals in the pollen dispersal distance range the model does not simulate asexual reproduction or gene flow from other non explicitly simulated populations reproduction occurs once per annual time step all adult individuals are considered to be reproductive and all have the same potential for pollen and seed production we assume that there is no pollen limitation pollen donors are randomly sampled from the pool of individuals in the pollen dispersal distance range we assumed mendelian inheritance of alleles as the model s loci represent independent nuclear genetic marker loci i e no linkage selfing was allowed in the simulations as the mother tree is included in the pollen donors 2 6 2 seed dispersal we assumed isotropy no preferential direction for dispersal so the seed location is defined by the dispersal distance function and a random value from one to 2π radians for the direction all seeds produced in a year germinate or die we do not consider soil seed bank formation 2 6 3 seed germination we modelled the probability of seed germination as a function of inbreeding thus in this sub model the probability of germination is estimated using all neutral loci wherein if the inbreeding coefficient fis is greater than zero an increase in inbreeding leads to a reduction of germination rate in the scale defined by the selection factor grate g 1 selection fis where g is the probability of germination with no inbreeding so a selection factor of 0 5 means that an increase in inbreeding by 10 leads to a reduction of 5 in germination rate frankel and soulé 1981 if inbreeding coefficient is zero or negative it has no effect on germination rate 2 6 4 survival the probability of mortality increased as a function of age table 1 up until the maximum age for that species at which point all individuals die to determine whether an individual dies at each time step a random number is sampled from a uniform distribution between zero and one if the number is larger than the survival probability srate associated with the individual s age then the individual dies 2 7 model development we wrote the program script in the scientific computing language r r core team 2015 general model schematic is described in fig 1 and the program script can be found in supplementary material and also at github https github com sujiips restoration pva git 2 8 sensitivity analysis sensitivity analyses were performed to quantify the relative importance of each model process on simulation results and to assess how uncertainty in parameter values affects simulation dynamics all simulations for sensitivity analysis used a restoration area of five hectares with a presumed seed source of a large population and using reference parameter values from centrolobium tomentosum fabaceae a tree species from an intermediate stage of ecological succession from a tropical forest each simulation was run for 500 time steps and each scenario for a unique set of parameters was replicated 250 times this number of replicates was found to capture sufficient variation in system dynamics i e cv 0 05 fig s3 we performed a local sensitivity analysis railsback and grimm 2011 which involved varying parameter values one at a time parameter values were varied between 5 and 5 railsback and grimm 2011 except for some parameters e g adult age and maximum pollen dispersal distance for which a 5 variation was too small to produce noticeable response in these situations a higher percentage of variation was selected table 2 3 model application we demonstrate application of our model using a simulated restoration experiment using c tomentosum fabaceae in the tropical atlantic forest of brazil this species was selected because it is widely used in restoration projects in brazil and because demographic and genetic data are readily available c tomentosum is frequently used for forest restoration because it is a common gap colonizing species reproduces once a year grows quickly produce high quality timber and has symbiotic associations with nitrogen fixation microorganisms which facilitate its rapid colonization carvalho 2005 pagano 2008 this species has a wide distribution over the atlantic forest and some parts of cerrado two of the most threatened global hotspots for biodiversity conservation we investigated the consequences of varying three experimental factors on genetic diversity and short and mid terms population viability in forest patches that have undergone restoration planting these factors were 1 initial population size 2 size of the restoration area and 3 initial genetic composition number of alleles and genotypic frequencies initial genetic composition was determined by the number of mother trees from which seeds were collected we estimated mean number of alleles effective number of alleles allelic richness inbreeding coefficient and probability of extinction to evaluate the effects of the experimental factors on each population for the purposes of this experiment simulated forest patches represent riparian areas long and narrow with a fixed 30 m width as are many restoration plantations rodrigues et al 2009 simulations were run over 500 years and output files were saved at 30 50 100 250 and 500 years we simulated patch areas of 5 ha 10 ha and 20 ha initial population size varied with patch area because the current recommendations for forest restoration is to plant 20 in ha the tree spatial distribution in the forest patch the mean number of alleles per locus the inbreeding coefficient and the seed dispersal pattern used to produce the initial population were based on data obtained from real populations in well established 27 and 57 years old restoration plantations sujii 2015 sujii et al 2017 to produce the input datasets we first created a simulated a large initial population n 1000 with all loci in hardy weinberg equilibrium hwe and the same number of loci and alleles per locus that would be used in the simulations 10 loci 5 alleles per locus initial populations were composed of seedlings all of the same age as in a restoration plantation seedlings in the input dataset were the result of simulated reproduction events between seed sources and pollen donors from the original population therefore the input dataset represents a sample of seeds collected from a large population as is typically the case in applied restoration projects the genetic composition of each initial population was determined by the number of seed sources and pollen donors in some initial populations seedlings were all the result of self fertilization as the offspring of one isolated tree in other initial populations different number of seed sources and pollen donors contributed with alleles for the offspring seed sources 1 5 10 or 30 individuals pollen donors 5 10 or 20 in ividuals initial populations created with larger number of seed sources and pollen donors had higher initial genetic diversity for simulations with saplings from one mother tree and five pollen donors we sampled one individual from the original population to be the mother and five individuals to be the pollen donors this mother was the source of the first allele of each locus of each sapling used in the plantation the second allele of each locus was randomly sampled from the five pollen donors for the simulations with saplings from more than one mother tree we applied the same procedure as for one mother but using additional sampled individuals as mothers the assumed maximum tree age is 89 years based on mean growth rate functions for both canopy and emergent trees laurance et al 2004 growth rates for c tomentosum was estimated using diameter measures of trees from nine restoration areas with different known ages 6 96 years silva 2013 the probability of surviving to the next time step was estimated using a demographic study of adult individuals from a natural remnant forest fragment barreto 2009 silva 2013 and follows a weibull distribution as there were no available data for seedlings and sapling survival rates a linear function was used such that for each year of increase in age between one and six survival rate increases by 0 2 after the age of six we use empirical data on survival barreto 2009 silva 2013 fig s1 as c tomentosum is a hermaphrodite species and all individuals can be either mother or father of an offspring self fertilization is also possible the main pollinators are large bees with long distance flight capacity the maximum distance of pollen flow 1000 m was based on information on flight patterns and mean maximum flight distances of large bees which are the main pollinators of c tomentosum pasquet et al 2008 hagen et al 2011 the pollen donors are randomly sampled from the pool of individuals in the pollen dispersal distance range following the pollinators foraging behaviour keasar et al 1996 the species has a mixed mating system and the maximum number of pollen donors for each mother tree was selected to be 20 trees c tomentosum has one or two seeds enclosed in a large 9 g each thorny samara winged fruit that does not remain in permanent seed banks and are dispersed by wind for short distances at most 100 m away from the mother tree following a weibull distribution so most seeds fall under the canopy of the mother tree cavalho 2005 aidar and joly 2003 sujii 2015 the germination probability is 0 7 carvalho 2005 a summary of all parameter values can be found in table 1 4 results 4 1 sensitivity analysis we found that our model is not overly sensitive to any of the parameters tested given the range of values we examined table 2 each parameter had different effects on the mean number of alleles a the inbreeding coefficient fis and the proportion of extinct populations the parameters with the strongest effect were maximum age that a tree can reach germination rate selection pressure value and average number of seeds produced by each tree on the number of alleles table 2 4 2 model application complete output files from the simulated restoration experiment are available at github https github com sujiips restoration pva both initial population size and initial genetic composition affected population viability and long term maintenance of genetic diversity table 3 as expected larger populations resulted in smaller effects of genetic drift measured here as loss of total number of alleles fig 2 a in populations from small areas all simulated scenarios lead to allele loss and an increase in inbreeding coefficient regarding genetic diversity if planted saplings were produced from seeds of a single isolated tree initial genetic diversity was already low and the number of alleles tended to one in all simulation conditions fig 2 an increase either in the number of mother trees or pollen donors resulted in greater initial genetic diversity and reduced the rate allele loss especially in larger initial populations 200 and 400 individuals results of simulations with five or more mother trees were similar in mid term in the short term 250 years initial populations generated with seeds from five mother trees had a relatively reduced number of alleles there was no difference in allelic diversity effective number of alleles and allelic richness between 10 and 20 pollen donors fig 2 fig s4 initial genetic composition had a strong effect on the inbreeding coefficient in populations from the small areas sampling seeds from only one isolated tree resulted in a larger increase in inbreeding and in stronger bottleneck effects than sampling seeds that were result of outcrossing fig 2 selection against overall homozygosity at the germination phase kept the inbreeding coefficient small or moderate even with fixation of alleles at some loci fig 2 the probability of extinction was greater in populations from smaller areas also populations founded by seeds from only one isolated mother tree had higher proportion of extinct populations populations initiated with seeds from 30 seed sources also had high proportion of extinct populations although the mean number of alleles and the mean fis were similar to simulations with five and 10 seed sources fig 2 5 discussion 5 1 model development the model we present is a tool for understanding the effects of initial genetic diversity and population size on the long term viability of tree populations in forest restoration projects it can be applied in studies of tree species with different characteristics from tropical and temperate forests this model is particularly useful when rare and threatened species are reintroduced in restoration sites to support their conservation which relies on the potential of reintroduced populations to persist overtime duquesnel et al 2017 restoration practitioners can associate their current knowledge and new field data with the results from simulations of varied scenarios which may comprise species with different characteristics and a more comprehensive range of area sizes in order to guide planning and implementation of new restoration areas the use of spatially explicit stochastic space time simulations has many advantages over spatial mathematical models including the capacity to include biological complexity such as stochasticity individual level variation adaptive traits as well as spatial processes e g dispersal that are difficult to reliably model using purely mathematical approaches epperson et al 2010 individual based models are particularly useful for planning reintroduction and conservation of endangered species in restoration areas covington et al 2001 bruford et al 2010 especially if restoration and conservation practitioners and modellers work together wood et al 2015 habitat loss and population disruption by fragmentation are two of the main causes of species extinction fahrig 1997 forest restoration is a relevant complement to species conservation plans because it enables the increase in forest area and the reintroduction of endangered species nevertheless endangered species are usually found in small population sizes and in low densities which hampers seed sampling both for ex situ and in situ conservation the model we have presented is a valuable tool for decision making as it can be used to help design seed sampling strategies for effective and genetically informed restoration efforts it is important to note that for many tree species some of the parameters required by our model are not readily available one of the unfortunate paradoxes of working with endangered and hence rare species nonetheless data on threatened species autoecology and population structure are becoming increasingly available kattge et al 2011 sousa baena et al 2014 canhos et al 2014 de lima et al 2015 information can also be extrapolated from species with similar ecological and demographic characteristics and simulations covering the uncertainty range of the parameter can be performed this model accounts for overlapping generations and effects of inbreeding depression which are present in many tree species angeloni et al 2011 the effects of inbreeding depression were summarized in this model in the germination process that is when the negative effects of inbreeding are strong and were more carefully measured ishida 2006 naito et al 2005 chaves et al 2011 although there is evidence that inbreeding may reduce survival and reproduction in different life stages hufford and hamrick 2003 naito et al 2005 there is a lack of studies testing the magnitude of the effect on later life stages further investigation into the effects of inbreeding depression on different life stages is required this model was designed for simulations of populations in the short and mid term tens of generations because it does not account for mutation and for changes in selective pressures over time it focuses on only one isolated population but it is possible to evaluate effects of inter population gene flow when a migration parameter is included these limitations may be overcome using the results obtained from our model as input or assumptions for other simulation programs that account for mutation migration and natural selection in changing environments 5 2 model application restoration projects must consider both the spatial attributes of the restoration area and the initial effective population size to reduce the risk of genetic bottlenecks and to increase the probability of long term population persistence allendorf et al 2013 in general smaller restoration areas contain smaller populations thus in long narrow riparian restoration areas such as those targeted for c tomentosum high initial genetic composition i e diversity of the seed pool is necessary to maintain such diversity and assure long term population viability the results from our case study indicate that increasing the number of seed sources from one to five can be enough to reduce the bottleneck effect and sampling seeds from trees that can receive pollen from at least five other trees avoids the fixation of alleles in the medium term given our results for c tomentosum and species with similar reproductive characteristics we recommend for forest managers to avoid sampling seeds from isolated trees and to use more than five trees from large well preserved populations as seed sources in all sizes of restoration area planting seeds from only one isolated tree results in a very strong bottleneck effect higher extinction rate and genetic diversity loss increasing either the number of mother trees or the number of pollen donors increase the initial levels of genetic diversity which is beneficial for slowing down the loss of alleles over time higher initial genetic diversity also resulted in lower levels of inbreeding in a mid term we found that restoration projects using c tomentosum or using other species with similar life history traits should use seeds taken from at least ten mother trees to ensure successful restoration beyond this number e g up to 30 we did not identify any additional long term benefits in terms of the maintenance of genetic diversity and reduction in inbreeding the higher proportion of extinct populations observed in simulations with seeds from 30 mother trees may be a result of the random sample of a few seeds from each tree more simulations with defined seed sampling designs are required to explain this result our finding of a minimum of 10 trees is lower than current recommendations in the literature where greater than 30 trees are recommended vencovsky 1986 basey et al 2015 the recommendation for 30 trees aims to conserve a minimum effective population size of 100 which was not addressed in our study instead we focused on how the different levels of initial genetic diversity influenced long term maintenance of genetic diversity in restoration populations without explicit consideration of effective population size we show that under situations where conservation resources are limited and management objectives involve identifying suitable trade offs between population viability and minimizing costs seeds taken from ten trees will be sufficient this is a preliminary study with only one species and a limited number of simulated scenarios to exemplify one application of the model the overall pattern observed here should not be used isolated to support forest restoration and management actions more extensive studies however may help to improve the use of the proposed model in ecological restoration programs in addition as all simulated areas showed reduction in genetic diversity and increase in inbreeding coefficient estimates to ensure long term sustainability restoration programs should emphasize connectivity among newly restored patches and existing forest patches rudnick et al 2012 fao 2015 connectivity among forest fragments is essential to gene flow among remnant and other restoration areas increase metapopulation size and reduce the negative effects of small population sizes observed in our simulations frankham 2015 although we did not explicitly examine this question in this study future work in this area should examine the interactions between initial genetic diversity and spatial connectivity in fragmented landscape at different spatial scales and over varying conservation planning horizons 6 final remarks simulation approaches have been used previously in forest restoration to assess the impact of ecophysiological parameters on species resilience of forest stands pietsch and hasenauer 2002 to understand the influence of management on forest structure over time covington et al 2001 and to predict habitat quality in restoration plantations pausas et al 1997 simulations are a useful tool for evaluating restoration success when empirical manipulation of the system is either too costly or limited by the rarity and conservation status of the taxa being examined nonetheless integration of simulation and empirical studies will further serve to inform decision making processes and ultimately improve the probability of success and long term persistence of restoration efforts to our knowledge this is the first model to simulate restored population persistence using a combined population biology and population genetics approach as a novel approach it will require further adaptations and development to address other specific restoration projects this model and the approach on which it is based have great potential to support seed collection to guide restoration implementation and to increase the probability of long term persistence of restoration plantations author s contributions pss pmaj miz and phsb worked on the study conception and

25057,large scale urbanization and industrial development has resulted in serious environmental challenges for china both energy and water are considered key to urban sustainability and for that matter resource accounting and tracing are drawing growing attention in the economy this paper focuses on energy water nexus of urban sectors in shanghai referred to year 2010 using multi regional input output mrio analysis this study outcome revealed that overall shanghai is a net consumer city mainly imports embodied energy and water from domestic and developing regions of the world and exports little to developed regions in depth analysis indicated that except s17 s7 s10 s15 and s8 all other industrial sectors were net inflows of energy in shanghai similarly except s15 all other industrial sectors were net water consumers in shanghai the s16 18 96 mtce s20 11 06 mtce and s12 7 71 mtce were ranked highest as net importer making up about 60 48 of total net inflows of embodied energy whereas s1 18053 48 mt s3 6865 16 mt and s19 2320 62 mt were ranked highest as net importer making up about 74 99 of total net inflows of embodied water the developed nexus strength indicator uncovered the sectoral energy water linkages from a production perspective the s15 exhibited high nexus strength level up to 1 with 50 contribution by each resource to the nexus while from a consumption perspective the s1 revealed high nexus strength level and water was the most frequent resource node contributing about 84 to the energy water nexus the energy water nexus characteristics of industrial sectors can offer different ways to tackle environmental challenges this study can provide a reference to policy makers in identifying key sectors that requires more focus in terms of easing environmental stress to achieve sustainability in urban development in addition called for coordination and regulating urban industrial trade structure in the future keywords mrio urban sectors energy water nexus consumption sustainability 1 introduction cities are centers of trade productivity consumption and development ribeiro et al 2018 over the last few decades cities in particular are getting more populated than ever and about 54 of global population inhabited urban areas since 2014 de amorim et al 2018 cities have occupied less than 5 percent of the earth s land surface yet consume nearly 80 percent of the resources carreon and worrel 2018 furthermore cities are responsible for more than 60 percent of global energy use and 75 percent of pollutant emissions iea 2012 seto et al 2014 as one of world s leading economies china is experiencing rapid urban expansion and this transition is raising concerns about environmental sustainability in backdrop of relentless increasing demand for water and energy since both resources are key indicators of urban sustainability yang et al 2018 the range and complexity of interdependencies between these two natural resource categories including synergies and trade offs are very high in urban areas integrated resources management strategy for water and energy existed at a local level however policies which largely centered on single element fail to properly address the complex urban energy water nexus issue accordingly resources must be managed in a more sustainable and extensive way as a single target policy for energy or water might affect the other through the resource s supply chain and regional trading actions fang and chen 2018 the nexus concept was formulated in response to such siloed thinking and emphasizes the examination of critical interlinkages across resources particularly synergies and trade offs in a more integrated manner bleischwitz et al 2018 the emergence of resource nexus in recent times articulated the notion that the production and consumption of energy water and other ecosystem resources are all intricately related bijl et al 2018 this inter relation appeared to be greatly significant to city planning and management jensen and wu 2018 among ecological elements nexus has been broadly investigated within a single economic sector it cannot be overlooked that the resources flow depends on trade between sectors also it is essential to consider energy water nexus problem in a broader system instead of a single economic sector a number of studies have extended the study scope from a single economic sector to entire city scale involving numerous sectors chen and chen 2016 fang and chen 2017 wang et al 2017 examined the balance between energy and water consumption in beijing economic sectors and establish the main sectors related energy water inflow and outflow fang and chen 2017 analyzed the energy water nexus and exposed the embodied energy and water flows between major urban sectors chen and chen 2016 built a system based framework and investigated embodied energy use related to water consumption and embodied water use related to energy consumption in the urban economic sectors and results showed variable resource consumption patterns among sectors in addition the energy water nexus has been investigated on a regional scale for example duan and chen 2017 investigated energy water nexus embodied in international energy trade of china the nexus debate has been quite intense over recent years however conceptual clarity often is missing recent studies illustrate that a comprehensive exploration of urban economic structure from a nexus perspective is still limited global energy and water scarcity as well as environmental deterioration are triggering research on resource flows in trade in the past virtual or embodied resource transfers has been largely underestimated but lately research has been conducted to explore energy and water flows within urban economic system from a comprehensive perspective yang et al 2018 a top down approach by employing input output analysis is considered a useful tool to simulate resource flows in fact it can evaluate both direct and indirect flows to account the amount required for producing goods and services in a region wang and chen 2016 wang et al 2019 in addition the multi scale input output model derived from multi regional input output table can present a more in depth examination capturing mutual dependencies of the world economic system while maintaining regional differences wiedmann 2009 bachmann et al 2015 it has been formulated and frequently applied at large scales to focus on modern day problems such as water footprints daniels et al 2011 and consumption based air emissions liu et al 2016 meng et al 2018 the chinese municipalities beijing tianjin shanghai and chongqing are experiencing unprecedented environmental pressures due to the excessive resources consumption and pollutant emissions meng et al 2018 as a special case shanghai functions as a main chinese financial trade and shipping center consuming huge amount of resources mainly imported from other regions due to its mature urbanization in year 2014 city electricity production was about 792 3 twh whereas domestic electricity use stretched up to 1369 03 twh a huge amount of crude oil 22 42 million tons and natural gas 72 43 billion cbm was consumed accounting for 99 7 percent and 97 1 percent of imported fuel respectively the per capita water consumption touched about 437 58 m3 2014 which somehow exposed the city consumption behavior zhang et al 2018 thus due to increasing energy water trade links and distinct development pattern of shanghai underlying economic structure needs to be studied more deeply and targeted analysis is essential in turn it may enable a city to make global difference towards reducing resource use and maximize positive economic effect to fill this important research gap this study proposed an urban energy water nexus framework based on environmentally extended multi scale input output ee msio model for shanghai referred to year 2010 using a

collection for this study section 3 present results analysis section 4 provides discussion finally conclusion of the study is presented in section 5 2 method 2 1 nexus framework and ee msio model an urban energy water nexus framework is proposed for modeling the intricate flows of energy and water embodied in goods and services in a multi scale economy the ee msio model derived from mrio table shows flows of energy and water for urban industrial sectors in the local domestic and international regions mainly it links multi regional input output table mriot of china 2010 to world input output table wiot based on world input output database wiod the mriot of chinese regions compiled by liu et al 2016 has been widely applied in several researches feng et al 2013 liu et al 2016 meng et al 2018 the main linking method was earlier presented in more detail by peters et al 2011 in the ee msio model the world is divided into 8 domestic regions in china including shanghai and 6 international regions including the row region in addition 20 aggregated sectors for each region were included in the ee msio model dietzenbacher et al 2013 timmer et al 2015 the intermediate and final flows between provinces in mainland china and regions in the rest of the world were estimated by splitting provincial total sectoral trade volume with a matrix generated from the trade relationship between china as a whole and other regions in the world mrio table for regions see table 1 thus the intermediate flow from sector i in chinese province p to sector j in world region s is given by 1 t i j p s t i j c s s j t i j c s s j t i j p s where t i j c s taken from the world mrio table describes the economic flow from sector i in mainland china to sector j of region s the sectoral flow of final consumption is estimated with the same principle the production based and consumption based energy and water flows impacts of trade can be assessed by the trade relationship in the ee msio model the calculation equations can be referred to hu et al 2016 liang et al 2017 meng et al 2017 2018 the fundamental input output balance principle can be presented as 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 x m a 11 a 12 a 13 a 1 m a

a 1 y 4 w r w i a 1 y where e and w represent the embodied energy and water matrix induced by the final demand of the whole economic system respectively re and rw are the diagonal matrix representing the pressure coefficient of energy consumption and water consumption respectively the diagonal elements are direct water consumption coefficient rwi and direct energy consumption coefficient rci i a 1 is the leontief inverse matrix y is a diagonal matrix while the diagonal element yj represents the final demands of products and services in sector j for the industrial balance analysis the formula can be calculated as follows 5 n e t w i w i m i w e x i 6 n e t e i e i m i e e x i where the net represents the net energy and water consumption embodied in trade for each sector e i m i and w i m i refer to the energy and water consumption embodied in import in sector i respectively e e x i and w e x i refer to the energy and water consumption embodied in export in sector i 2 2 energy water nexus indicator the nexus lacks a clear and universal definition and some question whether it s just a buzz word endo et al 2017 however the concept has gained great attention in the scientific community allan et al 2015 dai 2018 the emergence of the nexus idea is just an indication of transition of scientific thought and policies towards new integrative thinking to address future uncertainties and promote sustainable resource consumption zhang et al 2018 here the nexus strength of trading regions and industrial sectors of shanghai city were evaluated in the domestic and international trade to show environmental stress externalized in urban economic development the nexus strength indicator is developed according to flows of energy and water considered in ee msio model referring to the ecological footprint concept rees 1992 the nexus strength indicator presents a unified accounting of multiple ecological resources usage i e energy and water measuring nexus strength requires standardization for embodied energy and water flows current flow maximum flow and weighting scheme for both resources in this particular work equal weights 1 2 each to energy and water has been assigned indicating that energy and water of each trading region has the same significance the nexus strength is based on a metric range from 0 no use of resources to 1 maximum use for all resources by ranking procedure we can determine which industrial sector has the highest nexus strength mathematically the summation of nexus strength for each sector region can be formulated below 7 n e x u s s t r e n g t h p w d w i p e d e i w i t h i i i 1 n d w i g w i g w g w max g w i i i d e i g e i g e g e max g e i i i r n p n 1 r w e where w e stands for water and energy respectively i stand for each industrial sector i represents the set of all industrial sectors taking water as an example gw i represents the water consumption of sector i gw represents the largest industrial water consumption among all sectors dw i represents the deviation between the industrial largest water consumption and water consumption of sector i p is a weight for resource pw represents the weight of water resource in this study energy and water are considered equally important p is 0 5 2 3 data source in this study energy consumption only includes the one used for production purposes while fossil fuel is only considered in our research all the energy data are unified as ton standard coal equivalent tce energy used by the energy processing and conversion are accounted for in electricity production sector while the electricity and heating consumption in the final consumption sectors are not accounted for to avoid double counting for china the environment satellite accounts including the energy and water are not officially published annually for the 30 regions we therefore estimated the energy consumption of each region based on the provincial energy balance table and energy statistical yearbook in china 2011 research year 2010 for water consumption green water and blue water are accounted for while grey water is not included in china water usage by industrial sectors is reported in the first national pollution source census of china the most complete and available dataset conducted by the ministry of environmental protection and national bureau of statistics for the international regions the energy and water consumption data can be obtained from wiod environmental account 3 results based on the ee msio model energy and water flows in shanghai city were traced on production based and consumption based perspectives the production perspective exhibited when and where resource flow occurred whereas the consumption pattern exhibited why and how resource flow took place in this study shanghai industrial structure analysis revealed different characteristics but in general the city is being explored as net consumer of embodied energy and water for sectors detail see table 2 3 1 sectoral energy analysis 3 1 1 regional spatial distribution for key sectoral flows table 3 shows main industrial structure of production based energy flow for instance in s15 sectoral production based spb energy consumed 37 81 of the urban production based upb energy out of that 53 92 of spb energy was used for local production based lpb 46 08 of spb was used for exports 22 32 for domestic production based dpb exports and 23 76 for international production based ipb for embodied energy in exports the domestic region receives 48 43 of energy and out of that 28 01 focused in central north northwest whereas international region receives 51 57 of energy and out of that 35 19 focused in nafta row and european countries table 4 shows main industrial structure of consumption based energy flow for instance in s15 sectoral consumption based scb energy consumed 18 30 of the urban consumption based ucb energy out of that 50 53 of scb energy was used from local consumption based lcb 49 47 of scb was used from imports 46 34 for domestic consumption based dcb imports and 3 13 for international consumption based icb for embodied energy in imports domestic regions supplied 93 68 of energy and out of that 82 6 focused in central central coast and north whereas international regions supplied 6 32 of energy only and out of that 5 32 focused in row east asia and briiat rest of the industrial sectors and spatial distribution of energy flow can be seen in figs 1 and 2 on the basis of specific industrial flow features production based conclusion can be drawn that s15 and s17 were the leading direct energy consumers occupying more than half of total direct energy flow in shanghai around 53 92 of direct energy flow was driven by local electricity demands while 72 86 of direct energy flow in s17 was driven by domestic 47 27 and international 25 59 exports the main sectoral flows can define shanghai s energy flow characteristics specifically that at local level 38 28 of energy flow was consumed whereas domestic export and international export used up 32 32 and 29 40 of flow respectively the central north and central coast were key domestic exporting regions and north america europe and row were key international exporting regions on the basis of specific industrial flow features consumption based conclusion can be drawn that s16 s15 and s20 were the main direct energy consumers accounting for 54 32 of the total direct energy flow in shanghai about 36 46 of embodied energy flow of s16 s15 and s20 were driven by local demands the domestic imports drove 57 40 46 34 and 49 75 of sectoral energy of s16 s15 and s20 respectively the results showed that for industrial sectors key domestic importing regions were central north and central coast and key international importing regions were row east asia and briiat the consumption based sectoral flows facilitated to show shanghai distinctive energy flow behavior the main driver found was domestic and international trade structure as about 72 energy transfers took place beyond city s administrative boundary 3 1 2 local intersectoral analysis through local intersectoral and regional spatial distribution analysis interconnections and drivers of urban energy flows are identified energy flows of key industrial sectors can help to explain characteristic of urban flow in the whole perspective as regards to local sectoral analysis both production and consumption perspectives were used to expose the underlying industrial structure and analyzed intersectoral flows fig 3 shows that top sectors such as s15 s17 and s7 used up 53 26 14 49 and 8 30 of production based energy flows respectively making their total share of about 76 06 out of that involving destination of energy flows in downstream supply chain s15 itself induced around 59 48 of energy flows similarly s17 itself induced around 54 60 of energy flows while 23 16 of energy flows of s7 were transferred to s16 then s15 s16 and s20 used up 33 10 21 75 and 16 06 of consumption based energy flows respectively making their total share of about 70 91 out of that involving source of energy flows in upstream supply chain s15 itself derived around 95 71 of energy flows 34 84 of energy flows of s16 were transferred to s15 and s20 transferred 40 21 of energy flows to s15 3 2 sectoral water analysis 3 2 1 regional spatial distribution for key sectoral flows table 5 shows main industrial structure of production based water flow for instance in s1 sectoral production based spb water used 23 18 of the urban production based upb water out of that 48 09 of spb water was utilized for local production based lpb 51 91 of spb was used for exports 27 76 for domestic production based dpb exports and 24 15 for international production based ipb for water embodied in exports domestic region received 53 48 of water and out of that 31 30 focused in north central and central coast whereas international regions received 46 52 of water and out of that 30 19 focused in nafta row and europe table 6 shows main industrial structure of consumption based water flow for instance in s1 sectoral consumption based scb water used 45 10 of the urban consumption based ucb water out of that 3 95 of scb water was utilized from local consumption based lcb 96 05 of scb was used from imports 91 23 for domestic consumption based dcb imports and 4 82 for international consumption based icb for embodied water in imports domestic regions supplied 94 98 of water and out of that 73 26 focused in north central northwest whereas international regions supplied 5 02 of water and out of that 4 93 focused in row briiat and nafta rest of the industrial sectors and spatial distribution of water flow can be seen in figs 4 and 5 on the basis of specific industrial flow features production based conclusion can be drawn that s15 and s1 were the leading water consumers making up about 85 81 of total direct water flow in shanghai around 53 79 of direct water flow was driven by local electricity demands while 51 91 of direct water flow in s1 was driven by domestic 27 76 and international 24 15 exports as whole the main sectoral flows can define shanghai s water flow characteristic specifically that at local level 52 66 of water flow was consumed whereas domestic and international exports used up 23 38 and 23 96 of flow respectively the central north and central coast were key domestic exporting regions and north america europe and row were key international exporting regions on the basis of specific industrial flow features consumption based conclusion can be drawn that s1 s3 and s16 were the main water consumers accounting for 68 15 of the total direct water flow in shanghai around 6 78 of embodied water flow of s1 s3 and s16 was driven by local demands the domestic imports drove 91 23 68 43 and 39 85 of the sectoral water of s1 s3 and s16 respectively the results showed that for industrial sectors key domestic importing regions were central north and northwest and key international importing regions were row briiat and nafta the central north and northwest were the top domestic imported regions for embodied water for the industrial sectors the row briiat and nafta were the main international embodied imported sources the consumption based sectoral flows facilitated to show shanghai distinctive water flow behavior the main driver found was domestic and international trade structure as about 87 38 water transfers took place beyond city s administrative boundary 3 2 2 local intersectoral analysis through local intersectoral and regional spatial distribution analysis the interconnections and drivers of urban water flows are identified water flows of key industrial sectors can help to explain characteristic of urban flow in the whole perspective as regards to local sectoral analysis both production and consumption perspectives were used to expose the underlying industrial structure and analyzed intersectoral flows fig 6 shows that top sectors such as s15 s1 and s16 used up 63 96 21 17 and 11 48 of production based water flows respectively making a total share of about 96 62 out of that involving destination of water flows in downstream supply chain s15 itself induced 59 26 of water flows similarly s1 itself induced around 65 21 of water flows while s16 also itself induced around 93 42 of water flows then s15 s16 and s1 used up 38 12 21 80 and 14 13 of consumption based water flows respectively making a total share of about 74 05 out of that involving source of water flows in upstream supply chain s15 itself derived around 99 44 of water flows similarly s16 itself derived about 49 20 of water flows and s1 also itself derived about 97 70 of water flows 3 3 sectoral balance analysis 3 3 1 energy balance as can be seen in fig 7 except s17 s7 s10 s15 and s8 all other sectors were net energy consumer for shanghai and from a global perspective presented shanghai a net energy importer the results demonstrated that 60 48 of total net inflows of embodied energy 62 41 mtce were focused on the s16 18 96 mtce s20 11 06 mtce and s12 7 71 mtce in particular calculating net energy inflow in s16 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 80 49 and 19 51 respectively in s20 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 73 81 and 26 19 respectively in case of s12 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 72 91 and 27 09 respectively the data clearly showed that up to 70 of energy flows were transmitted to inland areas of china via imports fig 7 shows that s17 s7 s10 s15 and s8 were net outflows of energy in shanghai with share of about 35 71 22 70 16 87 16 15 and 8 57 respectively total net outflow of embodied energy of 28 47 mtce in calculating net energy outflow in s17 the relative proportion for domestic and international net outflow was 65 97 and 34 03 respectively in s7 the relative proportion for domestic and international net outflow was 51 66 and 48 34 respectively in s10 the relative proportion of domestic and international net outflow was 19 02 and 80 98 respectively in s8 the relative proportion of domestic and international net outflow was 12 09 and 87 91 respectively similarly s15 also show a total net outflow of embodied energy 3 3 2 water balance as can be seen in fig 8 except s15 all other sectors were net water consumer for shanghai and from a global perspective presented shanghai a net water importer the results demonstrated that 74 99 of total net inflows of embodied water 36322 50 mt were focused on the s1 s3 and s19 in particular calculating net water inflow in s1 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 97 94 and 2 06 respectively in s3 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 68 79 and 31 21 respectively in s19 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 73 63 and 26 37 respectively the data clearly showed that up to 65 of water flows were transmitted to inland areas of china via imports the s15 was the only sector responsible for net outflow of embodied water 2368 91 mt in shanghai in calculating net water outflow in s15 the relative proportion for domestic and international net outflow was 37 56 and 62 44 respectively 3 4 sectoral energy water nexus analysis this segment describes the results of the urban energy water nexus in the context of this study the nexus strength indicator is constructed according to the flow analysis and structure analysis based on ee msio model both energy and water received the same weight and considered equally important the nexus strength is related merely to energy and water use relative to shanghai and reflects the consumption extent of energy and water simultaneously the nexus strength for a particular industrial sector or region is considered high when the combine usage of energy and water is high detailed analysis for urban industrial sectors nexus can be seen below as apparent in fig 9 from a production perspective associated with each industry s production activity the s15 has high nexus strength level up to 1 with 50 contribution by each resource to the nexus some important sectors were driven by unequal energy and water use and as a result the contribution of single resource use was greater to the energy water nexus i e for s17 energy was key resource node contributing nearly 99 while for s1 about 96 water contributed to the energy water nexus however for sector s1 and s17 the nexus strength was not as high as s15 the nexus strength results for the urban industrial sectors from a consumption perspective caused by the final demand for each industry can be seen in fig 10 large differences can be identified among sectors if compared to the production perspective the consumption based nexus is determined by inter industry dependencies rather than direct requirements among all sectors the s1 showed high nexus strength level followed by s16 and s15 for s1 water was the most frequent resource node contributing about 84 to the energy water nexus in the case of s16 and s15 energy contributed about 85 and 86 respectively towards the nexus considering the fact that within shanghai substantial inter sectoral variations exist nexus strength values are relatively consistent uncovering the main industrial sectors and displaying intensive energy water destinations in urban economic system 4 discussion due to rapid industrial growth and urban transformation for the last three decades the sustainable cities concept has become dominant in planning and managing urban areas around the globe marcotullio 2001 juraschek et al 2018 the current work showed that shanghai a major chinese international metropolis is a net consumer city mainly importing embodied energy and water from domestic and developing regions of the world and exporting little to developed regions for the majority of studied sectors the main driving force for resource consumption were s16 s20 and s12 as embodied energy consumers while s1 s3 and s19 were the highest embodied water consumers these urban industrial sectors largely avoided indigenous resource utilization and shifted energy water stress associated with its consumption to other regions and abroad as a result the energy and water supply in shanghai may be exposed to changes in resource conditions in other areas there is lot of room for improvement of resource conservation and lowering sectoral energy water pressure every industrial sector should be focused with specific conservation strategy and thus different conservation measures needs to be designed for target sectors the industrial sectors responsible for high energy and water consumption increasing resource use efficiency would be a better way to decrease energy and water consumption for example in agriculture sector water saving measures such as irrigation scheduling drip irrigation and cover crops etc should be implemented construction sector should also make endeavor to identify the opportunities of energy saving through technological management and policy approaches by adjusting industrial structure trade pattern and development priorities shanghai could contribute to global resource saving to help easing resources scarcity these days energy water linkages have become recognizable as application of the nexus approach to identify tradeoffs search for cross sector efficiencies and deal with challenges not only within urban system but across global supply chains radcliffe 2018 schlor et al 2018 with different perspectives industrial sectors don t share the same nexus characteristics the s15 exhibited high nexus strength level with production based perspective whereas the s1 revealed high nexus strength level due to large amount of final demands in most of the urban industrial sectors contribution of energy and water use towards nexus was not the equal and because of these structural and development differences resource nexus is not the same among industrial sectors and regions the study results show that from a sector perspective shanghai is facing several energy and water challenges for policy makers the analysis of consumption indexes may offer useful hints revealing that sectors such as s16 s20 and s12 for energy and s1 s3 and s19 for water need to be focused preferentially such work opens the door to more comprehensive resource management practices 5 concluding remarks the present study investigates urban sectoral energy water nexus in shanghai for the year 2010 a nexus strength indicator was developed according to resource flows based on ee msio model findings revealed shanghai is a net consumer city mainly importing embodied energy and water from domestic regions and abroad in depth sectoral analysis showed that s16 s20 and s12were the top three embodied energy consumers while s1 s3 and s19 were the top three embodied water consumers the city global embodied energy and water transfer created a new degree of connectedness amid economies thus resource allocation adjustment and fine tuning of existing industrial sectors are significant to enhance resource utilization efficiency and lower energy water pressure from a production perspective s15 has high nexus strength indicating large resource usage whereas from a consumption perspective s1 has high nexus strength revealing large energy and water consumption the study provides an understanding that intensive resource use in urban industrial sectors results in low efficiency and seriously affects resource security due to differences in industrial structure industrial development priorities technology and policy the resource nexus matters are not the same among sectors and regions this work offers new ways for other mega cities around the globe in coping environmental stress during sustainable urban development acknowledgements this work is supported by projects of sino america international cooperation of national natural science foundation no

25057,large scale urbanization and industrial development has resulted in serious environmental challenges for china both energy and water are considered key to urban sustainability and for that matter resource accounting and tracing are drawing growing attention in the economy this paper focuses on energy water nexus of urban sectors in shanghai referred to year 2010 using multi regional input output mrio analysis this study outcome revealed that overall shanghai is a net consumer city mainly imports embodied energy and water from domestic and developing regions of the world and exports little to developed regions in depth analysis indicated that except s17 s7 s10 s15 and s8 all other industrial sectors were net inflows of energy in shanghai similarly except s15 all other industrial sectors were net water consumers in shanghai the s16 18 96 mtce s20 11 06 mtce and s12 7 71 mtce were ranked highest as net importer making up about 60 48 of total net inflows of embodied energy whereas s1 18053 48 mt s3 6865 16 mt and s19 2320 62 mt were ranked highest as net importer making up about 74 99 of total net inflows of embodied water the developed nexus strength indicator uncovered the sectoral energy water linkages from a production perspective the s15 exhibited high nexus strength level up to 1 with 50 contribution by each resource to the nexus while from a consumption perspective the s1 revealed high nexus strength level and water was the most frequent resource node contributing about 84 to the energy water nexus the energy water nexus characteristics of industrial sectors can offer different ways to tackle environmental challenges this study can provide a reference to policy makers in identifying key sectors that requires more focus in terms of easing environmental stress to achieve sustainability in urban development in addition called for coordination and regulating urban industrial trade structure in the future keywords mrio urban sectors energy water nexus consumption sustainability 1 introduction cities are centers of trade productivity consumption and development ribeiro et al 2018 over the last few decades cities in particular are getting more populated than ever and about 54 of global population inhabited urban areas since 2014 de amorim et al 2018 cities have occupied less than 5 percent of the earth s land surface yet consume nearly 80 percent of the resources carreon and worrel 2018 furthermore cities are responsible for more than 60 percent of global energy use and 75 percent of pollutant emissions iea 2012 seto et al 2014 as one of world s leading economies china is experiencing rapid urban expansion and this transition is raising concerns about environmental sustainability in backdrop of relentless increasing demand for water and energy since both resources are key indicators of urban sustainability yang et al 2018 the range and complexity of interdependencies between these two natural resource categories including synergies and trade offs are very high in urban areas integrated resources management strategy for water and energy existed at a local level however policies which largely centered on single element fail to properly address the complex urban energy water nexus issue accordingly resources must be managed in a more sustainable and extensive way as a single target policy for energy or water might affect the other through the resource s supply chain and regional trading actions fang and chen 2018 the nexus concept was formulated in response to such siloed thinking and emphasizes the examination of critical interlinkages across resources particularly synergies and trade offs in a more integrated manner bleischwitz et al 2018 the emergence of resource nexus in recent times articulated the notion that the production and consumption of energy water and other ecosystem resources are all intricately related bijl et al 2018 this inter relation appeared to be greatly significant to city planning and management jensen and wu 2018 among ecological elements nexus has been broadly investigated within a single economic sector it cannot be overlooked that the resources flow depends on trade between sectors also it is essential to consider energy water nexus problem in a broader system instead of a single economic sector a number of studies have extended the study scope from a single economic sector to entire city scale involving numerous sectors chen and chen 2016 fang and chen 2017 wang et al 2017 examined the balance between energy and water consumption in beijing economic sectors and establish the main sectors related energy water inflow and outflow fang and chen 2017 analyzed the energy water nexus and exposed the embodied energy and water flows between major urban sectors chen and chen 2016 built a system based framework and investigated embodied energy use related to water consumption and embodied water use related to energy consumption in the urban economic sectors and results showed variable resource consumption patterns among sectors in addition the energy water nexus has been investigated on a regional scale for example duan and chen 2017 investigated energy water nexus embodied in international energy trade of china the nexus debate has been quite intense over recent years however conceptual clarity often is missing recent studies illustrate that a comprehensive exploration of urban economic structure from a nexus perspective is still limited global energy and water scarcity as well as environmental deterioration are triggering research on resource flows in trade in the past virtual or embodied resource transfers has been largely underestimated but lately research has been conducted to explore energy and water flows within urban economic system from a comprehensive perspective yang et al 2018 a top down approach by employing input output analysis is considered a useful tool to simulate resource flows in fact it can evaluate both direct and indirect flows to account the amount required for producing goods and services in a region wang and chen 2016 wang et al 2019 in addition the multi scale input output model derived from multi regional input output table can present a more in depth examination capturing mutual dependencies of the world economic system while maintaining regional differences wiedmann 2009 bachmann et al 2015 it has been formulated and frequently applied at large scales to focus on modern day problems such as water footprints daniels et al 2011 and consumption based air emissions liu et al 2016 meng et al 2018 the chinese municipalities beijing tianjin shanghai and chongqing are experiencing unprecedented environmental pressures due to the excessive resources consumption and pollutant emissions meng et al 2018 as a special case shanghai functions as a main chinese financial trade and shipping center consuming huge amount of resources mainly imported from other regions due to its mature urbanization in year 2014 city electricity production was about 792 3 twh whereas domestic electricity use stretched up to 1369 03 twh a huge amount of crude oil 22 42 million tons and natural gas 72 43 billion cbm was consumed accounting for 99 7 percent and 97 1 percent of imported fuel respectively the per capita water consumption touched about 437 58 m3 2014 which somehow exposed the city consumption behavior zhang et al 2018 thus due to increasing energy water trade links and distinct development pattern of shanghai underlying economic structure needs to be studied more deeply and targeted analysis is essential in turn it may enable a city to make global difference towards reducing resource use and maximize positive economic effect to fill this important research gap this study proposed an urban energy water nexus framework based on environmentally extended multi scale input output ee msio model for shanghai referred to year 2010 using a comprehensive multi sectoral mrio analysis this research work aims to open up city s black box and reveal the complexity of urban economy to explore structural properties and interactions between sectors and regions in this context the urban industrial structure is analyzed to identify specific sectors with potential for resource efficiency improvements as these are related to national and global policy goals a nexus strength indicator is developed and the nexus emphasis relates mainly to combined energy and water usage in the urban industrial system virtually traded resources were studied by inter sectoral and spatial analysis at multiple scales the study may serve as a reference for other metropolitan areas and mega cities that are going through development transition worldwide and guide to ease environmental stress in order to achieve a higher level of urban sustainability the rest of this paper is structured as follows section 2 explains methodology and data collection for this study section 3 present results analysis section 4 provides discussion finally conclusion of the study is presented in section 5 2 method 2 1 nexus framework and ee msio model an urban energy water nexus framework is proposed for modeling the intricate flows of energy and water embodied in goods and services in a multi scale economy the ee msio model derived from mrio table shows flows of energy and water for urban industrial sectors in the local domestic and international regions mainly it links multi regional input output table mriot of china 2010 to world input output table wiot based on world input output database wiod the mriot of chinese regions compiled by liu et al 2016 has been widely applied in several researches feng et al 2013 liu et al 2016 meng et al 2018 the main linking method was earlier presented in more detail by peters et al 2011 in the ee msio model the world is divided into 8 domestic regions in china including shanghai and 6 international regions including the row region in addition 20 aggregated sectors for each region were included in the ee msio model dietzenbacher et al 2013 timmer et al 2015 the intermediate and final flows between provinces in mainland china and regions in the rest of the world were estimated by splitting provincial total sectoral trade volume with a matrix generated from the trade relationship between china as a whole and other regions in the world mrio table for regions see table 1 thus the intermediate flow from sector i in chinese province p to sector j in world region s is given by 1 t i j p s t i j c s s j t i j c s s j t i j p s where t i j c s taken from the world mrio table describes the economic flow from sector i in mainland china to sector j of region s the sectoral flow of final consumption is estimated with the same principle the production based and consumption based energy and water flows impacts of trade can be assessed by the trade relationship in the ee msio model the calculation equations can be referred to hu et al 2016 liang et al 2017 meng et al 2017 2018 the fundamental input output balance principle can be presented as 2 x 1 x 2 x 3 x m a 11 a 12 a 13 a 1 m a

nexus indicator the nexus lacks a clear and universal definition and some question whether it s just a buzz word endo et al 2017 however the concept has gained great attention in the scientific community allan et al 2015 dai 2018 the emergence of the nexus idea is just an indication of transition of scientific thought and policies towards new integrative thinking to address future uncertainties and promote sustainable resource consumption zhang et al 2018 here the nexus strength of trading regions and industrial sectors of shanghai city were evaluated in the domestic and international trade to show environmental stress externalized in urban economic development the nexus strength indicator is developed according to flows of energy and water considered in ee msio model referring to the ecological footprint concept rees 1992 the nexus strength indicator presents a unified accounting of multiple ecological resources usage i e energy and water measuring nexus strength requires standardization for embodied energy and water flows current flow maximum flow and weighting scheme for both resources in this particular work equal weights 1 2 each to energy and water has been assigned indicating that energy and water of each trading region has the same significance the nexus strength is based on a metric range from 0 no use of resources to 1 maximum use for all resources by ranking procedure we can determine which industrial sector has the highest nexus strength mathematically the summation of nexus strength for each sector region can be formulated below 7 n

stand for each industrial sector i represents the set of all industrial sectors taking water as an example gw i represents the water consumption of sector i gw represents the largest industrial water consumption among all sectors dw i represents the deviation between the industrial largest water consumption and water consumption of sector i p is a weight for resource pw represents the weight of water resource in this study energy and water are considered equally important p is 0 5 2 3 data source in this study energy consumption only includes the one used for production purposes while fossil fuel is only considered in our research all the energy data are unified as ton standard coal equivalent tce energy used by the energy processing and conversion are accounted for in electricity production sector while the electricity and heating consumption in the final consumption sectors are not accounted for to avoid double counting for china the environment satellite accounts including the energy and water are not officially published annually for the 30 regions we therefore estimated the energy consumption of each region based on the provincial energy balance table and energy statistical yearbook in china 2011 research year 2010 for water consumption green water and blue water are accounted for while grey water is not included in china water usage by industrial sectors is reported in the first national pollution source census of china the most complete and available dataset conducted by the ministry of environmental protection and national bureau of statistics for the international regions the energy and water consumption data can be obtained from wiod environmental account 3 results based on the ee msio model energy and water flows in shanghai city were traced on production based and consumption based perspectives the production perspective exhibited when and where resource flow occurred whereas the consumption pattern exhibited why and how resource flow took place in this study shanghai industrial structure analysis revealed different characteristics but in general the city is being explored as net consumer of embodied energy and water for sectors detail see table 2 3 1 sectoral energy analysis 3 1 1 regional spatial distribution for key sectoral flows table 3 shows main industrial structure of production based energy flow for instance in s15 sectoral production based spb energy consumed 37 81 of the urban production based upb energy out of that 53 92 of spb energy was used for local production based lpb 46 08 of spb was used for exports 22 32 for domestic production based dpb exports and 23 76 for international production based ipb for embodied energy in exports the domestic region receives 48 43 of energy and out of that 28 01 focused in central north northwest whereas international region receives 51 57 of energy and out of that 35 19 focused in nafta row and european countries table 4 shows main industrial structure of consumption based energy flow for instance in s15 sectoral consumption based scb energy consumed 18 30 of the urban consumption based ucb energy out of that 50 53 of scb energy was used from local consumption based lcb 49 47 of scb was used from imports 46 34 for domestic consumption based dcb imports and 3 13 for international consumption based icb for embodied energy in imports domestic regions supplied 93 68 of energy and out of that 82 6 focused in central central coast and north whereas international regions supplied 6 32 of energy only and out of that 5 32 focused in row east asia and briiat rest of the industrial sectors and spatial distribution of energy flow can be seen in figs 1 and 2 on the basis of specific industrial flow features production based conclusion can be drawn that s15 and s17 were the leading direct energy consumers occupying more than half of total direct energy flow in shanghai around 53 92 of direct energy flow was driven by local electricity demands while 72 86 of direct energy flow in s17 was driven by domestic 47 27 and international 25 59 exports the main sectoral flows can define shanghai s energy flow characteristics specifically that at local level 38 28 of energy flow was consumed whereas domestic export and international export used up 32 32 and 29 40 of flow respectively the central north and central coast were key domestic exporting regions and north america europe and row were key international exporting regions on the basis of specific industrial flow features consumption based conclusion can be drawn that s16 s15 and s20 were the main direct energy consumers accounting for 54 32 of the total direct energy flow in shanghai about 36 46 of embodied energy flow of s16 s15 and s20 were driven by local demands the domestic imports drove 57 40 46 34 and 49 75 of sectoral energy of s16 s15 and s20 respectively the results showed that for industrial sectors key domestic importing regions were central north and central coast and key international importing regions were row east asia and briiat the consumption based sectoral flows facilitated to show shanghai distinctive energy flow behavior the main driver found was domestic and international trade structure as about 72 energy transfers took place beyond city s administrative boundary 3 1 2 local intersectoral analysis through local intersectoral and regional spatial distribution analysis interconnections and drivers of urban energy flows are identified energy flows of key industrial sectors can help to explain characteristic of urban flow in the whole perspective as regards to local sectoral analysis both production and consumption perspectives were used to expose the underlying industrial structure and analyzed intersectoral flows fig 3 shows that top sectors such as s15 s17 and s7 used up 53 26 14 49 and 8 30 of production based energy flows respectively making their total share of about 76 06 out of that involving destination of energy flows in downstream supply chain s15 itself induced around 59 48 of energy flows similarly s17 itself induced around 54 60 of energy flows while 23 16 of energy flows of s7 were transferred to s16 then s15 s16 and s20 used up 33 10 21 75 and 16 06 of consumption based energy flows respectively making their total share of about 70 91 out of that involving source of energy flows in upstream supply chain s15 itself derived around 95 71 of energy flows 34 84 of energy flows of s16 were transferred to s15 and s20 transferred 40 21 of energy flows to s15 3 2 sectoral water analysis 3 2 1 regional spatial distribution for key sectoral flows table 5 shows main industrial structure of production based water flow for instance in s1 sectoral production based spb water used 23 18 of the urban production based upb water out of that 48 09 of spb water was utilized for local production based lpb 51 91 of spb was used for exports 27 76 for domestic production based dpb exports and 24 15 for international production based ipb for water embodied in exports domestic region received 53 48 of water and out of that 31 30 focused in north central and central coast whereas international regions received 46 52 of water and out of that 30 19 focused in nafta row and europe table 6 shows main industrial structure of consumption based water flow for instance in s1 sectoral consumption based scb water used 45 10 of the urban consumption based ucb water out of that 3 95 of scb water was utilized from local consumption based lcb 96 05 of scb was used from imports 91 23 for domestic consumption based dcb imports and 4 82 for international consumption based icb for embodied water in imports domestic regions supplied 94 98 of water and out of that 73 26 focused in north central northwest whereas international regions supplied 5 02 of water and out of that 4 93 focused in row briiat and nafta rest of the industrial sectors and spatial distribution of water flow can be seen in figs 4 and 5 on the basis of specific industrial flow features production based conclusion can be drawn that s15 and s1 were the leading water consumers making up about 85 81 of total direct water flow in shanghai around 53 79 of direct water flow was driven by local electricity demands while 51 91 of direct water flow in s1 was driven by domestic 27 76 and international 24 15 exports as whole the main sectoral flows can define shanghai s water flow characteristic specifically that at local level 52 66 of water flow was consumed whereas domestic and international exports used up 23 38 and 23 96 of flow respectively the central north and central coast were key domestic exporting regions and north america europe and row were key international exporting regions on the basis of specific industrial flow features consumption based conclusion can be drawn that s1 s3 and s16 were the main water consumers accounting for 68 15 of the total direct water flow in shanghai around 6 78 of embodied water flow of s1 s3 and s16 was driven by local demands the domestic imports drove 91 23 68 43 and 39 85 of the sectoral water of s1 s3 and s16 respectively the results showed that for industrial sectors key domestic importing regions were central north and northwest and key international importing regions were row briiat and nafta the central north and northwest were the top domestic imported regions for embodied water for the industrial sectors the row briiat and nafta were the main international embodied imported sources the consumption based sectoral flows facilitated to show shanghai distinctive water flow behavior the main driver found was domestic and international trade structure as about 87 38 water transfers took place beyond city s administrative boundary 3 2 2 local intersectoral analysis through local intersectoral and regional spatial distribution analysis the interconnections and drivers of urban water flows are identified water flows of key industrial sectors can help to explain characteristic of urban flow in the whole perspective as regards to local sectoral analysis both production and consumption perspectives were used to expose the underlying industrial structure and analyzed intersectoral flows fig 6 shows that top sectors such as s15 s1 and s16 used up 63 96 21 17 and 11 48 of production based water flows respectively making a total share of about 96 62 out of that involving destination of water flows in downstream supply chain s15 itself induced 59 26 of water flows similarly s1 itself induced around 65 21 of water flows while s16 also itself induced around 93 42 of water flows then s15 s16 and s1 used up 38 12 21 80 and 14 13 of consumption based water flows respectively making a total share of about 74 05 out of that involving source of water flows in upstream supply chain s15 itself derived around 99 44 of water flows similarly s16 itself derived about 49 20 of water flows and s1 also itself derived about 97 70 of water flows 3 3 sectoral balance analysis 3 3 1 energy balance as can be seen in fig 7 except s17 s7 s10 s15 and s8 all other sectors were net energy consumer for shanghai and from a global perspective presented shanghai a net energy importer the results demonstrated that 60 48 of total net inflows of embodied energy 62 41 mtce were focused on the s16 18 96 mtce s20 11 06 mtce and s12 7 71 mtce in particular calculating net energy inflow in s16 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 80 49 and 19 51 respectively in s20 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 73 81 and 26 19 respectively in case of s12 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 72 91 and 27 09 respectively the data clearly showed that up to 70 of energy flows were transmitted to inland areas of china via imports fig 7 shows that s17 s7 s10 s15 and s8 were net outflows of energy in shanghai with share of about 35 71 22 70 16 87 16 15 and 8 57 respectively total net outflow of embodied energy of 28 47 mtce in calculating net energy outflow in s17 the relative proportion for domestic and international net outflow was 65 97 and 34 03 respectively in s7 the relative proportion for domestic and international net outflow was 51 66 and 48 34 respectively in s10 the relative proportion of domestic and international net outflow was 19 02 and 80 98 respectively in s8 the relative proportion of domestic and international net outflow was 12 09 and 87 91 respectively similarly s15 also show a total net outflow of embodied energy 3 3 2 water balance as can be seen in fig 8 except s15 all other sectors were net water consumer for shanghai and from a global perspective presented shanghai a net water importer the results demonstrated that 74 99 of total net inflows of embodied water 36322 50 mt were focused on the s1 s3 and s19 in particular calculating net water inflow in s1 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 97 94 and 2 06 respectively in s3 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 68 79 and 31 21 respectively in s19 the relative proportion of domestic and international net inflow was 73 63 and 26 37 respectively the data clearly showed that up to 65 of water flows were transmitted to inland areas of china via imports the s15 was the only sector responsible for net outflow of embodied water 2368 91 mt in shanghai in calculating net water outflow in s15 the relative proportion for domestic and international net outflow was 37 56 and 62 44 respectively 3 4 sectoral energy water nexus analysis this segment describes the results of the urban energy water nexus in the context of this study the nexus strength indicator is constructed according to the flow analysis and structure analysis based on ee msio model both energy and water received the same weight and considered equally important the nexus strength is related merely to energy and water use relative to shanghai and reflects the consumption extent of energy and water simultaneously the nexus strength for a particular industrial sector or region is considered high when the combine usage of energy and water is high detailed analysis for urban industrial sectors nexus can be seen below as apparent in fig 9 from a production perspective associated with each industry s production activity the s15 has high nexus strength level up to 1 with 50 contribution by each resource to the nexus some important sectors were driven by unequal energy and water use and as a result the contribution of single resource use was greater to the energy water nexus i e for s17 energy was key resource node contributing nearly 99 while for s1 about 96 water contributed to the energy water nexus however for sector s1 and s17 the nexus strength was not as high as s15 the nexus strength results for the urban industrial sectors from a consumption perspective caused by the final demand for each industry can be seen in fig 10 large differences can be identified among sectors if compared to the production perspective the consumption based nexus is determined by inter industry dependencies rather than direct requirements among all sectors the s1 showed high nexus strength level followed by s16 and s15 for s1 water was the most frequent resource node contributing about 84 to the energy water nexus in the case of s16 and s15 energy contributed about 85 and 86 respectively towards the nexus considering the fact that within shanghai substantial inter sectoral variations exist nexus strength values are relatively consistent uncovering the main industrial sectors and displaying intensive energy water destinations in urban economic system 4 discussion due to rapid industrial growth and urban transformation for the last three decades the sustainable cities concept has become dominant in planning and managing urban areas around the globe marcotullio 2001 juraschek et al 2018 the current work showed that shanghai a major chinese international metropolis is a net consumer city mainly importing embodied energy and water from domestic and developing regions of the world and exporting little to developed regions for the majority of studied sectors the main driving force for resource consumption were s16 s20 and s12 as embodied energy consumers while s1 s3 and s19 were the highest embodied water consumers these urban industrial sectors largely avoided indigenous resource utilization and shifted energy water stress associated with its consumption to other regions and abroad as a result the energy and water supply in shanghai may be exposed to changes in resource conditions in other areas there is lot of room for improvement of resource conservation and lowering sectoral energy water pressure every industrial sector should be focused with specific conservation strategy and thus different conservation measures needs to be designed for target sectors the industrial sectors responsible for high energy and water consumption increasing resource use efficiency would be a better way to decrease energy and water consumption for example in agriculture sector water saving measures such as irrigation scheduling drip irrigation and cover crops etc should be implemented construction sector should also make endeavor to identify the opportunities of energy saving through technological management and policy approaches by adjusting industrial structure trade pattern and development priorities shanghai could contribute to global resource saving to help easing resources scarcity these days energy water linkages have become recognizable as application of the nexus approach to identify tradeoffs search for cross sector efficiencies and deal with challenges not only within urban system but across global supply chains radcliffe 2018 schlor et al 2018 with different perspectives industrial sectors don t share the same nexus characteristics the s15 exhibited high nexus strength level with production based perspective whereas the s1 revealed high nexus strength level due to large amount of final demands in most of the urban industrial sectors contribution of energy and water use towards nexus was not the equal and because of these structural and development differences resource nexus is not the same among industrial sectors and regions the study results show that from a sector perspective shanghai is facing several energy and water challenges for policy makers the analysis of consumption indexes may offer useful hints revealing that sectors such as s16 s20 and s12 for energy and s1 s3 and s19 for water need to be focused preferentially such work opens the door to more comprehensive resource management practices 5 concluding remarks the present study investigates urban sectoral energy water nexus in shanghai for the year 2010 a nexus strength indicator was developed according to resource flows based on ee msio model findings revealed shanghai is a net consumer city mainly importing embodied energy and water from domestic regions and abroad in depth sectoral analysis showed that s16 s20 and s12were the top three embodied energy consumers while s1 s3 and s19 were the top three embodied water consumers the city global embodied energy and water transfer created a new degree of connectedness amid economies thus resource allocation adjustment and fine tuning of existing industrial sectors are significant to enhance resource utilization efficiency and lower energy water pressure from a production perspective s15 has high nexus strength indicating large resource usage whereas from a consumption perspective s1 has high nexus strength revealing large energy and water consumption the study provides an understanding that intensive resource use in urban industrial sectors results in low efficiency and seriously affects resource security due to differences in industrial structure industrial development priorities technology and policy the resource nexus matters are not the same among sectors and regions this work offers new ways for other mega cities around the globe in coping environmental stress during sustainable urban development acknowledgements this work is supported by projects of sino america international cooperation of national natural science foundation no

25058,urbanization not only causes environmental changes in metropolitan regions but also influences the ecological and socioeconomic changes of distant land areas due to increasing demands on resource use and waste emissions previous studies on the assessment of urban systems have focused on the city or metropolitan areas under study there is a need to incorporate urban land teleconnections to investigate the relationship between a city and distant land areas during the process of urbanization this paper analyzes the teleconnection of the energy and material flows associated with taipei s peri urbanization and remote areas in taiwan the cross scale emergy synthesis of taipei and taiwan was examined first to investigate the relationships of the material and energy flows between taipei and taiwan the exploitation of non renewable resources in taiwan during the 1990s was driven mainly by the construction and development taking place in taipei furthermore compared with taiwan the taipei area relies heavily on external resources the results of the emergy evaluation of materials flows in taipei indicated that 85 of the construction materials used were imported from other remote areas during the past 30 years the use of construction materials in taipei had a higher intensity in the city center during 1982 1992 and in the peri urban area during 2002 2014 the results of the emergy synthesis indicated that urban land teleconnections exist between peri urban areas of taipei and other distant areas in taiwan keywords urban land teleconnections urbanization urban metabolism cross scale emergy synthesis underlying driving force 1 introduction the size of global urban areas has expanded by 58 000 km2 from 1970 to 2010 and is expected to increase to 1 2 million km2 by 2030 seto et al 2011 in addition to its direct influence on the city center urbanization is often associated with the process of peri urbanization by converting rural areas into urban built up areas seto et al 2013 the conversion of forest and agricultural lands into urban built up areas in peri urban areas due to urban sprawl has frequently resulted in the fragmentation of land uses in peri urban areas huang et al 2009 furthermore studies on the influence of peri urbanization have repeatedly emphasized environmental problems such as damaging ecosystem services in peri urban areas douglas 2006 huang et al 2010 reducing the abilities to mitigate climate change and enhance urban resilience lwasa et al 2015 olsson et al 2016 and increasing the demand for material and energy flows douglas 2006 simon 2008 hence understanding how peri urbanization affects environmental change and influences urban sustainability is an important issue simon 2008 previous studies however have focused on assessing the environmental or social impacts on peri urban areas or the urban systems of the area being studied based on a place based conceptualization an urban system which is an open hybrid and socio ecological system relies on external material and energy inflows such as food construction materials and fossil fuels the urban system subsequently generates outflows of material and energy such as industrial products waste heat solid waste or ghg emissions bai 2016 decker et al 2000 therefore when comprehensively studying an urban system the scope should not be limited an area defined by political or administrative boundaries in the science plan of the core project of the international human dimensions programme on global environmental change ihdp on urbanization and global environmental change ugec the research theme 1 3 what are the zones of influence of urban systems and how do these social and biophysical teleconnections affect gec was introduced that urban processes might affect the social ecological economic and cultural functions of remote areas sánchez rodríguez et al 2005 as noted by biermann et al 2016 the process of urbanization should not be restricted to fixed geographic locations consequently it becomes necessary to examine the impacts of urbanization on distant land uses qureshi and haase 2014 to reflect the long distance connection between urbanization and the distant land areas we have proposed using the concept and framework of urban land teleconnections ult by fragkias et al 2012 and seto et al 2012 ult conceptualizes the flows and connections between an urban area and distal areas in relation to the land use change processes human activities and goods and services all of which are driven by underlying urbanization dynamics seto et al 2012 the concept of ult has integrated a number of theories on urban systems such as innovation diffusion theory central place theory complex adaptive urban systems world city systems theory urban metabolism urban material and energy flow studies as well as commodity and value chains and networks fragkias et al 2012 seto et al 2012 proposed four types of ult 1 multiple urban areas affect a single distant area 2 a single urban area affects multiple distant areas 3 a single urban area affects another urban area and 4 multiple urban areas affect multiple distant areas the concept of ult not only emphasizes distant linkages between urbanized areas and their hinterlands on different scales seitzinger et al 2012 but also points out how the urbanization and resource nexus increases environmental burdens on distant lands brondizio et al 2016 for example more than half of the global energy use is attributed to urban areas which generate over 70 of co2 emissions on a global scale seto et al 2014 on the regional scale the imported water demand in beijing city due to china s south north water transfer project affects drainage basins in south china and drives the residents living in the affected areas to migrate to other areas deines et al 2016 liu et al 2016 ult has also shown that urban systems accelerate the reliance on global hinterlands due to the requisition of resources to fulfill the needs of human society güneralp et al 2013 seto et al 2012 for instance a positive correlation has been shown to exists between deforestation and teleconnection effects such as urban population growth defries et al 2010 moreover a significant number of countries rely on the food supplies from other countries because of the loss of agricultural lands due to urbanization seto and ramankutty 2016 van vliet et al 2015 yu et al 2016 2013 other examples have shown that the mining of construction materials driven by urbanization can cause a reduction of remote agricultural lands fry 2011 haack and khatiwada 2007 singh and asgher 2005 the inflow and outflow relationship between cities and their environment can be explained by urban metabolism wolman 1965 the metabolic process of an urban system relates to not only urban sustainability but also to the surrounding hinterlands and global resource networks kennedy et al 2007 ult can extend urban metabolism studies to interpret the energy and material flow between two and more systems friis et al 2015 seto et al 2012 emergy synthesis has been previously used to integrate different energy and material flows to evaluate the contribution of the natural environment to human dominated urban systems previous emergy studies investigating these relationships include taipei huang and chen 2009 taiwan huang et al 2006 macao lei et al 2018 2016 montreal vega azamar et al 2013 scotland viglia et al 2017 rome zucaro et al 2014 and beijing song et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 2009 material flows for urban infrastructure and buildings have also been evaluated through emergy synthesis in a number of studies e g andrić et al 2017 huang and hsu 2003 law et al 2017 lee and braham 2017 pulselli et al 2008 although previous emergy research on urban system and cities emphasized the energetic flows converging from natural and agricultural areas to the urban center huang 1998a huang et al 2001 huang and chen 2005 lee et al 2013 but those prior studies have lacked a consideration of the relationships between an urban system and its associated distant areas although some empirical research has been conducted to analyze the relationship between a city and its hinterlands through material flow analysis e g krausmann 2013 lee et al 2016 lenzen and peters 2009 obernosterer et al 1998 no study has integrated material flow analysis with energetic analysis to examine the social ecological connection between a city and its remote hinterlands from a biophysical perspective in this paper we applied the concept of ult and incorporated emergy synthesis to establish the relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and the distant areas in taiwan the aims of this study are as follows 1 to conduct a cross scale emergy synthesis of taipei and taiwan to investigate the reliance of taipei on taiwan 2 to investigate the flows of construction materials in taipei s peri urban area 3 to interpret the ult relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and remote areas in taiwan 2 methodology 2 1 study area the taipei metropolitan area tma which includes taipei city new taipei city and keelung city is the political and economic center of taiwan fig 1 a its total area is approximately 2 457 km2 the entire population in the tma was 7 million in 2016 while the population density in the tma is 2 849 persons per square kilometer the built up area of the tma is located in the central part of a river basin surrounded by agricultural lands and forests tamsui river the main river in the tma is a natural boundary between taipei city and new taipei city fig 1b urban areas in the tma have expanded significantly over the past 40 years built up area covered approximately 283 km2 in 1971 and increased to 465 km2 in 2013 fig 1c shows that the majority of the areas where urban expansion took place from 1971 to 2013 were located in the southwest of taipei city s peri urban area furthermore the increase of built up areas in the peri urban area of the tma 85 8 during 1971 and 2013 was much higher than that for the city center 25 1 and whole tma 64 2 table 1 according to the planning system in taiwan land use change in the peri urban area in the tma can be categorized into three types plan induced development plan expanded development and scattered development fig 1d plan induced development includes the areas of recent implementation of urban plans for new towns and the development of infrastructure the built up areas in the plan induced development increased significantly during 1971 1995 the second type of peri urbanization in tma the plan expanded development represents areas which were previously developed and the increase of built up area was due to the revision of land use zoning plan to accommodate rapid growth of population density in exiting urban planning areas the final type of land use change is evident in the scattered development in non urban planning areas due to the lack of guiding plans 2 2 emergy synthesis to analyze the construction material flows as a phenomenon of ult a conceptual framework among taiwan taipei and taipei s peri urban area was developed fig 2 the tma systems boundary includes its central urban areas and the peri urban areas as a result of urbanization some of the agricultural lands and forests in the peri urban area of the tma have been converted into built up areas due to peri urbanization because of the needs for urban construction and engineering the tma and its peri urban area rely on the construction material e g sand gravel cement inflows from either importation from foreign countries or exploitation of non renewable resources from distant areas in taiwan hence the supply demand relationship of construction materials has resulted in the existence of ult between taipei s peri urban area and the construction material supplying areas in the distant areas of taiwan from a biophysical perspective the concept of emergy uses a common energy unit and combines socioeconomic and natural factors to synthesize material and energy flows and assess an ecological economic system odum 1996 any flow of energy material money or service in a system can be transformed into a common unit of solar emergy through multiplying units of energy or mass by a unit emergy value uev emergy has been defined as the energy of one type required in transformation to generate a flow or a storage odum 1996 a uev is the unit of energy that the emergy of one type transforms into another type brown and ulgiati 2004 in this paper the geophysical emergy baseline geb of 12 0e 24 sej y 1 was applied and the uevs computed from other gebs were converted using the ratio of the old baseline to the new baseline brown et al 2016 after converting different flows into the same unit of solar emergy the relative contribution of different flows within the system was analyzed and further investigation of the performance of the system done through the calculation of emergy indices emergy indices were introduced in this study to evaluate the characteristics of each system by aggregating resource flows the indices can be categorized into three types emergy source emergy intensity and the emergy evaluation of construction materials used see table 2 indices of the emergy source including the fraction of renewable emergy used the fraction of indigenous emergy used and the fraction of purchased emergy used can allow an overview of the proportion of the emergy inputs of an urban system the emergy investment ratio eir can show the match between the emergy purchased from the economic system and emergy from locally renewable and non renewable sources to evaluate whether the process is a good user of the emergy invested from the economic system to evaluate emergy intensity the indices of emergy density and the density of purchased emergy used can be applied to show changes in the concentration of emergy in urban areas indices of per capita emergy used and per capita purchased emergy used can be applied to display differences in the per capita emergy shared as the living standard in urban areas meanwhile the indices of the density of increased emergy used per increased built up area and per capita increased emergy used for an increased population reveal the trends of emergy intensity in taipei s peri urban area to illustrate the construction material flows within the cross scale system emergy indices for the construction materials used such as the emergy density of construction materials used per increased built up area and per capita construction materials used for an increased population were calculated to explain the intensity of construction materials used in taipei and its peri urban area furthermore the indices for construction materials used such as the density of construction materials used and per capita construction materials used can be applied to compare differences in the intensity of use between the city center and the peri urban area within the tma to calculate the material and energy flows in the peri urban area of the tma we estimated the amounts of sand and gravel cement and asphalt needed for the construction of roads bridges sewers flood prevention projects and buildings statistical data of building construction were used to estimate the amounts of sand and gravel and cement used the per unit requirements of construction materials are shown in table 3 after converting the mass of each substance into an emergy value by multiplying their individual uevs we then used the common emergy unit to compare the contributions of energy and resources from different sources to the development in the peri urban area details for the calculation of construction materials can be found in huang and hsu 2003 3 results 3 1 cross scale emergy evaluation of taiwan and taipei the energy diagram is a fundamental step in the emergy synthesis procedure and is used to provide a system overview of the research problem fig 3 shows the ecological economic system of the taipei area the major components in taipei are the river the coastal natural and agricultural areas the utility flood control transportation and high tech industry sectors urban activity renewable resources imports and exports are all represented table 4 presents the aggregated emergy flows of taiwan and taipei from 1982 to 2014 the total emergy used u and the non renewable resources n of taiwan and taipei increased from 1982 to 2002 at which point they decreased until 2014 furthermore the imported emergy flows in taiwan and taipei had different trajectories while the imported emergy flows in both taiwan and taipei had been rising rapidly since 1982 they stabilized and decreased slightly in taipei from 1 125 89 1020 sej in 1992 to 1 063 18 1020 sej in 2014 the emergy flow of construction materials used e g sand gravel cement in taiwan increased from 1982 to 2002 and then decreased from 2002 to 2014 however the emergy use of construction materials used in taipei reached the highest amount of 629 35 1020 sej in 1992 and then declined over the next 20 years table 5 shows the comparison of emergy indices between taiwan and taipei from 1982 to 2014 regarding emergy sources the fraction of purchased emergy used in taiwan has gradually increased since 1982 while in taipei the purchased emergy used has accounted for four fifths or more of the total emergy used in the past 30 years the eir shows that both the taiwan and taipei systems have become increasingly dependent on the outside world over this 30 year period it also shows that the degree of rising in the eir was much higher in taipei than in taiwan the emergy densities in both areas display the same trajectories of increasing since 1982 and decreasing since 2002 the density of purchased emergy used in taiwan had steadily increased while in taipei the density of purchased emergy used rose from 1982 and showed a slight decline since 1992 the two indices showed that the density in taipei was higher than in taiwan over this 30 year period the value of per capita total emergy used in taiwan increased from 1982 to 2002 at which point it decreased until 2014 meanwhile the highest value of per capita emergy used in taipei 21 15 1015 sej per person was in 1992 comparing the changes of per capita construction materials used we found that the highest value in taiwan 7 46 1015 sej per person was in 2002 and that taipei reached the top value ten years earlier than taiwan did these results revealed that taipei was undergoing significant urban development from 1982 to 1992 3 2 material flows and teleconnections of the peri urbanization in the tma to answer questions concerning the ult relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and remote areas in taiwan we analyzed the construction material flows in taipei s peri urban area through emergy synthesis fig 4 represents a conceptual system of the land use change and construction conducted for peri urbanization in the tma in fig 4 similar to the conceptual framework in this study driven by external and underlying forces such as investment land policy the construction of major infrastructure and population growth the land zoning of the natural and agricultural lands of the peri urban area of the tma was revised and changed to the zone of urban lands to allow for the construction of buildings and infrastructure furthermore the resources for construction materials e g sand gravel cement and labor to construct buildings and infrastructure such as roads levees and bridges were imported from the outside system of taipei which resulted in the increase of built up areas in the peri urban area the results of the emergy synthesis of the construction material flows in the peri urban areas of the tma are shown in table 6 the items with the highest emergy flows were the imported sand gravel and labor services as well as the sand and gravel from locally non renewable resources the highest emergy inflow of construction materials was sand gravel 4 161 31 1020 sej during the period from 1991 to 2000 this value then decreased from 2001 to 2014 because of the need for construction maintenance the demand for imported labor services rose from 1991 2010 from 2010 the demand for labor continued to rise as shown by the gradual increase of the proportion of labor in the imported goods and services category table 7 shows the aggregated emergy flows of urban land construction in taipei s peri urban area the total emergy used u of land construction in taipei s peri urban area increased from 3 190 82 1020 sej 1981 1990 to 5 633 50 1020 sej 1991 2000 after which it began to decrease imported goods and services and the emergy flow of construction materials used had the same trend as that of total emergy used the emergy flows of locally non renewable resources reached its peak 1 208 29 1020 sej over 2001 2010 moreover using emergy indices see table 8 we found that the flow of purchased emergy used construction materials and labor accounts a high proportion 0 719 0 953 of the total emergy used during the past forty years obviously the imported resources played a critical role in the land development and increase of built up areas in the peri urban area which also showed the phenomenon of ult between taipei s peri urbanization and the distant areas in taiwan the most intense development period of building construction in taipei s peri urban area took place during 2001 2014 and the density of emergy used per increased built up area 139 389 92 1020 sej km2 mainly came from the emergy density of construction materials used per increased built up area 109 714 59 1020 sej km2 additionally the index of per capita emergy used for an increased population continued to increase from 1981 to 2014 which also revealed that the increasing need for construction materials in the peri urban area of taipei from 426 31 1015 sej person during 1981 1990 to 3 160 1015 sej person during 2001 2014 these results of the emergy synthesis reflect the need for construction materials in the peri urban area of taipei and further establish the ult relationship between this area and the remote areas in taiwan 4 discussion 4 1 ult in relation to city demand for construction materials an urban system has to rely on the material and energy flows from either their surroundings or global hinterlands kennedy et al 2007 the demand for construction materials can be regarded as an external driving force that influences the land uses of resource supplying areas güneralp et al 2013 the resource inflows from sending areas represent a cause effect connection between urban areas and remote areas seitzinger et al 2012 peri urbanization around taipei has influenced the environmental changes in remote areas in taiwan fig 5 compares the densities of emergy used in taiwan and taipei from the fraction of purchased emergy used it is clear that taiwan and taipei both rely on external resource inflows fig 5a there was an increasing trend of purchased emergy inflows in taiwan but the fraction of purchased emergy used in taipei was always above 0 85 the density of purchased emergy used in taipei was more than 25 1018 sej km2in 1981 and it further increased beyond 45 1018 sej km2 in 2014 by contrast the density of purchased emergy used in taiwan was much lower than of taipei see fig 5b comparing the average densities of purchased emergy used the value of taipei s system 40 78 1018 sej km2 was five times as high as taiwan s system 7 75 1018 sej km2 the eir the ratio of purchased emergy used to the indigenous emergy input renewable and non renewable measures the proportion of investments from outside to that of the self produced resources of systems thereby reflecting the intensity of reliance on resources from outside the systems fig 5c shows that both taipei and taiwan had increasing trends of the eir however the slope of the eir trend in taipei was steeper than that of taiwan which means that taipei has relied on external resources much more than taiwan has fig 5c in addition the eir of taipei in 2014 232 04 was 4 6 times of the eir in 1982 50 14 which reveals the extent of relying on external resources in taipei has significantly increased during 1982 2014 finally fig 5d displays the sources of construction materials in taipei with approximately 85 of the material inflows coming from outside systems during 1982 2014 thereby demonstrating taipei s heavy reliance on external resources the results above showed that taipei s need for material and energy flows from outside systems is high the demand for construction materials due to taipei s urbanization has become one of the underlying driving forces of changes in taiwan s remote areas causing mineral development and production and landscape changes that turn farmlands or forests into mining lands 4 2 peri urbanization and emergy flows in taipei peri urbanization is one type of urbanization that has different features and contexts in different countries seto et al 2013 compared with those of taipei and its peri urban area see fig 6 a the inflow emergy of construction materials in the city center of taipei increased in 1982 and 1992 and then declined in 2002 and 2014 moreover the inflow of imported emergy in the peri urban area of taipei was always higher than in the city center additionally the density of construction materials used in the peri urban area of taipei was higher than in the city center from 1982 to 2014 see fig 6b comparing the indices of the average density of construction materials used we found that the value of the peri urban area 1 45 1020 sej km2 was 2 4 times as high as that of the city center 0 6 1020 sej km2 furthermore fig 6c shows that the per capita construction material emergy used in taipei s peri urban area avg 11 43 1015 sej km2 was 4 3 times as high as in taipei s city center avg 2 61 1015 sej km2 according to the results of the indices of the emergy density and per capita construction materials used the intensity of construction material used in taipei s peri urban areas is higher than in the city center finally the ratio of the intensity of construction materials used to the increase of urban areas in taipei s city center had the highest value during 1982 and 1992 15 81 1020 sej km2 ultimately decreasing until 2014 by contrast the intensity of construction materials used was lower in taipei s peri urban area than in the city center during 1982 and 1992 reaching its peak during 2002 and 2014 see fig 6d the emergy synthesis of the material flow in taipei revealed that the emergy inflows of construction materials in the peri urban area of taipei occupied a great proportion of the urban development in the entire taipei metropolitan area a relationship exists between urban metabolism and land use transformation due to urbanization huang et al 2006 huang and chen 2009 fig 7 shows the relationship between the required emergy of construction materials and the expansion of built up areas in taipei s peri urban area the increase of urban areas in 2002 reflects the increase of the emergy inflow of construction materials in the 1990s further the increasing rate of urban areas decelerated between 2002 and 2014 which is also connected to the declined emergy inflow of construction materials from 1992 to 2002 caused by saturated housing development moreover the increase of the inflow of construction materials in 2014 can be explained by the fact that the demand for construction materials was mainly for maintenance and renewal of existing urban structure there were different needs and intensities of construction materials used across different periods in taipei s peri urban area in taipei the construction of flood prevention infrastructures such as levees and pumps was the primary cause of the material inflow of construction materials from remote areas in the 1980s furthermore the taipei city government started the straightening project of keelung river the main tributary of tamsui river which was completed in 1993 chang et al 2013 the emergy inflows of the construction materials needed for significant infrastructure and buildings in taipei peaked during the 1990s in the 2010s the emergy of infrastructure maintenance and building renewal has been the primary cause of material inflow 4 3 the relationship between the resource inflow of taipei and non renewable resource production from remote areas in taiwan the exploitation of non renewable resources in taiwan was driven mainly by the need for construction materials required by taipei s development during the period from the 1980s to 1990s taiwan was a highly industrialized country and taipei had already been the energy convergent center of taiwan huang 1998b the significant emergy flows of taiwan and taipei showed that not only did the inflow of purchased emergy in taipei reached its peak in 1992 but a significant amount of non renewable resources in taiwan were exploited for development in the same period see fig 8 a during the 1990s taiwan s government implemented the six year national development plan which generated several public construction projects the primary requirement of sand and gravel in taipei was for construction projects such as the mass rapid transit system river straightening project and road construction in the 1990s to build public infrastructures in taipei in the 1990s purchasing the goods energy sand and gravel and cement of the other counties in taiwan was required see fig 8b after the 2000s taiwan entered a period of a stabilized economy however at the same time the economy was affected by globalization and national issues e g the sars outbreak in 2003 the financial crisis of 2007 2008 the imported emergy of goods and services in taipei decreased from 1992 to 2002 in order to solve the economic issue in taiwan after the 2000s taiwan had expanded its domestic demand although the demand for construction materials in taiwan increased from 1992 to 2002 but the demand for building materials in taipei decreased for the same period due to the saturated housing market see fig 8b the imported emergy used of taiwan continued to increase in 2014 but the imported emergy of taipei only increased slightly see fig 8a the main production areas of sand and gravel are located in central and southern taiwan however the eastern counties yilan hualien and taitung of taiwan are also critical exploitation areas in 1997 taiwan s government implemented the policy of sand and gravel shipped from eastern to western taiwan the reason for this policy was to prevent the exploitation of river sand and to prohibit the illegal quarrying in farmlands in the western coastal plain of taiwan hence the counties in eastern taiwan have been the major sources of sand and gravel for the taipei metropolitan area since 1997 fig 9 shows the quantity of sand and gravel shipped from eastern to western taiwan by different modes of transportation and the inflow of sand and gravel from other counties in taiwan to taipei in 2015 the counties that sent the highest volumes of sand gravel to the tma in 2015 were hualien county yilan county as well as miaoli county ults between taipei s peri urbanization and taiwan s remote areas exist due to the flow of construction materials 5 conclusion the primary aim of this study was to establish the ult relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and the distant areas in taiwan using cross scale emergy synthesis we found that compared with taiwan taipei relies heavily on external resources and the demand for inflows of goods and services has been increased from 1982 to 2014 the values of the fraction of purchased emergy used the eir and the density of purchased emergy used in the taipei system were all higher than those of the taiwan system moreover the results also showed that 85 of the construction materials used in taipei derived from other areas in taiwan during 1982 to 2014 meanwhile the flows of construction materials due to peri urbanization in taipei were also analyzed in our study the values of the density of construction material emergy used and per capita construction material emergy used revealed that the intensity of construction materials used was higher in taipei s peri urban area than in taipei city furthermore the results of our analysis showed a spatial temporal difference in the intensities of construction materials used within the tma the ratio of the intensity of construction materials used to the increase of urban areas in taipei city was highest during 1982 1992 and decreased during 2002 2014 by contrast the ratio of the intensity of construction materials used to the increase of urban areas in taipei s peri urban area had a lower value during 1982 1992 and this value increased during 2002 2014 the peri urbanization of taipei has been the underlying driving force impacting the source locations of construction materials finally the results of this study also showed that the demand for construction materials to implement taipei s urban development during the 1990s drove the exploitation of construction material resources in the other counties of taiwan due to the policies of national development and the sand and gravel exploitation in taiwan eastern taiwan has been supplying taipei and the other regions in taiwan with sand and gravel since 1997 the results revealed that the counties that shipped the highest volumes of sand gravel to the tma in 2015 were hualien yilan and miaoli all of these results indicated that ult relationships exist between taipei and taiwan s remote areas due to taipei s peri urbanization the concept of ult has become an emerging research theme in land system science emphasizing the importance of the relationship between cities and their supporting remote areas this concept has also prompted researchers to rethink urban sustainability which has tended to focus internally on the city and ignore the impacts on distant areas therefore how to evaluate the relationship between cities and remote areas is an important research issue in this study we attempted to establish the relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and the remote areas in taiwan from the analysis of energy and material flows which represents the second type of ult that a single urban area affects multiple distant areas as proposed by seto et al 2012 emergy synthesis was used to analyze the relationship of long distance flows between the two systems meanwhile emergy indices used in this study can help us interpret taipei s urban metabolic system and the relationship between taipei and taiwan in order to further investigate how taipei affected the remote areas which provide resources for the peri urbanization in taipei the analysis on the bilateral relations of the energy and material flows between taipei and the remote sites in taiwan is suggested acknowledgment financial support for this research was provided by the

25058,urbanization not only causes environmental changes in metropolitan regions but also influences the ecological and socioeconomic changes of distant land areas due to increasing demands on resource use and waste emissions previous studies on the assessment of urban systems have focused on the city or metropolitan areas under study there is a need to incorporate urban land teleconnections to investigate the relationship between a city and distant land areas during the process of urbanization this paper analyzes the teleconnection of the energy and material flows associated with taipei s peri urbanization and remote areas in taiwan the cross scale emergy synthesis of taipei and taiwan was examined first to investigate the relationships of the material and energy flows between taipei and taiwan the exploitation of non renewable resources in taiwan during the 1990s was driven mainly by the construction and development taking place in taipei furthermore compared with taiwan the taipei area relies heavily on external resources the results of the emergy evaluation of materials flows in taipei indicated that 85 of the construction materials used were imported from other remote areas during the past 30 years the use of construction materials in taipei had a higher intensity in the city center during 1982 1992 and in the peri urban area during 2002 2014 the results of the emergy synthesis indicated that urban land teleconnections exist between peri urban areas of taipei and other distant areas in taiwan keywords urban land teleconnections urbanization urban metabolism cross scale emergy synthesis underlying driving force 1 introduction the size of global urban areas has expanded by 58 000 km2 from 1970 to 2010 and is expected to increase to 1 2 million km2 by 2030 seto et al 2011 in addition to its direct influence on the city center urbanization is often associated with the process of peri urbanization by converting rural areas into urban built up areas seto et al 2013 the conversion of forest and agricultural lands into urban built up areas in peri urban areas due to urban sprawl has frequently resulted in the fragmentation of land uses in peri urban areas huang et al 2009 furthermore studies on the influence of peri urbanization have repeatedly emphasized environmental problems such as damaging ecosystem services in peri urban areas douglas 2006 huang et al 2010 reducing the abilities to mitigate climate change and enhance urban resilience lwasa et al 2015 olsson et al 2016 and increasing the demand for material and energy flows douglas 2006 simon 2008 hence understanding how peri urbanization affects environmental change and influences urban sustainability is an important issue simon 2008 previous studies however have focused on assessing the environmental or social impacts on peri urban areas or the urban systems of the area being studied based on a place based conceptualization an urban system which is an open hybrid and socio ecological system relies on external material and energy inflows such as food construction materials and fossil fuels the urban system subsequently generates outflows of material and energy such as industrial products waste heat solid waste or ghg emissions bai 2016 decker et al 2000 therefore when comprehensively studying an urban system the scope should not be limited an area defined by political or administrative boundaries in the science plan of the core project of the international human dimensions programme on global environmental change ihdp on urbanization and global environmental change ugec the research theme 1 3 what are the zones of influence of urban systems and how do these social and biophysical teleconnections affect gec was introduced that urban processes might affect the social ecological economic and cultural functions of remote areas sánchez rodríguez et al 2005 as noted by biermann et al 2016 the process of urbanization should not be restricted to fixed geographic locations consequently it becomes necessary to examine the impacts of urbanization on distant land uses qureshi and haase 2014 to reflect the long distance connection between urbanization and the distant land areas we have proposed using the concept and framework of urban land teleconnections ult by fragkias et al 2012 and seto et al 2012 ult conceptualizes the flows and connections between an urban area and distal areas in relation to the land use change processes human activities and goods and services all of which are driven by underlying urbanization dynamics seto et al 2012 the concept of ult has integrated a number of theories on urban systems such as innovation diffusion theory central place theory complex adaptive urban systems world city systems theory urban metabolism urban material and energy flow studies as well as commodity and value chains and networks fragkias et al 2012 seto et al 2012 proposed four types of ult 1 multiple urban areas affect a single distant area 2 a single urban area affects multiple distant areas 3 a single urban area affects another urban area and 4 multiple urban areas affect multiple distant areas the concept of ult not only emphasizes distant linkages between urbanized areas and their hinterlands on different scales seitzinger et al 2012 but also points out how the urbanization and resource nexus increases environmental burdens on distant lands brondizio et al 2016 for example more than half of the global energy use is attributed to urban areas which generate over 70 of co2 emissions on a global scale seto et al 2014 on the regional scale the imported water demand in beijing city due to china s south north water transfer project affects drainage basins in south china and drives the residents living in the affected areas to migrate to other areas deines et al 2016 liu et al 2016 ult has also shown that urban systems accelerate the reliance on global hinterlands due to the requisition of resources to fulfill the needs of human society güneralp et al 2013 seto et al 2012 for instance a positive correlation has been shown to exists between deforestation and teleconnection effects such as urban population growth defries et al 2010 moreover a significant number of countries rely on the food supplies from other countries because of the loss of agricultural lands due to urbanization seto and ramankutty 2016 van vliet et al 2015 yu et al 2016 2013 other examples have shown that the mining of construction materials driven by urbanization can cause a reduction of remote agricultural lands fry 2011 haack and khatiwada 2007 singh and asgher 2005 the inflow and outflow relationship between cities and their environment can be explained by urban metabolism wolman 1965 the metabolic process of an urban system relates to not only urban sustainability but also to the surrounding hinterlands and global resource networks kennedy et al 2007 ult can extend urban metabolism studies to interpret the energy and material flow between two and more systems friis et al 2015 seto et al 2012 emergy synthesis has been previously used to integrate different energy and material flows to evaluate the contribution of the natural environment to human dominated urban systems previous emergy studies investigating these relationships include taipei huang and chen 2009 taiwan huang et al 2006 macao lei et al 2018 2016 montreal vega azamar et al 2013 scotland viglia et al 2017 rome zucaro et al 2014 and beijing song et al 2015 zhang et al 2011 2009 material flows for urban infrastructure and buildings have also been evaluated through emergy synthesis in a number of studies e g andrić et al 2017 huang and hsu 2003 law et al 2017 lee and braham 2017 pulselli et al 2008 although previous emergy research on urban system and cities emphasized the energetic flows converging from natural and agricultural areas to the urban center huang 1998a huang et al 2001 huang and chen 2005 lee et al 2013 but those prior studies have lacked a consideration of the relationships between an urban system and its associated distant areas although some empirical research has been conducted to analyze the relationship between a city and its hinterlands through material flow analysis e g krausmann 2013 lee et al 2016 lenzen and peters 2009 obernosterer et al 1998 no study has integrated material flow analysis with energetic analysis to examine the social ecological connection between a city and its remote hinterlands from a biophysical perspective in this paper we applied the concept of ult and incorporated emergy synthesis to establish the relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and the distant areas in taiwan the aims of this study are as follows 1 to conduct a cross scale emergy synthesis of taipei and taiwan to investigate the reliance of taipei on taiwan 2 to investigate the flows of construction materials in taipei s peri urban area 3 to interpret the ult relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and remote areas in taiwan 2 methodology 2 1 study area the taipei metropolitan area tma which includes taipei city new taipei city and keelung city is the political and economic center of taiwan fig 1 a its total area is approximately 2 457 km2 the entire population in the tma was 7 million in 2016 while the population density in the tma is 2 849 persons per square kilometer the built up area of the tma is located in the central part of a river basin surrounded by agricultural lands and forests tamsui river the main river in the tma is a natural boundary between taipei city and new taipei city fig 1b urban areas in the tma have expanded significantly over the past 40 years built up area covered approximately 283 km2 in 1971 and increased to 465 km2 in 2013 fig 1c shows that the majority of the areas where urban expansion took place from 1971 to 2013 were located in the southwest of taipei city s peri urban area furthermore the increase of built up areas in the peri urban area of the tma 85 8 during 1971 and 2013 was much higher than that for the city center 25 1 and whole tma 64 2 table 1 according to the planning system in taiwan land use change in the peri urban area in the tma can be categorized into three types plan induced development plan expanded development and scattered development fig 1d plan induced development includes the areas of recent implementation of urban plans for new towns and the development of infrastructure the built up areas in the plan induced development increased significantly during 1971 1995 the second type of peri urbanization in tma the plan expanded development represents areas which were previously developed and the increase of built up area was due to the revision of land use zoning plan to accommodate rapid growth of population density in exiting urban planning areas the final type of land use change is evident in the scattered development in non urban planning areas due to the lack of guiding plans 2 2 emergy synthesis to analyze the construction material flows as a phenomenon of ult a conceptual framework among taiwan taipei and taipei s peri urban area was developed fig 2 the tma systems boundary includes its central urban areas and the peri urban areas as a result of urbanization some of the agricultural lands and forests in the peri urban area of the tma have been converted into built up areas due to peri urbanization because of the needs for urban construction and engineering the tma and its peri urban area rely on the construction material e g sand gravel cement inflows from either importation from foreign countries or exploitation of non renewable resources from distant areas in taiwan hence the supply demand relationship of construction materials has resulted in the existence of ult between taipei s peri urban area and the construction material supplying areas in the distant areas of taiwan from a biophysical perspective the concept of emergy uses a common energy unit and combines socioeconomic and natural factors to synthesize material and energy flows and assess an ecological economic system odum 1996 any flow of energy material money or service in a system can be transformed into a common unit of solar emergy through multiplying units of energy or mass by a unit emergy value uev emergy has been defined as the energy of one type required in transformation to generate a flow or a storage odum 1996 a uev is the unit of energy that the emergy of one type transforms into another type brown and ulgiati 2004 in this paper the geophysical emergy baseline geb of 12 0e 24 sej y 1 was applied and the uevs computed from other gebs were converted using the ratio of the old baseline to the new baseline brown et al 2016 after converting different flows into the same unit of solar emergy the relative contribution of different flows within the system was analyzed and further investigation of the performance of the system done through the calculation of emergy indices emergy indices were introduced in this study to evaluate the characteristics of each system by aggregating resource flows the indices can be categorized into three types emergy source emergy intensity and the emergy evaluation of construction materials used see table 2 indices of the emergy source including the fraction of renewable emergy used the fraction of indigenous emergy used and the fraction of purchased emergy used can allow an overview of the proportion of the emergy inputs of an urban system the emergy investment ratio eir can show the match between the emergy purchased from the economic system and emergy from locally renewable and non renewable sources to evaluate whether the process is a good user of the emergy invested from the economic system to evaluate emergy intensity the indices of emergy density and the density of purchased emergy used can be applied to show changes in the concentration of emergy in urban areas indices of per capita emergy used and per capita purchased emergy used can be applied to display differences in the per capita emergy shared as the living standard in urban areas meanwhile the indices of the density of increased emergy used per increased built up area and per capita increased emergy used for an increased population reveal the trends of emergy intensity in taipei s peri urban area to illustrate the construction material flows within the cross scale system emergy indices for the construction materials used such as the emergy density of construction materials used per increased built up area and per capita construction materials used for an increased population were calculated to explain the intensity of construction materials used in taipei and its peri urban area furthermore the indices for construction materials used such as the density of construction materials used and per capita construction materials used can be applied to compare differences in the intensity of use between the city center and the peri urban area within the tma to calculate the material and energy flows in the peri urban area of the tma we estimated the amounts of sand and gravel cement and asphalt needed for the construction of roads bridges sewers flood prevention projects and buildings statistical data of building construction were used to estimate the amounts of sand and gravel and cement used the per unit requirements of construction materials are shown in table 3 after converting the mass of each substance into an emergy value by multiplying their individual uevs we then used the common emergy unit to compare the contributions of energy and resources from different sources to the development in the peri urban area details for the calculation of construction materials can be found in huang and hsu 2003 3 results 3 1 cross scale emergy evaluation of taiwan and taipei the energy diagram is a fundamental step in the emergy synthesis procedure and is used to provide a system overview of the research problem fig 3 shows the ecological economic system of the taipei area the major components in taipei are the river the coastal natural and agricultural areas the utility flood control transportation and high tech industry sectors urban activity renewable resources imports and exports are all represented table 4 presents the aggregated emergy flows of taiwan and taipei from 1982 to 2014 the total emergy used u and the non renewable resources n of taiwan and taipei increased from 1982 to 2002 at which point they decreased until 2014 furthermore the imported emergy flows in taiwan and taipei had different trajectories while the imported emergy flows in both taiwan and taipei had been rising rapidly since 1982 they stabilized and decreased slightly in taipei from 1 125 89 1020 sej in 1992 to 1 063 18 1020 sej in 2014 the emergy flow of construction materials used e g sand gravel cement in taiwan increased from 1982 to 2002 and then decreased from 2002 to 2014 however the emergy use of construction materials used in taipei reached the highest amount of 629 35 1020 sej in 1992 and then declined over the next 20 years table 5 shows the comparison of emergy indices between taiwan and taipei from 1982 to 2014 regarding emergy sources the fraction of purchased emergy used in taiwan has gradually increased since 1982 while in taipei the purchased emergy used has accounted for four fifths or more of the total emergy used in the past 30 years the eir shows that both the taiwan and taipei systems have become increasingly dependent on the outside world over this 30 year period it also shows that the degree of rising in the eir was much higher in taipei than in taiwan the emergy densities in both areas display the same trajectories of increasing since 1982 and decreasing since 2002 the density of purchased emergy used in taiwan had steadily increased while in taipei the density of purchased emergy used rose from 1982 and showed a slight decline since 1992 the two indices showed that the density in taipei was higher than in taiwan over this 30 year period the value of per capita total emergy used in taiwan increased from 1982 to 2002 at which point it decreased until 2014 meanwhile the highest value of per capita emergy used in taipei 21 15 1015 sej per person was in 1992 comparing the changes of per capita construction materials used we found that the highest value in taiwan 7 46 1015 sej per person was in 2002 and that taipei reached the top value ten years earlier than taiwan did these results revealed that taipei was undergoing significant urban development from 1982 to 1992 3 2 material flows and teleconnections of the peri urbanization in the tma to answer questions concerning the ult relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and remote areas in taiwan we analyzed the construction material flows in taipei s peri urban area through emergy synthesis fig 4 represents a conceptual system of the land use change and construction conducted for peri urbanization in the tma in fig 4 similar to the conceptual framework in this study driven by external and underlying forces such as investment land policy the construction of major infrastructure and population growth the land zoning of the natural and agricultural lands of the peri urban area of the tma was revised and changed to the zone of urban lands to allow for the construction of buildings and infrastructure furthermore the resources for construction materials e g sand gravel cement and labor to construct buildings and infrastructure such as roads levees and bridges were imported from the outside system of taipei which resulted in the increase of built up areas in the peri urban area the results of the emergy synthesis of the construction material flows in the peri urban areas of the tma are shown in table 6 the items with the highest emergy flows were the imported sand gravel and labor services as well as the sand and gravel from locally non renewable resources the highest emergy inflow of construction materials was sand gravel 4 161 31 1020 sej during the period from 1991 to 2000 this value then decreased from 2001 to 2014 because of the need for construction maintenance the demand for imported labor services rose from 1991 2010 from 2010 the demand for labor continued to rise as shown by the gradual increase of the proportion of labor in the imported goods and services category table 7 shows the aggregated emergy flows of urban land construction in taipei s peri urban area the total emergy used u of land construction in taipei s peri urban area increased from 3 190 82 1020 sej 1981 1990 to 5 633 50 1020 sej 1991 2000 after which it began to decrease imported goods and services and the emergy flow of construction materials used had the same trend as that of total emergy used the emergy flows of locally non renewable resources reached its peak 1 208 29 1020 sej over 2001 2010 moreover using emergy indices see table 8 we found that the flow of purchased emergy used construction materials and labor accounts a high proportion 0 719 0 953 of the total emergy used during the past forty years obviously the imported resources played a critical role in the land development and increase of built up areas in the peri urban area which also showed the phenomenon of ult between taipei s peri urbanization and the distant areas in taiwan the most intense development period of building construction in taipei s peri urban area took place during 2001 2014 and the density of emergy used per increased built up area 139 389 92 1020 sej km2 mainly came from the emergy density of construction materials used per increased built up area 109 714 59 1020 sej km2 additionally the index of per capita emergy used for an increased population continued to increase from 1981 to 2014 which also revealed that the increasing need for construction materials in the peri urban area of taipei from 426 31 1015 sej person during 1981 1990 to 3 160 1015 sej person during 2001 2014 these results of the emergy synthesis reflect the need for construction materials in the peri urban area of taipei and further establish the ult relationship between this area and the remote areas in taiwan 4 discussion 4 1 ult in relation to city demand for construction materials an urban system has to rely on the material and energy flows from either their surroundings or global hinterlands kennedy et al 2007 the demand for construction materials can be regarded as an external driving force that influences the land uses of resource supplying areas güneralp et al 2013 the resource inflows from sending areas represent a cause effect connection between urban areas and remote areas seitzinger et al 2012 peri urbanization around taipei has influenced the environmental changes in remote areas in taiwan fig 5 compares the densities of emergy used in taiwan and taipei from the fraction of purchased emergy used it is clear that taiwan and taipei both rely on external resource inflows fig 5a there was an increasing trend of purchased emergy inflows in taiwan but the fraction of purchased emergy used in taipei was always above 0 85 the density of purchased emergy used in taipei was more than 25 1018 sej km2in 1981 and it further increased beyond 45 1018 sej km2 in 2014 by contrast the density of purchased emergy used in taiwan was much lower than of taipei see fig 5b comparing the average densities of purchased emergy used the value of taipei s system 40 78 1018 sej km2 was five times as high as taiwan s system 7 75 1018 sej km2 the eir the ratio of purchased emergy used to the indigenous emergy input renewable and non renewable measures the proportion of investments from outside to that of the self produced resources of systems thereby reflecting the intensity of reliance on resources from outside the systems fig 5c shows that both taipei and taiwan had increasing trends of the eir however the slope of the eir trend in taipei was steeper than that of taiwan which means that taipei has relied on external resources much more than taiwan has fig 5c in addition the eir of taipei in 2014 232 04 was 4 6 times of the eir in 1982 50 14 which reveals the extent of relying on external resources in taipei has significantly increased during 1982 2014 finally fig 5d displays the sources of construction materials in taipei with approximately 85 of the material inflows coming from outside systems during 1982 2014 thereby demonstrating taipei s heavy reliance on external resources the results above showed that taipei s need for material and energy flows from outside systems is high the demand for construction materials due to taipei s urbanization has become one of the underlying driving forces of changes in taiwan s remote areas causing mineral development and production and landscape changes that turn farmlands or forests into mining lands 4 2 peri urbanization and emergy flows in taipei peri urbanization is one type of urbanization that has different features and contexts in different countries seto et al 2013 compared with those of taipei and its peri urban area see fig 6 a the inflow emergy of construction materials in the city center of taipei increased in 1982 and 1992 and then declined in 2002 and 2014 moreover the inflow of imported emergy in the peri urban area of taipei was always higher than in the city center additionally the density of construction materials used in the peri urban area of taipei was higher than in the city center from 1982 to 2014 see fig 6b comparing the indices of the average density of construction materials used we found that the value of the peri urban area 1 45 1020 sej km2 was 2 4 times as high as that of the city center 0 6 1020 sej km2 furthermore fig 6c shows that the per capita construction material emergy used in taipei s peri urban area avg 11 43 1015 sej km2 was 4 3 times as high as in taipei s city center avg 2 61 1015 sej km2 according to the results of the indices of the emergy density and per capita construction materials used the intensity of construction material used in taipei s peri urban areas is higher than in the city center finally the ratio of the intensity of construction materials used to the increase of urban areas in taipei s city center had the highest value during 1982 and 1992 15 81 1020 sej km2 ultimately decreasing until 2014 by contrast the intensity of construction materials used was lower in taipei s peri urban area than in the city center during 1982 and 1992 reaching its peak during 2002 and 2014 see fig 6d the emergy synthesis of the material flow in taipei revealed that the emergy inflows of construction materials in the peri urban area of taipei occupied a great proportion of the urban development in the entire taipei metropolitan area a relationship exists between urban metabolism and land use transformation due to urbanization huang et al 2006 huang and chen 2009 fig 7 shows the relationship between the required emergy of construction materials and the expansion of built up areas in taipei s peri urban area the increase of urban areas in 2002 reflects the increase of the emergy inflow of construction materials in the 1990s further the increasing rate of urban areas decelerated between 2002 and 2014 which is also connected to the declined emergy inflow of construction materials from 1992 to 2002 caused by saturated housing development moreover the increase of the inflow of construction materials in 2014 can be explained by the fact that the demand for construction materials was mainly for maintenance and renewal of existing urban structure there were different needs and intensities of construction materials used across different periods in taipei s peri urban area in taipei the construction of flood prevention infrastructures such as levees and pumps was the primary cause of the material inflow of construction materials from remote areas in the 1980s furthermore the taipei city government started the straightening project of keelung river the main tributary of tamsui river which was completed in 1993 chang et al 2013 the emergy inflows of the construction materials needed for significant infrastructure and buildings in taipei peaked during the 1990s in the 2010s the emergy of infrastructure maintenance and building renewal has been the primary cause of material inflow 4 3 the relationship between the resource inflow of taipei and non renewable resource production from remote areas in taiwan the exploitation of non renewable resources in taiwan was driven mainly by the need for construction materials required by taipei s development during the period from the 1980s to 1990s taiwan was a highly industrialized country and taipei had already been the energy convergent center of taiwan huang 1998b the significant emergy flows of taiwan and taipei showed that not only did the inflow of purchased emergy in taipei reached its peak in 1992 but a significant amount of non renewable resources in taiwan were exploited for development in the same period see fig 8 a during the 1990s taiwan s government implemented the six year national development plan which generated several public construction projects the primary requirement of sand and gravel in taipei was for construction projects such as the mass rapid transit system river straightening project and road construction in the 1990s to build public infrastructures in taipei in the 1990s purchasing the goods energy sand and gravel and cement of the other counties in taiwan was required see fig 8b after the 2000s taiwan entered a period of a stabilized economy however at the same time the economy was affected by globalization and national issues e g the sars outbreak in 2003 the financial crisis of 2007 2008 the imported emergy of goods and services in taipei decreased from 1992 to 2002 in order to solve the economic issue in taiwan after the 2000s taiwan had expanded its domestic demand although the demand for construction materials in taiwan increased from 1992 to 2002 but the demand for building materials in taipei decreased for the same period due to the saturated housing market see fig 8b the imported emergy used of taiwan continued to increase in 2014 but the imported emergy of taipei only increased slightly see fig 8a the main production areas of sand and gravel are located in central and southern taiwan however the eastern counties yilan hualien and taitung of taiwan are also critical exploitation areas in 1997 taiwan s government implemented the policy of sand and gravel shipped from eastern to western taiwan the reason for this policy was to prevent the exploitation of river sand and to prohibit the illegal quarrying in farmlands in the western coastal plain of taiwan hence the counties in eastern taiwan have been the major sources of sand and gravel for the taipei metropolitan area since 1997 fig 9 shows the quantity of sand and gravel shipped from eastern to western taiwan by different modes of transportation and the inflow of sand and gravel from other counties in taiwan to taipei in 2015 the counties that sent the highest volumes of sand gravel to the tma in 2015 were hualien county yilan county as well as miaoli county ults between taipei s peri urbanization and taiwan s remote areas exist due to the flow of construction materials 5 conclusion the primary aim of this study was to establish the ult relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and the distant areas in taiwan using cross scale emergy synthesis we found that compared with taiwan taipei relies heavily on external resources and the demand for inflows of goods and services has been increased from 1982 to 2014 the values of the fraction of purchased emergy used the eir and the density of purchased emergy used in the taipei system were all higher than those of the taiwan system moreover the results also showed that 85 of the construction materials used in taipei derived from other areas in taiwan during 1982 to 2014 meanwhile the flows of construction materials due to peri urbanization in taipei were also analyzed in our study the values of the density of construction material emergy used and per capita construction material emergy used revealed that the intensity of construction materials used was higher in taipei s peri urban area than in taipei city furthermore the results of our analysis showed a spatial temporal difference in the intensities of construction materials used within the tma the ratio of the intensity of construction materials used to the increase of urban areas in taipei city was highest during 1982 1992 and decreased during 2002 2014 by contrast the ratio of the intensity of construction materials used to the increase of urban areas in taipei s peri urban area had a lower value during 1982 1992 and this value increased during 2002 2014 the peri urbanization of taipei has been the underlying driving force impacting the source locations of construction materials finally the results of this study also showed that the demand for construction materials to implement taipei s urban development during the 1990s drove the exploitation of construction material resources in the other counties of taiwan due to the policies of national development and the sand and gravel exploitation in taiwan eastern taiwan has been supplying taipei and the other regions in taiwan with sand and gravel since 1997 the results revealed that the counties that shipped the highest volumes of sand gravel to the tma in 2015 were hualien yilan and miaoli all of these results indicated that ult relationships exist between taipei and taiwan s remote areas due to taipei s peri urbanization the concept of ult has become an emerging research theme in land system science emphasizing the importance of the relationship between cities and their supporting remote areas this concept has also prompted researchers to rethink urban sustainability which has tended to focus internally on the city and ignore the impacts on distant areas therefore how to evaluate the relationship between cities and remote areas is an important research issue in this study we attempted to establish the relationship between taipei s peri urbanization and the remote areas in taiwan from the analysis of energy and material flows which represents the second type of ult that a single urban area affects multiple distant areas as proposed by seto et al 2012 emergy synthesis was used to analyze the relationship of long distance flows between the two systems meanwhile emergy indices used in this study can help us interpret taipei s urban metabolic system and the relationship between taipei and taiwan in order to further investigate how taipei affected the remote areas which provide resources for the peri urbanization in taipei the analysis on the bilateral relations of the energy and material flows between taipei and the remote sites in taiwan is suggested acknowledgment financial support for this research was provided by the

25059,oysters directly impact water quality through filter feeding and have been extensively studied due to the potential ecological benefits of population restoration numerical models have been developed that simulate the environmental impact of oysters on estimating current water quality conditions and evaluating prospective restoration strategies accurately representing oyster filtration in these models is essential to their value as management tools however the formulation of filtration in response to environmental variables differs between models here we compare different formulations for filtration for the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica from several studies cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 ehrich and harris 2015 which use functions of temperature salinity and suspended solids concentration tss to limit filtration rate using outputs from a water quality model with controlled forcing conditions we investigated how sensitive model output can be to the environmental limitation functions used we found that due to feedback between tss and filtration rate the choice of tss function caused significant variation in the model output beyond the scale of the differences in the functions themselves from our results and a theoretical understanding of model construction we discuss the implications for the accuracy of water quality models with oyster filtration and provide recommendations for future modeling efforts keywords eastern oyster bivalve filtration filtration rate model sensitivity model comparison feedback loops 1 introduction the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica is a sessile suspension feeding bivalve that has been labeled as an ecosystem engineer due to the diverse ecosystem services it provides including habitat formation transferring energy from plankton to the benthos and influencing water quality through filtration and denitrification gutierrez et al 2003 oysters utilize cilia on their gills to remove particulate matter from water that passes through the gills ingesting edible material and excreting the excess onto the substrate as pseudofeces newell and langdon 1996 ward et al 1994 this filter feeding can have a noticeable impact on water clarity and the concentration of suspended solids such as plankton and detritus newell 1988 newell et al 2005 oysters also form reefs through the accumulation of shell which serves as habitat for other organisms gutierrez et al 2003 in chesapeake bay maryland and virginia u s a the eastern oyster not only provides the aforementioned ecosystem services but also supports a historically important fishery north et al 2010 however it is estimated that the chesapeake oyster population has experienced reef loss over the last century of about 63 regionally and over 99 in some estuaries locally beck et al 2011 this population decline has been attributed primarily to a history of disease over harvesting and habitat degradation newell 1988 several government and nonprofit agencies in the chesapeake bay region view restoration of the oyster population as a high priority and are investing in various strategies to rebuild and protect oyster reefs chesapeake watershed agreement 2014 this investment in restoring oysters is motivated by several potential benefits primarily improved water quality through increased filtration and the revival of the commercial fishery harding and mann 2001 newell et al 2005 north et al 2010 oyster restoration is limited by funding and uncertainty about which restoration strategies are the most effective necessitating the use of numerical models as a low cost tool to efficiently evaluate potential strategies and estimate their environmental impacts north et al 2010 these models simulate the interaction between environmental conditions and oysters specifically the impact of filter feeding to provide quantitative estimates of changes in water quality wilberg et al 2013 cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 cerco and noel 2005 used a coupled hydrodynamic and eutrophication model with oyster filtration to examine the potential impact of various levels of increased oyster population on dissolved oxygen and water clarity fulford et al 2007 investigated the potential of restored oyster populations to aid in reducing the impact of eutrophication by simulating the extent of plankton biomass removal by oysters under various conditions north et al 2010 used numerical modeling to develop a decision support tool for identifying optimal oyster restoration locations in chesapeake bay considering many controlling factors and ecological benefits including improved water quality numerous models have been developed for a wide variety of applications that include functions that represent oyster filtration e g hofmann et al 1992 filgueira et al 2014 bacher et al 2012 ferreira et al 1997 kobayashi et al 1997 wilberg et al 2013 cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 many of these models use the same basic structure for how filtration is represented with a filtration rate defined as the volume of water filtered per unit time calculated from a maximum rate and environmental limitation functions of temperature salinity and total suspended solids concentration cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 and north et al 2010 model oyster filtration in chesapeake bay using this structure with the environmental limitation functions derived from observed rates of particle removal by oysters under changing water conditions specifically from the studies of loosanoff 1952 1958 jordan 1987 and newell and koch 2004 however despite being based primarily on the same observational data these modeling studies use different limitation functions due to differences in the interpretation of the data understanding how these functions impact model behavior differently is necessary in order to compare outputs between models and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these functions with respect to model accuracy ehrich and harris 2015 compared the formulations for filtration used in cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 and powell et al 1992 in order to investigate the differences between them and determine which aspects of each to use in future models they calculated filtration rate using the equations from each study over a range of temperature salinity and total suspended solids values from measurements in 2009 of the lower potomac river a chesapeake bay tributary by doing so they were able to observe differences in the calculated filtration rate between the different formulations they also conducted sensitivity tests on the different formulations isolating for temperature salinity or total suspended solids and observing how different levels of those environmental conditions affected the filtration rate they highlighted that these different models do provide distinctly different calculations of oyster filtration rates and based on their assessments recommended different components of each formulation for future modeling use although ehrich and harris 2015 directly compared the formulations of oyster filtration between multiple models and identified differences between them there is still a lack of understanding of how those differences affect the output of a model water quality models such as those used by cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 and north et al 2010 are complex and include non linear ordinary differential equations making it difficult to predict how a change in one aspect of the model construction will translate to variation in the output of the state variables without direct investigation of model simulations we lack an adequate understanding of the extent to which these different environmental limitation functions can impact model output and where potential sensitivities and weaknesses are in this paper we compare model outputs produced by different formulations for calculating of the filtration rate by controlling the numerical model and forcing conditions observed changes in model behavior can be directly attributed to the differences in filtration individual aspects of the filtration rate calculation are also each isolated for and examined individually so that when large sensitivity is observed in the model it can be further linked directly to its source this work will contribute to improving the development of oyster ecosystem models by identifying sources of sensitivity in the filtration that may only be observed in model execution 2 methods 2 1 formulating filtration and the environmental limitation functions our investigation focuses specifically on the formulations of filtration used in cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 and ehrich and harris 2015 in these studies filtration rate is calculated by multiplying a maximum filtration rate frmax by several environmental limitation functions that ramp between 0 and 1 eq 1 these functions represent the effects of temperature t salinity s and total suspended solids concentration tss on filtration rate fr 1 fr m3 day 1 frmax ƒ t ƒ s ƒ tss cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 and north et al 2010 use different combinations of the 3 types of environmental limitation functions the full description of each ƒ t ƒ s and ƒ tss function used and which studies they are implemented in can be found in table 1 and figs 1 3 in addition we have included the ƒ t function created by ehrich and harris 2015 and an original continuous ƒ tss function that we developed from work done by jordan 1987 jordan 1987 derived a function for biodeposition with respect to t and tss from multiple regression of observational data as justified therein filtration rate was estimated by dividing the rate of biodeposition by tss concentration we modified this function by setting a constant temperature of 27 c resulting in a function of only tss by dividing this new function by its maximum value we produced a function of tss with the same shape as the filtration rate curve but with a range of 0 to 1 to correct for asymptotic behavior in the function at low values of tss ƒ tss is defined to slope linearly below tss concentrations of 5 mg l a relationship also observed in jordan 1987 this function tss con was created to provide a continuous ƒ tss function to contrast with the existing ones tss 01 tss 02 and tss log which are all discontinuous but based at least in part on the observations of jordan 1987 2 2 model description 2 2 1 the biogeochemical model the biogeochemical model used in this study is based on the fennel et al 2006 model that has been modified to better represent estuarine processes brown et al 2013 feng et al 2015 wiggert et al 2017 the model tracks 8 state variables nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 phytoplankton p zooplankton z small and large detritus ds and dl dissolved organic nitrogen don and inorganic suspended solids iss fig 4 the 7 nitrogenous state variables are tracked as atoms of labile nitrogen mmoln m 3 whereas iss is tracked as mass mg l 1 the model is zero dimensional however basic physical processes are simulated using a formulation for a chemostat the model was built using r a language and environment for statistical computing r 3 4 0 the model numerically solves the 8 differential equations for each state variable to steady state using the package desolve soetaert and herman 2009 for conciseness only the oyster parameterizations salient modifications from fennel et al 2006 and formulations specific to the zero dimensional model are described below the full set of equations and constants is provided in the appendix 2 2 2 filtration within the model oyster filtration of suspended solids is modeled as a reduction in the concentrations of p z ds dl and iss the rate of change in internal concentration due to filtration x t is determined by the filtration rate fr the internal concentration x and the spatial volume v of the modeled region eq 2 2 x t 1 fr x v 1 other processes the filtration rate fr is calculated as described in section 2 1 and eq 1 frma x is calculated from the filtration rate of a single oyster frsingle the oyster density od and the bottom area a eq 3 3 frmax frsingle od a 4 frsingle 0 17 dtw 0 75 ehrich and harris 2015 5 dtw 0

harris 2015 we used a shell length of 76 mm because that is the minimal size for legal harvest and has been used previously as the shell length for modeled oysters north et al 2010 2 2 3 dissolved organic matter the biogeochemical model includes a labile dissolved organic nitrogen don state variable parameterized using the same relationships exercised in brown et al 2013 and wiggert et al 2017 2 2 4 suspended solids an iss state variable is required to properly represent tss in the model which is of key importance to the oyster filtration the iss variable does not participate in any of the biogeochemical processes but as a component of tss it influences light attenuation iss is controlled solely by the rates of sinking boundary exchange and filtration the organic suspended solids oss mg l 1 were calculated from p z ds and dl which as described in 2 2 1 are in units of mmol n m 3 cerco et al 2013 estimates that total mass is 2 5 times that of carbon which can be estimated from mmol n by using the redfield ratio 106 16 to get mmol c and multiplying by the atomic weight of carbon 12 once p z ds and dl are summed and converted to a mass concentration mg l 1 they are added to iss to give tss eq 6 oss in mg l 1 is equal to the section of eq 6 within the brackets 6 tss mg l 1 iss 2 5 p z ds dl 106 16 12 1 000 2 2 5 light attenuation and chlorophyll the diffuse attenuation

remineralization the biogeochemical model in fennel et al 2006 assumes that the water column is fully aerobic the mesohaline chesapeake bay experiences hypoxic and anoxic conditions during the summer however this model was run under conditions based on a shallow estuarine environment in which the assumption of a fully aerobic water column is valid sediment remineralization is done using the biogeochemical bottom boundary condition from fennel et al 2006 which assumes that 25 of particulate nitrogen that reaches the sediment is instantaneously remineralized to ammonium nh4 the remaining 75 is converted to dinitrogen gas and is therefore lost from the system this estimate is based on the assumption that the sediment is partially anaerobic with some remineralization 14 occurring through coupled nitrification denitrification and the remainder 86 through direct oxidation 2 2 7 physical parameters the model is zero dimensional without a spatial grid this simplified style of model allows for repeatable runs of the biogeochemical state variables to steady state and fast runtimes these characteristics support the objective of this study which is to compare the effect different environmental limitation functions have on model behavior not provide the most accurate realistic simulations possible of a specific study site although zero dimensional spatial dimensions of the model space are specified which influence the rates of boundary exchange and the impacts of sinking and filtration because this study focused on oyster models in the chesapeake bay region spatial dimensions were chosen based on the harris creek maryland usa tributary where current restoration efforts are focused the bottom area parameter a was set to be 24 42 km2 estimated from gis data wazniak et al unpublished the depth d was chosen as 3 m based on general knowledge of regional water depths 2 2 7 1 boundary exchange the effect of transport in and out of the model domain is simulated using a forced boundary concentration b and a boundary exchange rate h the change in internal concentration to a state variable x due to boundary exchange depends on the difference between the internal concentration and the boundary concentration and the exchange rate eq 9 9 x t h b x other processes if the internal concentration x is equal to the forced boundary concentration b there is no effect from boundary exchange if internal concentration exceeds boundary concentration the boundary exchange dilutes the internal concentration if internal concentration is less than boundary concentration the boundary exchange raises the internal concentration boundary exchange effects all state variables with the same exchange rate however at a given time each state variable may have a different rate of change depending on the internal concentration of that state variable the exchange rate h was determined by taking the inverse of an estimate of the flushing time tf of the harris creek maryland usa tributary this flushing time was estimated with the tidal prism method using gis and bathymetry data sets to calculate the area and volume of the harris creek tributary wazniak et al unpublished tf was determined to be 4 26 days translating to an exchange rate of 0 235 day 1 2 2 7 2 vertical sinking rates the sinking velocity of small particles ws was set at 0 1 m d 1 and affects p z and ds the sinking velocity of larger particles wl was set at 1 m d 1 and affects dl and iss the other state variables are dissolved and therefore unaffected by sinking these sinking velocities are the same as those used in fennel et al 2006 for ds and dl the change in internal concentration x of a state variable due to sinking is determined by the relevant sinking rate w and the depth d eq 10 10 x t 1 w x d 1 other processes 2 3 sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 base run we established a base parameterization and set of forcing conditions table 2 that were held consistent between model runs except for the environmental limitation function select boundary exchange forcing concentrations b and oyster density which were changed selectively as independent variables t and s were set at 27 c and 13 psu respectively because all of the ƒ t and ƒ s functions equal 1 at these values therefore the base run is not dependent on environmental limitation functions for temperature and salinity however because tss concentration varies due to processes within the model environment a base ƒ tss function had to be chosen for the base run we selected tss con because it is continuous oyster density od was set to 50 m 2 within ranges observed in the chesapeake bay oyster population estimation 2 2 http www vims edu research units labgroups molluscan ecology archive cbope index php each state variable was forced by its boundary exchange concentration b the base run b value for each state variable except for iss was defined with measurements from the chesapeake bay program station et5 2 summer 2001 average detritus was evenly split between small and large ds and dl iss was set to 17 08 mg l 1 so that tss equaled 20 mg l 1 eq 6 and therefore all ƒ tss functions equaled 1 2 3 2 sensitivity tests of the ƒ t functions to look at the response of the model to the two temperature functions model runs were conducted forcing temperature over a range of 0 35 c representing typical seasonal minimum and maximum temperatures in chesapeake bay for each temperature the model was run out to steady state and the steady values of each state variable were recorded then the ƒ t function was changed and steady state model outputs were again recorded for repeated runs forced over the same range of temperature for each model run model forcing conditions other than t and ƒ t were held consistent with the base run 2 3 3 sensitivity tests of the ƒ s functions the same method as described in 2 3 2 was applied to the ƒ s functions running the model out to steady state at salinities over the range of 2 14 psu this range of salinity was chosen because outside of that range the ƒ s functions behave identically the model was run over this salinity range 3 times once for each ƒ s function this resulted in steady state model responses to each ƒ s function over a range of salinity values for each model run model forcing conditions other than s and ƒ s were held consistent with the base run 2 3 4 sensitivity tests of the ƒ tss functions similarly to 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 steady state model outputs were recorded for model runs forced with each ƒ tss function over a range of boundary exchange tss concentrations from 0 to 250 mg l 1 this range of tss was chosen to extend up to a high extreme but be within a range of observed concentrations stumpf 1988 describes observed tss concentrations of 200 mg l 1 as highly turbid water during high flow events but also observed values several times larger in some locations during extreme flooding events tss was forced for each run by modifying the bx forcing values for each particulate state variable p z ds dl iss using the following method for tss forcing 2 92 mg l 1 the base run oss concentration tss was forced by changing biss while bp bz bds and bdl were held constant as in the base run this method was chosen for consistency in the initial conditions of the biogeochemical components between simulations and the assumption that increased levels of tss are primarily a result of increased levels of iss for tss forcing 2 92 mg l 1 biss 0 and bp bz bds and bdl were reduced so that the total oss forcing concentration was equal to the desired tss forcing and the relative magnitude of their concentrations remained constant 2 3 5 varying the oyster density to observe the effect of oyster density on the model response to the different environmental limitation functions the model runs forced as described in sections 2 3 2 2 3 4 were repeated at oyster densities of 1 10 and 100 m 2 chosen to represent a range of possible densities from current to historical populations this provided sets of model results for each environmental limitation function over a range of each parameter and at multiple oyster densities 2 3 6 quantitative analysis to quantify the difference in model output caused by two different environmental limitation functions we utilized a metric adapted from the reliability index called the average factor af leggett and williams 1981 the af is the average magnitude by which two sets of model outputs are different multiplicatively and is not dependent on having an observed or correct set of values an af of 2 0 means that on average one set of model output values is twice as large as the other the af is calculated by taking the log of the ratio between two output values and squaring it which gives the same positive number regardless of which value is in the denominator or numerator of the initial ratio the average value of these numbers is then calculated by integrating over the range of the independent variable and dividing by that range finally the square root is taken and the number is exponentiated to normalize it back to the magnitude of the ratio between two values 11 a f e x p 1 x n x 1 i 1 n log d 1 i d 2 i 2 x i x i 1 eq 11 shows the calculation of the af where d1 and d2 are two model output values with the same independent variable value xi because our model results were discrete values at given but sometimes unevenly spaced values for t s and tss the integration was done using a riemann sum with the summation numbered subscripts and expressions containing x all components of integration and getting the average value we calculated the average factor between sets of model results with different environmental limitation functions but for the same relevant environmental parameter t s tss and oyster density therefore any observed differences could be directly attributed to just the change in the environmental limitation function for example the af was calculated between the model outputs with the t 6 and t 15 ƒ t functions over the range of temperature values from 0 to 35 c and at 50 m 2 oyster density as the two sets of model runs only differ by one environmental limitation function of the same type 3 results 3 1 response of steady state tss to environmental limitation functions 3 1 1 ƒ t functions for both ƒ t functions the model tss decreased with increasing temperature to 27 c and increased with temperature above 27 c fig 5 the shape of the response exhibits the bell like curve of both ƒ t functions but inverted consistent with our expectation that increases in the filtration rate result in lower steady state tss concentrations t 6 produced lower steady state tss concentrations than t 15 except at 27 c where they are equal this is because the t 6 ƒ t function has a larger magnitude than the t 15 function except at 27 c where they are equal fig 1 increased oyster density also resulted in lower overall steady state tss concentrations for both ƒ t functions due to the higher filtration rates fig 5 the two different ƒ t functions produced steady state tss concentrations different from each other by an af of 1 01 1 12 1 33 and 1 49 over the range of forced temperatures from 0 to 35 c at oyster densities of 1 10 50 and 100 m 2 respectively 3 1 2 ƒ s functions internal tss decreased with increased salinity fig 6 due to the positive correlation between salinity and ƒ s fig 2 the response of steady state tss to salinity exhibited unique behaviors for each ƒ s function specifically the discontinuous drop in tss at 5 psu observed with s pw and the hyperbolic tangent shaped response observed with s tan the s pw and s lin functions are linear between 4 and 12 psu however the response of tss to salinity for both of these functions was non linear in the same salinity range the differences in steady state tss caused by using the different ƒ s functions are quantitatively summarized as follows between s lin and s tan steady state tss differed by an af of 1 00 1 03 1 06 and 1 08 at 1 10 50 and 100 m 2 oyster densities respectively between s lin and s pw 1 00 1 03 1 07 and 1 09 between s pw and s tan 1 01 1 04 1 09 and 1 13 these af values were calculated over the range of forced salinity values from 2 to 14 psu 3 1 3 ƒ tss functions at 1 m 2 oyster density the steady state tss increased linearly with boundary exchange tss with little difference between the ƒ tss functions fig 7 at 50 and 100 m 2 oyster densities tss 02 and tss con exhibited the same linear increase when exchange tss exceeded 55 mg l 1 for tss 02 and approximately 110 mg l 1 for tss con however tss log produced much lower steady state concentrations with little increase even at very large boundary concentrations with tss 01 steady state tss responded discontinuously with increasing exchange concentration changing from a low flat response similar to that of tss log to an intermediate linear trend to the same linear trend exhibited by tss 02 and tss con the discontinuous changes in steady state tss caused by tss 01 and tss 02 are expected as these ƒ tss functions are themselves discontinuous figs 3 7 however tss con which is continuous also caused a discontinuous jump in the model response the differences in steady state tss caused by using the different ƒ tss functions are quantitatively summarized as follows between tss 01 and tss 02 steady state tss differed by an af of 1 02 1 31 3 22 and 6 34 at 1 10 50 and 100 m 2 oyster densities od respectively between tss 02 and tss log 1 06 1 84 5 63 and 8 91 between tss con and tss 02 1 04 1 36 1 81 and 2 06 between tss con and tss 01 1 04 1 31 2 37 and 5 00 between tss con and tss log 1 07 1 74 4 67 and 7 10 between tss log and tss 01 1 05 1 51 2 42 and 2 17 these af values were calculated over the range of forced boundary exchange tss from 0 to 250 mg l 1 the af value for steady state tss was also calculated between each ƒ tss function for an od of 50 m 2 over two smaller ranges of forced boundary tss between 0 and 50 mg l 1 the af values were 1 61 1 55 1 32 1 31 1 21 and 1 19 between tss con and tss 02 tss con and tss log tss con and tss 01 tss 02 and tss 01 tss log and tss 01 tss 02 and tss log respectively between 50 and 100 mg l 1 the af values were 3 22 2 12 1 92 5 91 1 15 and 6 37 between the same pairs of ƒ tss functions respectively this change between the two ranges of forced tss further highlights the discrete jump in behavior observed in this range on fig 7 the af values for steady state tss between the ƒ tss functions and these different ranges of forced boundary tss are summarized in table 3 3 2 response of steady state oss and nh4 to ƒ tss functions 3 2 1 oss all 4 ƒ tss functions caused an immediate increase in oss concentration up to about 2 mg l 1 at very low forced tss values and then a negative relationship with forced tss except for a few discrete increases with tss 02 tss 01 and tss con fig 8 tss 02 and tss con increased up over 3 mg l 1 at approximately 55 and 110 mg l 1 forced tss respectively tss log caused oss to level out at approximately 0 5 mg l 1 the response of oss with tss 01 was consistent with that of tss log below 130 mg l 1 and that of tss 02 and tss con above 238 mg l 1 in between it exhibited an intermediate oss response with concentrations between 1 2 and 1 4 mg l 1 these differences in steady state oss between the different ƒ tss functions are quantitatively summarized as follows between tss con and tss 02 steady state oss differed by an af of 1 81 tss con and tss log 4 52 tss con and tss 01 2 42 tss 02 and tss 01 3 29 tss log and tss 01 2 29 tss 02 and tss log 5 48 these af values were calculated over the range of forced boundary exchange tss from 0 to 250 mg l 1 and oyster density of 50 m 2 3 2 2 nh4 all 4 ƒ tss functions produced low steady state nh4 concentrations and a negative response with forced tss up to 55 mg l 1 forcing concentration fig 9 with tss 02 and tss con nh4 concentrations had a sloping increase to over 3 mmoln m 3 starting at 55 and 110 mg l 1 forced tss respectively tss log never produced steady state nh4 that exceeded 0 125 mmoln m 3 the response of nh4 with tss 01 was consistent with that of tss log below 130 mg l 1 and that of tss 02 and tss con above 238 mg l 1 in between it exhibited an intermediate response with concentrations between 0 25 and 0 6 mmoln m 3 the differences in the steady state nh4 caused by using the different ƒ tss functions are quantitatively summarized as follows between tss con and tss 02 steady state nh4 differed by an af of 2 54 tss con and tss log 14 16 tss con and tss 01 4 55 tss 02 and tss 01 6 12 tss log and tss 01 4 16 tss 02 and tss log 16 38 these af values were calculated over the range of forced boundary exchange tss from 0 to 250 mg l 1 and at an oyster density of 50 m 2 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity to the environmental limitation functions the selection of environmental limitation function clearly has an effect on model output evident by the differences in the steady state tss values produced each time an environmental limitation function was changed figs 5 9 our goals are to describe how each element of the filtration rate formulation that was isolated for affects model output compare the elements to identify the greatest sources of sensitivity and explain conceptually how the structure of the filtration formulation contributes to model sensitivity there is little to suggest that the selection of ƒ t function contributes to model output beyond what a simple comparison of the functions themselves would predict by considering just t 6 and t 15 the expectation is for equal output at 0 and 27 c and a divergent bell shaped response with t 6 producing similar but relatively lower steady state concentrations the presence of this direct correlation between ƒ t and the model response to temperature is important because it suggests that the ƒ t functions are properly serving their purpose which is to represent different interpretations of how oyster filtration responds to temperature there is no obvious additional sensitivity to ƒ t when the numerical model is implemented that causes the response to temperature to be much different from the intended shape described by ƒ t with the ƒ s functions we also find that much of the response of steady state tss to salinity is explained by the shape of the ƒ s functions seen with the overall negative response of tss to salinity the discontinuous jump at 5 psu with s pw and the hyperbolic tangent shape with s tan however with s lin and s pw the response of steady state tss to salinity is non linear between 5 and 12 psu initially we considered the possibility that this non linear response was the result of salinity changes affecting the biological processes that determine oss concentration however iss responds nonlinearly to salinity between 5 and 12 psu as shown in fig 10 because iss is unaffected by biological processes other than filtration observing this response in the iss confirms that the filtration is responding non linearly to salinity despite utilizing a linear ƒ s function one possible explanation is that as the filtration rate changes due to ƒ s the resulting change in internal tss feeds back through the ƒ tss function to further adjust the filtration rate which causes the overall response to differ from that expected from ƒ s alone in addition it is possible that the impacts of the linear f s function are being combined with the dampening effect of iss inflow as the concentration drops leading to a non linear response a similar phenomenon is observed with how oyster density affects model response to salinity and temperature where the af values for the ƒ t and ƒ s functions increase with oyster density the oyster density is just a scaling factor for the filtration rate so if all else is constant one expects the filtration to scale directly according to the oyster density however if this were the case the af values would be relatively equal at all oyster densities increasing oyster density causes the differences between the limitation functions to produce larger differences in internal tss and increased disagreement in internal tss results in further divergence of ƒ tss the larger overall filtration with increasing oyster density magnifies the observed differences between the environmental limitation functions because the secondary influence from the feedback with ƒ tss is amplified by increased differences in internal tss concentration model filtration responds non linearly to any change in its formulation because changes in tss feed back into changes in the filtration rate through the presence of ƒ tss any change to the filtration rate whether due to ƒ t ƒ s oyster density or another source yields a different internal tss concentration which can in turn adjust the magnitude of ƒ tss this results in heightened sensitivity to the ƒ tss function not only in the response of model filtration to tss but also because the definition of the ƒ tss function affects how the filtration responds to all other factors the af values for ƒ tss are much larger than those of ƒ s and ƒ t exceeding 4 5 times that of the ƒ t functions and 6 times that of the ƒ s functions at 100 m 2 oyster density also we observe wide ranges of model outputs where some ƒ tss functions produce tss values over an order of magnitude larger than others at the same forcing conditions fig 7 the responses of oss and nh4 also exhibit these large differences in model output over the same forcing ranges as the responses of tss figs 7 9 with nh4 the differences in model output between ƒ tss functions were even higher in many cases observing such a high variation in nh4 further highlights the importance of understanding the source of this sensitivity to ƒ tss because even though nh4 is not directly connected to filtration in the model equations the ƒ tss function still impacts it significantly by influencing the state variables comprising tss large sensitivities and similarly differing responses to ƒ tss were also observed with every state variable but have not been included to avoid redundancy however it is clear that the impact ƒ tss has on p z ds dl and iss which are the components of tss translates through model processes to the other state variables such as nh4 the observed sensitivity to the ƒ tss function is extreme especially considering that the different ƒ tss functions have been derived to represent the same process and are all at least in part based on the same data from jordan 1987 furthermore over the range of 50 100 mg l 1 of forced boundary tss in several cases the af values were larger than the overall af this shows that this major variation in model output does not rely on extreme forcing conditions as these concentrations although relatively large are much more consistently observed in the chesapeake bay region than tss concentrations of 100 mg l 1 and larger stumpf 1988 north et al 2004 fulford et al 2007 ehrich and harris 2015 compared the tss log and tss 01 functions directly without running model simulations and discussed the presence of variability at tss concentrations above 25 mg l 1 however we have observed higher than expected sensitivity of the model output to ƒ tss because of the feedback between tss concentration and ƒ tss which was not previously observed as it only manifests in dynamic model simulations 4 2 explanation of feedback between tss and filtration the goal of this study is to provide insight that can further improve methods of modeling oyster filtration in order to effectively do that it is not sufficient to only show the presence of model sensitivity we must also identify its source and explain conceptually why it is present beyond just simply identifying that tss is both a result and driver of filtration we have also found that this feedback causes the model to tend towards divergent types of steady state equilibrium fig 7 in the following we use examples from model outputs and theoretical exercises to explain not only the mechanics of the feedback itself but these different equilibrium states and what they mean for model sensitivity if at any timestep within the model the filtration rate is large enough that the internal tss concentration declines tss will continue to decrease until equilibrium is reached usually when the filtration rate is also reduced looking at the shape of each ƒ tss function the filtration rate does not decrease with lowering tss concentration until relatively low values for each function 5 mg l 1 for tss 01 tss log and tss 02 20 mg l 1 for tss con conversely if filtration rate is such that the internal tss is increasing equilibrium is reached when the internal concentration reaches sufficiently close to the boundary forcing this is because for all ƒ tss the filtration rate only becomes weaker with higher tss concentration above 20 mg l 1 and so filtration cannot increase to drive down the internal concentration these are two discrete states that the model can settle into the first we call filtration dominated equilibrium and it is characterized by a steady state with a low internal tss concentration and equilibrium that is found between the filtration and boundary exchange because the rate of loss due to sinking is proportional to the internal concentration the effect of sinking is negligible compared to filtration and boundary exchange the second is boundary dominated equilibrium and is characterized by steady state with an internal tss concentration similar to the boundary exchange concentration and equilibrium that is found between boundary exchange and sinking with negligible filtration due to the decrease in ƒ tss at higher tss concentrations most of the model runs in this study reached equilibrium in one of these 2 states however we did observe a third state an intermediate equilibrium characterized by sinking filtration and boundary exchange all being of the same order of magnitude for all 3 types of equilibrium steady state is reached when the effects of filtration sinking and boundary exchange sum to zero however the different equilibrium states are caused by different relative magnitudes in these effects examples of which are shown in fig 11 the results of the sensitivity tests can be put in the context of these equilibrium states and have been classified as such in fig 7 model outputs agree between ƒ tss functions when they are of the same type of equilibrium such as between tss con and tss 02 for much of the forced range of tss or between all functions at 1 m 2 oyster density fig 7 output tss varies greatly when the model reaches different types of equilibrium as can be seen when tss log and tss 01 are compared at larger oyster densities to tss con and tss 02 which switch to a boundary dominated equilibrium at much lower forced concentrations the disagreement between ƒ tss functions in the tss concentrations where their values are zero is a major contributor to the variation in which equilibrium type is reached if ƒ tss equals zero the model will necessarily reach a boundary dominated equilibrium because multiplying the other components of filtration rate by zero yields no filtration eq 1 tss 02 is zero above 25 mg l 1 tss con approaches zero at around 45 mg l 1 and tss 01 is zero above 100 mg l 1 and tss log is never equal to zero fig 3 the point where the forced tss is high enough to clear this threshold can be observed by sudden piecewise changes into boundary dominated equilibrium and occurs at higher values for the ƒ tss functions with a higher threshold fig 7 4 3 relevance of oyster density at higher oyster densities the additional scaling of the filtration means that a lower ƒ tss value is sufficient for a filtration dominated equilibrium this can be observed with the tss 01 function where increasing the oyster density from 50 to 100 m 2 extends the range of forced tss over which it produces a filtration dominated equilibrium at 1 m 2 oyster density the overall filtration is always too small to produce any state other than boundary dominated at 10 m 2 the overall filtration is never sufficient to produce a filtration dominated state this is an important result as it again highlights an unexpected sensitivity that results from the feedback between tss and ƒ tss the oyster density parameter is constructed as a simple scaling factor of filtration but by changing the overall capacity for filtration it affects the states of equilibrium that the model is able to reach 4 4 limitations of the approach finally it should be emphasized again that this idealized 0 dimensional steady state approach was employed for simplicity and to increase the interpretability of the results the filtration dynamics revealed by this approach will not necessarily be fully realized in a 3 dimensional 3 d time dependent hydrodynamic model with currents mixing and stratification a more realistic 3 d framework with tide and wind driven variability will tend to prevent achievement of a steady state because for example tss concentrations will most likely vary substantially in both space and time in addition the composition relative amount of p z d and iss of tss will impact the shape of the f tss curves because bivalves will adjust their feeding rate in response to food quality and local conditions e g iglesias et al 1996 these kinds of behavioral responses could also significantly alter the effects of the different filtration rate functions the impacts of all of these complexities can only be assessed by running a biogeochemical oyster filtration model in a 3 d time dependent framework with currents mixing stratification and more realistic feeding behavior it is important to remember that the purpose of this model is not to accurately predict biogeochemical processes in a specific location rather we have used it to highlight how these different limitation functions lead to interesting model behavior that has not been previously described in order to inform future efforts along these lines the logical next step in this research is to assess to what extent the filtration dynamics that are observed in 0 d are manifested in a more realistic simulation and to further investigate what functions provide the most accurate predictions of oyster behaviors and ecosystem services 5 conclusion by running model simulations with the environmental limitation functions used in existing oyster modeling studies namely cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 and ehrich and harris 2015 we have shown how the selection of each environmental limitation function can impact the results of a water quality model through quantifying the differences in model output tss we have identified that model response is most sensitive to the ƒ tss functions the observed differences in steady state tss between them are far more than expected from the functions themselves due to their ability to force the model into different discrete states of steady state equilibrium with the ƒ t and ƒ s functions differences in the model output between environmental limitation functions share the overall shape described by their respective functions except that the feedback of tss on to ƒ tss causes some non linear behavior previous reviews of oyster filtration environmental limitation functions that have not conducted sensitivity tests using dynamic model simulations such as ehrich and harris 2015 could not identify this non linear response to ƒ s or the high sensitivity to the selection of the ƒ tss function because these responses only manifest when the model equations are combined and solved numerically the formulation for filtration used in this study where each environmental limitation function is multiplied by a maximum filtration rate has been the standard parameterization for filtration in chesapeake bay region oyster modeling cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 ehrich and harris 2015 these modeling studies have made selections on how to represent ƒ tss based on various experimental findings and reviews including loosanoff 1952 jordan 1987 newell and langdon 1996 and shumway 1996 among others although the underlying justification is well founded for how these equations are derived from these experimental studies more consideration is needed as to whether the type of behavior we have observed in this study is desired we do not contend that any of the model outputs we produced more accurately agree with the real behavior of oyster populations than any other but we have clearly shown that what may be considered small changes between different functions completely change how a model behaves in a dynamic simulation which is a concern when thinking about reliability and comparing different models to each other we want to emphasize however that we are not claiming that existing modeling efforts are inconsistent to the level observed in this study as described in 4 4 we do not consider many effects that are present in 3 d estuarine models that would likely dampen the sensitivities observed here also we observed more variations in filtration response when forced tss reached a higher level as seen in fig 7 and by comparing the af values of 50 100 mg l 1 with those of 0 50 mg l 1 in table 3 tss concentrations in our study area and in many other estuarine environments are more typically in the lower 0 50 mg l 1 range where these major differences in filtration response between the different functions do not arise with only occasional major increases during high flow events stumpf 1988 north et al 2004 fulford et al 2007 nonetheless there is always feedback between tss and oyster filtration which is why we suggest that it should be addressed by any future modeling efforts that implement similar parameterizations to the ones discussed in this study we have two recommendations for future oyster modeling efforts with regard to choosing how to represent filtration first if filtration rate is calculated by multiplying environmental limitation functions we recommend using a continuous ƒ tss function like the one derived in this study tss con a continuous function allows steady state equilibrium to be reached at any ƒ tss value between zero and one whereas a discontinuous function is restricted to the ƒ tss magnitudes of its discrete parts using a continuous function allows for a smoother response and the output is not forced to settle on a constant value over a range of forcing conditions second future efforts should consider developing a new parameterization of the filtration that considers the interaction of parameters in its development environmental limitation functions have been selected to reproduce an observed response of oyster filtration to environmental conditions but due to their interaction and the feedback between ƒ tss and tss the intended response of each function is not necessarily translated to model behavior perhaps the development of a single filtration rate function of multiple variables would allow for a more robust parameterization because in its development the interactions of parameters are explicitly included jordan 1987 attempted something similar by fitting a function of biodeposition with respect to temperature and tss concentration to his experimental data however the multiplication of separate limitation functions is not theoretically unsound as it combines the effects of multiple parameters but the interaction of the functions and their execution in model simulations should be considered when they are developed a non spatial model like the one used in this study could be used for testing different potential formulations in order to confirm the intended response to the environmental conditions manifests in the model execution and would be efficient due to the very fast run times by developing the parameterization of filtration in the anticipation of effects from feedback future studies should be able to reduce uncertainty that currently results from the use of different environmental limitation functions although the focus of this paper is on oysters the same type of feedback might be observed in any model where a parameter is both a driver and target of a process potential examples of this include other species of bivalves such as mytilus edulis blue mussel which have been modeled to interact with plankton and seston in a similar way to oysters dowd 1997 and phytoplankton concentration which both impacts and is affected by light availability one must consider however that this type of formulation does not necessarily mean extreme sensitivity a major component of the observed sensitivity in this study was due to the divergence of internal tss to two opposing extreme equilibriums which was caused not just by the feedback of tss with ƒ tss but the shape of the ƒ tss functions much of the underlying mathematical theory behind the type of non linear model behavior discussed in this study has been explained by may 1976 who analyzed simple numerical models generally and highlighted the potential for discrete states and chaotic behavior in them this study highlights the potential for sensitivity in numerical models with non linear differential equations by identifying and describing sensitivities to the formulation of oyster filtration in a biogeochemical model we discuss how these findings affect our understanding

25059,oysters directly impact water quality through filter feeding and have been extensively studied due to the potential ecological benefits of population restoration numerical models have been developed that simulate the environmental impact of oysters on estimating current water quality conditions and evaluating prospective restoration strategies accurately representing oyster filtration in these models is essential to their value as management tools however the formulation of filtration in response to environmental variables differs between models here we compare different formulations for filtration for the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica from several studies cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 ehrich and harris 2015 which use functions of temperature salinity and suspended solids concentration tss to limit filtration rate using outputs from a water quality model with controlled forcing conditions we investigated how sensitive model output can be to the environmental limitation functions used we found that due to feedback between tss and filtration rate the choice of tss function caused significant variation in the model output beyond the scale of the differences in the functions themselves from our results and a theoretical understanding of model construction we discuss the implications for the accuracy of water quality models with oyster filtration and provide recommendations for future modeling efforts keywords eastern oyster bivalve filtration filtration rate model sensitivity model comparison feedback loops 1 introduction the eastern oyster crassostrea virginica is a sessile suspension feeding bivalve that has been labeled as an ecosystem engineer due to the diverse ecosystem services it provides including habitat formation transferring energy from plankton to the benthos and influencing water quality through filtration and denitrification gutierrez et al 2003 oysters utilize cilia on their gills to remove particulate matter from water that passes through the gills ingesting edible material and excreting the excess onto the substrate as pseudofeces newell and langdon 1996 ward et al 1994 this filter feeding can have a noticeable impact on water clarity and the concentration of suspended solids such as plankton and detritus newell 1988 newell et al 2005 oysters also form reefs through the accumulation of shell which serves as habitat for other organisms gutierrez et al 2003 in chesapeake bay maryland and virginia u s a the eastern oyster not only provides the aforementioned ecosystem services but also supports a historically important fishery north et al 2010 however it is estimated that the chesapeake oyster population has experienced reef loss over the last century of about 63 regionally and over 99 in some estuaries locally beck et al 2011 this population decline has been attributed primarily to a history of disease over harvesting and habitat degradation newell 1988 several government and nonprofit agencies in the chesapeake bay region view restoration of the oyster population as a high priority and are investing in various strategies to rebuild and protect oyster reefs chesapeake watershed agreement 2014 this investment in restoring oysters is motivated by several potential benefits primarily improved water quality through increased filtration and the revival of the commercial fishery harding and mann 2001 newell et al 2005 north et al 2010 oyster restoration is limited by funding and uncertainty about which restoration strategies are the most effective necessitating the use of numerical models as a low cost tool to efficiently evaluate potential strategies and estimate their environmental impacts north et al 2010 these models simulate the interaction between environmental conditions and oysters specifically the impact of filter feeding to provide quantitative estimates of changes in water quality wilberg et al 2013 cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 cerco and noel 2005 used a coupled hydrodynamic and eutrophication model with oyster filtration to examine the potential impact of various levels of increased oyster population on dissolved oxygen and water clarity fulford et al 2007 investigated the potential of restored oyster populations to aid in reducing the impact of eutrophication by simulating the extent of plankton biomass removal by oysters under various conditions north et al 2010 used numerical modeling to develop a decision support tool for identifying optimal oyster restoration locations in chesapeake bay considering many controlling factors and ecological benefits including improved water quality numerous models have been developed for a wide variety of applications that include functions that represent oyster filtration e g hofmann et al 1992 filgueira et al 2014 bacher et al 2012 ferreira et al 1997 kobayashi et al 1997 wilberg et al 2013 cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 many of these models use the same basic structure for how filtration is represented with a filtration rate defined as the volume of water filtered per unit time calculated from a maximum rate and environmental limitation functions of temperature salinity and total suspended solids concentration cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 and north et al 2010 model oyster filtration in chesapeake bay using this structure with the environmental limitation functions derived from observed rates of particle removal by oysters under changing water conditions specifically from the studies of loosanoff 1952 1958 jordan 1987 and newell and koch 2004 however despite being based primarily on the same observational data these modeling studies use different limitation functions due to differences in the interpretation of the data understanding how these functions impact model behavior differently is necessary in order to compare outputs between models and provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of these functions with respect to model accuracy ehrich and harris 2015 compared the formulations for filtration used in cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 and powell et al 1992 in order to investigate the differences between them and determine which aspects of each to use in future models they calculated filtration rate using the equations from each study over a range of temperature salinity and total suspended solids values from measurements in 2009 of the lower potomac river a chesapeake bay tributary by doing so they were able to observe differences in the calculated filtration rate between the different formulations they also conducted sensitivity tests on the different formulations isolating for temperature salinity or total suspended solids and observing how different levels of those environmental conditions affected the filtration rate they highlighted that these different models do provide distinctly different calculations of oyster filtration rates and based on their assessments recommended different components of each formulation for future modeling use although ehrich and harris 2015 directly compared the formulations of oyster filtration between multiple models and identified differences between them there is still a lack of understanding of how those differences affect the output of a model water quality models such as those used by cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 and north et al 2010 are complex and include non linear ordinary differential equations making it difficult to predict how a change in one aspect of the model construction will translate to variation in the output of the state variables without direct investigation of model simulations we lack an adequate understanding of the extent to which these different environmental limitation functions can impact model output and where potential sensitivities and weaknesses are in this paper we compare model outputs produced by different formulations for calculating of the filtration rate by controlling the numerical model and forcing conditions observed changes in model behavior can be directly attributed to the differences in filtration individual aspects of the filtration rate calculation are also each isolated for and examined individually so that when large sensitivity is observed in the model it can be further linked directly to its source this work will contribute to improving the development of oyster ecosystem models by identifying sources of sensitivity in the filtration that may only be observed in model execution 2 methods 2 1 formulating filtration and the environmental limitation functions our investigation focuses specifically on the formulations of filtration used in cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 and ehrich and harris 2015 in these studies filtration rate is calculated by multiplying a maximum filtration rate frmax by several environmental limitation functions that ramp between 0 and 1 eq 1 these functions represent the effects of temperature t salinity s and total suspended solids concentration tss on filtration rate fr 1 fr m3 day 1 frmax ƒ t ƒ s ƒ tss cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 and north et al 2010 use different combinations of the 3 types of environmental limitation functions the full description of each ƒ t ƒ s and ƒ tss function used and which studies they are implemented in can be found in table 1 and figs 1 3 in addition we have included the ƒ t function created by ehrich and harris 2015 and an original continuous ƒ tss function that we developed from work done by jordan 1987 jordan 1987 derived a function for biodeposition with respect to t and tss from multiple regression of observational data as justified therein filtration rate was estimated by dividing the rate of biodeposition by tss concentration we modified this function by setting a constant temperature of 27 c resulting in a function of only tss by dividing this new function by its maximum value we produced a function of tss with the same shape as the filtration rate curve but with a range of 0 to 1 to correct for asymptotic behavior in the function at low values of tss ƒ tss is defined to slope linearly below tss concentrations of 5 mg l a relationship also observed in jordan 1987 this function tss con was created to provide a continuous ƒ tss function to contrast with the existing ones tss 01 tss 02 and tss log which are all discontinuous but based at least in part on the observations of jordan 1987 2 2 model description 2 2 1 the biogeochemical model the biogeochemical model used in this study is based on the fennel et al 2006 model that has been modified to better represent estuarine processes brown et al 2013 feng et al 2015 wiggert et al 2017 the model tracks 8 state variables nitrate no3 ammonium nh4 phytoplankton p zooplankton z small and large detritus ds and dl dissolved organic nitrogen don and inorganic suspended solids iss fig 4 the 7 nitrogenous state variables are tracked as atoms of labile nitrogen mmoln m 3 whereas iss is tracked as mass mg l 1 the model is zero dimensional however basic physical processes are simulated using a formulation for a chemostat the model was built using r a language and environment for statistical computing r 3 4 0 the model numerically solves the 8 differential equations for each state variable to steady state using the package desolve soetaert and herman 2009 for conciseness only the oyster parameterizations salient modifications from fennel et al 2006 and formulations specific to the zero dimensional model are described below the full set of equations and constants is provided in the appendix 2 2 2 filtration within the model oyster filtration of suspended solids is modeled as a reduction in the concentrations of p z ds dl and iss the rate of change in internal concentration due to filtration x t is determined by the filtration rate fr the internal concentration x and the spatial volume v of the modeled region eq 2 2 x t 1 fr x v 1 other processes the filtration rate fr is calculated as described in section 2 1 and eq 1 frma x is calculated from the filtration rate of a single oyster frsingle the oyster density od and the bottom area a eq 3 3 frmax frsingle od a 4 frsingle 0 17 dtw 0 75 ehrich and harris 2015 5 dtw 0 000174 sl 2 06 jordan et al 2009 frsingle is derived from the dry tissue weight dtw in grams of a single oyster which is calculated from a given shell length sls 4 5 jordan et al 2009 ehrich and harris 2015 we used a shell length of 76 mm because that is the minimal size for legal harvest and has been used previously as the shell length for modeled oysters north et al 2010 2 2 3 dissolved organic matter the biogeochemical model includes a labile dissolved organic nitrogen don state variable parameterized using the same relationships exercised in brown et al 2013 and wiggert et al 2017 2 2 4 suspended solids an iss state variable is required to properly represent tss in the model which is of key importance to the oyster filtration the iss variable does not participate in any of the biogeochemical processes but as a component of tss it influences light attenuation iss is controlled solely by the rates of sinking boundary exchange and filtration the organic suspended solids oss mg l 1 were calculated from p z ds and dl which as described in 2 2 1 are in units of mmol n m 3 cerco et al 2013 estimates that total mass is 2 5 times that of carbon which can be estimated from mmol n by using the redfield ratio 106 16 to get mmol c and multiplying by the atomic weight of carbon 12 once p z ds and dl are summed and converted to a mass concentration mg l 1 they are added to iss to give tss eq 6 oss in mg l 1 is equal to the section of eq 6 within the brackets 6 tss mg l 1 iss 2 5 p z ds dl 106 16 12 1 000 2 2 5 light attenuation and chlorophyll the diffuse attenuation coefficient kd is calculated from tss chlorophyll concentration chl and salinity using a chesapeake bay specific relationship developed by xu et al 2005 eq 7 7 kd 1 80 0 0044 chl 0 0673 tss 0 096 s s 15 kd 1 17 0 024 chl 0 006 tss 0 0225 s s 15 salinity is used as a proxy for colored dissolved organic matter other model applications of this relationship can be found in xu and hood 2006 brown et al 2013 and wiggert et al 2017 kd in turn effects the primary productivity of phytoplankton by regulating the amount of light in the water column as described in xu and hood 2006 and feng et al 2015 with its effect contained in the calculation of the uptake rate of no3 and nh4 this is fully represented in the appendix chlorophyll concentration μg l 1 is calculated from the phytoplankton concentration p using the redfield ratio molc moln 106 16 the atomic mass of carbon and assuming a 50 1 mass ratio of carbon to chlorophyll cerco and noel 2004 eq 8 8 chl p 106 16 12 1 50 2 2 6 sediment remineralization the biogeochemical model in fennel et al 2006 assumes that the water column is fully aerobic the mesohaline chesapeake bay experiences hypoxic and anoxic conditions during the summer however this model was run under conditions based on a shallow estuarine environment in which the assumption of a fully aerobic water column is valid sediment remineralization is done using the biogeochemical bottom boundary condition from fennel et al 2006 which assumes that 25 of particulate nitrogen that reaches the sediment is instantaneously remineralized to ammonium nh4 the remaining 75 is converted to dinitrogen gas and is therefore lost from the system this estimate is based on the assumption that the sediment is partially anaerobic with some remineralization 14 occurring through coupled nitrification denitrification and the remainder 86 through direct oxidation 2 2 7 physical parameters the model is zero dimensional without a spatial grid this simplified style of model allows for repeatable runs of the biogeochemical state variables to steady state and fast runtimes these characteristics support the objective of this study which is to compare the effect different environmental limitation functions have on model behavior not provide the most accurate realistic simulations possible of a specific study site although zero dimensional spatial dimensions of the model space are specified which influence the rates of boundary exchange and the impacts of sinking and filtration because this study focused on oyster models in the chesapeake bay region spatial dimensions were chosen based on the harris creek maryland usa tributary where current restoration efforts are focused the bottom area parameter a was set to be 24 42 km2 estimated from gis data wazniak et al unpublished the depth d was chosen as 3 m based on general knowledge of regional water depths 2 2 7 1 boundary exchange the effect of transport in and out of the model domain is simulated using a forced boundary concentration b and a boundary exchange rate h the change in internal concentration to a state variable x due to boundary exchange depends on the difference between the internal concentration and the boundary concentration and the exchange rate eq 9 9 x t h b x other processes if the internal concentration x is equal to the forced boundary concentration b there is no effect from boundary exchange if internal concentration exceeds boundary concentration the boundary exchange dilutes the internal concentration if internal concentration is less than boundary concentration the boundary exchange raises the internal concentration boundary exchange effects all state variables with the same exchange rate however at a given time each state variable may have a different rate of change depending on the internal concentration of that state variable the exchange rate h was determined by taking the inverse of an estimate of the flushing time tf of the harris creek maryland usa tributary this flushing time was estimated with the tidal prism method using gis and bathymetry data sets to calculate the area and volume of the harris creek tributary wazniak et al unpublished tf was determined to be 4 26 days translating to an exchange rate of 0 235 day 1 2 2 7 2 vertical sinking rates the sinking velocity of small particles ws was set at 0 1 m d 1 and affects p z and ds the sinking velocity of larger particles wl was set at 1 m d 1 and affects dl and iss the other state variables are dissolved and therefore unaffected by sinking these sinking velocities are the same as those used in fennel et al 2006 for ds and dl the change in internal concentration x of a state variable due to sinking is determined by the relevant sinking rate w and the depth d eq 10 10 x t 1 w x d 1 other processes 2 3 sensitivity analysis 2 3 1 base run we established a base parameterization and set of forcing conditions table 2 that were held consistent between model runs except for the environmental limitation function select boundary exchange forcing concentrations b and oyster density which were changed selectively as independent variables t and s were set at 27 c and 13 psu respectively because all of the ƒ t and ƒ s functions equal 1 at these values therefore the base run is not dependent on environmental limitation functions for temperature and salinity however because tss concentration varies due to processes within the model environment a base ƒ tss function had to be chosen for the base run we selected tss con because it is continuous oyster density od was set to 50 m 2 within ranges observed in the chesapeake bay oyster population estimation 2 2 http www vims edu research units labgroups molluscan ecology archive cbope index php each state variable was forced by its boundary exchange concentration b the base run b value for each state variable except for iss was defined with measurements from the chesapeake bay program station et5 2 summer 2001 average detritus was evenly split between small and large ds and dl iss was set to 17 08 mg l 1 so that tss equaled 20 mg l 1 eq 6 and therefore all ƒ tss functions equaled 1 2 3 2 sensitivity tests of the ƒ t functions to look at the response of the model to the two temperature functions model runs were conducted forcing temperature over a range of 0 35 c representing typical seasonal minimum and maximum temperatures in chesapeake bay for each temperature the model was run out to steady state and the steady values of each state variable were recorded then the ƒ t function was changed and steady state model outputs were again recorded for repeated runs forced over the same range of temperature for each model run model forcing conditions other than t and ƒ t were held consistent with the base run 2 3 3 sensitivity tests of the ƒ s functions the same method as described in 2 3 2 was applied to the ƒ s functions running the model out to steady state at salinities over the range of 2 14 psu this range of salinity was chosen because outside of that range the ƒ s functions behave identically the model was run over this salinity range 3 times once for each ƒ s function this resulted in steady state model responses to each ƒ s function over a range of salinity values for each model run model forcing conditions other than s and ƒ s were held consistent with the base run 2 3 4 sensitivity tests of the ƒ tss functions similarly to 2 3 2 and 2 3 3 steady state model outputs were recorded for model runs forced with each ƒ tss function over a range of boundary exchange tss concentrations from 0 to 250 mg l 1 this range of tss was chosen to extend up to a high extreme but be within a range of observed concentrations stumpf 1988 describes observed tss concentrations of 200 mg l 1 as highly turbid water during high flow events but also observed values several times larger in some locations during extreme flooding events tss was forced for each run by modifying the bx forcing values for each particulate state variable p z ds dl iss using the following method for tss forcing 2 92 mg l 1 the base run oss concentration tss was forced by changing biss while bp bz bds and bdl were held constant as in the base run this method was chosen for consistency in the initial conditions of the biogeochemical components between simulations and the assumption that increased levels of tss are primarily a result of increased levels of iss for tss forcing 2 92 mg l 1 biss 0 and bp bz bds and bdl were reduced so that the total oss forcing concentration was equal to the desired tss forcing and the relative magnitude of their concentrations remained constant 2 3 5 varying the oyster density to observe the effect of oyster density on the model response to the different environmental limitation functions the model runs forced as described in sections 2 3 2 2 3 4 were repeated at oyster densities of 1 10 and 100 m 2 chosen to represent a range of possible densities from current to historical populations this provided sets of model results for each environmental limitation function over a range of each parameter and at multiple oyster densities 2 3 6 quantitative analysis to quantify the difference in model output caused by two different environmental limitation functions we utilized a metric adapted from the reliability index called the average factor af leggett and williams 1981 the af is the average magnitude by which two sets of model outputs are different multiplicatively and is not dependent on having an observed or correct set of values an af of 2 0 means that on average one set of model output values is twice as large as the other the af is calculated by taking the log of the ratio between two output values and squaring it which gives the same positive number regardless of which value is in the denominator or numerator of the initial ratio the average value of these numbers is then calculated by integrating over the range of the independent variable and dividing by that range finally the square root is taken and the number is exponentiated to normalize it back to the magnitude of the ratio between two values 11 a f e x p 1 x n x 1 i 1 n log d 1 i d 2 i 2 x i x i 1 eq 11 shows the calculation of the af where d1 and d2 are two model output values with the same independent variable value xi because our model results were discrete values at given but sometimes unevenly spaced values for t s and tss the integration was done using a riemann sum with the summation numbered subscripts and expressions containing x all components of integration and getting the average value we calculated the average factor between sets of model results with different environmental limitation functions but for the same relevant environmental parameter t s tss and oyster density therefore any observed differences could be directly attributed to just the change in the environmental limitation function for example the af was calculated between the model outputs with the t 6 and t 15 ƒ t functions over the range of temperature values from 0 to 35 c and at 50 m 2 oyster density as the two sets of model runs only differ by one environmental limitation function of the same type 3 results 3 1 response of steady state tss to environmental limitation functions 3 1 1 ƒ t functions for both ƒ t functions the model tss decreased with increasing temperature to 27 c and increased with temperature above 27 c fig 5 the shape of the response exhibits the bell like curve of both ƒ t functions but inverted consistent with our expectation that increases in the filtration rate result in lower steady state tss concentrations t 6 produced lower steady state tss concentrations than t 15 except at 27 c where they are equal this is because the t 6 ƒ t function has a larger magnitude than the t 15 function except at 27 c where they are equal fig 1 increased oyster density also resulted in lower overall steady state tss concentrations for both ƒ t functions due to the higher filtration rates fig 5 the two different ƒ t functions produced steady state tss concentrations different from each other by an af of 1 01 1 12 1 33 and 1 49 over the range of forced temperatures from 0 to 35 c at oyster densities of 1 10 50 and 100 m 2 respectively 3 1 2 ƒ s functions internal tss decreased with increased salinity fig 6 due to the positive correlation between salinity and ƒ s fig 2 the response of steady state tss to salinity exhibited unique behaviors for each ƒ s function specifically the discontinuous drop in tss at 5 psu observed with s pw and the hyperbolic tangent shaped response observed with s tan the s pw and s lin functions are linear between 4 and 12 psu however the response of tss to salinity for both of these functions was non linear in the same salinity range the differences in steady state tss caused by using the different ƒ s functions are quantitatively summarized as follows between s lin and s tan steady state tss differed by an af of 1 00 1 03 1 06 and 1 08 at 1 10 50 and 100 m 2 oyster densities respectively between s lin and s pw 1 00 1 03 1 07 and 1 09 between s pw and s tan 1 01 1 04 1 09 and 1 13 these af values were calculated over the range of forced salinity values from 2 to 14 psu 3 1 3 ƒ tss functions at 1 m 2 oyster density the steady state tss increased linearly with boundary exchange tss with little difference between the ƒ tss functions fig 7 at 50 and 100 m 2 oyster densities tss 02 and tss con exhibited the same linear increase when exchange tss exceeded 55 mg l 1 for tss 02 and approximately 110 mg l 1 for tss con however tss log produced much lower steady state concentrations with little increase even at very large boundary concentrations with tss 01 steady state tss responded discontinuously with increasing exchange concentration changing from a low flat response similar to that of tss log to an intermediate linear trend to the same linear trend exhibited by tss 02 and tss con the discontinuous changes in steady state tss caused by tss 01 and tss 02 are expected as these ƒ tss functions are themselves discontinuous figs 3 7 however tss con which is continuous also caused a discontinuous jump in the model response the differences in steady state tss caused by using the different ƒ tss functions are quantitatively summarized as follows between tss 01 and tss 02 steady state tss differed by an af of 1 02 1 31 3 22 and 6 34 at 1 10 50 and 100 m 2 oyster densities od respectively between tss 02 and tss log 1 06 1 84 5 63 and 8 91 between tss con and tss 02 1 04 1 36 1 81 and 2 06 between tss con and tss 01 1 04 1 31 2 37 and 5 00 between tss con and tss log 1 07 1 74 4 67 and 7 10 between tss log and tss 01 1 05 1 51 2 42 and 2 17 these af values were calculated over the range of forced boundary exchange tss from 0 to 250 mg l 1 the af value for steady state tss was also calculated between each ƒ tss function for an od of 50 m 2 over two smaller ranges of forced boundary tss between 0 and 50 mg l 1 the af values were 1 61 1 55 1 32 1 31 1 21 and 1 19 between tss con and tss 02 tss con and tss log tss con and tss 01 tss 02 and tss 01 tss log and tss 01 tss 02 and tss log respectively between 50 and 100 mg l 1 the af values were 3 22 2 12 1 92 5 91 1 15 and 6 37 between the same pairs of ƒ tss functions respectively this change between the two ranges of forced tss further highlights the discrete jump in behavior observed in this range on fig 7 the af values for steady state tss between the ƒ tss functions and these different ranges of forced boundary tss are summarized in table 3 3 2 response of steady state oss and nh4 to ƒ tss functions 3 2 1 oss all 4 ƒ tss functions caused an immediate increase in oss concentration up to about 2 mg l 1 at very low forced tss values and then a negative relationship with forced tss except for a few discrete increases with tss 02 tss 01 and tss con fig 8 tss 02 and tss con increased up over 3 mg l 1 at approximately 55 and 110 mg l 1 forced tss respectively tss log caused oss to level out at approximately 0 5 mg l 1 the response of oss with tss 01 was consistent with that of tss log below 130 mg l 1 and that of tss 02 and tss con above 238 mg l 1 in between it exhibited an intermediate oss response with concentrations between 1 2 and 1 4 mg l 1 these differences in steady state oss between the different ƒ tss functions are quantitatively summarized as follows between tss con and tss 02 steady state oss differed by an af of 1 81 tss con and tss log 4 52 tss con and tss 01 2 42 tss 02 and tss 01 3 29 tss log and tss 01 2 29 tss 02 and tss log 5 48 these af values were calculated over the range of forced boundary exchange tss from 0 to 250 mg l 1 and oyster density of 50 m 2 3 2 2 nh4 all 4 ƒ tss functions produced low steady state nh4 concentrations and a negative response with forced tss up to 55 mg l 1 forcing concentration fig 9 with tss 02 and tss con nh4 concentrations had a sloping increase to over 3 mmoln m 3 starting at 55 and 110 mg l 1 forced tss respectively tss log never produced steady state nh4 that exceeded 0 125 mmoln m 3 the response of nh4 with tss 01 was consistent with that of tss log below 130 mg l 1 and that of tss 02 and tss con above 238 mg l 1 in between it exhibited an intermediate response with concentrations between 0 25 and 0 6 mmoln m 3 the differences in the steady state nh4 caused by using the different ƒ tss functions are quantitatively summarized as follows between tss con and tss 02 steady state nh4 differed by an af of 2 54 tss con and tss log 14 16 tss con and tss 01 4 55 tss 02 and tss 01 6 12 tss log and tss 01 4 16 tss 02 and tss log 16 38 these af values were calculated over the range of forced boundary exchange tss from 0 to 250 mg l 1 and at an oyster density of 50 m 2 4 discussion 4 1 sensitivity to the environmental limitation functions the selection of environmental limitation function clearly has an effect on model output evident by the differences in the steady state tss values produced each time an environmental limitation function was changed figs 5 9 our goals are to describe how each element of the filtration rate formulation that was isolated for affects model output compare the elements to identify the greatest sources of sensitivity and explain conceptually how the structure of the filtration formulation contributes to model sensitivity there is little to suggest that the selection of ƒ t function contributes to model output beyond what a simple comparison of the functions themselves would predict by considering just t 6 and t 15 the expectation is for equal output at 0 and 27 c and a divergent bell shaped response with t 6 producing similar but relatively lower steady state concentrations the presence of this direct correlation between ƒ t and the model response to temperature is important because it suggests that the ƒ t functions are properly serving their purpose which is to represent different interpretations of how oyster filtration responds to temperature there is no obvious additional sensitivity to ƒ t when the numerical model is implemented that causes the response to temperature to be much different from the intended shape described by ƒ t with the ƒ s functions we also find that much of the response of steady state tss to salinity is explained by the shape of the ƒ s functions seen with the overall negative response of tss to salinity the discontinuous jump at 5 psu with s pw and the hyperbolic tangent shape with s tan however with s lin and s pw the response of steady state tss to salinity is non linear between 5 and 12 psu initially we considered the possibility that this non linear response was the result of salinity changes affecting the biological processes that determine oss concentration however iss responds nonlinearly to salinity between 5 and 12 psu as shown in fig 10 because iss is unaffected by biological processes other than filtration observing this response in the iss confirms that the filtration is responding non linearly to salinity despite utilizing a linear ƒ s function one possible explanation is that as the filtration rate changes due to ƒ s the resulting change in internal tss feeds back through the ƒ tss function to further adjust the filtration rate which causes the overall response to differ from that expected from ƒ s alone in addition it is possible that the impacts of the linear f s function are being combined with the dampening effect of iss inflow as the concentration drops leading to a non linear response a similar phenomenon is observed with how oyster density affects model response to salinity and temperature where the af values for the ƒ t and ƒ s functions increase with oyster density the oyster density is just a scaling factor for the filtration rate so if all else is constant one expects the filtration to scale directly according to the oyster density however if this were the case the af values would be relatively equal at all oyster densities increasing oyster density causes the differences between the limitation functions to produce larger differences in internal tss and increased disagreement in internal tss results in further divergence of ƒ tss the larger overall filtration with increasing oyster density magnifies the observed differences between the environmental limitation functions because the secondary influence from the feedback with ƒ tss is amplified by increased differences in internal tss concentration model filtration responds non linearly to any change in its formulation because changes in tss feed back into changes in the filtration rate through the presence of ƒ tss any change to the filtration rate whether due to ƒ t ƒ s oyster density or another source yields a different internal tss concentration which can in turn adjust the magnitude of ƒ tss this results in heightened sensitivity to the ƒ tss function not only in the response of model filtration to tss but also because the definition of the ƒ tss function affects how the filtration responds to all other factors the af values for ƒ tss are much larger than those of ƒ s and ƒ t exceeding 4 5 times that of the ƒ t functions and 6 times that of the ƒ s functions at 100 m 2 oyster density also we observe wide ranges of model outputs where some ƒ tss functions produce tss values over an order of magnitude larger than others at the same forcing conditions fig 7 the responses of oss and nh4 also exhibit these large differences in model output over the same forcing ranges as the responses of tss figs 7 9 with nh4 the differences in model output between ƒ tss functions were even higher in many cases observing such a high variation in nh4 further highlights the importance of understanding the source of this sensitivity to ƒ tss because even though nh4 is not directly connected to filtration in the model equations the ƒ tss function still impacts it significantly by influencing the state variables comprising tss large sensitivities and similarly differing responses to ƒ tss were also observed with every state variable but have not been included to avoid redundancy however it is clear that the impact ƒ tss has on p z ds dl and iss which are the components of tss translates through model processes to the other state variables such as nh4 the observed sensitivity to the ƒ tss function is extreme especially considering that the different ƒ tss functions have been derived to represent the same process and are all at least in part based on the same data from jordan 1987 furthermore over the range of 50 100 mg l 1 of forced boundary tss in several cases the af values were larger than the overall af this shows that this major variation in model output does not rely on extreme forcing conditions as these concentrations although relatively large are much more consistently observed in the chesapeake bay region than tss concentrations of 100 mg l 1 and larger stumpf 1988 north et al 2004 fulford et al 2007 ehrich and harris 2015 compared the tss log and tss 01 functions directly without running model simulations and discussed the presence of variability at tss concentrations above 25 mg l 1 however we have observed higher than expected sensitivity of the model output to ƒ tss because of the feedback between tss concentration and ƒ tss which was not previously observed as it only manifests in dynamic model simulations 4 2 explanation of feedback between tss and filtration the goal of this study is to provide insight that can further improve methods of modeling oyster filtration in order to effectively do that it is not sufficient to only show the presence of model sensitivity we must also identify its source and explain conceptually why it is present beyond just simply identifying that tss is both a result and driver of filtration we have also found that this feedback causes the model to tend towards divergent types of steady state equilibrium fig 7 in the following we use examples from model outputs and theoretical exercises to explain not only the mechanics of the feedback itself but these different equilibrium states and what they mean for model sensitivity if at any timestep within the model the filtration rate is large enough that the internal tss concentration declines tss will continue to decrease until equilibrium is reached usually when the filtration rate is also reduced looking at the shape of each ƒ tss function the filtration rate does not decrease with lowering tss concentration until relatively low values for each function 5 mg l 1 for tss 01 tss log and tss 02 20 mg l 1 for tss con conversely if filtration rate is such that the internal tss is increasing equilibrium is reached when the internal concentration reaches sufficiently close to the boundary forcing this is because for all ƒ tss the filtration rate only becomes weaker with higher tss concentration above 20 mg l 1 and so filtration cannot increase to drive down the internal concentration these are two discrete states that the model can settle into the first we call filtration dominated equilibrium and it is characterized by a steady state with a low internal tss concentration and equilibrium that is found between the filtration and boundary exchange because the rate of loss due to sinking is proportional to the internal concentration the effect of sinking is negligible compared to filtration and boundary exchange the second is boundary dominated equilibrium and is characterized by steady state with an internal tss concentration similar to the boundary exchange concentration and equilibrium that is found between boundary exchange and sinking with negligible filtration due to the decrease in ƒ tss at higher tss concentrations most of the model runs in this study reached equilibrium in one of these 2 states however we did observe a third state an intermediate equilibrium characterized by sinking filtration and boundary exchange all being of the same order of magnitude for all 3 types of equilibrium steady state is reached when the effects of filtration sinking and boundary exchange sum to zero however the different equilibrium states are caused by different relative magnitudes in these effects examples of which are shown in fig 11 the results of the sensitivity tests can be put in the context of these equilibrium states and have been classified as such in fig 7 model outputs agree between ƒ tss functions when they are of the same type of equilibrium such as between tss con and tss 02 for much of the forced range of tss or between all functions at 1 m 2 oyster density fig 7 output tss varies greatly when the model reaches different types of equilibrium as can be seen when tss log and tss 01 are compared at larger oyster densities to tss con and tss 02 which switch to a boundary dominated equilibrium at much lower forced concentrations the disagreement between ƒ tss functions in the tss concentrations where their values are zero is a major contributor to the variation in which equilibrium type is reached if ƒ tss equals zero the model will necessarily reach a boundary dominated equilibrium because multiplying the other components of filtration rate by zero yields no filtration eq 1 tss 02 is zero above 25 mg l 1 tss con approaches zero at around 45 mg l 1 and tss 01 is zero above 100 mg l 1 and tss log is never equal to zero fig 3 the point where the forced tss is high enough to clear this threshold can be observed by sudden piecewise changes into boundary dominated equilibrium and occurs at higher values for the ƒ tss functions with a higher threshold fig 7 4 3 relevance of oyster density at higher oyster densities the additional scaling of the filtration means that a lower ƒ tss value is sufficient for a filtration dominated equilibrium this can be observed with the tss 01 function where increasing the oyster density from 50 to 100 m 2 extends the range of forced tss over which it produces a filtration dominated equilibrium at 1 m 2 oyster density the overall filtration is always too small to produce any state other than boundary dominated at 10 m 2 the overall filtration is never sufficient to produce a filtration dominated state this is an important result as it again highlights an unexpected sensitivity that results from the feedback between tss and ƒ tss the oyster density parameter is constructed as a simple scaling factor of filtration but by changing the overall capacity for filtration it affects the states of equilibrium that the model is able to reach 4 4 limitations of the approach finally it should be emphasized again that this idealized 0 dimensional steady state approach was employed for simplicity and to increase the interpretability of the results the filtration dynamics revealed by this approach will not necessarily be fully realized in a 3 dimensional 3 d time dependent hydrodynamic model with currents mixing and stratification a more realistic 3 d framework with tide and wind driven variability will tend to prevent achievement of a steady state because for example tss concentrations will most likely vary substantially in both space and time in addition the composition relative amount of p z d and iss of tss will impact the shape of the f tss curves because bivalves will adjust their feeding rate in response to food quality and local conditions e g iglesias et al 1996 these kinds of behavioral responses could also significantly alter the effects of the different filtration rate functions the impacts of all of these complexities can only be assessed by running a biogeochemical oyster filtration model in a 3 d time dependent framework with currents mixing stratification and more realistic feeding behavior it is important to remember that the purpose of this model is not to accurately predict biogeochemical processes in a specific location rather we have used it to highlight how these different limitation functions lead to interesting model behavior that has not been previously described in order to inform future efforts along these lines the logical next step in this research is to assess to what extent the filtration dynamics that are observed in 0 d are manifested in a more realistic simulation and to further investigate what functions provide the most accurate predictions of oyster behaviors and ecosystem services 5 conclusion by running model simulations with the environmental limitation functions used in existing oyster modeling studies namely cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 and ehrich and harris 2015 we have shown how the selection of each environmental limitation function can impact the results of a water quality model through quantifying the differences in model output tss we have identified that model response is most sensitive to the ƒ tss functions the observed differences in steady state tss between them are far more than expected from the functions themselves due to their ability to force the model into different discrete states of steady state equilibrium with the ƒ t and ƒ s functions differences in the model output between environmental limitation functions share the overall shape described by their respective functions except that the feedback of tss on to ƒ tss causes some non linear behavior previous reviews of oyster filtration environmental limitation functions that have not conducted sensitivity tests using dynamic model simulations such as ehrich and harris 2015 could not identify this non linear response to ƒ s or the high sensitivity to the selection of the ƒ tss function because these responses only manifest when the model equations are combined and solved numerically the formulation for filtration used in this study where each environmental limitation function is multiplied by a maximum filtration rate has been the standard parameterization for filtration in chesapeake bay region oyster modeling cerco and noel 2005 fulford et al 2007 north et al 2010 ehrich and harris 2015 these modeling studies have made selections on how to represent ƒ tss based on various experimental findings and reviews including loosanoff 1952 jordan 1987 newell and langdon 1996 and shumway 1996 among others although the underlying justification is well founded for how these equations are derived from these experimental studies more consideration is needed as to whether the type of behavior we have observed in this study is desired we do not contend that any of the model outputs we produced more accurately agree with the real behavior of oyster populations than any other but we have clearly shown that what may be considered small changes between different functions completely change how a model behaves in a dynamic simulation which is a concern when thinking about reliability and comparing different models to each other we want to emphasize however that we are not claiming that existing modeling efforts are inconsistent to the level observed in this study as described in 4 4 we do not consider many effects that are present in 3 d estuarine models that would likely dampen the sensitivities observed here also we observed more variations in filtration response when forced tss reached a higher level as seen in fig 7 and by comparing the af values of 50 100 mg l 1 with those of 0 50 mg l 1 in table 3 tss concentrations in our study area and in many other estuarine environments are more typically in the lower 0 50 mg l 1 range where these major differences in filtration response between the different functions do not arise with only occasional major increases during high flow events stumpf 1988 north et al 2004 fulford et al 2007 nonetheless there is always feedback between tss and oyster filtration which is why we suggest that it should be addressed by any future modeling efforts that implement similar parameterizations to the ones discussed in this study we have two recommendations for future oyster modeling efforts with regard to choosing how to represent filtration first if filtration rate is calculated by multiplying environmental limitation functions we recommend using a continuous ƒ tss function like the one derived in this study tss con a continuous function allows steady state equilibrium to be reached at any ƒ tss value between zero and one whereas a discontinuous function is restricted to the ƒ tss magnitudes of its discrete parts using a continuous function allows for a smoother response and the output is not forced to settle on a constant value over a range of forcing conditions second future efforts should consider developing a new parameterization of the filtration that considers the interaction of parameters in its development environmental limitation functions have been selected to reproduce an observed response of oyster filtration to environmental conditions but due to their interaction and the feedback between ƒ tss and tss the intended response of each function is not necessarily translated to model behavior perhaps the development of a single filtration rate function of multiple variables would allow for a more robust parameterization because in its development the interactions of parameters are explicitly included jordan 1987 attempted something similar by fitting a function of biodeposition with respect to temperature and tss concentration to his experimental data however the multiplication of separate limitation functions is not theoretically unsound as it combines the effects of multiple parameters but the interaction of the functions and their execution in model simulations should be considered when they are developed a non spatial model like the one used in this study could be used for testing different potential formulations in order to confirm the intended response to the environmental conditions manifests in the model execution and would be efficient due to the very fast run times by developing the parameterization of filtration in the anticipation of effects from feedback future studies should be able to reduce uncertainty that currently results from the use of different environmental limitation functions although the focus of this paper is on oysters the same type of feedback might be observed in any model where a parameter is both a driver and target of a process potential examples of this include other species of bivalves such as mytilus edulis blue mussel which have been modeled to interact with plankton and seston in a similar way to oysters dowd 1997 and phytoplankton concentration which both impacts and is affected by light availability one must consider however that this type of formulation does not necessarily mean extreme sensitivity a major component of the observed sensitivity in this study was due to the divergence of internal tss to two opposing extreme equilibriums which was caused not just by the feedback of tss with ƒ tss but the shape of the ƒ tss functions much of the underlying mathematical theory behind the type of non linear model behavior discussed in this study has been explained by may 1976 who analyzed simple numerical models generally and highlighted the potential for discrete states and chaotic behavior in them this study highlights the potential for sensitivity in numerical models with non linear differential equations by identifying and describing sensitivities to the formulation of oyster filtration in a biogeochemical model we discuss how these findings affect our understanding of water quality models with oyster filtration and provide simple recommendations for future modeling efforts to account for these sensitivities acknowledgements we would like to thank elizabeth north
