16025,preserving human and environmental health requires anthropogenic pollutants to be biologically degradable depending on concentration both nutrients and pollutants induce and activate metabolic capacity in the endemic bacterial consortium which in turn aids their degradation knowledge on such acclimation is rarely implemented in risk assessment cost effectively as a result an accurate description of the mechanisms and kinetics of biodegradation remains problematic in this study we defined a yield effectivity comprising the effectiveness at which a pollutant substrate enhances its own degradation by inducing biomass cofactors involved therein our architecture for calculation represents the interplay between concentration and metabolism via both stoichiometric and thermodynamic concepts the calculus for yield effectivity is biochemically intuitive implicitly embeds co metabolism and distinguishes endogenic from exogenic substances reflecting various phenomena in biodegradation and bio transformation studies we combined data on half lives of pollutants nutrients in wastewater and surface water with transition state rate theory to obtain also experimental

vanbriesen 2002 westerhoff and van dam 1987 when the number of required metabolic steps needing maintenance increases the production of e1 x from s will be less effective in other words if the metabolic pathway is long energy loss accumulates along each step so that a lower effective yield η q 1 x y can be achieved mccarty 2007 fig 2 envisions stoichiometries to reflect path functions in thermodynamic quantities chen et al 2017 effective green and non effective gray pathways we hypothesized that η q 1 x y s can be captured predicted by combining elemental compositions of substrates s with those of biomass cofactors e1 x the combination of stoichiometries of biochemical reactions then co determines the effectivity of metabolic pathways stoichiometric molar ratios ν reflect projections of η on y we set out to connect compositions of s to those of e1 x by calculating values for stoichiometric ratios ν s combining and comparing them with experimental values of η q 1 x y s comparison yielded statistically significant relationships signifying relevance of η q 1 x y s in multiple environments the resulting predictions are biochemically intuitive and can supplement sbr and kinetic fate models 3 methods we considered the production y s of effective metabolic biomass machinery η e section 2 2 from any substrate s i and co substrates x i the y s corresponds to the theoretical maximal yield of the machinery produced when substrate s is added to medium we determined an experimental effective yield η y s and an apparent stoichiometric ratio ν s the first one is experimentally derived the second one is predicted we then compared and contrasted the two we predicted values for ν s i on the basis of stoichiometric solutions of the generalized reaction equation

of reactions to be proportionally higher with higher yields i e lower gibbs energy dissipation we combined the individual contributions ν s i to predict the apparent stoichiometric ratio by treating them as resistances of flows through each metabolic chain westerhoff et al 1982 which are connected in parallel section 3 1 3 10 ν s 1 i 1 ν s i 1 we evaluated the relevancy of predictions of ν s by comparison with experimental values for η y s considering the rate constant and exponential decay in equation 8 we calculated experimental values for η y s via 11 δ η y s e x p k k b wherein k is the observed first order biodegradation rate constant in surface wastewater we obtained values for k from an empirical qsbr nolte et al 2020c 2018 episuite s biowin and other datasets see section 3 2 1 we calculated k b by applying aspects on diffusion steric hindrance and energetics eyring nolte et al 2020c 3 2 2 variance from the e 1 e x 0 term was accounted for via data curation 3 2 1 3 1 prediction of ν s 3 1 1 stoichiometry we predict contributions to ν s via of the pollutant s to those of biomass cofactors e eq 12 we do this by solving algebraically stoichiometric equations for each i ei 12 wherein p s s s are the element concentrations elements in bold capital letters in number per substrate molecule s for each reaction likewise the decapitalized letters p x s x are the number concentrations of co substrates co substrates are needed because the stoichiometric ratios in substrate and cofactor ei may not match up the entries p e s e are the element number concentrations of the biomass cofactors we obtained the elemental compositions via solving the stoichiometry equation eq 12 via applying the argument 13 min 0 c v n x i n s n e i h x i h s h e i s x i s s s e i p x i p s p e i o x i o s o e i c x i c s c e i which minimalizes the difference between elemental ratios before and after the reaction eq 12 via their coefficient of variation cv in other words the argument eq 13 solves equation 12 for each i the required accuracy of the stoichiometric solution in terms of the cv of the ratios eq 13 was set at 1 10 4 based on equation 12 we define the contributions to ν

produce i with i being hypothetical constituents of biomass cofactors as defined below 3 1 2 stoichiometric parameters the elemental compositions of biomass cofactors differ we therefore determined the individual i contributions to v s eq 14 via biomass specific stoichiometries however virtually endless biomass cofactors i can be involved enzymes transporters coenzymes nucleic acids lipids etc keeping the parametrization to a minimum we broadly distinguished between 4 important metabolic routes lipid amino acid carbohydrate and nucleic acid metabolism hendriks et al 2016 van lier j b et al 2008 yang et al 2020 an additional 5th term acknowledges general or background metabolism involving hybrid multifunctional enzymes transporters etc table 1 thus we simplified i to be 5 we took the elemental ratios of background metabolism from fagerbakke et al 1996 popovic 2019 vrede et al 2002 and specifically included phosphorous as a characteristic of life hunter 2012 kamerlin et al 2013 3 1 3 metabolic routes i microbes may prefer a particular metabolic route over another the colored lines in fig 3 signal particular routes which s may follow we conveniently choose the potential metabolic routes to be lipid amino acid carbohydrate nucleic acid and background metabolism as in 3 1 2 naturally the observed metabolism will likely occur via the fastest available and most effective route gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 the path of lowest resistance chen et al 2017 e g green instead of gray in fig 2 we consider the main metabolic routes to function in parallel treating them as resistances eq 15 westerhoff et al 1982 as shown graphically in fig 3 15 1 v s 1 v s i c a r b o h y d r a t e s 1 v s i a m i n o a c i d 1 v s i n u c l e i c a c i d 1 v s i g e n e r a l b a c k g r o u n d 1 v s i l i p i d thereby we implement eq 15 with i 5 as the calculation of the metabolic resistance of s according to equation 21 wherein i represents the biomass cofactor constituent a more thorough interpretation of the values for v s thus obtained is given in the discussion the values are a measure for biological likeness fig s1 or natural character of the substrate table 2 3 2 experimental η y s 3 2 1 data we considered three independent datasets for k to calculate experimental values for η y s the first is the episuite dataset to develop biowin ver 4 0 giving scores between 0 and 5 for biodegradability in wastewater usepa 2012 we assume that a 1 difference in the biowin score translates to an order of magnitude in k the second for surface water is an in house dataset nolte et al 2020c containing electron rich substances and carboxylates a third data subset of k values was on nitrogen containing substances evenblij et al 2020 to allow comparing results from datasets we aligned the episuite dataset to the in house dataset specifically we excluded carboxylic acids esters from the episuite dataset because of potential abiotic hydrolysis whereby values of dt50 were all below 100 days for ph 8 and 6 in environmental aqueous media we also excluded episuite data for salts containing toxic metal e g zn al ions we further excluded compounds for which the octanol water partitioning ratio 10log kow exceeded 4 to minimize potential convoluting influence of non linear sorption nolte et al 2018 unitednations 2011 3 2 2 calculation of experimental η y s biodegradation of structurally diverse micropollutant adheres to 2nd order kinetics paris et al 1981 but data for k represents pseudo 1st order kinetics because low micropollutant concentrations data curation render the effective biomass η e in surface and waste water constant via steady state we take k b in eq 11 to be a product function nazzal 2016 nolte et al 2020c we thus acquire experimental values for η y s by plugging in values for k and k b p and a 16 δ η y s k p a e δ g wherein p is a partitioning function bar even et al 2011 pirovano et al 2014 taken as p 0 09 k ow with k ow at ph 7 4 nolte et al 2020c in the presence of electrolyte carboxylates can bind biomass via ion exchange rather than hydrophobic interaction thus we calculated p in eq 16 for positive charges attached to the carboxylates a is a frequency factor calculation details in hill 1976 nolte et al 2020c and e δ g is the thermodynamic reaction efficiency eyring 1935 nazzal 2016 from chemoinformatic calculation fig 4 visualizes the calculation of experimental η y s by applying eq 16 we calculated η y s by correcting the data on k for a and δ g then the difference in η y s between substrates becomes visible we need activation energies δg as they influence biodegradation nolte et al 2020a 2020c rorije et al 1995 eq 16 calculating δg for potentially 10 000 substrates and enzymes is cumbersome and sometimes error prone echa 2020 jaladanki et al 2020 hence we minimized the influence of δg hence error by considering electron rich electrochemically neutral substrates s separately such that there is negligible variation in δg values between s δs δg 0 nolte et al 2020c in the case of carboxylates and nitrogen as heteroatoms the term δs δg could not be ignored we applied the assumption of lfer jinich et al 2018 nolte et al 2020c 17 δ s δ g f c σ δ s δ g r δ g c t assuming transformations are overall oxidative we calculated η y s for carboxylates taking δ g c t 0 and nitrogen containing substrates δ g c t 0 via karki and dinnocenzo 1995 nolte 2020b nolte et al 2020c we assumed that the reacting atom is well defined rudik et al 2016 the orbital density overlap f c term is a constant factor for all s δf c 0 nolte et al 2021 3 3 testing the apparent yield effectivity η y s is a complex quantity we therefore cannot evaluate its absolute accuracy but can do this merely in abstract terms by inferring plausibility of our calculus we evaluate the accuracy of the prediction of η y s via calculated values from three different datasets section 3 2 1 allowing comparison with widely applied statistical methods we chose to calculate p values to evaluate significance and the pearson s squared correlation coefficient r2 to evaluate preciseness the values for log k b and log k standard errors of 0 5 1 0 nolte et al 2020c in log scales entail uncertainty and variability resp partially due to unknown involvement of ei which propagate into errors in the experimental η y s e g maximum r2 obtainable for a perfect model is 0 3 to evaluate prediction errors we thus compared errors in experimental η y s to its discrepancy with predicted v s 4 results 4 1 experimental values for η y s we calculated experimental values for the effective e yield η y s the values reflect the concentration dependency in eq 1 and fig s1 the values for η y s largely vary by 3 orders of magnitude between substrates i e δ η y s 1000 figs 5 6 vertical axes for data subsets variation is larger figs 6 7 the compounds we generally consider as being natural biological and organic compounds show high values for η y s implying that these chemicals are relatively easily biodegradable we note that uncertainties values for experimental η y s are approximately 1 order of magnitude stemming largely from the uncertainties in the raw data on k uncertainties were larger as compared to variance in v s more so for specific chemical classes 4 2 predicted values for v s i and v s implementing the values in table 1 as parameters in eqs 12 15 yielded apparent stoichiometric ratios v s i and v s predicted concentration dependencies table 2 combining the metabolic paths v s i by treating them as resistances eq 10 15 gave v s values varying mostly between 0 4 0 9 figs 5 7 by illustration a bacterial consortium will find it virtually impossible to adapt to efficiently degrade sulfur hexafluoride and fullerene unless many other co substrates x are available in contrast most consortia will already have machinery to use e g fatty and amino acids for instance gabapentin a γ amino acid has high v s asterisk in fig 7 4 3 metabolic paths i analysis yielded statistically significant correlation p 0 05 between η y s and all individual contributions from v s i e v s i for specific metabolism i fig 5a

observe a significant correlation for carboxylates as a specific chemical class filled vs open data points fig 6c d envisioning cn cleavage metabolism nolte et al 2020a preliminary investigations on n rich compounds excluding other heteroatoms did not yield statistically significant relationships between experimental η y s and any predicted v s i including nucleotide and amino acid metabolism i this was with exception of the homogeneous wdod data significant relationships in fig 7 all contributions i from v s i to η y s were positive i e correlations yielded r 0 this was with exception of v s i for which we took i lipid cofactors fig 5d 7d i e r 0 discussed in section 4 3 the slopes of the regressions were highest when taking i 1 carbohydrate and when taking i 1 nucleotide cofactors fig 5 6 slopes differed slightly for ei as nucleotide cofactors e g in the case when s are carboxylates fig 6b since the units of biodegradation e g episuite differ between datasets we cannot compare slopes between datasets however within for example fig 6 biodegradability in terms of yield effectivity ηy increases stoichiometrically by 3 2 0 4 or 3 1 0 5 via likeness to carbohydrate this shows that under steady state acclimation a compound stoichiometrically identical to carbohydrate e g sugars will be 103 2 0 4 or 103 1 0 5 times faster degraded than a compound marginally similar to carbohydrate when correlations were statistically significant the signs of the correlations did not differ between datasets fig 5 compared to fig 6 fig 7 4 4 total metabolism comparisons between predicted v s and experimental η y s are depicted in fig 5f 6f 7f nolte et al 2020c comparison between v s as combined from v s i eq 10 15 also yielded a statistically significant correlation with η y s figs 5f 6f 7f prominently for episuite data fig 5f taken together evaluation using data on k from episuite fig 5 led to slightly stronger relationships between predicted v s and experimental η y s as compared to in house data for surface water fig 6 and wastewater fig 7 while the involvement of metabolic cofactors i were not weighted eq 15 denotes equal contribution an analysis excluding general background and lipid cofactors gave better results this was with the exception of n rich compounds fig 7 if the relevance of metabolic cofactors was weighted e g optimizing the numerators in eq 15 this would have yielded a maximum correlation r2 0 2 0 3 multiple analyses show that approximately 90 of the experimental η y s y axes values fall within 1 order of magnitude of the expected value based on v s figs 5 7 our corresponding values for v s x axes vary mostly 90 by 0 5 figs 5f 7f show that a factor of 0 5 can correspond to a predicted increase in the value of η y s by a factor of 103 a variation of 0 2 in v s x axes in fig 7f results in a factor 4 difference in the value of k 5 discussion 5 1 stoichiometry microorganisms are vital components of biogeochemical cycles of

vanbriesen 2001 yuan and vanbriesen 2002a the elemental composition of substrate s determines the stoichiometry of reactions which differs between substrates this however does not take into account the effectiveness η q of the biomass e production a priori η q 1 x denotes effectiveness of the biomass production from s reflecting transport connectivity coupling transcription speed etc η q 1 x can

vanbriesen 2002 westerhoff and van dam 1987 when the number of required metabolic steps needing maintenance increases the production of e1 x from s will be less effective in other words if the metabolic pathway is long energy loss accumulates along each step so that a lower effective yield η q 1 x y can be achieved mccarty 2007 fig 2 envisions stoichiometries to reflect path functions in thermodynamic quantities chen et al 2017 effective green and non effective gray pathways we hypothesized that η q 1 x y s can be captured predicted by combining elemental compositions of substrates s with those of biomass cofactors e1 x the combination of stoichiometries of biochemical reactions then co determines the effectivity of metabolic pathways stoichiometric molar ratios ν reflect projections of η on y we set out to connect compositions of s to those of e1 x by calculating values for stoichiometric ratios ν s combining and comparing them with experimental values of η q 1 x y s comparison yielded statistically significant relationships signifying relevance of η q 1 x y s in multiple environments the resulting predictions are biochemically intuitive and can supplement sbr and kinetic fate models 3 methods we considered the production y s of effective metabolic biomass machinery η e section 2 2 from any substrate s i and co substrates x i the y s corresponds to the theoretical maximal yield of the machinery produced when substrate s is added to medium we determined an experimental effective yield η y s and an apparent stoichiometric ratio ν s the first one is experimentally derived the second one is predicted we then compared and contrasted the two we predicted values for ν s i on the basis of stoichiometric solutions of the generalized reaction equation

biochemistry we assumed that all these reactions are possible i e x and in other words snb t 0 ouiroga et al 1999 eq 5 or coupling q 0 westerhoff et al 1982 though at different rates we took the rates of reactions to be proportionally higher with higher yields i e lower gibbs energy dissipation we combined the individual contributions ν s i to predict the apparent stoichiometric ratio by treating them as resistances of flows through each metabolic chain westerhoff et al 1982 which are connected in parallel section 3 1 3 10 ν s 1 i 1 ν s i 1 we evaluated the relevancy of predictions of ν s by comparison with experimental values for η y s considering the rate constant and exponential decay in equation 8 we calculated experimental values for η y s via 11 δ η y s e x p k k b wherein k is the observed first order biodegradation rate constant in surface wastewater we obtained values for k from an empirical qsbr nolte et al 2020c 2018 episuite s biowin and other datasets see section 3 2 1 we calculated k b by applying aspects on diffusion steric hindrance and energetics eyring nolte et al 2020c 3 2 2 variance from the e 1 e x 0 term was accounted for via data curation 3 2 1 3 1 prediction of ν s 3 1 1 stoichiometry we predict contributions to ν s via of the pollutant s to those of biomass cofactors e eq 12 we do this by solving algebraically stoichiometric equations for each i ei 12 wherein p s s s are the element concentrations elements in bold capital letters in number per substrate molecule s for each reaction likewise the decapitalized letters p x s x are the number concentrations of co substrates co substrates are needed because the stoichiometric ratios in substrate and cofactor ei may not match up the entries p e s e are the element number concentrations of the biomass cofactors we obtained the elemental compositions via solving the stoichiometry equation eq 12 via applying the argument 13 min 0 c v n x i n s n e i h x i h s h e i s x i s s s e i p x i p

eq 13 solves equation 12 for each i the required accuracy of the stoichiometric solution in terms of the cv of the ratios eq 13 was set at 1 10 4 based on equation 12 we define the contributions to ν

produce i with i being hypothetical constituents of biomass cofactors as defined below 3 1 2 stoichiometric parameters the elemental compositions of biomass cofactors differ we therefore determined the individual i contributions to v s eq 14 via biomass specific stoichiometries however virtually endless biomass cofactors i can be involved enzymes transporters coenzymes nucleic acids lipids etc keeping the parametrization to a minimum we broadly distinguished between 4 important metabolic routes lipid amino acid carbohydrate and nucleic acid metabolism hendriks et al 2016 van lier j b et al 2008 yang et al 2020 an additional 5th term acknowledges general or background metabolism involving hybrid multifunctional enzymes transporters etc table 1 thus we simplified i to be 5 we took the elemental ratios of background metabolism from fagerbakke et al 1996 popovic 2019 vrede et al 2002 and specifically included phosphorous as a characteristic of life hunter 2012 kamerlin et al 2013 3 1 3 metabolic routes i microbes may prefer a particular metabolic route over another the colored lines in fig 3 signal particular routes which s may follow we conveniently choose the potential metabolic routes to be lipid amino acid carbohydrate nucleic acid and background metabolism as in 3 1 2 naturally the observed metabolism will likely occur via the fastest available and most effective route gonzález cabaleiro et al 2015 the path of lowest resistance chen et al 2017 e g green instead of gray in fig 2 we consider the main metabolic routes to function in parallel treating them as resistances eq 15 westerhoff et al 1982 as shown graphically in fig 3 15 1 v s 1 v s i c a r b o h y d r a t e s 1 v s i a m i n o a c i d 1 v s i n u c l e i c a c i d 1 v s i g e n e r a l b a c k g r o u n d 1 v s i l i p i d thereby we implement eq 15 with i 5 as the calculation of the metabolic resistance of s according to equation 21 wherein i represents the biomass cofactor constituent a more thorough interpretation of the values for v s thus obtained is given in the discussion the values are a measure for biological likeness fig s1 or natural character of the substrate table 2 3 2 experimental η y s 3 2 1 data we considered three independent datasets for k to calculate experimental values for η y s the first is the episuite dataset to develop biowin ver 4 0 giving scores between 0 and 5 for biodegradability in wastewater usepa 2012 we assume that a 1 difference in the biowin score translates to an order of magnitude in k the second for surface water is an in house dataset nolte et al 2020c containing electron rich substances and carboxylates a third data subset of k values was on nitrogen containing substances evenblij et al 2020 to allow comparing results from datasets we aligned the episuite dataset to the in house dataset specifically we excluded carboxylic acids esters from the episuite dataset because of potential abiotic hydrolysis whereby values of dt50 were all below 100 days for ph 8 and 6 in environmental aqueous media we also excluded episuite data for salts containing toxic metal e g zn al ions we further excluded compounds for which the octanol water partitioning ratio 10log kow exceeded 4 to minimize potential convoluting influence of non linear sorption nolte et al 2018 unitednations 2011 3 2 2 calculation of experimental η y s biodegradation of structurally diverse micropollutant adheres to 2nd order kinetics paris et al 1981 but data for k represents pseudo 1st order kinetics because low micropollutant concentrations data curation render the effective biomass η e in surface and waste water constant via steady state we take k b in eq 11 to be a product function nazzal 2016 nolte et al 2020c we thus acquire experimental values for η y s by plugging in values for k and k b p and a 16 δ η y s k p a e δ g wherein p is a partitioning function bar even et al 2011 pirovano et al 2014 taken as p 0 09 k ow with k ow at ph 7 4 nolte et al 2020c in the presence of electrolyte carboxylates can bind biomass via ion exchange rather than hydrophobic interaction thus we calculated p in eq 16 for positive charges attached to the carboxylates a is a frequency factor calculation details in hill 1976 nolte et al 2020c and e δ g is the thermodynamic reaction efficiency eyring 1935 nazzal 2016 from chemoinformatic calculation fig 4 visualizes the calculation of experimental η y s by applying eq 16 we calculated η y s by correcting the data on k for a and δ g then the difference in η y s between substrates becomes visible we need activation energies δg as they influence biodegradation nolte et al 2020a 2020c rorije et al 1995 eq 16 calculating δg for potentially 10 000 substrates and enzymes is cumbersome and sometimes error prone echa 2020 jaladanki et al 2020 hence we minimized the influence of δg hence error by considering electron rich electrochemically neutral substrates s separately such that there is negligible variation in δg values between s δs δg 0 nolte et al 2020c in the case of carboxylates and nitrogen as heteroatoms the term δs δg could not be ignored we applied the assumption of lfer jinich et al 2018 nolte et al 2020c 17 δ s δ g f c σ δ s δ g r δ g c t assuming transformations are overall oxidative we calculated η y s for carboxylates taking δ g c t 0 and nitrogen containing substrates δ g c t 0 via karki and dinnocenzo 1995 nolte 2020b nolte et al 2020c we assumed that the reacting atom is well defined rudik et al 2016 the orbital density overlap f c term is a constant factor for all s δf c 0 nolte et al 2021 3 3 testing the apparent yield effectivity η y s is a complex quantity we therefore cannot evaluate its absolute accuracy but can do this merely in abstract terms by inferring plausibility of our calculus we evaluate the accuracy of the prediction of η y s via calculated values from three different datasets section 3 2 1 allowing comparison with widely applied statistical methods we chose to calculate p values to evaluate significance and the pearson s squared correlation coefficient r2 to evaluate preciseness the values for log k b and log k standard errors of 0 5 1 0 nolte et al 2020c in log scales entail uncertainty and variability resp partially due to unknown involvement of ei which propagate into errors in the experimental η y s e g maximum r2 obtainable for a perfect model is 0 3 to evaluate prediction errors we thus compared errors in experimental η y s to its discrepancy with predicted v s 4 results 4 1 experimental values for η y s we calculated experimental values for the effective e yield η y s the values reflect the concentration dependency in eq 1 and fig s1 the values for η y s largely vary by 3 orders of magnitude between substrates i e δ η y s 1000 figs 5 6 vertical axes for data subsets variation is larger figs 6 7 the compounds we generally consider as being natural biological and organic compounds show high values for η y s implying that these chemicals are relatively easily biodegradable we note that uncertainties values for experimental η y s are approximately 1 order of magnitude stemming largely from the uncertainties in the raw data on k uncertainties were larger as compared to variance in v s more so for specific chemical classes 4 2 predicted values for v s i and v s implementing the values in table 1 as parameters in eqs 12 15 yielded apparent stoichiometric ratios v s i and v s predicted concentration dependencies table 2 combining the metabolic paths v s i by treating them as resistances eq 10 15 gave v s values varying mostly between 0 4 0 9 figs 5 7 by illustration a bacterial consortium will find it virtually impossible to adapt to efficiently degrade sulfur hexafluoride and fullerene unless many other co substrates x are available in contrast most consortia will already have machinery to use e g fatty and amino acids for instance gabapentin a γ amino acid has high v s asterisk in fig 7 4 3 metabolic paths i analysis yielded statistically significant correlation p 0 05 between η y s and all individual contributions from v s i e v s i for specific metabolism i fig 5a e this was true for episuite data but using our in house data only the contributions i from carbohydrates nucleotides fig 6a fig 6b fig 7a and amino acids fig 7c appeared significant we did however observe a significant correlation for carboxylates as a specific chemical class filled vs open data points fig 6c d envisioning cn cleavage metabolism nolte et al 2020a preliminary investigations on n rich compounds excluding other heteroatoms did not yield statistically significant relationships between experimental η y s and any predicted v s i including nucleotide and amino acid metabolism i this was with exception of the homogeneous wdod data significant relationships in fig 7 all contributions i from v s i to η y s were positive i e correlations yielded r 0 this was with exception of v s i for which we took i lipid cofactors fig 5d 7d i e r 0 discussed in section 4 3 the slopes of the regressions were highest when taking i 1 carbohydrate and when taking i 1 nucleotide cofactors fig 5 6 slopes differed slightly for ei as nucleotide cofactors e g in the case when s are carboxylates fig 6b since the units of biodegradation e g episuite differ between datasets we cannot compare slopes between datasets however within for example fig 6 biodegradability in terms of yield effectivity ηy increases stoichiometrically by 3 2 0 4 or 3 1 0 5 via likeness to carbohydrate this shows that under steady state acclimation a compound stoichiometrically identical to carbohydrate e g sugars will be 103 2 0 4 or 103 1 0 5 times faster degraded than a compound marginally similar to carbohydrate when correlations were statistically significant the signs of the correlations did not differ between datasets fig 5 compared to fig 6 fig 7 4 4 total metabolism comparisons between predicted v s and experimental η y s are depicted in fig 5f 6f 7f nolte et al 2020c comparison between v s as combined from v s i eq 10 15 also yielded a statistically significant correlation with η y s figs 5f 6f 7f prominently for episuite data fig 5f taken together evaluation using data on k from episuite fig 5 led to slightly stronger relationships between predicted v s and experimental η y s as compared to in house data for surface water fig 6 and wastewater fig 7 while the involvement of metabolic cofactors i were not weighted eq 15 denotes equal contribution an analysis excluding general background and lipid cofactors gave better results this was with the exception of n rich compounds fig 7 if the relevance of metabolic cofactors was weighted e g optimizing the numerators in eq 15 this would have yielded a maximum correlation r2 0 2 0 3 multiple analyses show that approximately 90 of the experimental η y s y axes values fall within 1 order of magnitude of the expected value based on v s figs 5 7 our corresponding values for v s x axes vary mostly 90 by 0 5 figs 5f 7f show that a factor of 0 5 can correspond to a predicted increase in the value of η y s by a factor of 103 a variation of 0 2 in v s x axes in fig 7f results in a factor 4 difference in the value of k 5 discussion 5 1 stoichiometry microorganisms are vital components of biogeochemical cycles of

degraded faster than expected based on thermochemistry nolte et al 2020c van bergen et al 2020 to our knowledge there is no study uniformly evaluating 100 compounds for fate assessment comparable to ours we therefore compared to similar data on bioconcentration and aerobic bacterial yield by yuan and vanbriesen 2002 vanbriesen 2002 and smeaton 2018 fig 8 the combined agreement indicates that stoichiometry describes η y i e the state of acclimation brandt 2002 strous et al 1998 variability in η ys corresponds to variability in ei t 0 involved when the effectivity η of biomass production is maximal the apparent yield equals the theoretical maximal yield y eq 3 this calculus aligns with authors stating that a phenomenological stoichiometry equals a mechanistic stoichiometry only when the coupling q is maximal westerhoff et al 1982 for the same inoculum and when other growth substrates are absent the coupling architecture theoretically accessible for each xenobiotic chemical s is approximately a constant factor trapp et al 2018 solving for stoichiometry can lead to more than 1 solution for a single s depending on the prerequisite accuracy of the stoichiometric solution eq 13 in analogy differing metabolic routes can lead to similar final products i e co2 and h2o the routes can differ in effectivity yield and in number of metabolic steps the accuracy of the solution eq 13 was set at arbitrary values of 1 10 4 section 3 1 1 the arbitrary criteria however parallels nature varying involvement of co metabolites or co nutrients may render an exact solution of the

factors nutrients converting s to e becomes less efficient when the number of steps from s to e i increases the amount of work needed thus depends on how much the microbial consortia has acclimated it s e to degrade s then degradation time depends on the manner by which the system changes from one state to another thermodynamically acclimation would be a path function or process function fig 2 the route by which a system goes from state a to state b determines the result η y s is proportional to some resistance along a path of metabolic steps wherein cofactors are needed to embed the substrate into the endemic metabolism usually peripheral metabolic reactions oxygenases are less efficient than are central metabolic reactions where energy is produced for cell functioning gonzález cabaleiro

phosphorus removal and anammox during 246 days are illustrated in fig s1 in phase i days 1 50 the release of organic matter nh4 n and po4 3 p was not good due to insufficient time of sludge fermentation in anaerobic phase of pfpn sbr the concentration of po4 3 p was less than 20 mg l at the end of anaerobic phase fig 3a after the oxidation of oxic phase the drainage from decant i phase of pfpn sbr 20 and real domestic wastewater 40 were pumped into pda sbr for partial denitrification and anammox process at the beginning of partial denitrification and anammox process the

in this study the effluent concentrations of no2 n and no3 n were about 5 mg l and 15 mg l respectively and the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p were 90 6 79 1 and 83 2 respectively in phase ii days 51 100 sludge fermentation was enhanced due to the running time of anaerobic phase in pfpn sbr increased from 8 h to 16 h the release amounts of organic matter and nh4 n in phase ii were 2 21 fold and 2 44 fold of those in phase i and the concentration of po4 3 p increased to about 44 8 mg l at the end of anaerobic phase fig 3c according to eqs 2 the nar reached 60 6 in the oxic phase of pfpn sbr the increase of running time of anaerobic phase was beneficial to tetrasphaera section 3 4 causing that the activities of aerobic phosphorus uptake in phase ii were 2 18 fold of that in phase i fig s1 after the drainage from decant i phase of pfpn sbr 20 and real domestic wastewater 40 pumping into pda sbr the initial concentrations of no2 n and no3 n in pda sbr increased to 20 mg l and 13 mg l respectively fig 3d after 5 h of operation the final concentrations of nh4 n decreased from 24 mg l in phase i to 18 mg l in phase ii in pda sbr the raise of no2 n concentration provided

4 mg l and 1 5 mg l in phase i to 22 8 mg l and 3 mg l in phase ii in the post anoxic phase of pfpn sbr respectively fig 3c this was because the enhancement of sludge fermentation increased the loads of ammonium and phosphorus and ammonium and phosphorus were not completely removed in the oxic phase the denitrifying phosphorus removal activity in phase ii was 4 3 fold of that in phase i fig s1 due to the increase of tetrasphaera abundance section 3 4 leading to that the effluent concentrations of no2 n and no3 n decreased below detection limits 0 1 mg l and po4 3 p decreased to 0 62 mg l in phase iii days 101 246 the aeration time in pfpn sbr was extended to improve the removal efficiencies of ammonium and phosphorus the increase of aeration time was beneficial to the rna expression of

iii the release amounts of nh4 n were 2 69 fold and 1 1 fold of those in phase i and phase ii respectively due to the raise of tetrasphaera abundance enhancing sludge fermentation section 3 4 since tetrasphaera not only had the fermenting ability but also had the biological phosphorus removal ability the phosphorus removal efficiency was higher in phase iii the release amounts of po4 3 p were 3 1 fold and 1 34 fold of those in phase i and phase ii respectively the cod concentration increased before 12 h and then decreased in the anaerobic stage of phase iii fig 3e due to that there were very few vfas in the influent of pfpn sbr and the released organic matter through sludge fermentation was utilized by heterotrophic bacteria ammonium was completely oxidized to nitrite or nitrate in the oxic stage of phase iii and the nar was about 60 6 fig s1 after the drainage from decant i phase of pfpn sbr 20 and real domestic wastewater 40 pumping into pda sbr the initial concentrations of no2 n and no3 n in pda sbr increased from 20 mg l and 13 mg l in phase ii to 26 mg l and 17 mg l in phase iii respectively in the first 1 h of pda sbr the concentration of no3 n decreased from 17 mg l to 1 9 mg l accompanied by the increase of no2 n concentration through partial denitrification process fig 3f the ntr was about 87 the ammonium in the influent of pda sbr was completely removed through anammox process the contribution of anammox pathway to tin removal was 85 4 fig 2d after the discharge of pda sbr 60 pumping into pfpn sbr residual phosphorus nitrite and nitrate were removed by denitrifying phosphorus removal process the final effluent concentration of po4 3 p was 0 1 mg l and the effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were below detection limits 0 1 mg l in phase iii fig 2a fig 3e table 2 shows the paos stoichiometries in oxic stage of phase iii in this study the pha utilization and glycogen generation were much lower than those in the studies published before and the ratios of p uptake pha utilization and p uptake glycogen generation were much higher than those in the studies published before this indicated that pha and glycogen were not the main internal carbon storage for phosphorus removal variations of intracellular amino acids in typical cycle of pfpn sbr were shown in fig 4 to investigate the internal carbon storage in this study the amounts of intracellular amino acids were determined as lg a where a is amino acids responses measured by lc ms ms the contents of intracellular amino acids increased in the anaerobic stage and then decreased in the oxic and anoxic stage as shown in fig 4 intracellular amino acids were not stored at the same time glutamate aspartic acid and phenylalanine were stored as internal carbon source at the beginning of the anaerobic stage at the end of the anaerobic stage in the three phases the content of intracellular glutamate was the highest and the content of threonine is the lowest indicating glutamate was the main type of intracellular stored amino acids intracellular amino acids are not consumed at the same time intracellular valine glycine and lysine were not consumed in oxic stage while other amino acids are consumed at the beginning of oxic stage in the anoxic stage valine glycine and lysine were the major intracellular carbon sources for denitrifying phosphorus removal process these data indicated that though little pha utilization and glycogen generation were observed in oxic stage table 2 amino acids were an important intracellular carbon storage in pda pfpn system 3 3 was reduction in pda pfpn system not only good performance of nitrogen and phosphorus removal was achieved but also was reduction was achieved in pda pfpn system fig s2 shows the was dosage sludge discharge mlvss mlss cell decay rate and sludge reduction efficiency in pda pfpn system during 246 days at the beginning of the experiment the sludge discharge exceeded sludge dosage due to microbial growth and reproduction as the experiment proceeded sludge fermentation was enhanced leading to the increase of sludge reduction efficiency and decrease of sludge discharge based on eqs 5 the sludge reduction efficiency increased from 16 5 in phase i 37 4 in phase ii to 48 1 in phase iii mlvss mlss decreased from 0 78 in phase i 0 6 in phase ii to 0 57 in phase iii indicating that organics were biodegraded in pda pfpn system according to eqs 6 cell decay rate in phase iii was 2 68 fold and 1 27 fold of that in phase i and phase ii respectively the cell decay rate in phase iii 0 252 d was higher than that reported in the previous literatures wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 these data confirmed that nitrogen and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction were simultaneously achieved in pda pfpn system cell integrity dna concentration in the sludge supernatant particle size carbohydrate and protein concentrations and eem spectra in eps were analyzed to reveal the mechanism of was reduction in pda pfpn system which is displayed in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a and b the proportion of intact cells decreased from 94 7 in phase i to 82 9 in phase iii and the proportion of necrotic cells increased from 5 3 in phase i to 17 1 in phase iii in addition dna concentration in the sludge supernatant gradually rose and particle size gradually declined as the experiment proceeded fig 5c these data suggested that cell death and lysis and the release of intracellular substances occurred in this study resulting in the was reduction in pda pfpn system carbohydrate and protein concentrations in eps of phase iii were higher than those in eps of phase i and phase ii fig 5d the raise of carbohydrate and protein concentrations in eps was considered as an indicator that sludge fermentation was strengthened wang et al 2019 furthermore fig 5e and fig 5f show eem spectra of eps in phase i and phase iii respectively the soluble microbial byproduct peak a and tyrosine and tryptophan aromatic protein peak b in phase iii were higher than those in phase i due to the enhancement of sludge fermentation and then these slowly biodegradable organics were hydrolyzed and acidized to vfas for the growth of denitrifying bacteria fig 3e which ensured good performance of nitrogen removal despite no external carbon source was added into pfpn sbr in this study there were nearly no vfas in the influent of pfpn sbr fig 3a c and e and all carbon sources required for nitrogen and phosphorus removal came from sludge fermentation 100 of the external carbon source dosage was saved in pfpn sbr due to sludge fermentation and the sludge reduction efficiency reached 48 1 previous study showed that the sludge treatment cost accounted for up to 60 of the total operating cost in wwtps zhang et al 2019 therefore efficient sludge reduction was of great significance to the operation of wwtps not only that the effluent concentration of po4 3 p was 0 1 mg l and the effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were below detection limits 0 1 mg l the pda pfpn system not only achieved highly efficient n and p removal but also enhanced sludge reduction which saved the operation cost of wastewater treatment 3 4 transcriptional community composition in pda pfpn system the transcriptional community compositions top 8 genera in pda pfpn system are displayed in fig 6 including the community structure in pda sbr fig 6a and pfpn sbr fig 6b as shown in fig 6a the relative abundance of thauera at gene level dna high throughput sequencing increased from 12 56 in phase i 27 95 in phase ii to 29 64 in phase iii due to the raise of nitrate concentration in pda sbr section 3 2 the cdna high throughput sequencing transcriptional community composition suggested that thauera that actually played a role accounted for 41 22 of the total bacteria actually working in phase iii the high abundance of thauera ensured partial denitrification in pda pfpn system and the ntr remained above 85 in phase iii section 3 1 and 3 2 the high ntr provided a stable source of nitrite for anammox process in this study candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were detected as anammox bacteria the raise of nitrite accumulation concentration provided more substrates for anammox process section 3 2 leading to the gradual increase of candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia abundance from phase i phase ii to phase iii the effluent concentration of nh4 n decreased below detection limits 0 1 mg l in phase iii due to the raise of anammox bacteria abundance section 3 2 though the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia was higher than that of candidatus kuenenia at gene level in phase iii the proportion of candidatus brocadia that actually worked in the total bacteria 8 56 was lower than that of candidatus kuenenia 9 98 these data explained why this study determined transcriptional community composition rather than the common gene level analysis the gene level analysis could not determine the bacteria that actually worked and rna expression of functional microorganism in wastewater treatment fig 6b shows that the proportion of tetrasphaera that actually worked in the total bacteria increased from 9 86 in phase i 54 12 in phase ii to 70 8 in phase iii previous study confirmed that tetrasphaera utilized oxygen as electron acceptor to remove phosphorus in oxic stage and acted as denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos to achieve denitrifying p removal using nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptor in anoxic stage marques et al 2018 compared with phase i more ammonium was released due to the enhancement of sludge fermentation in phase ii the ammonium was oxidized to nitrite or nitrate in the oxic phase because of prolonged aeration time in phase iii as a result the effluent concentration of phosphorus decreased from 1 14 mg l in phase i 0 62 mg l in phase ii to 0 1 mg l in phase iii after denitrifying p removal process which explained the increase of relative abundance of tetrasphaera as dpaos tetrasphaera not only had the phosphorus removal ability but also the fermenting ability compared with phase i the extension of the running time of anaerobic phase provided more time for sludge fermentation in phase ii the enhancement of sludge fermentation was beneficial to tetrasphaera leading to the increase of tetrasphaera abundance the release amounts of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p in phase ii were 2 21 fold 2 44 fold and 2 33 fold of those in phase i respectively compared with phase ii the extension of aeration time supplied more electron acceptors for aerobic phosphorus uptake in phase iii the aerobic phosphorus uptake activity in phase iii were 1 23 fold of that in phase ii section 3 1 resulting in the relative abundance of tetrasphaera in phase iii exceeding that in phase ii as a result the release amounts of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p in phase iii were 1 24 fold 1 1 fold and 1 34 fold of those in phase ii respectively in phase iii phosphorus produced by sludge fermentation and paos release were completely removed in the oxic stage and the effluent concentration of po4 3 p decreased from 0 62 mg l in phase ii to 0 1 mg l in phase iii fig s3 shows the transcriptional activities of aob and nob in three phases and the specific primers used are presented in table s1 sludge fermentation was strengthened due to the increasing abundance of tetrasphaera from phase i phase ii to phase iii leading to the raise of nh4 n release the increase of nh4 n concentration provided enough substrates for nitrification which caused the raise of nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira nob abundance from phase i ii to iii fig 6b the transcriptional activities of aob and nob also increased from phase i ii to iii fig s3 therefore though the release amounts of nh4 n in anaerobic stage of phase iii were 2 69 fold and 1 1 fold of those in phase i and phase ii nh4 n was completely oxidized to nitrite or nitrate in the subsequent oxic phase section 3 2 in phase ii and phase iii the relative abundance of nitrosomonas that actually worked exceeded nitrospira fig 6b and the transcriptional activities of aob were also higher than those of nob fig s3 as a result the nar was higher than 60 in phase ii and phase iii the shift of dominant nitrifying genes from phase i to phase ii and iii might be because that the running time of anaerobic phase in pfpn sbr increased from 8 h in phase i to 16 h in phase ii and iii previous study demonstrated that the inhibition effect of prolonged anaerobic running time on nob was stronger than that of aob and the activity recovery of nob was slower than that of aob fan et al 2022 guo et al 2016 3 5 implications of this study the schematic diagram of mechanism in the novel pda pfpn system is shown in fig 7 in anaerobic phase of pfpn sbr tetrasphaera as paos with fermentation ability utilized was as substrate to achieve phosphorus release and sludge fermentation the released vfas were provided for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and the released nh4 n and po4 3 p were removed by partial nitrification and aerobic p uptake in the oxic stage respectively all nh4 n was oxidized to nitrite or nitrate and the nar exceeded 60 the nitrate from pfpn sbr and cod from real domestic wastewater were utilized as substrates for partial denitrification in pda sbr partial nitrification and partial denitrification provided nitrite for anammox process and the nh4 n required for anammox process came from real domestic wastewater in the post anoxic stage of pfpn sbr po4 3 p from real domestic wastewater and residual nitrite and or nitrate were removed by denitrifying phosphorus removal process table 3 shows the comparisons of the novel pda pfpn system with other systems the removal efficiencies of tin and po4 3 p in this study were higher than those in the reported literatures this was because that in addition to anammox process aerobic p uptake and denitrifying phosphorus removal were also achieved to remove nitrogen and phosphorus in this study though nitrogen and phosphorus removal were achieved in previous study ji et al 2020b the influent was synthetic wastewater rather than real domestic wastewater the practical application value was limited partial denitrification anammox and fermentation were achieved in the literature ji et al 2020c utilizing slowly biodegradable organics in real domestic wastewater however sludge reduction and phosphorus removal were not realized in this literature which could not solve the problems of phosphorus removal and large amount of sludge discharge in wastewater treatment different from the previously reported literatures in this study nitrogen and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction were simultaneously achieved based on partial denitrification anammox biological phosphorus removal fermentation and partial nitrification in treating real domestic wastewater pda pfpn system not only achieved highly efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal without the addition of external carbon source but also greatly reduced the sludge discharge indicating that the novel pda pfpn process had great application value in wastewater treatment 4 conclusion a novel pda pfpn process was established for real domestic wastewater and was treatment after 246 days of operation the novel pda pfpn system not only achieved highly efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal without adding external carbon source but also greatly reduced the was discharge due to sludge fermentation the tyrosine and tryptophan aromatic protein and soluble microbial byproduct in was were hydrolyzed and acidized into vfas for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria which ensured good performance of nitrogen and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction despite no external carbon source was added to pda pfpn system overall this study provided a new idea to simultaneously achieve nitrogen and

decreased from 94 7 to 82 9 and necrotic cells increased from 5 3 to 17 1 with the increase of dna content in sludge supernatant and cell decay rate indicating the occurrence of cell death and lysis and leading to was reduction analysis of transcriptional community composition revealed that partial denitrification bacteria thauera anammox bacteria candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia simultaneous phosphorus removal and fermentation bacteria tetrasphaera and partial nitrification bacteria nitrosomonas coexisted and actually worked in pda pfpn system the novel pda pfpn process

pathway and anammox pathway to tin removal in pda sbr are shown in fig 2d fig 3 presents the nutrient removal performance of typical cycle in pfpn sbr and pda sbr the nar and activities of biological phosphorus removal and anammox during 246 days are illustrated in fig s1 in phase i days 1 50 the release of organic matter nh4 n and po4 3 p was not good due to insufficient time of sludge fermentation in anaerobic phase of pfpn sbr the concentration of po4 3 p was less than 20 mg l at the end of anaerobic phase fig 3a after the oxidation of oxic phase the drainage from decant i phase of pfpn sbr 20 and real domestic wastewater 40 were pumped into pda sbr for partial denitrification and anammox process at the beginning of partial denitrification and anammox process the

concentrations of nh4 n no2 n no3 n and po4 3 p were about 14 4 mg l 12 mg l 20 mg l and 1 5 mg l in the post anoxic phase of pfpn sbr respectively fig 3a in the post anoxic phase of pfpn sbr denitrifying phosphorus removal occurred to remove residual phosphorus nitrite and or nitrate table s2 shows the range of effluent nitrogen concentration and detection limits of nitrogen analysis test in this study the effluent concentrations of no2 n and no3 n were about 5 mg l and 15 mg l respectively and the removal efficiencies of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p were 90 6 79 1 and 83 2 respectively in phase ii days 51 100 sludge fermentation was enhanced due to the running time of anaerobic phase in pfpn sbr increased from 8 h to 16 h the release amounts of organic matter and nh4 n in phase ii were 2 21 fold and 2 44 fold of those in phase i and the concentration of po4 3 p increased to about 44 8 mg l at the end of anaerobic phase fig 3c according to eqs 2 the nar reached 60 6 in the oxic phase of pfpn sbr the increase of running time of anaerobic phase was beneficial to tetrasphaera section 3 4 causing that the activities of aerobic phosphorus uptake in phase ii were 2 18 fold of that in phase i fig s1 after the drainage from decant i phase of pfpn sbr 20 and real domestic wastewater 40 pumping into pda sbr the initial concentrations of no2 n and no3 n in pda sbr increased to 20 mg l and 13 mg l respectively fig 3d after 5 h of operation the final concentrations of nh4 n decreased from 24 mg l in phase i to 18 mg l in phase ii in pda sbr the raise of no2 n concentration provided more substrates for anammox process and the activities of anammox increased from 0 7 mg gvss h in phase i to 1 42 mg gvss h in phase ii fig s1 furthermore the contribution of anammox pathway to tin removal increased from 32 in phase i to 71 phase ii based on eqs 3 and 4 fig 2d after the discharge of pda sbr 60 pumping into pfpn sbr the initial concentration of nh4 n and po4 3 p increased from 14 4 mg l and 1 5 mg l in phase i to 22 8 mg l and 3 mg l in phase ii in the post anoxic phase of pfpn sbr respectively fig 3c this was because the enhancement of sludge fermentation increased the loads of ammonium and phosphorus and ammonium and phosphorus were not completely removed in the oxic phase the denitrifying phosphorus removal activity in phase ii was 4 3 fold of that in phase i fig s1 due to the increase of tetrasphaera abundance section 3 4 leading to that the effluent concentrations of no2 n and no3 n decreased below detection limits 0 1 mg l and po4 3 p decreased to 0 62 mg l in phase iii days 101 246 the aeration time in pfpn sbr was extended to improve the removal efficiencies of ammonium and phosphorus the increase of aeration time was beneficial to the rna expression of tetrasphaera section 3 4 in the oxic phase phosphorus produced by sludge fermentation and paos release were completely removed fig 3e and the aerobic phosphorus uptake activity in phase iii were 1 23 fold of that in phase ii fig s1 ammonium was completely oxidized to nitrite or nitrate in the oxic phase of pfpn sbr resulting in the increase of no2 n and no3 n concentrations in pda sbr fig 3ef the activities of anammox increased from 1 42 mg gvss h in phase ii to 1 74 mg gvss h in phase iii fig s1 due to the raise of substrate concentration and the contribution of anammox pathway to tin removal increased from 71 in phase ii to 85 in phase iii fig 2d indicating the anammox became the main pathway for nitrogen removal the nh4 n concentrations in the effluent of pda sbr decreased from 18 mg l in phase ii to 0 in phase iii fig 3df after the discharge of pda sbr 60 pumping into pfpn sbr the effluent concentration of po4 3 p decreased to 0 1 mg l in pda pfpn system fig 2c the denitrifying phosphorus removal activity in phase iii was 1 77 fold of that in phase ii fig s1 the final effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were below detection limits 0 1 mg l in phase iii fig 2a 3 2 nutrient removal mechanism in pda pfpn system typical cycle analysis is presented in fig 3 to reveal the nutrient removal mechanism in three phases of pda pfpn system in the anaerobic stage of phase iii the release amounts of nh4 n were 2 69 fold and 1 1 fold of those in phase i and phase ii respectively due to the raise of tetrasphaera abundance enhancing sludge fermentation section 3 4 since tetrasphaera not only had the fermenting ability but also had the biological phosphorus removal ability the phosphorus removal efficiency was higher in phase iii the release amounts of po4 3 p were 3 1 fold and 1 34 fold of those in phase i and phase ii respectively the cod concentration increased before 12 h and then decreased in the anaerobic stage of phase iii fig 3e due to that there were very few vfas in the influent of pfpn sbr and the released organic matter through sludge fermentation was utilized by heterotrophic bacteria ammonium was completely oxidized to nitrite or nitrate in the oxic stage of phase iii and the nar was about 60 6 fig s1 after the drainage from decant i phase of pfpn sbr 20 and real domestic wastewater 40 pumping into pda sbr the initial concentrations of no2 n and no3 n in pda sbr increased from 20 mg l and 13 mg l in phase ii to 26 mg l and 17 mg l in phase iii respectively in the first 1 h of pda sbr the concentration of no3 n decreased from 17 mg l to 1 9 mg l accompanied by the increase of no2 n concentration through partial denitrification process fig 3f the ntr was about 87 the ammonium in the influent of pda sbr was completely removed through anammox process the contribution of anammox pathway to tin removal was 85 4 fig 2d after the discharge of pda sbr 60 pumping into pfpn sbr residual phosphorus nitrite and nitrate were removed by denitrifying phosphorus removal process the final effluent concentration of po4 3 p was 0 1 mg l and the effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were below detection limits 0 1 mg l in phase iii fig 2a fig 3e table 2 shows the paos stoichiometries in oxic stage of phase iii in this study the pha utilization and glycogen generation were much lower than those in the studies published before and the ratios of p uptake pha utilization and p uptake glycogen generation were much higher than those in the studies published before this indicated that pha and glycogen were not the main internal carbon storage for phosphorus removal variations of intracellular amino acids in typical cycle of pfpn sbr were shown in fig 4 to investigate the internal carbon storage in this study the amounts of intracellular amino acids were determined as lg a where a is amino acids responses measured by lc ms ms the contents of intracellular amino acids increased in the anaerobic stage and then decreased in the oxic and anoxic stage as shown in fig 4 intracellular amino acids were not stored at the same time glutamate aspartic acid and phenylalanine were stored as internal carbon source at the beginning of the anaerobic stage at the end of the anaerobic stage in the three phases the content of intracellular glutamate was the highest and the content of threonine is the lowest indicating glutamate was the main type of intracellular stored amino acids intracellular amino acids are not consumed at the same time intracellular valine glycine and lysine were not consumed in oxic stage while other amino acids are consumed at the beginning of oxic stage in the anoxic stage valine glycine and lysine were the major intracellular carbon sources for denitrifying phosphorus removal process these data indicated that though little pha utilization and glycogen generation were observed in oxic stage table 2 amino acids were an important intracellular carbon storage in pda pfpn system 3 3 was reduction in pda pfpn system not only good performance of nitrogen and phosphorus removal was achieved but also was reduction was achieved in pda pfpn system fig s2 shows the was dosage sludge discharge mlvss mlss cell decay rate and sludge reduction efficiency in pda pfpn system during 246 days at the beginning of the experiment the sludge discharge exceeded sludge dosage due to microbial growth and reproduction as the experiment proceeded sludge fermentation was enhanced leading to the increase of sludge reduction efficiency and decrease of sludge discharge based on eqs 5 the sludge reduction efficiency increased from 16 5 in phase i 37 4 in phase ii to 48 1 in phase iii mlvss mlss decreased from 0 78 in phase i 0 6 in phase ii to 0 57 in phase iii indicating that organics were biodegraded in pda pfpn system according to eqs 6 cell decay rate in phase iii was 2 68 fold and 1 27 fold of that in phase i and phase ii respectively the cell decay rate in phase iii 0 252 d was higher than that reported in the previous literatures wang et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 these data confirmed that nitrogen and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction were simultaneously achieved in pda pfpn system cell integrity dna concentration in the sludge supernatant particle size carbohydrate and protein concentrations and eem spectra in eps were analyzed to reveal the mechanism of was reduction in pda pfpn system which is displayed in fig 5 as shown in fig 5a and b the proportion of intact cells decreased from 94 7 in phase i to 82 9 in phase iii and the proportion of necrotic cells increased from 5 3 in phase i to 17 1 in phase iii in addition dna concentration in the sludge supernatant gradually rose and particle size gradually declined as the experiment proceeded fig 5c these data suggested that cell death and lysis and the release of intracellular substances occurred in this study resulting in the was reduction in pda pfpn system carbohydrate and protein concentrations in eps of phase iii were higher than those in eps of phase i and phase ii fig 5d the raise of carbohydrate and protein concentrations in eps was considered as an indicator that sludge fermentation was strengthened wang et al 2019 furthermore fig 5e and fig 5f show eem spectra of eps in phase i and phase iii respectively the soluble microbial byproduct peak a and tyrosine and tryptophan aromatic protein peak b in phase iii were higher than those in phase i due to the enhancement of sludge fermentation and then these slowly biodegradable organics were hydrolyzed and acidized to vfas for the growth of denitrifying bacteria fig 3e which ensured good performance of nitrogen removal despite no external carbon source was added into pfpn sbr in this study there were nearly no vfas in the influent of pfpn sbr fig 3a c and e and all carbon sources required for nitrogen and phosphorus removal came from sludge fermentation 100 of the external carbon source dosage was saved in pfpn sbr due to sludge fermentation and the sludge reduction efficiency reached 48 1 previous study showed that the sludge treatment cost accounted for up to 60 of the total operating cost in wwtps zhang et al 2019 therefore efficient sludge reduction was of great significance to the operation of wwtps not only that the effluent concentration of po4 3 p was 0 1 mg l and the effluent concentrations of nh4 n no2 n and no3 n were below detection limits 0 1 mg l the pda pfpn system not only achieved highly efficient n and p removal but also enhanced sludge reduction which saved the operation cost of wastewater treatment 3 4 transcriptional community composition in pda pfpn system the transcriptional community compositions top 8 genera in pda pfpn system are displayed in fig 6 including the community structure in pda sbr fig 6a and pfpn sbr fig 6b as shown in fig 6a the relative abundance of thauera at gene level dna high throughput sequencing increased from 12 56 in phase i 27 95 in phase ii to 29 64 in phase iii due to the raise of nitrate concentration in pda sbr section 3 2 the cdna high throughput sequencing transcriptional community composition suggested that thauera that actually played a role accounted for 41 22 of the total bacteria actually working in phase iii the high abundance of thauera ensured partial denitrification in pda pfpn system and the ntr remained above 85 in phase iii section 3 1 and 3 2 the high ntr provided a stable source of nitrite for anammox process in this study candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia were detected as anammox bacteria the raise of nitrite accumulation concentration provided more substrates for anammox process section 3 2 leading to the gradual increase of candidatus brocadia and candidatus kuenenia abundance from phase i phase ii to phase iii the effluent concentration of nh4 n decreased below detection limits 0 1 mg l in phase iii due to the raise of anammox bacteria abundance section 3 2 though the relative abundance of candidatus brocadia was higher than that of candidatus kuenenia at gene level in phase iii the proportion of candidatus brocadia that actually worked in the total bacteria 8 56 was lower than that of candidatus kuenenia 9 98 these data explained why this study determined transcriptional community composition rather than the common gene level analysis the gene level analysis could not determine the bacteria that actually worked and rna expression of functional microorganism in wastewater treatment fig 6b shows that the proportion of tetrasphaera that actually worked in the total bacteria increased from 9 86 in phase i 54 12 in phase ii to 70 8 in phase iii previous study confirmed that tetrasphaera utilized oxygen as electron acceptor to remove phosphorus in oxic stage and acted as denitrifying phosphorus accumulating organisms dpaos to achieve denitrifying p removal using nitrite and nitrate as electron acceptor in anoxic stage marques et al 2018 compared with phase i more ammonium was released due to the enhancement of sludge fermentation in phase ii the ammonium was oxidized to nitrite or nitrate in the oxic phase because of prolonged aeration time in phase iii as a result the effluent concentration of phosphorus decreased from 1 14 mg l in phase i 0 62 mg l in phase ii to 0 1 mg l in phase iii after denitrifying p removal process which explained the increase of relative abundance of tetrasphaera as dpaos tetrasphaera not only had the phosphorus removal ability but also the fermenting ability compared with phase i the extension of the running time of anaerobic phase provided more time for sludge fermentation in phase ii the enhancement of sludge fermentation was beneficial to tetrasphaera leading to the increase of tetrasphaera abundance the release amounts of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p in phase ii were 2 21 fold 2 44 fold and 2 33 fold of those in phase i respectively compared with phase ii the extension of aeration time supplied more electron acceptors for aerobic phosphorus uptake in phase iii the aerobic phosphorus uptake activity in phase iii were 1 23 fold of that in phase ii section 3 1 resulting in the relative abundance of tetrasphaera in phase iii exceeding that in phase ii as a result the release amounts of cod nh4 n and po4 3 p in phase iii were 1 24 fold 1 1 fold and 1 34 fold of those in phase ii respectively in phase iii phosphorus produced by sludge fermentation and paos release were completely removed in the oxic stage and the effluent concentration of po4 3 p decreased from 0 62 mg l in phase ii to 0 1 mg l in phase iii fig s3 shows the transcriptional activities of aob and nob in three phases and the specific primers used are presented in table s1 sludge fermentation was strengthened due to the increasing abundance of tetrasphaera from phase i phase ii to phase iii leading to the raise of nh4 n release the increase of nh4 n concentration provided enough substrates for nitrification which caused the raise of nitrosomonas aob and nitrospira nob abundance from phase i ii to iii fig 6b the transcriptional activities of aob and nob also increased from phase i ii to iii fig s3 therefore though the release amounts of nh4 n in anaerobic stage of phase iii were 2 69 fold and 1 1 fold of those in phase i and phase ii nh4 n was completely oxidized to nitrite or nitrate in the subsequent oxic phase section 3 2 in phase ii and phase iii the relative abundance of nitrosomonas that actually worked exceeded nitrospira fig 6b and the transcriptional activities of aob were also higher than those of nob fig s3 as a result the nar was higher than 60 in phase ii and phase iii the shift of dominant nitrifying genes from phase i to phase ii and iii might be because that the running time of anaerobic phase in pfpn sbr increased from 8 h in phase i to 16 h in phase ii and iii previous study demonstrated that the inhibition effect of prolonged anaerobic running time on nob was stronger than that of aob and the activity recovery of nob was slower than that of aob fan et al 2022 guo et al 2016 3 5 implications of this study the schematic diagram of mechanism in the novel pda pfpn system is shown in fig 7 in anaerobic phase of pfpn sbr tetrasphaera as paos with fermentation ability utilized was as substrate to achieve phosphorus release and sludge fermentation the released vfas were provided for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria and the released nh4 n and po4 3 p were removed by partial nitrification and aerobic p uptake in the oxic stage respectively all nh4 n was oxidized to nitrite or nitrate and the nar exceeded 60 the nitrate from pfpn sbr and cod from real domestic wastewater were utilized as substrates for partial denitrification in pda sbr partial nitrification and partial denitrification provided nitrite for anammox process and the nh4 n required for anammox process came from real domestic wastewater in the post anoxic stage of pfpn sbr po4 3 p from real domestic wastewater and residual nitrite and or nitrate were removed by denitrifying phosphorus removal process table 3 shows the comparisons of the novel pda pfpn system with other systems the removal efficiencies of tin and po4 3 p in this study were higher than those in the reported literatures this was because that in addition to anammox process aerobic p uptake and denitrifying phosphorus removal were also achieved to remove nitrogen and phosphorus in this study though nitrogen and phosphorus removal were achieved in previous study ji et al 2020b the influent was synthetic wastewater rather than real domestic wastewater the practical application value was limited partial denitrification anammox and fermentation were achieved in the literature ji et al 2020c utilizing slowly biodegradable organics in real domestic wastewater however sludge reduction and phosphorus removal were not realized in this literature which could not solve the problems of phosphorus removal and large amount of sludge discharge in wastewater treatment different from the previously reported literatures in this study nitrogen and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction were simultaneously achieved based on partial denitrification anammox biological phosphorus removal fermentation and partial nitrification in treating real domestic wastewater pda pfpn system not only achieved highly efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal without the addition of external carbon source but also greatly reduced the sludge discharge indicating that the novel pda pfpn process had great application value in wastewater treatment 4 conclusion a novel pda pfpn process was established for real domestic wastewater and was treatment after 246 days of operation the novel pda pfpn system not only achieved highly efficient nitrogen and phosphorus removal without adding external carbon source but also greatly reduced the was discharge due to sludge fermentation the tyrosine and tryptophan aromatic protein and soluble microbial byproduct in was were hydrolyzed and acidized into vfas for the growth of heterotrophic bacteria which ensured good performance of nitrogen and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction despite no external carbon source was added to pda pfpn system overall this study provided a new idea to simultaneously achieve nitrogen and phosphorus removal and sludge reduction without adding carbon sources in wastewater treatment declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

16027,oxidative treatment of seawater in coastal and shipboard installations is applied to control biofouling and or minimize the input of noxious or invasive species into the marine environment this treatment allows a safe and efficient operation of industrial installations and helps to protect human health from infectious diseases and to maintain the biodiversity in the marine environment on the downside the application of chemical oxidants generates undesired organic compounds so called disinfection by products dbps which are discharged into the marine environment this article provides an overview on sources and quantities of dbp inputs which could serve as basis for hazard analysis for the marine environment human health and the atmosphere during oxidation of marine water mainly brominated dbps are generated with bromoform chbr3 being the major dbp chbr3 has been used as an indicator to compare inputs from different sources total global annual volumes of treated seawater inputs resulting from cooling processes of coastal power stations from desalination plants and from ballast water treatment in ships are estimated to be 470 800 109 m3 46 109 m3 and 3 5 109 m3 respectively overall the total estimated anthropogenic bromoform production and discharge adds up to 13 5 21 8 106 kg a kg per year with contributions of 11 8 20 1 106 kg a from cooling water treatment 0 89 106 kg a from desalination and 0 86 106 kg a from ballast water treatment this equals approximately 2 6 of the natural bromoform emissions from marine water which is estimated to be 385 870 106 kg a graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products oxidant treatment marine water cooling water desalination ballast water treatment 1 introduction marine water is subject to disinfection for several purposes in cooling water circuits disinfection strives to mitigate biofouling and clogging to guarantee good thermal exchange efficiency and reduce maintenance efforts rajagopal 2012 in desalination plants for potable water production disinfection seeks to limit biofouling and to avoid clogging of in take pipes in membrane based and thermal treatment trains kim et al 2015 ballast water treatment aims to prevent minimize and ultimately eliminate the risks resulting from the discharge of potentially invasive and harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens from ships to the environment and to human health david and gollasch 2015 in municipal wastewater disinfection as well as for seawater toilet systems which are used in some coastal areas with limited freshwater supply with the city of hong kong being the only large scale case worldwide the main purpose of treatment is to limit the discharge of pathogens to the aquatic environment jacangelo and trussell 2002 liu et al 2016 ng 2015 furthermore oxidative treatment is performed in various sectors such as aquaculture and seawater aquaria to control animal diseases and improve water quality qiang et al 2015 however while these latter applications may be locally relevant they are less important as sources of disinfection by products dbps on a global scale and are not further addressed here different chemical oxidants can be used for disinfection purposes they can either be added from storage tanks or be generated in situ for treatment of ocean or brackish waters containing bromide some disinfection techniques including electro chlorination chlorination and ozonation generate hypobromous acid hobr as secondary oxidant in ocean and brackish water hobr and thus produce similar patterns of dbps heeb et al 2014 other oxidation processes e g chlorine dioxide peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide typically produce different patterns of dbps shah et al 2015b however the relative composition and absolute concentrations of dbps also depend on process parameters such as the concentration of active substances reaction time as well as the chemical and physical characteristics of the treated water salinity organic matter temperature etc shah et al 2015a therefore dbp generation typically varies between different applications and sites even if similar or identical processes are applied so far more than 700 anthropogenic dbps have been identified in oxidative water treatment mainly haloorganic compounds also named organohalogens haloorganic compounds are also part of the spectrum of naturally generated compounds with more than 5000 compounds described to be formed by marine organisms gribble 2010 most of these compounds are distinct from dbps and are formed in small quantities by specialized organisms however some of the dbps with the highest concentrations in oxidative seawater treatment are also produced as natural organohalogens with bromoform being a major dbp and similarly a major natural haloorganic product in the marine environment quack and wallace 2003 phytoplankton and macroalgae have been identified as main sources carpenter and liss 2000 hepach et al 2015 the aim of this study is to identify sources and quantify the inputs of major dbps through anthropogenic activities such as industrial cooling units desalination plants ballast water treatment in ships and wastewater treatment seawater toilets to the marine environment to this end an overview on the most prominent treatment processes and regimes i e oxidant concentrations and reaction times is provided for the different industrial processes data on dbp concentrations from different industrial activities is provided with a focus on the most abundant dbps of each compound class to enable a comparative assessment furthermore as the major dbp bromoform is also produced naturally in the marine environment this study also provides an overview on its production from natural processes a quantitative comparison of the anthropogenic bromoform production relative to its overall production is carried out which could serve as a basis for the estimation of potentially harmful impact of anthropogenic dbps to aquatic organisms in the marine environment to human health and the atmosphere this study was initiated by the joint group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine environmental protection gesamp 2022 an expert group of ten un organizations which strives to support sustainable governance of the marine environment by providing a multidisciplinary scientific advice on marine ecosystems and human activities that affect them gesamp is involved in the assessment of risks resulting from ballast water treatment to broaden the perspective towards potential risks of dbp discharges to the marine environment from other sources a workshop was organized involving experts from different backgrounds and a report on the outcomes will be published gesamp in preparation the present study provides a comprehensive compilation of the main aspects related to the quantification of dbp inputs 2 generation of disinfection by products in marine waters various chemical oxidants are used in water treatment for disinfection purposes with chlorine cl2 being the most widely applied in large industrial processes in marine and brackish waters the applied oxidants react with bromide to form various bromine species with hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr being the most important ones the formation of bromine by chemical oxidants such as chlorine ozone and peracetic acid and its reactions with inorganic and organic compounds have been reviewed by heeb et al 2014 depending on the characteristics of the treated waters a large fraction of the applied or formed secondary oxidants reacts with dissolved organic matter dom leading to the formation of dbps processes involved in dbp formation through reaction with dom have been reviewed li and mitch 2018 richardson and ternes 2018 sedlak and von gunten 2011 von gunten 2018 in waters with high bromide levels mainly brominated dbps are formed shah et al 2015a because dbps were first discovered in chlorinated drinking water most of the initially discovered dbps were chlorine containing rook 1974 later on when bromide containing waters were investigated including marine waters many bromo analogues of chlorine containing dbps were identified rook et al 1978 bromine containing compounds represent the largest group of dbps detected in marine waters manasfi et al 2019 werschkun et al 2012 the types and concentrations of the brominated dbps depend strongly on the specific oxidation conditions oxidant dose reaction time temperature etc and on the characteristics and the concentrations of the dissolved organic matter trihalomethanes thms are the most important group of dbps generated during chlorination of both freshwater and marine water who 2017 in freshwater containing low levels of bromide chloroform chcl3 is the major thm generated whereas its brominated analogue bromoform chbr3 predominates at high bromide levels richardson et al 1999 the four major chlorinated brominated thms chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 have been detected in chlorinated marine water with chloroform being very minor and bromoform being by far the major thm shah et al 2015a haloacetic acids haas typically represent the second largest group of dbps formed in oxidative processes in marine water dibromoacetic acid dbaa is observed as the compound with the second highest concentration after bromoform followed by tribromoacetic acid tbaa shah et al 2015a other haas can be detected in considerably lower concentrations including monobromoacetic acid mbaa mono di and trichloroacetic acid along with bromochloro bromodichloro and dibromochloroacetic acids fabbricino and korshin 2005 haas are often summarized as the sum parameter haa5 sum of concentrations of monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa mbaa and dbaa or haa9 which include haa5 and the sum of the concentrations of bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid chlorodibromoacetic acid and tbaa haloacetonitriles hans typically occur at higher concentrations in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking waters than many other nitrogen containing dbps n dbps such as nitrosamines halonitromethanes and haloacetamides krasner et al 2006 in chlorinated seawater hans constitute only a small portion of the formed halogenated dbps with dibromoacetonitrile dban being the predominant han fabbricino and korshin 2005 the formation of hans is related to the presence of nitrogenous precursors e g amino acids in water bromate formation mainly occurs during ozonation shah et al 2015a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 chlorination typically does not lead to bromate formation unless it is in electro chlorination treatment or when the process is catalyzed by metal oxides such as copper oxide jung et al 2014 liu et al 2012 numerous aromatic dbps have been detected in chlorine treated bromide rich drinking water samples pan and zhang 2013 and disinfected saline wastewater effluents ding et al 2013 in chlorinated seawater cooling effluents of power stations 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp has been detected as the most important aromatic dbp allonier et al 1999b boudjellaba et al 2016 since only a fraction of dbps has been identified sum parameters such as adsorbable organic halide aox or total organic halide tox can be used to quantify the total organohalogen content hua and reckhow 2006 kristiana et al 2009 langsa et al 2017 for the same source water the toxic potency of the disinfected water has been reported to be positively correlated with the tox level of the disinfected water han and zhang 2018 the measured individual dbps account for about 40 70 of tox in chlorinated water chen et al 2015 krasner 2009 hence there is a need of sum parameters to evaluate the overall content of halogenated dbps one major challenge is that not all dbps are amenable to extraction methods and chemical analyzes commonly used in the determination of dbps moreover among the extracted dbps many are still unknown this results in a gap between quantified dbps and the sum of organohalogens e g tox accordingly a considerable portion of dbps remains to be discovered by new analytical techniques including improved methods for sample preparation chlorine is used as oxidant for most large scale applications however because concentrations of generated dbps and ratios of different dbps depend on process parameters oxidant concentration reaction time etc and water characteristics dom type and concentration salinity etc each technical installation likely generates specific levels of dbps in the subsequent sections an overview on the process parameters volumes of treated water and dbps generated is provided for major technical applications of oxidative treatment of marine and brackish waters 2 1 cooling waters all industrial cooling systems using seawater are affected by excessive macrofouling settlement and development of sessile marine organisms such as barnacles and mussels that may block condensers or microfouling formation of biofilms that limit heat exchange fossil fuel and nuclear power stations at the seaside are particularly affected by biofouling because of the large water volumes required and the large size and complexity of the cooling systems jenner et al 1997 to maintain water flow and heat exchange at the required level and to avoid disruption of operation of the cooling systems it is necessary to apply anti fouling measures hypochlorite addition represents the most common antifouling treatment in industrial cooling water systems rajagopal 2012 either injected from a hypochlorite storage tank or produced on site electrochemically a low level chlorination process requires to maintain a residual oxidant concentration of about 0 2 mg cl2 l at the outlet of all heat exchangers such as condensers and auxiliary exchangers khalanski and jenner 2012 the applied chlorine dose depends on the water quality such as dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and oxidant demand the growth pressure such as concentration of organisms and season and specificities of the circuits typical chlorine doses range between 0 5 and 1 5 mg cl2 l the most extensive study on dbps in power plant cooling water covers 90 analyzes of cooling water in 10 different coastal power stations in the united kingdom france and the netherlands jenner et al 1997 since then some additional data from these sites and additional analyzes were presented allonier et al 1999a taylor 2006 additionally studies on cooling waters of two korean an indian and a swedish power station were published fogelqvist et al 1982 padhi et al 2012 sim et al 2009 yang 2001 the main results from these studies are summarized in table s1 supporting information si the analyzes of chlorinated cooling water samples show large variations that are not only explained by differences in water quality but also by the variability in circuits complexity and their operation furthermore quantitative comparison of dbp concentrations produced is hampered by differences in study design and quality grab samples vs multiple sampling information on target or effective chlorine dose despite the shortcomings of this heterogeneous data set average concentrations reported are relatively consistent with estimated dbp concentrations based on formation yields of bromoform and other major dbps linked to chlorine dosage assuming an average chlorine dose in power plant cooling water of 0 75 mg l as described by khalanski 2003 average concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups in power station effluents provided in table s1 are used as reference for the assessment 25 3 1 100 µg l for bromoform 9 7 4 10 3 µg l for dbaa 1 1 0 1 3 6 µg l for dban and 0 16 0 002 0 37 µg l for tbp in 2016 approximately 25 000 terawatt hours twh of electricity were produced worldwide iea 2018 in thermal electricity production accounting for 18 900 twh an important fraction of the energy is transformed to heat which needs to be dissipated in coastal power stations once through cooling so called open loop is used for cooling by heating water by t of 10 15 c and subsequent rejection into the surrounding water in total the ratio of dissipated heat into cooling water compared to electricity produced amounts to 1 2 and 2 1 for fossil fuel and nuclear power stations respectively hartmann et al 2011 this results in water consumption of approximately 20 30 m3 s and 33 50 m3 s for fossil fuel or nuclear power stations of 1000 mw respectively the produced electricity thus allows an estimate of the dissipated heat and subsequently the volumes of required cooling water based on an analysis of geographic information maas et al 2021 identified that about one fourth of the power plant capacities are located at the coast and estimated a global volume of discharged cooling water of 8 1011 m3 a into the marine environment this emission estimate is based on an assumption of a high cooling requirement independent of energy source taking into account the lower cooling requirements of fossil power production compared to nuclear power production an alternative value for the annual discharge of 4 7 1011 m3 was estimated details on this estimate are provided as supplementary information table s6 and associated text these two values serve as an estimate of range of discharges into marine waters from energy production 2 2 desalination desalination processes contribute to the water supply in arid regions around the world the global capacity for water production by desalination has been estimated to be 9 5 107 m3 d in 2018 jones et al 2019 however capacity and production are predicted to rapidly increase in the future hanasaki et al 2016 due to rapid population growth and droughts induced by climate change the largest number of desalination plants is present in the middle east including the arabian gulf saudi arabia and the united arab emirates jones et al 2019 important capacities are installed in the mediterranean basin east asia and the pacific as well as the united states jones et al 2019 before 2013 around 60 of global desalination capacity treated seawater while the remainder treated brackish 21 and less saline water 19 bennett 2013 the share of seawater has become larger according to the more recent data published by jones et al 2019 desalination is either based on reverse osmosis ro or distillation i e thermal desalination representing 63 and 31 of the world s treatment capacity respectively gude 2016 to prevent bacterial growth and biofouling in the intake structures and to improve the performance of filters chemical disinfectants are used as a pre treatment before multi media filtration or membrane filtration hypochlorite is the most commonly used disinfectant for pre treatment as well as final disinfection chloramine ozone and chlorine dioxide are alternative disinfectants used less frequently in this context typically for specific treatment objectives kim et al 2015 for ro desalination plants the chlorine dose and contact time vary with the chlorination mode continuous intermittent or shock treatment the location and the objectives intake pipe can be used for other applications e g power plants a dose in the range of 0 2 2 mg cl2 l is typically applied continuously to protect the intake pipe although doses of up to 5 mg cl2 l are used in some installations kim et al 2015 the chlorine contact time can reach 45 60 min followed by an injection of sulfite to quench residual chlorine prior to ro filtration to avoid damage to membranes for distillation plants chlorine doses of approximately 2 mg cl2 l are applied targeting a residual chlorine concentration of 0 2 0 3 mg cl2 l at the heat rejection section and no sulfite injection is required in the production line as a result of disinfection dbps are formed during desalination processes it is important to distinguish between the produced desalinated water which might be dedicated to human consumption and the wastewater typically called brine which is discharged into the sea depending on the treatment process different concentrations of dbps can accumulate in the different water fractions in this paper the brines are the main focus as they represent the main source of dbp inputs into the marine environment resulting from desalination dbp occurrences in brine produced from distillation and ro seawater desalination plants from several previous publications are provided in table s2 si in addition to thms haas and hans low levels of iodinated thms and brominated phenols were reported in a few ro concentrates agus and sedlak 2010 le roux et al 2015 due to the heterogeneity of the installations and studies it is difficult to draw general conclusions on dbp concentrations in discharged brines therefore systematic dbp studies in full scale seawater desalination plants are warranted to provide generalizable information of thms and haas as well as other dbps for each process from several available studies mean concentrations of major dbps were calculated table s2 si average concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups in power station effluents are provided in table s2 are used as reference for the assessment 19 0 2 104 µg l for bromoform 3 6 0 6 11 6 µg l for dbaa 0 7 0 1 2 µg l for dban and 0 75 0 53 0 96 µg l for tbp jones et al 2019 estimate a global brine production and discharge of 1 42 108 m3 d taking into account specificities of combination of desalination technology and different feedwater qualities 1 25 108 m3 d comes from seawater desalination plants situated close to the coastline this equals a total estimated discharge of treated water from desalination plants into the marine environment of 4 6 1010 m3 a 2 3 ballast water treatment ballast water is taken up by ships when cargo is unloaded and discharged when cargo is loaded it is an essential measure to stabilize vessels at sea and it is therefore essential for safe and efficient shipping operations however discharged ballast water can lead to the introduction of non indigenous species into the receiving environment potentially becoming invasive and possibly causing severe ecological economic and human health impacts gollasch 2006 ruiz et al 2000 to address this problem the international maritime organization imo adopted the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments bwmc 2004 which entered into force in 2017 the convention sets a maximum permissible concentration standard for living organisms in discharged ballast water for all ships in international traffic although a wide range of treatment technologies have been assessed to meet the standards two treatment technologies are currently evolving as the major market shares ultraviolet radiation uv and chemical oxidation mainly hypochlorite added as a chemical or generated in situ by electrolysis i e electro chlorination both combined with filtration typically the treatment is performed during the uptake of the ballast water oxidant doses ranging from 2 to 20 mg cl2 l are used in imo approved ballast water management systems bwms the reaction in the ballast water tank continues as long as residual oxidants are available and can last up to the total holding time of the ballast water which may be as long as 21 d many systems aim to maintain a certain concentration of residual oxidants over the total ballast water holding time to maintain the biocidal potential and prevent the re growth of organisms to prevent a release of residual oxidants into the environment often reducing agents such as thiosulfate or sulfite are added prior to or during the discharge of treated ballast water david et al 2018 analyzed data on dbp concentrations in 36 bwms submitted to the imo approval process and assessed according to the established methodology gesamp 2019 bromoform was detected in discharged water of all investigated bwms whereas dbaa dibromochloromethane and mbaa were detected in the discharged water of 34 33 and 30 out of the 36 bwms respectively less frequently 24 other dbps were detected an overview on relative frequencies of occurrences and mean and maximum concentrations in ballast water discharge during the test scenarios is provided in table s3 si dbp formation depends on oxidant type and concentration with most dbps formed in systems applying hypochlorite treatment due to more variable water quality characteristics resulting from ship movements compared to fixed installations a higher variability of the extent of dbp formation can be expected in operating bwms it should be noted that imo regulations require bwms to be tested under most challenging conditions including very high concentrations of organic matter dbp concentrations observed under these conditions are likely higher than those generated under normal operating conditions of the bwms in natural waters mean concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups in ballast water from this analysis are used as reference for the assessment in this study 247 0 08 920 µg l for bromoform 49 0 14 230 µg l for dbaa 23 0 28 133 µg l for dban and 0 27 0 1 0 45 µg l for 2 4 6 tbp the annual global ballast water discharge from vessels in the international seaborne trade was estimated as 3 1 109 m3 in 2013 david 2015 another estimate provides a value of 1010 m3 of ballast water per year who 2011 today estimates from the imo suggest that uv treatment or electro chlorination systems have been installed on vessels as the dominant technologies with a market share of about one third each the use of oxidants and other disinfection processes might represent most of the rest it is currently unclear what percentage of ballast water volumes will be treated with oxidants in 2024 when the whole fleet will have to be equipped with bwms for the assessment in this study it is assumed that a total of 7 109 m3 of ballast water is taken from the aquatic environment by ships each year of which 50 is subject to oxidative treatment resulting in an estimated total annual volume of 3 5 109 m3 by 2024 2 4 wastewater treatment disinfection of wastewater prior to effluent discharge to the sea is used to preserve the health of the coastal marine environment yang et al 2000 and to protect humans against exposure to waterborne pathogenic microorganisms notably from fecal contamination mansilha et al 2009 the most common treatments include oxidation especially chlorination and uv irradiation jacangelo and trussell 2002 chlorination is still the most widely used method for disinfection of municipal wastewater effluents both in europe collivignarelli et al 2017 and the usa krasner et al 2009 report that wastewater treatment plants apply median chlorine doses of 2 4 2 7 mg cl2 l in the usa wastewater chlorination is commonly followed by a dechlorination step before the discharge of the effluents to the receiving waters chlorine and to a lesser extent chloramines can react with organic matter present in municipal wastewater to produce various dbps the wide array of formed dbps include thms haas and halogenated nitrogenous dbps sgroi et al 2018 krasner et al 2009 showed that chlorination of wastewater resulted in different dbp formation patterns depending on whether or not the treatment plant achieved good nitrification some results from this study are provided in table s4 si as stated above disinfection of municipal wastewater is applied worldwide however as the information is patchy it is difficult to quantify the total volumes treated and volumes entering the marine environment therefore for this study no reliable information on the volumes of oxidatively treated sewage water discharged into the marine environment could be compiled since the relevance of these inputs is unknown for estimating dbp inputs into the marine environment at this point they are not further considered here 2 5 seawater toilets to mitigate the shortage of freshwater supply seawater is used for toilet flushing in different coastal areas including hong kong the city of avalon california and several pacific regions including the marshall islands and kiribati boehm et al 2009 mirti and davies 2005 tang et al 2007 in hong kong where this practice has been extensively implemented since the 1950s a total of 2 7 108 m3 of seawater is supplied every year hk wsd 2018 the seawater is treated with chlorine or hypochlorite generated on site before being pumped to service reservoirs and distributed to consumers and then mixed with other domestic sewage and enters the sewage systems in hong kong where it is again treated with chlorine prior to discharge in hong kong s seawater supply typical chlorine doses are reported as 3 6 mg cl2 l for the intake of seawater 15 mg cl2 l 12 min contact time for the disinfection of primary sewage effluent and 4 18 mg cl2 l 15 30 min contact time for the disinfection of secondary sewage effluent ding et al 2013 gong and zhang 2015 as the seawater after toilet flushing is mixed with other domestic sewage and enters the sewage systems in hong kong very high levels of sea salts particularly bromide are introduced into the sewage due to the variety of dissolved organic matter including compounds derived from microorganism metabolization along with human and industrial waste a higher complexity of dbps can be formed in chlorinated saline sewage effluents than in chlorinated marine water nevertheless commonly known dbps such as thms and haas have been reported to form in chlorinated saline sewage effluents as major compounds sun et al 2009 yang et al 2005 an overview of the typical levels of dbps reported in chlorinated saline sewage effluents in hong kong is provided in table s5 si many polar semi polar brominated and iodinated aromatic dbps have also been detected ding et al 2013 gong and zhang 2015 gong et al 2016 mean concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups in seawater toilet effluents are used as reference for the assessment in this study 32 µg l for bromoform 9 µg l for dbaa and 0 97 µg l for 2 4 6 tbp to date only a few coastal cities have adopted seawater toilets requiring saline sewage effluents and generating halogenated dbps the saline sewage discharge in hong kong has been estimated to be 1 0 109 m3 a this likely represents one of the largest volumes of treated wastewater inputs into the marine environment which might be considered as a local hotspot 3 overview on treatment processes volumes and dbp concentrations an overview on oxidant treatment conditions and estimated global volumes of water treated in the different industrial sectors is provided in table 1 treatment processes differ in typically applied oxidant doses and in reaction times along the coast where water resources are abundant billions of m3 of seawater are used mostly for cooling of power plants and other industrial installations and desalination global cooling water discharge to marine water is estimated in the range of 4 7 1011 8 0 1011 m3 a desalination plants treat high amounts of marine water mostly in arid regions the global volume of discharged concentrate brine is estimated to be 4 6 1010 m3 a more than 50 of discharge originates from desalination plants located on the arabian peninsula thus other regions are considered to be less impacted from desalination discharge input of treated ballast water may add locally to the dbp concentrations around large ports maas et al 2019 all applications are expected to expand due to increasing demand from economic development and population growth in table 2 an overview is provided on the mean concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups detected in the treated or discharged water of the different industrial activities the data show that dbp concentrations are generally higher in ballast water compared to other sectors e g for bromoform the major dbp a mean concentration of 247 µg l was detected whereas only about 10 of this level is typically observed in power plant cooling water desalination brine and wastewater effluent from seawater toilets the relatively high concentration in ballast water is coherent with the high oxidant doses and long contact times for these treatments furthermore dbps containing chlorine appear to be present in relatively low concentrations in power plant cooling water jenner et al 1997 compared to discharge from other sectors possibly reflecting the more constant quality of marine water treated ballast water and municipal wastewater may be characterized by varying water qualities and thus also varying bromide concentrations which might shift the spectrum of generated dbps to chlorinated species david et al 2018 based on the volumes of treated water in the different sectors table 1 and the observed mean dbp concentrations in the treated water or discharge table 2 the global production of dbps from industrial activities can be estimated table 3 provides the estimated global production for bromoform it is assumed that the major part of the produced dbps represents direct inputs into the marine environment since bromoform is the most prominent dbp it may serve as a proxy to compare the inputs from different sectors the total estimated anthropogenic bromoform production and discharge adds up to 1 35 107 2 18 107 kg a with contributions of 1 18 107 2 01 107 kg a from cooling water 8 9 105 kg a from desalination 8 6 105 kg a from ballast water and 3 104 kg a from saline sewage treatment hong kong only most of the estimates are based on realistic assumptions for discharged water volumes and mean values for observed or estimated dbp concentrations therefore this assessment does not represent a worst case scenario environmental concentrations of dbps depend on the quantities emitted but also on the characteristics of the receiving environment and natural background concentrations furthermore the fate of the individual dbps in the surface water depends on the lifetime solubility and volatility of the compound the major dbp bromoform is volatile and expected to be outgassed relatively quickly and no long term accumulation in the ocean is expected environmental concentrations can be assessed by measurements of dbps in receiving environments or by predicting the estimated dilution of the effluents examples for measured environmental dbp concentrations have been reported for water in the vicinity of power plants polman 2018 and in receiving seawater for treated sewage effluents feng et al 2019 environmental concentrations can also be estimated based on the knowledge about dbp concentrations in effluents and on assumptions of specific or generic dilutions predicted environmental concentrations pec have been established for cooling water on the local and regional scale assuming dilution factors of the effluent of 20 and 100 respectively khalanski 2003 and ballast water by model dilution of measured discharge concentrations in a generic harbour david et al 2018 gesamp 2019 on local and short time scales of a few days all dbp discharges from anthropogenic activities contribute to the concentration in the aquatic environment in continuous discharges transient concentrations may be established reflecting an equilibrium of inputs dilution evaporation and degradation of compounds hence at large industrial sites where ports power plants or desalination plants are located the dbp inputs in discharged waters can sum up and significantly increase dbp concentrations in the coastal ocean this is important for metropolitan areas in temperate zones like europe and north america or tropical and subtropical regions like east and southeast asia 4 discussion a quantitative comparison between dbp inputs from different industries is hampered by the heterogeneity of the analyzed studies having various objectives analytical techniques and sampling strategies furthermore as characteristics of the treated water are known to influence dpb formation generalizations have to be interpreted with caution information on the total generated concentrations of halogenated organic compounds i e in form of sum parameters such as adsorbable organic halogen aox that would allow a total measure of dbp inputs is typically not available additional uncertainties may exist for instance average bromoform concentrations observed in cooling water were used for the assessment keeping in mind that the majority of available data was obtained from studies conducted in european power stations and may not be representative for power stations in other world regions for a regional assessment maas et al 2021 estimated higher bromoform emissions for east asian power stations however despite the uncertainties underlying the summarized data and the necessity of estimations to fill data gaps general conclusions appear warranted when the orders of magnitude of inputs are considered bromoform which was used as a proxy for the input of dbps into the marine environment is also synthesized in large quantities by phytoplankton and macroalgae in the oceans quack and wallace 2003 furthermore bromophenols with 2 4 6 tribromophenol most often detected are part of the natural bromine containing compounds of marine origin gribble 2010 for most other dbps no or only very limited natural production has been described therefore most dbps have to be considered as mainly anthropogenic compounds with little overlap with natural compounds except for bromoform and bromophenols for local risk assessment for the aquatic environment typically measured or predicted environmental concentrations pec of individual compounds are compared to their predicted no effect concentrations pnec where a ratio of pec pnec 1 indicates that no unacceptable risks to the aquatic environment may be expected pnec values for the most important dbps observed in marine water have been proposed by gesamp 2019 as environmental dbp concentrations depend on specific discharge conditions and dilution in receiving waters any risk assessment process is site or scenario specific thus general conclusions on environmental risks of dbps in marine water are not possible most known dbps are not bioaccumulative and are quickly eliminated and thus not considered to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms nor to biomagnify in the food chain gesamp 2019 khalanski and jenner 2012 the low bioaccumulation potential of major known dbps and the important dilution rate in ocean water suggest that the risks for the aquatic environment posed by dbps are low on larger scales and distances from discharge although in specific exposure situation such as in harbours and close to industrial discharges local effects on aquatic organisms may occur similarly for the human health risk assessment estimated human exposure levels are compared to derived no effect levels dnel and derived minimal effect levels dmel for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic compounds respectively where a risk characterization ratio estimated exposure level dnel or dmel rcr 1 indicates that no unacceptable risks for humans may be expected dnel and dmel for major dbps are proposed by dock et al 2019 and gesamp 2019 for discharge of treated ballast water exposure from two different scenarios covering direct contact i e swimming near a ship during ballast water discharge and seafood consumption did not indicate any significant health effects dock et al 2019 similar assessments are not available for discharges from other industrial applications bromoform is a major carrier of bromine from the ocean to the atmosphere penkett et al 1985 if it reaches the atmospheric boundary layer it is oxidized or photo dissociated to reactive halogen species which contribute to the depletion of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone by catalytic cycles saiz lopez and von glasow 2012 tegtmeier et al 2020 wmo 2018 the global bromoform emissions from marine water resulting from natural sources have been estimated to be 3 85 108 8 70 108 kg a wang et al 2019 yokouchi et al 2005 therefore based on the assessment in this study anthropogenic bromoform discharge into the marine water resulting from the considered industrial treatments equals approximately 2 6 of those global marine bromoform emissions depending on whether higher or lower boundaries are used table 3 this range reflects the uncertainty of the estimated anthropogenic inputs and natural production potentially the inputs could be higher in case the conducted studies on dbp concentrations in cooling water are not representative for other regions and other anthropogenic inputs may also be quantitatively relevant e g emission from wastewater treatment which could not be quantified due to missing data furthermore anthropogenic emission to the atmosphere may be underestimated in this study focusing mainly on marine inputs as 90 of thms produced in thermal desalination plants are rejected as vent gases le roux et al 2015 therefore an additional assessment of the overall thm production emitted to the atmosphere either from water or directly should be conducted when aiming to address potential effects on the atmosphere quivet et al 2022 5 conclusion this study identifies sources and quantities of inputs of major dbps through oxidative industrial processes to marine water including industrial cooling desalination ballast water treatment and seawater toilets with the following main outcomes disinfection by products dbps are produced during oxidative water treatment for disinfection purposes or biofouling control in industrial processes using marine or brackish water due to the high concentration of bromide which is oxidized to hypobromous acid by many oxidants brominated dbps are most abundant in treated marine water bromoform has been identified as the major dbp in all industrial applications using oxidants in seawater furthermore other dbps e g bromochloromethanes haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles and halophenols have been observed with dibromoacetic acid tribromoacetic acid dibromoacetonitrile 2 4 6 tribromophenol and bromate being often detected absolute concentrations and relative abundance of the different dbps vary between different applications reflecting variable process parameters e g oxidant dose and reaction time and water quality parameters e g characteristics and concentration of dissolved organic matter a quantification of global discharges of dbps from industrial processes showed that cooling water was the major anthropogenic source followed by desalination brine and ballast water since bromoform is the most abundant dbp it may serve as a proxy to compare the inputs from different sources the total estimated anthropogenic bromoform discharged into marine water adds up to 1 35 107 2 18 107 kg a which is considerably lower than the estimated natural emissions from marine water of 3 85 108 8 70 108 kg a although there are high quality studies on individual sites e g cooling circuits of some nuclear power plants and rather abundant information of dbp generation in ballast water treatment a comprehensive risk or impact assessment is hampered by a lack of data uncertainties arise from missing information e g volume of marine water used for cooling purposes worldwide dbp concentrations in cooling water from not yet studied regions and from unknown future developments e g an increasing number of desalination plants or the fraction of ballast water management systems using oxidants to be installed nevertheless the estimates from this study suggest that industrial bromoform inputs into marine water are minor compared to the natural marine emission 10 more harmonized studies on the different major dbps identified in oxidant treated effluents are warranted to allow a more systematic overview on dbp variety in the different industries and regions strengthening of international efforts in ocean science to build up a better database on

16027,oxidative treatment of seawater in coastal and shipboard installations is applied to control biofouling and or minimize the input of noxious or invasive species into the marine environment this treatment allows a safe and efficient operation of industrial installations and helps to protect human health from infectious diseases and to maintain the biodiversity in the marine environment on the downside the application of chemical oxidants generates undesired organic compounds so called disinfection by products dbps which are discharged into the marine environment this article provides an overview on sources and quantities of dbp inputs which could serve as basis for hazard analysis for the marine environment human health and the atmosphere during oxidation of marine water mainly brominated dbps are generated with bromoform chbr3 being the major dbp chbr3 has been used as an indicator to compare inputs from different sources total global annual volumes of treated seawater inputs resulting from cooling processes of coastal power stations from desalination plants and from ballast water treatment in ships are estimated to be 470 800 109 m3 46 109 m3 and 3 5 109 m3 respectively overall the total estimated anthropogenic bromoform production and discharge adds up to 13 5 21 8 106 kg a kg per year with contributions of 11 8 20 1 106 kg a from cooling water treatment 0 89 106 kg a from desalination and 0 86 106 kg a from ballast water treatment this equals approximately 2 6 of the natural bromoform emissions from marine water which is estimated to be 385 870 106 kg a graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords disinfection by products oxidant treatment marine water cooling water desalination ballast water treatment 1 introduction marine water is subject to disinfection for several purposes in cooling water circuits disinfection strives to mitigate biofouling and clogging to guarantee good thermal exchange efficiency and reduce maintenance efforts rajagopal 2012 in desalination plants for potable water production disinfection seeks to limit biofouling and to avoid clogging of in take pipes in membrane based and thermal treatment trains kim et al 2015 ballast water treatment aims to prevent minimize and ultimately eliminate the risks resulting from the discharge of potentially invasive and harmful aquatic organisms and pathogens from ships to the environment and to human health david and gollasch 2015 in municipal wastewater disinfection as well as for seawater toilet systems which are used in some coastal areas with limited freshwater supply with the city of hong kong being the only large scale case worldwide the main purpose of treatment is to limit the discharge of pathogens to the aquatic environment jacangelo and trussell 2002 liu et al 2016 ng 2015 furthermore oxidative treatment is performed in various sectors such as aquaculture and seawater aquaria to control animal diseases and improve water quality qiang et al 2015 however while these latter applications may be locally relevant they are less important as sources of disinfection by products dbps on a global scale and are not further addressed here different chemical oxidants can be used for disinfection purposes they can either be added from storage tanks or be generated in situ for treatment of ocean or brackish waters containing bromide some disinfection techniques including electro chlorination chlorination and ozonation generate hypobromous acid hobr as secondary oxidant in ocean and brackish water hobr and thus produce similar patterns of dbps heeb et al 2014 other oxidation processes e g chlorine dioxide peracetic acid and hydrogen peroxide typically produce different patterns of dbps shah et al 2015b however the relative composition and absolute concentrations of dbps also depend on process parameters such as the concentration of active substances reaction time as well as the chemical and physical characteristics of the treated water salinity organic matter temperature etc shah et al 2015a therefore dbp generation typically varies between different applications and sites even if similar or identical processes are applied so far more than 700 anthropogenic dbps have been identified in oxidative water treatment mainly haloorganic compounds also named organohalogens haloorganic compounds are also part of the spectrum of naturally generated compounds with more than 5000 compounds described to be formed by marine organisms gribble 2010 most of these compounds are distinct from dbps and are formed in small quantities by specialized organisms however some of the dbps with the highest concentrations in oxidative seawater treatment are also produced as natural organohalogens with bromoform being a major dbp and similarly a major natural haloorganic product in the marine environment quack and wallace 2003 phytoplankton and macroalgae have been identified as main sources carpenter and liss 2000 hepach et al 2015 the aim of this study is to identify sources and quantify the inputs of major dbps through anthropogenic activities such as industrial cooling units desalination plants ballast water treatment in ships and wastewater treatment seawater toilets to the marine environment to this end an overview on the most prominent treatment processes and regimes i e oxidant concentrations and reaction times is provided for the different industrial processes data on dbp concentrations from different industrial activities is provided with a focus on the most abundant dbps of each compound class to enable a comparative assessment furthermore as the major dbp bromoform is also produced naturally in the marine environment this study also provides an overview on its production from natural processes a quantitative comparison of the anthropogenic bromoform production relative to its overall production is carried out which could serve as a basis for the estimation of potentially harmful impact of anthropogenic dbps to aquatic organisms in the marine environment to human health and the atmosphere this study was initiated by the joint group of experts on the scientific aspects of marine environmental protection gesamp 2022 an expert group of ten un organizations which strives to support sustainable governance of the marine environment by providing a multidisciplinary scientific advice on marine ecosystems and human activities that affect them gesamp is involved in the assessment of risks resulting from ballast water treatment to broaden the perspective towards potential risks of dbp discharges to the marine environment from other sources a workshop was organized involving experts from different backgrounds and a report on the outcomes will be published gesamp in preparation the present study provides a comprehensive compilation of the main aspects related to the quantification of dbp inputs 2 generation of disinfection by products in marine waters various chemical oxidants are used in water treatment for disinfection purposes with chlorine cl2 being the most widely applied in large industrial processes in marine and brackish waters the applied oxidants react with bromide to form various bromine species with hypobromous acid hypobromite hobr obr being the most important ones the formation of bromine by chemical oxidants such as chlorine ozone and peracetic acid and its reactions with inorganic and organic compounds have been reviewed by heeb et al 2014 depending on the characteristics of the treated waters a large fraction of the applied or formed secondary oxidants reacts with dissolved organic matter dom leading to the formation of dbps processes involved in dbp formation through reaction with dom have been reviewed li and mitch 2018 richardson and ternes 2018 sedlak and von gunten 2011 von gunten 2018 in waters with high bromide levels mainly brominated dbps are formed shah et al 2015a because dbps were first discovered in chlorinated drinking water most of the initially discovered dbps were chlorine containing rook 1974 later on when bromide containing waters were investigated including marine waters many bromo analogues of chlorine containing dbps were identified rook et al 1978 bromine containing compounds represent the largest group of dbps detected in marine waters manasfi et al 2019 werschkun et al 2012 the types and concentrations of the brominated dbps depend strongly on the specific oxidation conditions oxidant dose reaction time temperature etc and on the characteristics and the concentrations of the dissolved organic matter trihalomethanes thms are the most important group of dbps generated during chlorination of both freshwater and marine water who 2017 in freshwater containing low levels of bromide chloroform chcl3 is the major thm generated whereas its brominated analogue bromoform chbr3 predominates at high bromide levels richardson et al 1999 the four major chlorinated brominated thms chcl3 chbrcl2 chbr2cl and chbr3 have been detected in chlorinated marine water with chloroform being very minor and bromoform being by far the major thm shah et al 2015a haloacetic acids haas typically represent the second largest group of dbps formed in oxidative processes in marine water dibromoacetic acid dbaa is observed as the compound with the second highest concentration after bromoform followed by tribromoacetic acid tbaa shah et al 2015a other haas can be detected in considerably lower concentrations including monobromoacetic acid mbaa mono di and trichloroacetic acid along with bromochloro bromodichloro and dibromochloroacetic acids fabbricino and korshin 2005 haas are often summarized as the sum parameter haa5 sum of concentrations of monochloroacetic acid mcaa dichloroacetic acid dcaa trichloroacetic acid tcaa mbaa and dbaa or haa9 which include haa5 and the sum of the concentrations of bromochloroacetic acid bcaa bromodichloroacetic acid chlorodibromoacetic acid and tbaa haloacetonitriles hans typically occur at higher concentrations in chlorinated and chloraminated drinking waters than many other nitrogen containing dbps n dbps such as nitrosamines halonitromethanes and haloacetamides krasner et al 2006 in chlorinated seawater hans constitute only a small portion of the formed halogenated dbps with dibromoacetonitrile dban being the predominant han fabbricino and korshin 2005 the formation of hans is related to the presence of nitrogenous precursors e g amino acids in water bromate formation mainly occurs during ozonation shah et al 2015a von sonntag and von gunten 2012 chlorination typically does not lead to bromate formation unless it is in electro chlorination treatment or when the process is catalyzed by metal oxides such as copper oxide jung et al 2014 liu et al 2012 numerous aromatic dbps have been detected in chlorine treated bromide rich drinking water samples pan and zhang 2013 and disinfected saline wastewater effluents ding et al 2013 in chlorinated seawater cooling effluents of power stations 2 4 6 tribromophenol tbp has been detected as the most important aromatic dbp allonier et al 1999b boudjellaba et al 2016 since only a fraction of dbps has been identified sum parameters such as adsorbable organic halide aox or total organic halide tox can be used to quantify the total organohalogen content hua and reckhow 2006 kristiana et al 2009 langsa et al 2017 for the same source water the toxic potency of the disinfected water has been reported to be positively correlated with the tox level of the disinfected water han and zhang 2018 the measured individual dbps account for about 40 70 of tox in chlorinated water chen et al 2015 krasner 2009 hence there is a need of sum parameters to evaluate the overall content of halogenated dbps one major challenge is that not all dbps are amenable to extraction methods and chemical analyzes commonly used in the determination of dbps moreover among the extracted dbps many are still unknown this results in a gap between quantified dbps and the sum of organohalogens e g tox accordingly a considerable portion of dbps remains to be discovered by new analytical techniques including improved methods for sample preparation chlorine is used as oxidant for most large scale applications however because concentrations of generated dbps and ratios of different dbps depend on process parameters oxidant concentration reaction time etc and water characteristics dom type and concentration salinity etc each technical installation likely generates specific levels of dbps in the subsequent sections an overview on the process parameters volumes of treated water and dbps generated is provided for major technical applications of oxidative treatment of marine and brackish waters 2 1 cooling waters all industrial cooling systems using seawater are affected by excessive macrofouling settlement and development of sessile marine organisms such as barnacles and mussels that may block condensers or microfouling formation of biofilms that limit heat exchange fossil fuel and nuclear power stations at the seaside are particularly affected by biofouling because of the large water volumes required and the large size and complexity of the cooling systems jenner et al 1997 to maintain water flow and heat exchange at the required level and to avoid disruption of operation of the cooling systems it is necessary to apply anti fouling measures hypochlorite addition represents the most common antifouling treatment in industrial cooling water systems rajagopal 2012 either injected from a hypochlorite storage tank or produced on site electrochemically a low level chlorination process requires to maintain a residual oxidant concentration of about 0 2 mg cl2 l at the outlet of all heat exchangers such as condensers and auxiliary exchangers khalanski and jenner 2012 the applied chlorine dose depends on the water quality such as dissolved organic carbon doc concentration and oxidant demand the growth pressure such as concentration of organisms and season and specificities of the circuits typical chlorine doses range between 0 5 and 1 5 mg cl2 l the most extensive study on dbps in power plant cooling water covers 90 analyzes of cooling water in 10 different coastal power stations in the united kingdom france and the netherlands jenner et al 1997 since then some additional data from these sites and additional analyzes were presented allonier et al 1999a taylor 2006 additionally studies on cooling waters of two korean an indian and a swedish power station were published fogelqvist et al 1982 padhi et al 2012 sim et al 2009 yang 2001 the main results from these studies are summarized in table s1 supporting information si the analyzes of chlorinated cooling water samples show large variations that are not only explained by differences in water quality but also by the variability in circuits complexity and their operation furthermore quantitative comparison of dbp concentrations produced is hampered by differences in study design and quality grab samples vs multiple sampling information on target or effective chlorine dose despite the shortcomings of this heterogeneous data set average concentrations reported are relatively consistent with estimated dbp concentrations based on formation yields of bromoform and other major dbps linked to chlorine dosage assuming an average chlorine dose in power plant cooling water of 0 75 mg l as described by khalanski 2003 average concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups in power station effluents provided in table s1 are used as reference for the assessment 25 3 1 100 µg l for bromoform 9 7 4 10 3 µg l for dbaa 1 1 0 1 3 6 µg l for dban and 0 16 0 002 0 37 µg l for tbp in 2016 approximately 25 000 terawatt hours twh of electricity were produced worldwide iea 2018 in thermal electricity production accounting for 18 900 twh an important fraction of the energy is transformed to heat which needs to be dissipated in coastal power stations once through cooling so called open loop is used for cooling by heating water by t of 10 15 c and subsequent rejection into the surrounding water in total the ratio of dissipated heat into cooling water compared to electricity produced amounts to 1 2 and 2 1 for fossil fuel and nuclear power stations respectively hartmann et al 2011 this results in water consumption of approximately 20 30 m3 s and 33 50 m3 s for fossil fuel or nuclear power stations of 1000 mw respectively the produced electricity thus allows an estimate of the dissipated heat and subsequently the volumes of required cooling water based on an analysis of geographic information maas et al 2021 identified that about one fourth of the power plant capacities are located at the coast and estimated a global volume of discharged cooling water of 8 1011 m3 a into the marine environment this emission estimate is based on an assumption of a high cooling requirement independent of energy source taking into account the lower cooling requirements of fossil power production compared to nuclear power production an alternative value for the annual discharge of 4 7 1011 m3 was estimated details on this estimate are provided as supplementary information table s6 and associated text these two values serve as an estimate of range of discharges into marine waters from energy production 2 2 desalination desalination processes contribute to the water supply in arid regions around the world the global capacity for water production by desalination has been estimated to be 9 5 107 m3 d in 2018 jones et al 2019 however capacity and production are predicted to rapidly increase in the future hanasaki et al 2016 due to rapid population growth and droughts induced by climate change the largest number of desalination plants is present in the middle east including the arabian gulf saudi arabia and the united arab emirates jones et al 2019 important capacities are installed in the mediterranean basin east asia and the pacific as well as the united states jones et al 2019 before 2013 around 60 of global desalination capacity treated seawater while the remainder treated brackish 21 and less saline water 19 bennett 2013 the share of seawater has become larger according to the more recent data published by jones et al 2019 desalination is either based on reverse osmosis ro or distillation i e thermal desalination representing 63 and 31 of the world s treatment capacity respectively gude 2016 to prevent bacterial growth and biofouling in the intake structures and to improve the performance of filters chemical disinfectants are used as a pre treatment before multi media filtration or membrane filtration hypochlorite is the most commonly used disinfectant for pre treatment as well as final disinfection chloramine ozone and chlorine dioxide are alternative disinfectants used less frequently in this context typically for specific treatment objectives kim et al 2015 for ro desalination plants the chlorine dose and contact time vary with the chlorination mode continuous intermittent or shock treatment the location and the objectives intake pipe can be used for other applications e g power plants a dose in the range of 0 2 2 mg cl2 l is typically applied continuously to protect the intake pipe although doses of up to 5 mg cl2 l are used in some installations kim et al 2015 the chlorine contact time can reach 45 60 min followed by an injection of sulfite to quench residual chlorine prior to ro filtration to avoid damage to membranes for distillation plants chlorine doses of approximately 2 mg cl2 l are applied targeting a residual chlorine concentration of 0 2 0 3 mg cl2 l at the heat rejection section and no sulfite injection is required in the production line as a result of disinfection dbps are formed during desalination processes it is important to distinguish between the produced desalinated water which might be dedicated to human consumption and the wastewater typically called brine which is discharged into the sea depending on the treatment process different concentrations of dbps can accumulate in the different water fractions in this paper the brines are the main focus as they represent the main source of dbp inputs into the marine environment resulting from desalination dbp occurrences in brine produced from distillation and ro seawater desalination plants from several previous publications are provided in table s2 si in addition to thms haas and hans low levels of iodinated thms and brominated phenols were reported in a few ro concentrates agus and sedlak 2010 le roux et al 2015 due to the heterogeneity of the installations and studies it is difficult to draw general conclusions on dbp concentrations in discharged brines therefore systematic dbp studies in full scale seawater desalination plants are warranted to provide generalizable information of thms and haas as well as other dbps for each process from several available studies mean concentrations of major dbps were calculated table s2 si average concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups in power station effluents are provided in table s2 are used as reference for the assessment 19 0 2 104 µg l for bromoform 3 6 0 6 11 6 µg l for dbaa 0 7 0 1 2 µg l for dban and 0 75 0 53 0 96 µg l for tbp jones et al 2019 estimate a global brine production and discharge of 1 42 108 m3 d taking into account specificities of combination of desalination technology and different feedwater qualities 1 25 108 m3 d comes from seawater desalination plants situated close to the coastline this equals a total estimated discharge of treated water from desalination plants into the marine environment of 4 6 1010 m3 a 2 3 ballast water treatment ballast water is taken up by ships when cargo is unloaded and discharged when cargo is loaded it is an essential measure to stabilize vessels at sea and it is therefore essential for safe and efficient shipping operations however discharged ballast water can lead to the introduction of non indigenous species into the receiving environment potentially becoming invasive and possibly causing severe ecological economic and human health impacts gollasch 2006 ruiz et al 2000 to address this problem the international maritime organization imo adopted the international convention for the control and management of ships ballast water and sediments bwmc 2004 which entered into force in 2017 the convention sets a maximum permissible concentration standard for living organisms in discharged ballast water for all ships in international traffic although a wide range of treatment technologies have been assessed to meet the standards two treatment technologies are currently evolving as the major market shares ultraviolet radiation uv and chemical oxidation mainly hypochlorite added as a chemical or generated in situ by electrolysis i e electro chlorination both combined with filtration typically the treatment is performed during the uptake of the ballast water oxidant doses ranging from 2 to 20 mg cl2 l are used in imo approved ballast water management systems bwms the reaction in the ballast water tank continues as long as residual oxidants are available and can last up to the total holding time of the ballast water which may be as long as 21 d many systems aim to maintain a certain concentration of residual oxidants over the total ballast water holding time to maintain the biocidal potential and prevent the re growth of organisms to prevent a release of residual oxidants into the environment often reducing agents such as thiosulfate or sulfite are added prior to or during the discharge of treated ballast water david et al 2018 analyzed data on dbp concentrations in 36 bwms submitted to the imo approval process and assessed according to the established methodology gesamp 2019 bromoform was detected in discharged water of all investigated bwms whereas dbaa dibromochloromethane and mbaa were detected in the discharged water of 34 33 and 30 out of the 36 bwms respectively less frequently 24 other dbps were detected an overview on relative frequencies of occurrences and mean and maximum concentrations in ballast water discharge during the test scenarios is provided in table s3 si dbp formation depends on oxidant type and concentration with most dbps formed in systems applying hypochlorite treatment due to more variable water quality characteristics resulting from ship movements compared to fixed installations a higher variability of the extent of dbp formation can be expected in operating bwms it should be noted that imo regulations require bwms to be tested under most challenging conditions including very high concentrations of organic matter dbp concentrations observed under these conditions are likely higher than those generated under normal operating conditions of the bwms in natural waters mean concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups in ballast water from this analysis are used as reference for the assessment in this study 247 0 08 920 µg l for bromoform 49 0 14 230 µg l for dbaa 23 0 28 133 µg l for dban and 0 27 0 1 0 45 µg l for 2 4 6 tbp the annual global ballast water discharge from vessels in the international seaborne trade was estimated as 3 1 109 m3 in 2013 david 2015 another estimate provides a value of 1010 m3 of ballast water per year who 2011 today estimates from the imo suggest that uv treatment or electro chlorination systems have been installed on vessels as the dominant technologies with a market share of about one third each the use of oxidants and other disinfection processes might represent most of the rest it is currently unclear what percentage of ballast water volumes will be treated with oxidants in 2024 when the whole fleet will have to be equipped with bwms for the assessment in this study it is assumed that a total of 7 109 m3 of ballast water is taken from the aquatic environment by ships each year of which 50 is subject to oxidative treatment resulting in an estimated total annual volume of 3 5 109 m3 by 2024 2 4 wastewater treatment disinfection of wastewater prior to effluent discharge to the sea is used to preserve the health of the coastal marine environment yang et al 2000 and to protect humans against exposure to waterborne pathogenic microorganisms notably from fecal contamination mansilha et al 2009 the most common treatments include oxidation especially chlorination and uv irradiation jacangelo and trussell 2002 chlorination is still the most widely used method for disinfection of municipal wastewater effluents both in europe collivignarelli et al 2017 and the usa krasner et al 2009 report that wastewater treatment plants apply median chlorine doses of 2 4 2 7 mg cl2 l in the usa wastewater chlorination is commonly followed by a dechlorination step before the discharge of the effluents to the receiving waters chlorine and to a lesser extent chloramines can react with organic matter present in municipal wastewater to produce various dbps the wide array of formed dbps include thms haas and halogenated nitrogenous dbps sgroi et al 2018 krasner et al 2009 showed that chlorination of wastewater resulted in different dbp formation patterns depending on whether or not the treatment plant achieved good nitrification some results from this study are provided in table s4 si as stated above disinfection of municipal wastewater is applied worldwide however as the information is patchy it is difficult to quantify the total volumes treated and volumes entering the marine environment therefore for this study no reliable information on the volumes of oxidatively treated sewage water discharged into the marine environment could be compiled since the relevance of these inputs is unknown for estimating dbp inputs into the marine environment at this point they are not further considered here 2 5 seawater toilets to mitigate the shortage of freshwater supply seawater is used for toilet flushing in different coastal areas including hong kong the city of avalon california and several pacific regions including the marshall islands and kiribati boehm et al 2009 mirti and davies 2005 tang et al 2007 in hong kong where this practice has been extensively implemented since the 1950s a total of 2 7 108 m3 of seawater is supplied every year hk wsd 2018 the seawater is treated with chlorine or hypochlorite generated on site before being pumped to service reservoirs and distributed to consumers and then mixed with other domestic sewage and enters the sewage systems in hong kong where it is again treated with chlorine prior to discharge in hong kong s seawater supply typical chlorine doses are reported as 3 6 mg cl2 l for the intake of seawater 15 mg cl2 l 12 min contact time for the disinfection of primary sewage effluent and 4 18 mg cl2 l 15 30 min contact time for the disinfection of secondary sewage effluent ding et al 2013 gong and zhang 2015 as the seawater after toilet flushing is mixed with other domestic sewage and enters the sewage systems in hong kong very high levels of sea salts particularly bromide are introduced into the sewage due to the variety of dissolved organic matter including compounds derived from microorganism metabolization along with human and industrial waste a higher complexity of dbps can be formed in chlorinated saline sewage effluents than in chlorinated marine water nevertheless commonly known dbps such as thms and haas have been reported to form in chlorinated saline sewage effluents as major compounds sun et al 2009 yang et al 2005 an overview of the typical levels of dbps reported in chlorinated saline sewage effluents in hong kong is provided in table s5 si many polar semi polar brominated and iodinated aromatic dbps have also been detected ding et al 2013 gong and zhang 2015 gong et al 2016 mean concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups in seawater toilet effluents are used as reference for the assessment in this study 32 µg l for bromoform 9 µg l for dbaa and 0 97 µg l for 2 4 6 tbp to date only a few coastal cities have adopted seawater toilets requiring saline sewage effluents and generating halogenated dbps the saline sewage discharge in hong kong has been estimated to be 1 0 109 m3 a this likely represents one of the largest volumes of treated wastewater inputs into the marine environment which might be considered as a local hotspot 3 overview on treatment processes volumes and dbp concentrations an overview on oxidant treatment conditions and estimated global volumes of water treated in the different industrial sectors is provided in table 1 treatment processes differ in typically applied oxidant doses and in reaction times along the coast where water resources are abundant billions of m3 of seawater are used mostly for cooling of power plants and other industrial installations and desalination global cooling water discharge to marine water is estimated in the range of 4 7 1011 8 0 1011 m3 a desalination plants treat high amounts of marine water mostly in arid regions the global volume of discharged concentrate brine is estimated to be 4 6 1010 m3 a more than 50 of discharge originates from desalination plants located on the arabian peninsula thus other regions are considered to be less impacted from desalination discharge input of treated ballast water may add locally to the dbp concentrations around large ports maas et al 2019 all applications are expected to expand due to increasing demand from economic development and population growth in table 2 an overview is provided on the mean concentrations of selected dbps representing different compound groups detected in the treated or discharged water of the different industrial activities the data show that dbp concentrations are generally higher in ballast water compared to other sectors e g for bromoform the major dbp a mean concentration of 247 µg l was detected whereas only about 10 of this level is typically observed in power plant cooling water desalination brine and wastewater effluent from seawater toilets the relatively high concentration in ballast water is coherent with the high oxidant doses and long contact times for these treatments furthermore dbps containing chlorine appear to be present in relatively low concentrations in power plant cooling water jenner et al 1997 compared to discharge from other sectors possibly reflecting the more constant quality of marine water treated ballast water and municipal wastewater may be characterized by varying water qualities and thus also varying bromide concentrations which might shift the spectrum of generated dbps to chlorinated species david et al 2018 based on the volumes of treated water in the different sectors table 1 and the observed mean dbp concentrations in the treated water or discharge table 2 the global production of dbps from industrial activities can be estimated table 3 provides the estimated global production for bromoform it is assumed that the major part of the produced dbps represents direct inputs into the marine environment since bromoform is the most prominent dbp it may serve as a proxy to compare the inputs from different sectors the total estimated anthropogenic bromoform production and discharge adds up to 1 35 107 2 18 107 kg a with contributions of 1 18 107 2 01 107 kg a from cooling water 8 9 105 kg a from desalination 8 6 105 kg a from ballast water and 3 104 kg a from saline sewage treatment hong kong only most of the estimates are based on realistic assumptions for discharged water volumes and mean values for observed or estimated dbp concentrations therefore this assessment does not represent a worst case scenario environmental concentrations of dbps depend on the quantities emitted but also on the characteristics of the receiving environment and natural background concentrations furthermore the fate of the individual dbps in the surface water depends on the lifetime solubility and volatility of the compound the major dbp bromoform is volatile and expected to be outgassed relatively quickly and no long term accumulation in the ocean is expected environmental concentrations can be assessed by measurements of dbps in receiving environments or by predicting the estimated dilution of the effluents examples for measured environmental dbp concentrations have been reported for water in the vicinity of power plants polman 2018 and in receiving seawater for treated sewage effluents feng et al 2019 environmental concentrations can also be estimated based on the knowledge about dbp concentrations in effluents and on assumptions of specific or generic dilutions predicted environmental concentrations pec have been established for cooling water on the local and regional scale assuming dilution factors of the effluent of 20 and 100 respectively khalanski 2003 and ballast water by model dilution of measured discharge concentrations in a generic harbour david et al 2018 gesamp 2019 on local and short time scales of a few days all dbp discharges from anthropogenic activities contribute to the concentration in the aquatic environment in continuous discharges transient concentrations may be established reflecting an equilibrium of inputs dilution evaporation and degradation of compounds hence at large industrial sites where ports power plants or desalination plants are located the dbp inputs in discharged waters can sum up and significantly increase dbp concentrations in the coastal ocean this is important for metropolitan areas in temperate zones like europe and north america or tropical and subtropical regions like east and southeast asia 4 discussion a quantitative comparison between dbp inputs from different industries is hampered by the heterogeneity of the analyzed studies having various objectives analytical techniques and sampling strategies furthermore as characteristics of the treated water are known to influence dpb formation generalizations have to be interpreted with caution information on the total generated concentrations of halogenated organic compounds i e in form of sum parameters such as adsorbable organic halogen aox that would allow a total measure of dbp inputs is typically not available additional uncertainties may exist for instance average bromoform concentrations observed in cooling water were used for the assessment keeping in mind that the majority of available data was obtained from studies conducted in european power stations and may not be representative for power stations in other world regions for a regional assessment maas et al 2021 estimated higher bromoform emissions for east asian power stations however despite the uncertainties underlying the summarized data and the necessity of estimations to fill data gaps general conclusions appear warranted when the orders of magnitude of inputs are considered bromoform which was used as a proxy for the input of dbps into the marine environment is also synthesized in large quantities by phytoplankton and macroalgae in the oceans quack and wallace 2003 furthermore bromophenols with 2 4 6 tribromophenol most often detected are part of the natural bromine containing compounds of marine origin gribble 2010 for most other dbps no or only very limited natural production has been described therefore most dbps have to be considered as mainly anthropogenic compounds with little overlap with natural compounds except for bromoform and bromophenols for local risk assessment for the aquatic environment typically measured or predicted environmental concentrations pec of individual compounds are compared to their predicted no effect concentrations pnec where a ratio of pec pnec 1 indicates that no unacceptable risks to the aquatic environment may be expected pnec values for the most important dbps observed in marine water have been proposed by gesamp 2019 as environmental dbp concentrations depend on specific discharge conditions and dilution in receiving waters any risk assessment process is site or scenario specific thus general conclusions on environmental risks of dbps in marine water are not possible most known dbps are not bioaccumulative and are quickly eliminated and thus not considered to bioconcentrate in aquatic organisms nor to biomagnify in the food chain gesamp 2019 khalanski and jenner 2012 the low bioaccumulation potential of major known dbps and the important dilution rate in ocean water suggest that the risks for the aquatic environment posed by dbps are low on larger scales and distances from discharge although in specific exposure situation such as in harbours and close to industrial discharges local effects on aquatic organisms may occur similarly for the human health risk assessment estimated human exposure levels are compared to derived no effect levels dnel and derived minimal effect levels dmel for non carcinogenic and carcinogenic compounds respectively where a risk characterization ratio estimated exposure level dnel or dmel rcr 1 indicates that no unacceptable risks for humans may be expected dnel and dmel for major dbps are proposed by dock et al 2019 and gesamp 2019 for discharge of treated ballast water exposure from two different scenarios covering direct contact i e swimming near a ship during ballast water discharge and seafood consumption did not indicate any significant health effects dock et al 2019 similar assessments are not available for discharges from other industrial applications bromoform is a major carrier of bromine from the ocean to the atmosphere penkett et al 1985 if it reaches the atmospheric boundary layer it is oxidized or photo dissociated to reactive halogen species which contribute to the depletion of tropospheric and stratospheric ozone by catalytic cycles saiz lopez and von glasow 2012 tegtmeier et al 2020 wmo 2018 the global bromoform emissions from marine water resulting from natural sources have been estimated to be 3 85 108 8 70 108 kg a wang et al 2019 yokouchi et al 2005 therefore based on the assessment in this study anthropogenic bromoform discharge into the marine water resulting from the considered industrial treatments equals approximately 2 6 of those global marine bromoform emissions depending on whether higher or lower boundaries are used table 3 this range reflects the uncertainty of the estimated anthropogenic inputs and natural production potentially the inputs could be higher in case the conducted studies on dbp concentrations in cooling water are not representative for other regions and other anthropogenic inputs may also be quantitatively relevant e g emission from wastewater treatment which could not be quantified due to missing data furthermore anthropogenic emission to the atmosphere may be underestimated in this study focusing mainly on marine inputs as 90 of thms produced in thermal desalination plants are rejected as vent gases le roux et al 2015 therefore an additional assessment of the overall thm production emitted to the atmosphere either from water or directly should be conducted when aiming to address potential effects on the atmosphere quivet et al 2022 5 conclusion this study identifies sources and quantities of inputs of major dbps through oxidative industrial processes to marine water including industrial cooling desalination ballast water treatment and seawater toilets with the following main outcomes disinfection by products dbps are produced during oxidative water treatment for disinfection purposes or biofouling control in industrial processes using marine or brackish water due to the high concentration of bromide which is oxidized to hypobromous acid by many oxidants brominated dbps are most abundant in treated marine water bromoform has been identified as the major dbp in all industrial applications using oxidants in seawater furthermore other dbps e g bromochloromethanes haloacetic acids haloacetonitriles and halophenols have been observed with dibromoacetic acid tribromoacetic acid dibromoacetonitrile 2 4 6 tribromophenol and bromate being often detected absolute concentrations and relative abundance of the different dbps vary between different applications reflecting variable process parameters e g oxidant dose and reaction time and water quality parameters e g characteristics and concentration of dissolved organic matter a quantification of global discharges of dbps from industrial processes showed that cooling water was the major anthropogenic source followed by desalination brine and ballast water since bromoform is the most abundant dbp it may serve as a proxy to compare the inputs from different sources the total estimated anthropogenic bromoform discharged into marine water adds up to 1 35 107 2 18 107 kg a which is considerably lower than the estimated natural emissions from marine water of 3 85 108 8 70 108 kg a although there are high quality studies on individual sites e g cooling circuits of some nuclear power plants and rather abundant information of dbp generation in ballast water treatment a comprehensive risk or impact assessment is hampered by a lack of data uncertainties arise from missing information e g volume of marine water used for cooling purposes worldwide dbp concentrations in cooling water from not yet studied regions and from unknown future developments e g an increasing number of desalination plants or the fraction of ballast water management systems using oxidants to be installed nevertheless the estimates from this study suggest that industrial bromoform inputs into marine water are minor compared to the natural marine emission 10 more harmonized studies on the different major dbps identified in oxidant treated effluents are warranted to allow a more systematic overview on dbp variety in the different industries and regions strengthening of international efforts in ocean science to build up a better database on

chemical industry almost doubled between 2000 and 2017 from about 1 2 to 2 3 billion tonnes cayuela and hagan 2019 suggesting continued future increases in the volume of chemicals produced therefore the number of chemicals registered with the chemical abstracts service cas has grown exponentially showing one new substance registered every 1 4 s by 2016 unep 2019 trillions of tonnes of manufactured chemicals are released to the environment directly from industrial facility releases or municipal landfill leakage air deposition contaminated water runoff land applications of pesticides and fertilizers and commercial products unep 2019 many of these substances are known to be toxic in small doses sometimes in combination with other pollutants or as breakdown products after release into the biosphere and geosphere a europe wide study provides strong evidence that organic chemicals were likely to have acute lethal effects on sensitive fish invertebrates or algae species at 14 of sites and chronic long term effects at 42 by testing 223 chemicals across 4000 monitoring sites malaj et al 2014 given the vast number of organic pollutants that exist in the aquatic environment efforts are needed to prioritize the chemicals of highest concern to effectively preferentially and temporally reduce and control chemicals with respect to potential threats to environment and human health organic micropollutants omps predominantly originate from intense anthropogenic activities and are presently widespread at trace levels pg l to ng l in aquatic ecosystems globally they constitute a major environmental and human health concern tang et al 2013 aemig et al 2021 yang et al 2021 white et al 2021 once omps enter the aquatic environment generally through wet dry deposition and surface runoff they are resistant to biotic and abiotic degradation thus they can bioaccumulate in organisms higher up the food web threatening both wildlife and humans govaerts et al 2018 some omps are considered endocrine disrupters because they alter the hormonal system damaging the reproductive and immune systems of people and their subsequent children negrete bolagay et al 2021 therefore extensive research attention has been paid to omps in aquatic systems of developed countries arinaitwe et al 2012 ssebugere et al 2015 vasseghian et al 2021 however unlike in developed countries several risk factors unique to developing countries including lack of clean drinking water and poor solid waste and wastewater management predispose human and ecological health to the potential adverse effects of omps gwenzi and chaukura 2018 ssebugere et al 2019 for developing regions evaluation of omp fate in aquatic ecosystems is limited due to the lack of sophisticated analytical equipment and skilled personnel required for sample analysis thus prohibiting the priority substances screening the global monitoring plan gmp for persistent organic pollutants pops in core media air breast milk and water which is an important component for evaluating the effectiveness of the stockholm convention provides a harmonized organizational framework for the collection of pop monitoring data on a global scale unep 2009 2015 2021 the main comparable regional data on aquatic perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and salts was mainly obtained from the large rives and estuaries under the unep gef gmp 1 2 projects and the monet africa pilot study however it could be easily found that only pfos was considered by these international projects while baseline data for other industrial pops and polar chemicals in the water bodies was limited additionally available water data from 2013 to 2019 was obtained at nine sites namely in egypt congo kenya mauritius morocco nigeria ghana tunisia and zambia although tanzania has been included for the monitoring of pops in air and breast milk at the vikuge site during the period 2018 and 2019 still no water samples have been analyzed unep 2021 according to a report by the international pop elimination network ipen which conducted a study on the pop situation in several regions of tanzania specifically the coast morogoro kilimanjaro and arusha areas pop residues were predominant in various media including fish breast milk and chicken eggs ipen 2004 2005a 2005b polder et al 2014 müller et al 2016 2017 mwakalapa et al

compound levels in water and sediments from rivers along the pangani river basin showing a notable water contamination that exceeded the eu maximum acceptable value for human health protection in river kikavu ddt residues ranging from 10 02 to 116 μg kg dry weight dw in soil and 7 5 to 564 2 μg kg dw in sediments have also been reported in eastern lake tanganyika mahugija et al 2017 recently the concentrations of metals and pops in water sediment fish and invertebrates were documented in rivers and dams of the morogoro region groffen et al 2021 further illustrating the extent of omp pollution in the aquatic ecosystem while production of chemicals is projected to grow in each region annual growth rates are highest in regions with developing countries and emerging economies particularly in asia pacific africa and the middle east being projected to be strongest in almost every year until 2022 unep 2019 moreover by 2050 over one quarter of the global population will live on the african continent oecd 2016 thus driving demand for chemicals and chemical intensive products without exception for tanzania over the past three decades the economy of tanzania grew by over 460 and a number of human development indicators have improved blocher et al 2021 at the same time tanzania is urbanizing at a rate of 5 22 per annum with roughly 34 of the population living in an urban area in 2018 world bank 2018 the population of tanzania is expected to grow from over 59 million currently to 80 million by 2035 and to over 129 million by 2050 increasing omp production and their subsequent discharge into field waters is considered inevitable along with social economic development sorensen et al 2015 however a literature survey indicates that few studies are available concerning highly toxic omps in inland lakes throughout tanzania especially the soda lakes moreover these soda lakes are highly vulnerable to environmental degradation the closed hydrological nature of soda lakes could induce a much more severe pollution effect compared to exorheic lakes and they may accumulate and biomagnify hydrophobic omps to a much greater degree furthermore their high salinity may modify the toxicity of specific pollutants schagerl 2016 for example mass deaths of lesser flamingos in east african soda lakes have been reported in recent decades ndetei and muhandiki 2005 nonga et al 2011 although these events are linked to ecosystem depletion the reasons are not fully understood due to an especially fragmented picture of environmental toxins caused by inadequate monitoring of highly toxic chemicals in these lakes krienitz et al 2016 and 2018 to reduce this knowledge gap continuous monitoring of omps in the east african rift lakes especially in the soda lakes should be performed not only through international projects but also by local institutions the importance of which has also been emphasized in the gmp reports despite the fact that the government of tanzania has made significant efforts to address the critical challenge of managing chemicals and waste awareness at the population level regarding the adverse effects of chemicals remains low with a limited capacity to monitor key chemicals the country is restricted in its ability to develop suitable strategies for combatting the adverse impacts that chemicals and waste have on human health and the environment therefore a streamline monitoring system focused on priority omps in the aquatic environment needs to be established for long term assessment in the present study a comprehensive investigation focusing on typical omps in the water and sediment from the inland lakes of tanzania has been carried out the multi criteria ranking method for priority pollutant screening established

tanzanian lakes thereby providing a reference for future pollutant monitoring and governmental management 2 methods 2 1 study area the east african rift velley earv system extends approximately 4000 miles and runs in two north south trending branches the western rift valley and the eastern rift valley stretching from ethiopia through mainland tanzania to malawi the system is characterized by many narrow deep depressions that have often created lakes which represent the majority of the east african lakes antony et al 2013 tebbs et al 2015 most of the lakes within the valley especially those in the eastern rift do not possess drainage outlets to the sea consequently inducing a high content of minerals that contribute to their alkaline nature schagerl et al 2016 the saline alkaline lakes distributed over the earv are among the most distinctive in the world these lakes make up 75 of the total lake area in this region occupying an area of 13 000 km2 with single lake areas ranging from 8800 km2 lake turkana down to tens of crater lakes smaller than 0 5 km2 butturini et al 2020 considering the distribution of lakes in the earv region and that previous studies mainly focused on the famous great lakes like lake tanganyika and lake victoria polder et al 2014 a total of 18 lakes including two reservoirs predominantly located in north eastern tanzania the largest country in east africa were selected in the present study for omp investigation and priority substances screening tanzania has defined nine river basins for water resource administration including relatively small basins like ruvu wami which flows into the indian ocean north of dar es salaam and supplies water for domestic and industrial usage to large basins like rufiji which covers 18 of mainland tanzania dickens 2011 as a result approximately 59 000 km2 of tanzania s territory consists of inland water supporting its roles as home to tens of millions of people and one of the most biodiverse countries in the world boasting thousands of species and distinct ecosystems kihwele et al 2021 specific sampling sites were as follows mabayani reservior lake mamka lake jipe lake chala lake small momela and lake big momela distributed in the pangani river basin prb lake duluti lake eyasi lake manyara lake babati lake balangita lake kindai lake singita lake kitangiri and lake mikuyu distributed in the internal river basin irb and lake sulunga mtera reservoir and lake hombolo distributed in the rufiji river basin rrb the basic information on the specific lakes are listed in table 1 while the spatial distribution of these lakes can be found in fig 1 2 2 sampling in february 2020 surface water and sediment were simultaneously collected from the studied lakes for the field sampling water was collected by overflowing pre cleaned dark brow glass bottles to avoid potential evaporation and photodegradation at each site 2 l of surface water was collected and then kept in an incubator sediments were collected in triplicate using a stainless steel grab sampler and then immediately homogenized as a single sample the sediment samples were then packed in brown glass bottles and stored in the incubator after returning to the local institution water samples were immediately concentrated using the solid phase extraction spe method while the sediment samples were air dried in shade the subsequent extraction and pretreatment for analysis of target omps were completed in the nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences niglas nanjing china 2 3 pretreatment and quantification of omps a total of 70 target omps were analyzed specifically 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 20 organochlorine pesticides ocps 18 polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and 16 phthalates paes the pretreatment procedures followed those of our previous studies zhao et al 2016 2017 2021 and can be found in the supplementary materials text s1 for water samples extraction

550 c for 6 h whatman britain the air dried sediments were ground in a mortar and sieved through 100 mesh to obtain powders next they were quantitatively extracted using an accelerated solvent extraction system ase 350 dionex usa for the quantification of omps the pah detection was completed via high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector coupled with a series wound fluorescence detector hplc dad fld agilent 1200 usa the ocp and pcb concentrations were determined by gas chromatography equipped with a 63ni μ electron capture detector gc μecd agilent 7890 usa for paes 16 component analyses were performed using capillary gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector gc fid agilent 7890 usa the detailed conditions for the hplc dad fld gc μecd and gc fid analyses are detailed in previous studies zhao et al 2009 2013 and 2016 and the following quantitative determination methods are listed in text s1 2 4 priority pollutant screening for the 70 chemicals analyzed in the present study priority pollutant screening was completed via the multi criteria scoring method several criteria namely occurrence o persistence p bioaccumulation b ecological toxicity eco t and human health toxicity hum t were used for priority pollutant screening in the water and sediment from tanzanian lakes this multi criteria scoring method was established by our lab and the detailed procedures can be found in the recent publication by zhao et al 2021 for water samples screening was done according to field detected concentrations for each individual chemical for sediments both the concentration oc and detection frequency odf were calculated with the same equations used for water similarly the persistence p and bioaccumulation b potential of the chemicals were determined via the biowin model biowin v 4 10 and the bcfbaf model v 3 01 both listed in the estimations programs interface for windows epi suite tm 4 1 usepa for eco t the hazard quotient hq was calculated by dividing the predicted no effect concentration pnec μg l using the measured concentration mec μg l of each individual as demonstrated in our previous study the pnec values of the water samples can be obtained directly using the species sensitivity distribution model ssd by considering local species or international model organisms accepted by the united states environmental protection agency usepa with a minimum of three trophic levels and eight species since toxicity data for sediment dwelling organisms is not available from the usepa ecotox the obtained pnec values for water were also used for the sediment ecotoxicity assessment by determining the chemical concentrations in pore water based on the equilibrium partitioning method epm echa 2021 the pore water concentration of chemicals was calculated as follows c p o r e w a t e r 1000 c s e d i m e n t f o c k o c where c p o r e w a t e r is the concentration ng l of target chemicals in the pore water c s e d i m e n t is the concentration ng g dw of target chemicals in the sediment f o c is the percentage of organic carbon in the sediment and k o c is the partition coefficient l kg of target chemicals between water and sediment organic carbon normalized concentration used obtained from epi suite tm 4 1 for hum t both the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were assessed according to the suggested multi criteria screening method based on the function of the lake ecosystems ingestion and dermal contact exposure to water were evaluated for the freshwater lakes and dermal contact was evaluated for water in the soda lakes while dermal contact was only involved in sediment exposure for these lakes the average daily dose add for the different compartments was obtained using the following equations a d d w a t e r i n g e s t i o n c w i r e f e d b w a t a d d w a t e r d e r m a l c o n t a c t c w s a p c e t e f e d c f b w a t a d d s e d i m e n t d e

for chemicals in the sediment adherence factor to skin and absorption fraction for the specific chemical respectively a detailed introduction to these parameters are available from the risk assessment program documented by the usepa 2021 for the tanzanian lakes in the current study the potential risk induced by the target chemicals was only assessed for adults hum t which is implied by the non carcinogenic risk quotient rq and the carcinogenic risk the increment lifetime cancer risk ilcr could then be obtained as shown in zhao et al 2021 finally the score for each criteria was calculated using the geometric classification method and the 2 3 cumulative ranking method the total score ts for a particular chemical was then obtained by multiplying the scores for these five criteria the priority pollutant list of the target chemicals in the tanzanian lakes was established by arranging the ts from highest to lowest zhao et al 2021 3 results 3 1 occurrence of omps in water the concentrations of target omps and their distribution in water from different lakes are presented in fig 2 box plots for the concentration of individual chemicals as well as their percentage compositions are provided in the supplementary materials fig s1 and s2 paes were observed in all 18 lakes showing large variation from 835 0 to 13 153 1 ng l with a mean value of 3735 9 2926 9 ng l the highest concentration was detected in lake jipe in the prb followed by lake balangita 5569 1 ng l and lake mikuyu 5298 7 ng l in the irb and mabayani reservior 5177 5 ng l in the prb the lowest pae concentration was found in lake kindai in the irb several lakes including lake chala lake big momela lake singida and lake babati were found to have similar pae levels of less than 2000 ng l the 6 priority pae compounds dmp dep dibp dbp bbp and dehp as suggested by the usepa were detected at total levels of 510 3 10 069 7 ng l with a mean concentration of 2687 9 2926 9 ng l and accounting for 74 8 10 6 of the total paes among the paes dehp was the predominant compound followed by dbp and dibp ranging from nd 5183 8 ng l nd 3599 8 ng l and 86 5 2653 7 ng l respectively and contributing to 40 3 28 2 17 7 10 6 and 17 4 11 3 of the total paes dep and dibp were observed in 100 of the water samples followed by the relatively high detection frequencies of for dbp 94 4 dmp 88 9 bbp 83 3 and dehp 72 2 while dmpp dhp dbmp dchp dop and dnp were not detected in any water sample pahs were detected in all samples ranging from 18 5 to 182 4 ng l mean 69 9 48 1 ng l lake jipe showed the highest residue concentration among the 18 lakes followed by lake balangita 158 9 ng l and lake hombolo 114 0 ng l while the lowest concentration was found in lake eyasi two lakes of the irb namely lake singida and lake mikuyu presented lower levels of 26 6 ng l and 30 3 ng l respectively among the pahs 3 ringed congeners showed the highest residues in the range of 4 7 60 8 ng l mean 27 7 17 1 ng l accounting for 45 9 16 4 of the total pahs followed by 4 ringed components at levels of 2 3 84 3 ng l mean 20 1 22 2 ng l with a mean contribution of 27 8 18 6 which indicates the predomination of medium ringed components in the waters of tanzanian lakes for individual pahs acy phe ant pyr chr and bbf were detected in 100 of the water samples while bghip was not detected in any water samples for pcbs lake jipe also exhibited the maximum residue concentration of 19 7 ng l followed by the metera reservoir 5 8 ng l while the lowest level was detected in lake chala 0 6 ng l the rest of the lakes showed similar residue concentrations from 1 9 lake singida to 5 5 ng l lake hombolo thereby demonstrating a homogenized spatial pcb distribution when considering different atomic chlorine homologs the pcb homolog pattern in the tanzanian lakes was primarily composed of high atomic chlorine compounds showing the overall trend of hexa penta tetra tri pcbs whereas hepta pcbs were not detected in water dioxin like pcbs exhibited lower levels than index pcbs according to their observed values of 0 03 7 6 ng l mean 1 7 1 6 ng l and 0 5 12 1 ng l mean 2 5 2 6 ng l respectively pcb153 and pcb105 were detected in all samples ranging from 0 2 to 10 4 ng l mean 2 1 2 3 ng l and 0 03 7 6 ng l mean 1 6 1 6 ng l followed by pcb28 nd 1 5 ng l mean 0 3 0 4 ng l similar to the pcbs the highest concentration of ocps was observed in lake jipe 18 3 ng l and the lowest was observed in lake chala 0 8 ng l indicating that there are potentially less anthropogenic effects around lake chala relative to lake jipe lake balangita located in the irb showed a similar residual level 17 0 ng l as lake jipe while no spatial differences could be found for other lakes with ocp concentrations of less than 10 0 ng l for different ocp compounds in the water of tanzanian lakes the concentrations were ordered as follows hchs methoxychlor ends chlors ddts aldrins hchs were detected at a range of 0 04 6 9 ng l mean 2 2 1 7 ng l with a mean contribution of 35 6 17 1 of the total ocps followed by methoxychlor nd 9 9 ng l mean 1 6 2 4 ng l and ends 0 1 4 3 ng l mean 1 1 1 0 ng l ddts aldrins and chlors exhibited similar levels ranging from nd 4 6 ng l mean 0 6 1 1 ng l nd 1 8 ng l mean 0 5 0 6 ng l and nd 2 3 ng l mean 0 6 0 6 ng l respectively among the ocp individuals lindane γ hch and methoxychlor showed higher concentrations ranging from of nd 4 4 ng l mean 1 5 1 2 ng l and nd 9 9 ng l mean 1 6 2 4 ng l respectively than other chemicals with detection frequencies of 94 4 and 66 7 respectively several pesticides specifically heptachlor aldrin endrin aldehyde and endrin ketone were not detected accordingly the occurrence of typical omps in water samples from the tanzanian lakes implies that there were much higher concentrations of paes followed by pahs while ocps and pcbs showed similar residue concentrations being 2 or 3 orders of magnitude lower than paes these results demonstrate the potentially increasing risk of paes in aquatic ecosystems induced by their current anthropogenic production and excessive usage 3 2 occurrence of omps in sediment the omp residues and their spatial distribution in the sediment of tanzanian lakes are shown in fig 3 the occurrence of individual chemicals and their contributions are also listed in the supplementary fig s3 and s4 consistent with the residue pattern in water paes in the sediment showed higher concentrations than pahs ocps and pcbs typically these pae concentrations varied from 244 6 to 8691 8 ng g dw with a mean value of 1784 0 2088 3 ng g dw unlike the water samples the highest sediment concentration was found in lake chala followed by several lakes distributed within the irb including lake babati 3464 3 ng g dw lake singida 2600 4 ng g dw lake kindai 2544 7 ng g dw and lakes located in the prb such as lake jipe 2340 5 ng g dw and lake big momela 2178 9 ng g dw at the time of sampling lake duluti in the arusha region was the least polluted by paes the residues of six priority paes were found ranging from 123 3 to 6576 7 ng g dw mean 1234 9 1539 0 ng g dw accounting for 70 6 21 5 of the total sediment paes dep dmp and dehp were widely distributed with the highest residues observed for dehp in the range of 56 2 4981 8 ng g dw mean 1149 0 1496 3 ng g dw conversely dop only accumulated in the sediment of lake jipe showing a comparatively low level of 1 3 5 4 ng g dw sediment pahs were detected at concentrations from 11 6 to 241 2 ng g dw mean 51 3 53 2 ng g dw with the highest value detected in lake chala and the lowest in lake kintangiri while no substantially differences in spatial distribution were found for the rest lakes the carcinogenic pah congeners showed a range of 5 7 96 1 ng g dw mean 19 7 21 9 ng g dw contributing to 39 3 10 8 of the total sediment pahs compositional analysis demonstrated that medium ringed congeners 3 and 4 ringed compounds were the predominant accounting for 64 7 11 4 of the total sediment pahs followed by the high molecular weight congeners such as 5 and 6 ringed pahs 22 9 13 0 among the pah congeners phe flu and bbf were detected in 100 of the sediment samples with the values of 4 0 48 7 ng g dw mean 13 6 11 5 ng g dw 0 3 15 7 ng g dw mean 13 6 11 5 ng g dw and 0 6 10 7 ng g dw mean 3 4 2 9 ng g dw respectively for pcbs lake chala also documented the highest sediment residue concentration 5 5 ng g dw followed by lake jipe 1 3 ng g dw while lake kitangiri showed the lowest value 0 1 ng g dw the pcbs were mainly composed of hexa and penta homologs with residue concentrations in the range of 0 01 3 5 ng g dw mean 0 4 0 9 ng g dw and 0 01 1 2 ng g dw mean 0 2 0 3 ng g dw respectively accounting for 40 2 18 2 and 24 1 15 1 respectively of the total sediment pcbs tri and tetra pcbs were detected at similar concentrations specifically nd 0 2 ng g dw mean 0 07 0 07 ng g dw and nd 0 5 ng g dw mean 0 08 0 1 ng g dw showing contributions of 15 9 13 2 and 13 2 12 9 respectively hepta pcbs were the least detected congeners with a mean concentration of 0 04 0 06 ng g dw dioxin like pcbs ranged from 0 04 to 2 2 ng g dw mean 0 4 0 6 ng g dw representing 55 6 20 5 for the total observed pcbs pcb153 and pcb167 were two dominant congeners with mean concentrations of 0 3 0 7 ng g dw and 0 2 0 2 ng g dw respectively and detection frequencies of 61 1 and 83 3 respectively several congeners namely pcb52 pcb114 pcb126 and pcb189 were not detected in any sediments ocp residue concentrations in the sediments were detected at higher levels than pcbs and ranged from 2 6 to 35 1 ng g dw a mean of 7 3 7 9 ng g dw again lake chala was the most predominant followed by lake jipe 11 5 ng g dw lake babati 10 7 ng g dw lake mamka 8 0 ng g dw and lake mikuyu 7 7 ng g dw while lake mtera exhibited the lowest concentration hchs were the major components ranging from 1 4 to 9 0 ng g dw 3 5 1 9 ng g dw and accounting for 61 2 22 9 of the total sediment ocps the monomeric compound methoxychlor was detected at a mean of 1 6 2 1 ng g dw followed by ddts with the compounds accounting for 20 4 18 8 and 10 3 20 0 respectively the other ocp groups including aldrins chlors and ends shared similar contributions of 2 9 0 7 1 3 1 7 and 3 9 3 1 respectively among individuals α γ hch were detected in all samples with mean values of 0 4 0 7 ng g dw and 3 0 1 8 ng g dw respectively for ddts the concentration of the aerobic metabolite p p dde was higher than that of both p p ddd anaerobic metabolite and p p ddt parent compound thereby demonstrating the predominance of the aerobic process in surface sediments conversely several compounds including endrin ketone endrin aldehyde heptachlor and α chlordane were not detected in summary similar residue trends were found between sediment and water samples specifically higher pae pollution was observed followed by pahs while pollution by ocps and pcbs was lower lake chala registered as highly polluted with omps in the sediment while the water was shown to be severely polluted this might be due to its potential high sedimentation rate and long retention time rt however this needs to be further explored 4 discussion 4 1 priority omps in water according to the multi criteria screening method a total of 31 chemicals comprising 5 paes 7 pcbs 9 ocps and 10 pah congeners were ranked as high priority pollutants in the water media based on their total score ts fig 4 a the most important chemicals were dehp pcb153 pcb105 trans chlordane bap baa bbf dibp and dbp tss from 265 to 402 along with an additional 7 pahs 8 ocps 5 pcbs and 2 paes tss from 163 to 251 as further demonstrated by the contribution of each criteria to the ts of the individual pollutants fig 5 a the high priority assigned to dehp dibp and dbp was predominantly due to their high detection occurrence followed by the sensitive responses from both the ecology and human health perspectives while the basic hazard profiles such as persistence and bioaccumulation capacity were not predominating factors for pahs equal contributions attributed to occurrence bioaccumulation ecological risk and human health risk were observed for bap baa and bbf the high priority of pyr and flt was mainly due to the substantial contribution associated with occurrence 33 2 and 42 3 respectively in addition to pcb153 and pcb105 for traditional pops pcb congeners including pcb28 pcb138 pcb52 pcb 156 and pcb157 were determined to be priority mainly due to their bioaccumulation potential as for ocps the hazard profiles of persistence and bioaccumulation capacity were generally responsible for the prioritization of trans chlordane cis chlordane p p dde endrin endosulfan i p p ddt endosulfan sulfate methoxychlor and heptachlor epoxide in the water of the tanzanian lakes the priority omps in the water of the tanzanian lakes were composed of chemicals currently being produced or used at high levels as well as the historically widely used pop substances that resisted degradation thus bioaccumulating as a result for example paes are used as plasticizers in pvc plastics therefore specific members of this chemical family can be found in many consumer products including packaging bags coating materials personal care products nail polish vinyl gloves floor tiles traffic cones carpet tiles tablecloths furniture upholstery shower curtains and garden hoses das et al 2021 hamid et al 2020 among which dehp is one of the most widespread phthalate plasticizers used in numerous consumer products commodities and building materials takdastan et al 2021 similarly dbp is used in cosmetic products such as nail polish to avoid chipping and in the preparation of specific adhesives and cellulosic coatings since paes in the polymeric matrix are linked by hydrogen bonding or van der waals forces they tend to release easily from any pae containing products and then migrate into the environment throughout all stages of the product lifecycle li et al 2020 as a result pae congeners have been frequently detected in the water and sediment of lakes around the world among which dehp and dbp have been identified as the primary paes in lake ecosystems ajay et al 2021 yang et al 2021 le et al 2021 nantaba et al 2021 which is consistent with their occurrence in tanzanian lakes as elucidated from the present study moreover as a replacement for dbp dibp is also becoming predominant in the environment pahs are mainly produced from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels as well as vehicular traffic incineration industrial emissions oil spillages and the burning of biomass such as wood and grass to a lesser extent they are also formed through natural combustion processes such as forest fires volcanic eruptions biosynthesis and natural oil seepages wang et al 2021 finally due to their semi volatile property and capacity for long range atmospheric transport pahs are ubiquitous in the environment thereby likely inducing potential ecological and human health risks for receiving waters as demonstrated in our study 4 2 priority omps in sediment the ts values and the final priority omps screened out from sediment of the tanzanian lakes are shown in fig 4 b while the percent contribution of each criteria for individual pollutants is shown in fig 5 b in the sediments 33 omp components were deemed high priority specifically 9 paes 9 ocps 9 pcbs and 6 pahs the top 10 priority substances with tss ranging from 292 to 368 were dehp dchp heptachlor epoxide pcb153 inp pcb167 dmpp p p ddd dbp bbf followed by dibp and pcb156 the other three detected high priority pae congeners were deep dmep and dptp the other detected ocps were p p ddt endosulfan ii cis chlordane p p dde γ hch methoxychlor and endrin the pcbs consisted of isomers pcb180 pcb105 pcb157 pcb118 pcb28 and pcb77 while the other detected pahs were baa bap daha and pyr considering the percentages of the different criteria a similar phenomenon as that of the water was observed for which equal contributions of field occurrence bioaccumulation potential ecological risk and human exposure risk were detected for paes with some relatively higher proportions of occurrence for ddep and dep moreover pahs presented similarities while for pcbs and ocps the bioaccumulation capacities of chemicals were primarily responsible for their prioritization in sediment thus it can be concluded that the risks for both ecological and human exposure induced by the high occurrence of currently applied pollutants will decide the priority of these compounds in the sediment whereas the hazard profiles of particular banned pops should be considered based on their prioritization in both environmental compartments the priority screening results indicate equal attention should be paid to both popular emerging endocrine disrupters and traditional pops 4 3 priority omp list for tanzanian lakes a final priority omp list for the aquatic environment of tanzanian lakes was obtained by combining the priority substances screened for both water and sediment those classified as top priority for specific media were selected and then the remaining list was established by choosing the chemicals that appeared in both media as a result the priority omp list was composed of 25 chemicals specifically 5 paes dehp dibp dbp dchp and dmpp 6 pcbs pcb153 pcb105 pcb28 pcb156 pcb157 and pcb167 6 pahs bap baa bbf pyr daha and inp and 8 ocps cis chlordane trans chlordane p p ddd p p dde p p ddt endrin methoxychlor and heptachlor epoxide table 2 verification of the obtained priority omp list for the tanzanian lakes was performed by comparing it with international priority substance lists for paes increasing concern over their highly abundant presence in the environment and their possible endocrine disrupting effects has led the usepa to declare dmp dep dbp dehp dop and bbp as six typical priority pollutants das et al 2021 additionally as suggested by the list of 129 priority pollutants established by the usepa as well as the lists published by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry astdr european commission eu canada and china the identified prioritization of dchp and dmpp in the tanzanian lake ecosystem should also be emphasized in this region along with dehp dibp and dbp among the 16 priority pahs only several 4 and 5 ringed congeners were recognized as priority compounds in the present study for historically used pcbs and ocps the hexa pcb homologs among the pcbs and chlors and ddts among the ocps are the predominant pop like chemicals that should be continuously monitored and evaluated in the tanzanian lakes in order to assess the efficiency to which the stockholm convention has been implemented in this country since april 2004 as previously reported the inventory of pops undertaken in early 2003 revealed that there are approximately 17 4 mt of obsolete pop pesticide stocks including aldrin dieldrin chlordane heptachlor and toxaphene and 170 6 mt of ddts stored in various site around tanzania ipen 2005a moreover a 2004 survey showed that there are 418 pieces of electrical equipment containing 273 mt of oil suspected to contain pcbs which could lead to frequent spillage at sites without protective measures ipen 2005b 2019 therefore the relatively high prioritization percentages of ocps and pcbs were expected in summary 22 of the 25 priority substances found in the aquatic environment of tanzanian lakes are also found in the priority pollutant list of the usepa 21 compounds are included in the astdr substance priority list 16 are in the eu priority list 8 are ranked as priority substances psl1 and psl2 by the canadian environmental protection act and 10 chemicals are also suggested as priority by china the overlapping chemicals among international organizations further demonstrate that these chemicals should be considered as priority in the tanzania lakes in addition based this field investigation the high priority of commonly detected paes such as dehp dibp and dbp in this region demonstrates the necessity for updating the original priority substance list 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to describe the typical omps in the water and sediment from equatorial lakes located in north eastern tanzania thereby providing comprehensive identification and priority pollutant screening of toxic omps in the aquatic ecosystem of this sub saharan african region typical omp compounds namely paes pahs pcbs and ocps were ubiquitous in the tanzanian lakes higher pae concentrations were detected in both the water and sediment relative to pahs followed by the traditional pop like chemicals such as pcbs and ocps which can be attributed to the current omp specific production or usage of these compounds the multi criteria ranking method for priority pollutant screening suggests a final priority list consisting of 25 chemicals specifically 5 paes 6 pcbs 6 pahs and 8 ocps among which dehp a pae showed top priority the predominance of paes in equatorial lakes as well as their priority among target omps indicate the increasingly deleterious effects on aquatic organisms and human health due to their widely usage of plasticizers and endocrine disruptor characteristics emphasizing the requirement of conventional monitoring and risk control in mainland tanzania declaration of competing interest the authors declare the following financial interests

and fertilizers and commercial products unep 2019 many of these substances are known to be toxic in small doses sometimes in combination with other pollutants or as breakdown products after release into the biosphere and geosphere a europe wide study provides strong evidence that organic chemicals were likely to have acute lethal effects on sensitive fish invertebrates or algae species at 14 of sites and chronic long term effects at 42 by testing 223 chemicals across 4000 monitoring sites malaj et al 2014 given the vast number of organic pollutants that exist in the aquatic environment efforts are needed to prioritize the chemicals of highest concern to effectively preferentially and temporally reduce and control chemicals with respect to potential threats to environment and human health organic micropollutants omps predominantly originate from intense anthropogenic activities and are presently widespread at trace levels pg l to ng l in aquatic ecosystems globally they constitute a major environmental and human health concern tang et al 2013 aemig et al 2021 yang et al 2021 white et al 2021 once omps enter the aquatic environment generally through wet dry deposition and surface runoff they are resistant to biotic and abiotic degradation thus they can bioaccumulate in organisms higher up the food web threatening both wildlife and humans govaerts et al 2018 some omps are considered endocrine disrupters because they alter the hormonal system damaging the reproductive and immune systems of people and their subsequent children negrete bolagay et al 2021 therefore extensive research attention has been paid to omps in aquatic systems of developed countries arinaitwe et al 2012 ssebugere et al 2015 vasseghian et al 2021 however unlike in developed countries several risk factors unique to developing countries including lack of clean drinking water and poor solid waste and wastewater management predispose human and ecological health to the potential adverse effects of omps gwenzi and chaukura 2018 ssebugere et al 2019 for developing regions evaluation of omp fate in aquatic ecosystems is limited due to the lack of sophisticated analytical equipment and skilled personnel required for sample analysis thus prohibiting the priority substances screening the global monitoring plan gmp for persistent organic pollutants pops in core media air breast milk and water which is an important component for evaluating the effectiveness of the stockholm convention provides a harmonized organizational framework for the collection of pop monitoring data on a global scale unep 2009 2015 2021 the main comparable regional data on aquatic perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos and salts was mainly obtained from the large rives and estuaries under the unep gef gmp 1 2 projects and the monet africa pilot study however it could be easily found that only pfos was considered by these international projects while baseline data for other industrial pops and polar chemicals in the water bodies was limited additionally available water data from 2013 to 2019 was obtained at nine sites namely in egypt congo kenya mauritius morocco nigeria ghana tunisia and zambia although tanzania has been included for the monitoring of pops in air and breast milk at the vikuge site during the period 2018 and 2019 still no water samples have been analyzed unep 2021 according to a report by the international pop elimination network ipen which conducted a study on the pop situation in several regions of tanzania specifically the coast morogoro kilimanjaro and arusha areas pop residues were predominant in various media including fish breast milk and chicken eggs ipen 2004 2005a 2005b polder et al 2014 müller et al 2016 2017 mwakalapa et al 2018 pius et al 2019 additionally kihampa et al 2011 2013 reported pesticide residues in four rivers flowing through an intensive agricultural area in the kilimanjaro region as well as organohalogen compound levels in water and sediments from rivers along the pangani river basin showing a notable water contamination that exceeded the eu maximum acceptable value for human health protection in river kikavu ddt residues ranging from 10 02 to 116 μg kg dry weight dw in soil and 7 5 to 564 2 μg kg dw in sediments have also been reported in eastern lake tanganyika mahugija et al 2017 recently the concentrations of metals and pops in water sediment fish and invertebrates were documented in rivers and dams of the morogoro region groffen et al 2021 further illustrating the extent of omp pollution in the aquatic ecosystem while production of chemicals is projected to grow in each region annual growth rates are highest in regions with developing countries and emerging economies particularly in asia pacific africa and the middle east being projected to be strongest in almost every year until 2022 unep 2019 moreover by 2050 over one quarter of the global population will live on the african continent oecd 2016 thus driving demand for chemicals and chemical intensive products without exception for tanzania over the past three decades the economy of tanzania grew by over 460 and a number of human development indicators have improved blocher et al 2021 at the same time tanzania is urbanizing at a rate of 5 22 per annum with roughly 34 of the population living in an urban area in 2018 world bank 2018 the population of tanzania is expected to grow from over 59 million currently to 80 million by 2035 and to over 129 million by 2050 increasing omp production and their subsequent discharge into field waters is considered inevitable along with social economic development sorensen et al 2015 however a literature survey indicates that few studies are available concerning highly toxic omps in inland lakes throughout tanzania especially the soda lakes moreover these soda lakes are highly vulnerable to environmental degradation the closed hydrological nature of soda lakes could induce a much more severe pollution effect compared to exorheic lakes and they may accumulate and biomagnify hydrophobic omps to a much greater degree furthermore their high salinity may modify the toxicity of specific pollutants schagerl 2016 for example mass deaths of lesser flamingos in east african soda lakes have been reported in recent decades ndetei and muhandiki 2005 nonga et al 2011 although these events are linked to ecosystem depletion the reasons are not fully understood due to an especially fragmented picture of environmental toxins caused by inadequate monitoring of highly toxic chemicals in these lakes krienitz et al 2016 and 2018 to reduce this knowledge gap continuous monitoring of omps in the east african rift lakes especially in the soda lakes should be performed not only through international projects but also by local institutions the importance of which has also been emphasized in the gmp reports despite the fact that the government of tanzania has made significant efforts to address the critical challenge of managing chemicals and waste awareness at the population level regarding the adverse effects of chemicals remains low with a limited capacity to monitor key chemicals the country is restricted in its ability to develop suitable strategies for combatting the adverse impacts that chemicals and waste have on human health and the environment therefore a streamline monitoring system focused on priority omps in the aquatic environment needs to be established for long term assessment in the present study a comprehensive investigation focusing on typical omps in the water and sediment from the inland lakes of tanzania has been carried out the multi criteria ranking method for priority pollutant screening established by our lab considered the occurrence o persistence p bioaccumulation b ecological risk eco t and human health risk hum t of omps zhao et al 2021 ultimately producing a priority omp list for the tanzanian lakes thereby providing a reference for future pollutant monitoring and governmental management 2 methods 2 1 study area the east african rift velley earv system extends approximately 4000 miles and runs in two north south trending branches the western rift valley and the eastern rift valley stretching from ethiopia through mainland tanzania to malawi the system is characterized by many narrow deep depressions that have often created lakes which represent the majority of the east african lakes antony et al 2013 tebbs et al 2015 most of the lakes within the valley especially those in the eastern rift do not possess drainage outlets to the sea consequently inducing a high content of minerals that contribute to their alkaline nature schagerl et al 2016 the saline alkaline lakes distributed over the earv are among the most distinctive in the world these lakes make up 75 of the total lake area in this region occupying an area of 13 000 km2 with single lake areas ranging from 8800 km2 lake turkana down to tens of crater lakes smaller than 0 5 km2 butturini et al 2020 considering the distribution of lakes in the earv region and that previous studies mainly focused on the famous great lakes like lake tanganyika and lake victoria polder et al 2014 a total of 18 lakes including two reservoirs predominantly located in north eastern tanzania the largest country in east africa were selected in the present study for omp investigation and priority substances screening tanzania has defined nine river basins for water resource administration including relatively small basins like ruvu wami which flows into the indian ocean north of dar es salaam and supplies water for domestic and industrial usage to large basins like rufiji which covers 18 of mainland tanzania dickens 2011 as a result approximately 59 000 km2 of tanzania s territory consists of inland water supporting its roles as home to tens of millions of people and one of the most biodiverse countries in the world boasting thousands of species and distinct ecosystems kihwele et al 2021 specific sampling sites were as follows mabayani reservior lake mamka lake jipe lake chala lake small momela and lake big momela distributed in the pangani river basin prb lake duluti lake eyasi lake manyara lake babati lake balangita lake kindai lake singita lake kitangiri and lake mikuyu distributed in the internal river basin irb and lake sulunga mtera reservoir and lake hombolo distributed in the rufiji river basin rrb the basic information on the specific lakes are listed in table 1 while the spatial distribution of these lakes can be found in fig 1 2 2 sampling in february 2020 surface water and sediment were simultaneously collected from the studied lakes for the field sampling water was collected by overflowing pre cleaned dark brow glass bottles to avoid potential evaporation and photodegradation at each site 2 l of surface water was collected and then kept in an incubator sediments were collected in triplicate using a stainless steel grab sampler and then immediately homogenized as a single sample the sediment samples were then packed in brown glass bottles and stored in the incubator after returning to the local institution water samples were immediately concentrated using the solid phase extraction spe method while the sediment samples were air dried in shade the subsequent extraction and pretreatment for analysis of target omps were completed in the nanjing institute of geography and limnology chinese academy of sciences niglas nanjing china 2 3 pretreatment and quantification of omps a total of 70 target omps were analyzed specifically 16 priority polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs 20 organochlorine pesticides ocps 18 polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs and 16 phthalates paes the pretreatment procedures followed those of our previous studies zhao et al 2016 2017 2021 and can be found in the supplementary materials text s1 for water samples extraction was conducted using an spe system equipped with c18 bonded phase columns 500 mg 6 ml of reversed phase octadecyl supelco usa after being filtered through gf f glass fiber filters 0 7 μm pre baked at 550 c for 6 h whatman britain the air dried sediments were ground in a mortar and sieved through 100 mesh to obtain powders next they were quantitatively extracted using an accelerated solvent extraction system ase 350 dionex usa for the quantification of omps the pah detection was completed via high performance liquid chromatography equipped with a diode array detector coupled with a series wound fluorescence detector hplc dad fld agilent 1200 usa the ocp and pcb concentrations were determined by gas chromatography equipped with a 63ni μ electron capture detector gc μecd agilent 7890 usa for paes 16 component analyses were performed using capillary gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector gc fid agilent 7890 usa the detailed conditions for the hplc dad fld gc μecd and gc fid analyses are detailed in previous studies zhao et al 2009 2013 and 2016 and the following quantitative determination methods are listed in text s1 2 4 priority pollutant screening for the 70 chemicals analyzed in the present study priority pollutant screening was completed via the multi criteria scoring method several criteria namely occurrence o persistence p bioaccumulation b ecological toxicity eco t and human health toxicity hum t were used for priority pollutant screening in the water and sediment from tanzanian lakes this multi criteria scoring method was established by our lab and the detailed procedures can be found in the recent publication by zhao et al 2021 for water samples screening was done according to field detected concentrations for each individual chemical for sediments both the concentration oc and detection frequency odf were calculated with the same equations used for water similarly the persistence p and bioaccumulation b potential of the chemicals were determined via the biowin model biowin v 4 10 and the bcfbaf model v 3 01 both listed in the estimations programs interface for windows epi suite tm 4 1 usepa for eco t the hazard quotient hq was calculated by dividing the predicted no effect concentration pnec μg l using the measured concentration mec μg l of each individual as demonstrated in our previous study the pnec values of the water samples can be obtained directly using the species sensitivity distribution model ssd by considering local species or international model organisms accepted by the united states environmental protection agency usepa with a minimum of three trophic levels and eight species since toxicity data for sediment dwelling organisms is not available from the usepa ecotox the obtained pnec values for water were also used for the sediment ecotoxicity assessment by determining the chemical concentrations in pore water based on the equilibrium partitioning method epm echa 2021 the pore water concentration of chemicals was calculated as follows c p o r e w a t e r 1000 c s e d i m e n t f o c k o c where c p o r e w a t e r is the concentration ng l of target chemicals in the pore water c s e d i m e n t is the concentration ng g dw of target chemicals in the sediment f o c is the percentage of organic carbon in the sediment and k o c is the partition coefficient l kg of target chemicals between water and sediment organic carbon normalized concentration used obtained from epi suite tm 4 1 for hum t both the non carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks were assessed according to the suggested multi criteria screening method based on the function of the lake ecosystems ingestion and dermal contact exposure to water were evaluated for the freshwater lakes and dermal contact was evaluated for water in the soda lakes while dermal contact was only involved in sediment exposure for these lakes the average daily dose add for the different compartments was obtained using the following equations a d d w a t e r i n g e s t i o n c w i r e f e d b w a t a d d w a t e r d e r m a l c o n t a c t c w s a p c e t e f e d c f b w a t a d d s e d i m e n t d e

exposure duration body weight average exposure time skin permeation constant conversion factor body height and body surface area respectively and cs af and abs indicate the pore water concentration for chemicals in the sediment adherence factor to skin and absorption fraction for the specific chemical respectively a detailed introduction to these parameters are available from the risk assessment program documented by the usepa 2021 for the tanzanian lakes in the current study the potential risk induced by the target chemicals was only assessed for adults hum t which is implied by the non carcinogenic risk quotient rq and the carcinogenic risk the increment lifetime cancer risk ilcr could then be obtained as shown in zhao et al 2021 finally the score for each criteria was calculated using the geometric classification method and the 2 3 cumulative ranking method the total score ts for a particular chemical was then obtained by multiplying the scores for these five criteria the priority pollutant list of the target chemicals in the tanzanian lakes was established by arranging the ts from highest to lowest zhao et al 2021 3 results 3 1 occurrence of omps in water the concentrations of target omps and their distribution in water from different lakes are presented in fig 2 box plots for the concentration of individual chemicals as well as their percentage compositions are provided in the supplementary materials fig s1 and s2 paes were observed in all 18 lakes showing large variation from 835 0 to 13 153 1 ng l with a mean value of 3735 9 2926 9 ng l the highest concentration was detected in lake jipe in the prb followed by lake balangita 5569 1 ng l and lake mikuyu 5298 7 ng l in the irb and mabayani reservior 5177 5 ng l in the prb the lowest pae concentration was found in lake kindai in the irb several lakes including lake chala lake big momela lake singida and lake babati were found to have similar pae levels of less than 2000 ng l the 6 priority pae compounds dmp dep dibp dbp bbp and dehp as suggested by the usepa were detected at total levels of 510 3 10 069 7 ng l with a mean concentration of 2687 9 2926 9 ng l and accounting for 74 8 10 6 of the total paes among the paes dehp was the predominant compound followed by dbp and dibp ranging from nd 5183 8 ng l nd 3599 8 ng l and 86 5 2653 7 ng l respectively and contributing to 40 3 28 2 17 7 10 6 and 17 4 11 3 of the total paes dep and dibp were observed in 100 of the water samples followed by the relatively high detection frequencies of for dbp 94 4 dmp 88 9 bbp 83 3 and dehp 72 2 while dmpp dhp dbmp dchp dop and dnp were not detected in any water sample pahs were detected in all samples ranging from 18 5 to 182 4 ng l mean 69 9 48 1 ng l lake jipe showed the highest residue concentration among the 18 lakes followed by lake balangita 158 9 ng l and lake hombolo 114 0 ng l while the lowest concentration was found in lake eyasi two lakes of the irb namely lake singida and lake mikuyu presented lower levels of 26 6 ng l and 30 3 ng l respectively among the pahs 3 ringed congeners showed the highest residues in the range of 4 7 60 8 ng l mean 27 7 17 1 ng l accounting for 45 9 16 4 of the total pahs followed by 4 ringed components at levels of 2 3 84 3 ng l mean 20 1 22 2 ng l with a mean contribution of 27 8 18 6 which indicates the predomination of medium ringed components in the waters of tanzanian lakes for individual pahs acy phe ant pyr chr and bbf were detected in 100 of the water samples while bghip was not detected in any water samples for pcbs lake jipe also exhibited the maximum residue concentration of 19 7 ng l followed by the metera reservoir 5 8 ng l while the lowest level was detected in lake chala 0 6 ng l the rest of the lakes showed similar residue concentrations from 1 9 lake singida to 5 5 ng l lake hombolo thereby demonstrating a homogenized spatial pcb distribution when considering different atomic chlorine homologs the pcb homolog pattern in the tanzanian lakes was primarily composed of high atomic chlorine compounds showing the overall trend of hexa penta tetra tri pcbs whereas hepta pcbs were not detected in water dioxin like pcbs exhibited lower levels than index pcbs according to their observed values of 0 03 7 6 ng l mean 1 7 1 6 ng l and 0 5 12 1 ng l mean 2 5 2 6 ng l respectively pcb153 and pcb105 were detected in all samples ranging from 0 2 to 10 4 ng l mean 2 1 2 3 ng l and 0 03 7 6 ng l mean 1 6 1 6 ng l followed by pcb28 nd 1 5 ng l mean 0 3 0 4 ng l similar to the pcbs the highest concentration of ocps was observed in lake jipe 18 3 ng l and the lowest was observed in lake chala 0 8 ng l indicating that there are potentially less anthropogenic effects around lake chala relative to lake jipe lake balangita located in the irb showed a similar residual level 17 0 ng l as lake jipe while no spatial differences could be found for other lakes with ocp concentrations of less than 10 0 ng l for different ocp compounds in the water of tanzanian lakes the concentrations were ordered as follows hchs methoxychlor ends chlors ddts aldrins hchs were detected at a range of 0 04 6 9 ng l mean 2 2 1 7 ng l with a mean contribution of 35 6 17 1 of the total ocps followed by methoxychlor nd 9 9 ng l mean 1 6 2 4 ng l and ends 0 1 4 3 ng l mean 1 1 1 0 ng l ddts aldrins and chlors exhibited similar levels ranging from nd 4 6 ng l mean 0 6 1 1 ng l nd 1 8 ng l mean 0 5 0 6 ng l and nd 2 3 ng l mean 0 6 0 6 ng l respectively among the ocp individuals lindane γ hch and methoxychlor showed higher concentrations ranging from of nd 4 4 ng l mean 1 5 1 2 ng l and nd 9 9 ng l mean 1 6 2 4 ng l respectively than other chemicals with detection frequencies of 94 4 and 66 7 respectively several pesticides specifically heptachlor aldrin endrin aldehyde and endrin ketone were not detected accordingly the occurrence of typical omps in water samples from the tanzanian lakes implies that there were much higher concentrations of paes followed by pahs while ocps and pcbs showed similar residue concentrations being 2 or 3 orders of magnitude lower than paes these results demonstrate the potentially increasing risk of paes in aquatic ecosystems induced by their current anthropogenic production and excessive usage 3 2 occurrence of omps in sediment the omp residues and their spatial distribution in the sediment of tanzanian lakes are shown in fig 3 the occurrence of individual chemicals and their contributions are also listed in the supplementary fig s3 and s4 consistent with the residue pattern in water paes in the sediment showed higher concentrations than pahs ocps and pcbs typically these pae concentrations varied from 244 6 to 8691 8 ng g dw with a mean value of 1784 0 2088 3 ng g dw unlike the water samples the highest sediment concentration was found in lake chala followed by several lakes distributed within the irb including lake babati 3464 3 ng g dw lake singida 2600 4 ng g dw lake kindai 2544 7 ng g dw and lakes located in the prb such as lake jipe 2340 5 ng g dw and lake big momela 2178 9 ng g dw at the time of sampling lake duluti in the arusha region was the least polluted by paes the residues of six priority paes were found ranging from 123 3 to 6576 7 ng g dw mean 1234 9 1539 0 ng g dw accounting for 70 6 21 5 of the total sediment paes dep dmp and dehp were widely distributed with the highest residues observed for dehp in the range of 56 2 4981 8 ng g dw mean 1149 0 1496 3 ng g dw conversely dop only accumulated in the sediment of lake jipe showing a comparatively low level of 1 3 5 4 ng g dw sediment pahs were detected at concentrations from 11 6 to 241 2 ng g dw mean 51 3 53 2 ng g dw with the highest value detected in lake chala and the lowest in lake kintangiri while no substantially differences in spatial distribution were found for the rest lakes the carcinogenic pah congeners showed a range of 5 7 96 1 ng g dw mean 19 7 21 9 ng g dw contributing to 39 3 10 8 of the total sediment pahs compositional analysis demonstrated that medium ringed congeners 3 and 4 ringed compounds were the predominant accounting for 64 7 11 4 of the total sediment pahs followed by the high molecular weight congeners such as 5 and 6 ringed pahs 22 9 13 0 among the pah congeners phe flu and bbf were detected in 100 of the sediment samples with the values of 4 0 48 7 ng g dw mean 13 6 11 5 ng g dw 0 3 15 7 ng g dw mean 13 6 11 5 ng g dw and 0 6 10 7 ng g dw mean 3 4 2 9 ng g dw respectively for pcbs lake chala also documented the highest sediment residue concentration 5 5 ng g dw followed by lake jipe 1 3 ng g dw while lake kitangiri showed the lowest value 0 1 ng g dw the pcbs were mainly composed of hexa and penta homologs with residue concentrations in the range of 0 01 3 5 ng g dw mean 0 4 0 9 ng g dw and 0 01 1 2 ng g dw mean 0 2 0 3 ng g dw respectively accounting for 40 2 18 2 and 24 1 15 1 respectively of the total sediment pcbs tri and tetra pcbs were detected at similar concentrations specifically nd 0 2 ng g dw mean 0 07 0 07 ng g dw and nd 0 5 ng g dw mean 0 08 0 1 ng g dw showing contributions of 15 9 13 2 and 13 2 12 9 respectively hepta pcbs were the least detected congeners with a mean concentration of 0 04 0 06 ng g dw dioxin like pcbs ranged from 0 04 to 2 2 ng g dw mean 0 4 0 6 ng g dw representing 55 6 20 5 for the total observed pcbs pcb153 and pcb167 were two dominant congeners with mean concentrations of 0 3 0 7 ng g dw and 0 2 0 2 ng g dw respectively and detection frequencies of 61 1 and 83 3 respectively several congeners namely pcb52 pcb114 pcb126 and pcb189 were not detected in any sediments ocp residue concentrations in the sediments were detected at higher levels than pcbs and ranged from 2 6 to 35 1 ng g dw a mean of 7 3 7 9 ng g dw again lake chala was the most predominant followed by lake jipe 11 5 ng g dw lake babati 10 7 ng g dw lake mamka 8 0 ng g dw and lake mikuyu 7 7 ng g dw while lake mtera exhibited the lowest concentration hchs were the major components ranging from 1 4 to 9 0 ng g dw 3 5 1 9 ng g dw and accounting for 61 2 22 9 of the total sediment ocps the monomeric compound methoxychlor was detected at a mean of 1 6 2 1 ng g dw followed by ddts with the compounds accounting for 20 4 18 8 and 10 3 20 0 respectively the other ocp groups including aldrins chlors and ends shared similar contributions of 2 9 0 7 1 3 1 7 and 3 9 3 1 respectively among individuals α γ hch were detected in all samples with mean values of 0 4 0 7 ng g dw and 3 0 1 8 ng g dw respectively for ddts the concentration of the aerobic metabolite p p dde was higher than that of both p p ddd anaerobic metabolite and p p ddt parent compound thereby demonstrating the predominance of the aerobic process in surface sediments conversely several compounds including endrin ketone endrin aldehyde heptachlor and α chlordane were not detected in summary similar residue trends were found between sediment and water samples specifically higher pae pollution was observed followed by pahs while pollution by ocps and pcbs was lower lake chala registered as highly polluted with omps in the sediment while the water was shown to be severely polluted this might be due to its potential high sedimentation rate and long retention time rt however this needs to be further explored 4 discussion 4 1 priority omps in water according to the multi criteria screening method a total of 31 chemicals comprising 5 paes 7 pcbs 9 ocps and 10 pah congeners were ranked as high priority pollutants in the water media based on their total score ts fig 4 a the most important chemicals were dehp pcb153 pcb105 trans chlordane bap baa bbf dibp and dbp tss from 265 to 402 along with an additional 7 pahs 8 ocps 5 pcbs and 2 paes tss from 163 to 251 as further demonstrated by the contribution of each criteria to the ts of the individual pollutants fig 5 a the high priority assigned to dehp dibp and dbp was predominantly due to their high detection occurrence followed by the sensitive responses from both the ecology and human health perspectives while the basic hazard profiles such as persistence and bioaccumulation capacity were not predominating factors for pahs equal contributions attributed to occurrence bioaccumulation ecological risk and human health risk were observed for bap baa and bbf the high priority of pyr and flt was mainly due to the substantial contribution associated with occurrence 33 2 and 42 3 respectively in addition to pcb153 and pcb105 for traditional pops pcb congeners including pcb28 pcb138 pcb52 pcb 156 and pcb157 were determined to be priority mainly due to their bioaccumulation potential as for ocps the hazard profiles of persistence and bioaccumulation capacity were generally responsible for the prioritization of trans chlordane cis chlordane p p dde endrin endosulfan i p p ddt endosulfan sulfate methoxychlor and heptachlor epoxide in the water of the tanzanian lakes the priority omps in the water of the tanzanian lakes were composed of chemicals currently being produced or used at high levels as well as the historically widely used pop substances that resisted degradation thus bioaccumulating as a result for example paes are used as plasticizers in pvc plastics therefore specific members of this chemical family can be found in many consumer products including packaging bags coating materials personal care products nail polish vinyl gloves floor tiles traffic cones carpet tiles tablecloths furniture upholstery shower curtains and garden hoses das et al 2021 hamid et al 2020 among which dehp is one of the most widespread phthalate plasticizers used in numerous consumer products commodities and building materials takdastan et al 2021 similarly dbp is used in cosmetic products such as nail polish to avoid chipping and in the preparation of specific adhesives and cellulosic coatings since paes in the polymeric matrix are linked by hydrogen bonding or van der waals forces they tend to release easily from any pae containing products and then migrate into the environment throughout all stages of the product lifecycle li et al 2020 as a result pae congeners have been frequently detected in the water and sediment of lakes around the world among which dehp and dbp have been identified as the primary paes in lake ecosystems ajay et al 2021 yang et al 2021 le et al 2021 nantaba et al 2021 which is consistent with their occurrence in tanzanian lakes as elucidated from the present study moreover as a replacement for dbp dibp is also becoming predominant in the environment pahs are mainly produced from the incomplete combustion of fossil fuels as well as vehicular traffic incineration industrial emissions oil spillages and the burning of biomass such as wood and grass to a lesser extent they are also formed through natural combustion processes such as forest fires volcanic eruptions biosynthesis and natural oil seepages wang et al 2021 finally due to their semi volatile property and capacity for long range atmospheric transport pahs are ubiquitous in the environment thereby likely inducing potential ecological and human health risks for receiving waters as demonstrated in our study 4 2 priority omps in sediment the ts values and the final priority omps screened out from sediment of the tanzanian lakes are shown in fig 4 b while the percent contribution of each criteria for individual pollutants is shown in fig 5 b in the sediments 33 omp components were deemed high priority specifically 9 paes 9 ocps 9 pcbs and 6 pahs the top 10 priority substances with tss ranging from 292 to 368 were dehp dchp heptachlor epoxide pcb153 inp pcb167 dmpp p p ddd dbp bbf followed by dibp and pcb156 the other three detected high priority pae congeners were deep dmep and dptp the other detected ocps were p p ddt endosulfan ii cis chlordane p p dde γ hch methoxychlor and endrin the pcbs consisted of isomers pcb180 pcb105 pcb157 pcb118 pcb28 and pcb77 while the other detected pahs were baa bap daha and pyr considering the percentages of the different criteria a similar phenomenon as that of the water was observed for which equal contributions of field occurrence bioaccumulation potential ecological risk and human exposure risk were detected for paes with some relatively higher proportions of occurrence for ddep and dep moreover pahs presented similarities while for pcbs and ocps the bioaccumulation capacities of chemicals were primarily responsible for their prioritization in sediment thus it can be concluded that the risks for both ecological and human exposure induced by the high occurrence of currently applied pollutants will decide the priority of these compounds in the sediment whereas the hazard profiles of particular banned pops should be considered based on their prioritization in both environmental compartments the priority screening results indicate equal attention should be paid to both popular emerging endocrine disrupters and traditional pops 4 3 priority omp list for tanzanian lakes a final priority omp list for the aquatic environment of tanzanian lakes was obtained by combining the priority substances screened for both water and sediment those classified as top priority for specific media were selected and then the remaining list was established by choosing the chemicals that appeared in both media as a result the priority omp list was composed of 25 chemicals specifically 5 paes dehp dibp dbp dchp and dmpp 6 pcbs pcb153 pcb105 pcb28 pcb156 pcb157 and pcb167 6 pahs bap baa bbf pyr daha and inp and 8 ocps cis chlordane trans chlordane p p ddd p p dde p p ddt endrin methoxychlor and heptachlor epoxide table 2 verification of the obtained priority omp list for the tanzanian lakes was performed by comparing it with international priority substance lists for paes increasing concern over their highly abundant presence in the environment and their possible endocrine disrupting effects has led the usepa to declare dmp dep dbp dehp dop and bbp as six typical priority pollutants das et al 2021 additionally as suggested by the list of 129 priority pollutants established by the usepa as well as the lists published by the agency for toxic substances and disease registry astdr european commission eu canada and china the identified prioritization of dchp and dmpp in the tanzanian lake ecosystem should also be emphasized in this region along with dehp dibp and dbp among the 16 priority pahs only several 4 and 5 ringed congeners were recognized as priority compounds in the present study for historically used pcbs and ocps the hexa pcb homologs among the pcbs and chlors and ddts among the ocps are the predominant pop like chemicals that should be continuously monitored and evaluated in the tanzanian lakes in order to assess the efficiency to which the stockholm convention has been implemented in this country since april 2004 as previously reported the inventory of pops undertaken in early 2003 revealed that there are approximately 17 4 mt of obsolete pop pesticide stocks including aldrin dieldrin chlordane heptachlor and toxaphene and 170 6 mt of ddts stored in various site around tanzania ipen 2005a moreover a 2004 survey showed that there are 418 pieces of electrical equipment containing 273 mt of oil suspected to contain pcbs which could lead to frequent spillage at sites without protective measures ipen 2005b 2019 therefore the relatively high prioritization percentages of ocps and pcbs were expected in summary 22 of the 25 priority substances found in the aquatic environment of tanzanian lakes are also found in the priority pollutant list of the usepa 21 compounds are included in the astdr substance priority list 16 are in the eu priority list 8 are ranked as priority substances psl1 and psl2 by the canadian environmental protection act and 10 chemicals are also suggested as priority by china the overlapping chemicals among international organizations further demonstrate that these chemicals should be considered as priority in the tanzania lakes in addition based this field investigation the high priority of commonly detected paes such as dehp dibp and dbp in this region demonstrates the necessity for updating the original priority substance list 5 conclusions to the best of our knowledge this is the first study to describe the typical omps in the water and sediment from equatorial lakes located in north eastern tanzania thereby providing comprehensive identification and priority pollutant screening of toxic omps in the aquatic ecosystem of this sub saharan african region typical omp compounds namely paes pahs pcbs and ocps were ubiquitous in the tanzanian lakes higher pae concentrations were detected in both the water and sediment relative to pahs followed by the traditional pop like chemicals such as pcbs and ocps which can be attributed to the current omp specific production or usage of these compounds the multi criteria ranking method for priority pollutant screening suggests a final priority list consisting of 25 chemicals specifically 5 paes 6 pcbs 6 pahs and 8 ocps among which dehp a pae showed top priority the predominance of paes in equatorial lakes as well as their priority among target omps indicate the increasingly deleterious effects on aquatic organisms and human health due to their widely usage of plasticizers and endocrine disruptor

avenue for sustainable environmental remediation graphical abstract this study developed a biomass based system for affordable and effective photothermocatalytic water disinfection and revealed the underlying mechanisms image graphical abstract keywords solar disinfection nature inspired material photothermal photocatalytic bactericidal mechanism 1 introduction although huge efforts have been made in the last few decades to disinfect water the lack of access to safe drinking water is still one of the greatest challenges worldwide especially in low and lower middle income countries the population who has no access to safe water and sanitation services is as large as 4 5 billion ferreira et al 2021 along with annual deaths of over half a million caused by the consumption of contaminated water loeb et al 2018 pichel et al 2019 driven by the urgent social needs for safe drinking water the united nations proposed a goal of ensure access to water and sanitation for all to be accomplished by 2030 ryberg et al 2021 therefore affordable low cost and effective water disinfection systems are urgently needed to achieve universal access to safe drinking water wang et al 2019b in comparison with centralized water treatment point of use pou water treatment demonstrates the advantages of low initial investment cost and easy operation matching well with the needs from rural communities ryberg et al 2018 2021 solar disinfection sodis is one of the most intensively used pou water disinfection methods taking advantage of the short wavelength uv and the thermal effect of sunlight to inactivate hazardous microorganisms however sodis suffers from the insufficient disinfection efficiency e g less than 0 5 log inactivation of e coli k 12 within 1 h and the requirement for long time exposure e g 1 to 2 days to sunlight cowie et al 2020 loeb et al 2018 ozores diez et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the use of additives such as photothermal catalysts is an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of sodis thanks to the synergetic effect between photocatalysis and photothermal conversion photothermocatalytic materials potentially outperform their semiconductor and photothermal catalyst counterparts rommozzi et al 2020 our recent work reported an ag mno2 catalyst capable of achieving significantly enhanced inactivation of e coli k 12 upon sunlight irradiation thanks to the synergetic effect between the substantially increased temperature of the bulk water from 25 to 60 c and the generation of reactive oxygen species ros xia et al 2019 however the metal based catalysts have certain drawbacks such as high cost photo corrosion and metal leaching which limit their large scale practical applications chang et al 2016 taniguchi et al 2020 wang et al 2020b these issues drive researchers to explore low cost and metal free materials capable of efficient photothermocatalytic pou water disinfection ding et al 2020 li et al 2019 xia et al 2015 zhang et al 2020a learning from nature offers a promising approach for the development of cost effective and metal free biomaterials for water treatment plenty of biological sources in nature are qualified as environmental functional materials with minor modifications some of us have found that the treated rape pollen trp was a promising biomass derived photocatalyst exhibiting a high density of active sites and wide spectrum response jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a it could inactivate 7 log10 cfu ml of e coli k 12 within 4 h under visible light given the good photocatalytic activity trp would be qualified as a photocatalyst candidate to be coupled with an effective photothermal material thus realizing the synergetic photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation noble metals e g au ag and pt etc with localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect have been intensively used as photothermal materials fan et al 2016 seh et al 2012 wang et al 2018a xia et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 2017 zielinski et al 2016 these noble metals can generate hot charge carriers and dissipate their energy by local heating of the surroundings kale et al 2013 mateo et al 2021 favorable for the photocatalytic and photothermal reactions however considering the low investment cost of pou water treatment at a rural household level noble metals are cost prohibitive this motivates researchers to search non noble metals as alternative photothermal catalysts recently the semi metallic tellurium te has been demonstrated to exhibit broadband solar energy harvesting and efficient photothermal conversion yu et al 2018 te nanoparticles show broad optical absorption up to 3500 nm making te nanoparticles rapidly increase from 29 to 85 c within 100 s irradiated by a halogen tungsten lamp with the spectrum similar to sunlight ma et al 2018 in addition the small bandgap 0 35 ev of te may facilitate the separation of charge carriers of a te loaded semiconductor and thus contribute to the photocatalytic performance lee et al 2013 the unique three dimensional porous structure of trp provides large accessible surface areas for loading te nanomaterials therefore we hypothesize that the combination of te with trp would lead to the desirable properties for water disinfection in this work the te nanowires loaded trp te trp was for the first time developed and applied to sodis the rapid 100 bacterial inactivation of 7 13 log e coli k 12 was achieved by te trp under simulated sunlight within 60 min mechanistic study showed that te trp exhibited altered wettability synergetic photocatalytic and photothermal effect and improved photocatalytic properties leading to the efficient sodis performance to realize a real world pou water treatment the flow through sodis system was established and the performance of te trp catalyst was examined the mechanisms of the significantly increased activity of te trp was systematically investigated followed by the study of bactericidal pathway in the photothermocatalytic treatment to guide future design of advanced catalysts 2 experimental 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this work are analytical grade and used without further

60 c for 48 h the brown trp powder was obtained fig s1 2 2 2 fabrication of te trp the ultrafine te nanowires loaded trp was fabricated by a hydrothermal method he et al 2016 liang et al 2013 typically 0 05 g of the as prepared trp 0 08 g of sodium tellurite na2teo3 and 0 5 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp were dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water under violent stirring with the assistance of ultrasound then 3 5 ml of nh3 h2o and 1 5 ml of n2h4 h2o were added as reducing agents and stirred for another 1 h after that the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml autoclave and heated in an oven at 200 c for 10 h after cooling to room temperature the resultant product was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm min for 10 min and washed with deionized water until the solution ph turned neutral after vacuum drying at 60 c for 24 h the te trp composite with the te to trp mass ratio of being 1 1 was obtained in addition the te trp composites with the te trp mass ratio of 1 2 2 1 and 4 1 were prepared by varying the dosage of na2teo3 being 0 08 0 32 and 0 64 g respectively unless otherwise specified the te trp mass ratio in te trp is 1 1 2 3 material characterizations the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of samples were recorded on a rigaku d max 2200 diffractometer with monochromatic cu kα radiation at a scanning speed of 8 s from 10 0 to 80 0 the morphology of samples was investigated by a quanta 400f thermal field emission scanning electron microscopy sem shimazhu japan fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded using a nicolet is10 ftir spectrometer thermofisher scientific u s a with 0 2 cm 1 resolution uv vis nir diffuse reflectance spectra drs were measured by a lambda 950 uv vis nir spectrophotometer perkinelmer u s a photoelectrochemical experiments were carried out in 1 0m na2so4 solution with a chi 660d electrochemical workstation using a three electrode system in which a platinum electrode was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel

angle tester kruss dsa25 germany the submerged thermocouple microprobe was used to monitor the solution temperature under irradiation 2 4 photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation e coli k 12 was chosen as the model bacterium to evaluate the bacterial inactivation bacterial cells were cultured in 25 ml of nutrient broth nb at 37 c for 16 h under shaking then 10 ml of the e coli k 12 suspension was collected centrifugated at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed with sterilized water twice subsequently 2 5 mg of catalyst was added into 5 ml of deionized water containing 107 cfu ml of e coli k 12 and irradiated by the simulated sunlight light intensity 200 mw cm2 spectrum is shown in fig s2 provided by a xenon lamp pls sxe300d beijing perfectlight china at given time intervals samples were collected and spread on agar plates for incubation the viable cells were counted after incubation at 37 c for 24 h to investigate the effectivity of te trp to inactivate other types of bacteria spingopyxis sp bm1 1 and staphylococcus s aureus were also used to evaluate the reusability and stability the photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation was repeated 5 times using the recycled te trp before each run the suspended te trp would float to the water surface which can be easily recovered by skimming followed by a thorough wash with ethanol and deionized water to remove the adhered bacterial residues and other substances before being dried at 60 c overnight to move toward practical pou operations a continuous flow through disinfection system was built to examine the disinfection performance of te trp in flowing water under natural sunlight irradiation 35 mw cm2 as shown in fig 4a c this system consisted of a circulating pump a bench scale reactor and a triangle bottle with a magnetic stirrer upon bacterial inactivation the water flow was cycled through the flow through disinfection system the concentration of te trp catalyst was 0 2 mg ml the initial e coli k 12 concentration was 3 7 log10 cfu ml close to that in natural water the suspended te trp catalyst in water was recovered by a floating method as shown in fig 5g i to estimate the catalyst recovery rate using this method the te trp residues in the purified water from outlet were collected by filtration for weight measurement 2 5 ros analysis ros were detected and analyzed by an electron spin resonance esr spectrometer bruker a300 spin traps can capture ros and produce spin adducts 2 4 6 trimethylpyridine temp aqueous solution 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso solution and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo aqueous solution were used to trap 1o2 o2 and oh respectively to identify the ros generated via photothermocatalytic photocatalytic and photothermal reactions respectively the esr spectra for each ros were recorded under various conditions 1 irradiated by simulated sunlight without temperature adjustment 2 irradiated by simulated sunlight with temperature adjustment fixed at 25 c to allow photocatalysis alone and 3 without irradiation but with temperature adjustment fixed at 55 c to simulate the photothermal process in addition to esr a scavenger study was carried out to evaluate the roles of reactive species in the bacterial inactivation process 2 mm of sodium azide nan3 tempol and isopropyl alcohol ipa were used to quench 1o2 o2 and oh respectively 2 6 biomolecule oxidation assay and enzyme activity cell viability assay sem imaging qualification of superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat enzymes analysis of bacterial membrane permeability and determination of single cell activity were shown in supplementary text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterizations xrd was used to analyze the crystal structure and phase composition of te nanowires trp and te trp as shown in fig 1 a pure te nanowires displayed sharp and strong diffraction peaks at 2θ 23 04 27 56 38 26 40 45 43 33 45 9 47 05 49 63 51 24 51 94 56 88 and 62 81 which were well indexed to the t te phase jcpds no 36 1452 the xrd patterns of bare trp only exhibited a wide diffraction peak at around 20 revealing the amorphous structure jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a the te trp composites showed the same diffraction peak positions as te but the intensity of some diffraction peaks varied which was attributed to the changed surface exposure of te nanowires after loading on trp the ftir spectra fig 1b showed that trp was mainly composed of c o ch3 and ch ch bonds peaks appeared at 1720 cm 1 and 1230 cm 1 indicated the presence of c o bond in trp the peak at 2930 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching of c h wang et al 2019a the ftir spectrum of te trp mainly followed suit indicating the preserved tpr structure upon te loading the uv vis nir drs spectra were performed to investigate the optical property of trp and te trp as shown in fig 1c te trp exhibited strong and broad absorption in uv visible and even infrared ir regions while trp showed strong uv but insufficient visible light absorption indicating the significantly extended spectral response and improved light harvesting capacity of te trp sem images were recorded to examine the morphologies of trp before and after te loading as shown in fig 2 a te nanowires exhibited a uniform ultrafine nanowire structure fig 2b showed the unique three dimensional porous hollow structure of trp with an average particle diameter of 1 to 2 µm this structure would not only provide abundant surface sites for the growth of te nanowires but also favor the contact with bacterial cells sem images of te trp clearly showed the well loaded te nanowires on either the inner or outer surface of trp regarding the te nanowires on the tpr outer surface they primarily concentrated on the pollen framework with a small portion across the pores the unique distribution of te nanowires would affect the near field optical intensity of te trp upon irradiation which will be discussed in section 3 3 it has been acknowledged that trp was not suitable for liquid phase operations due to its high hydrophobicity xiao et al 2019 the loading of te nanowires a hydrophilic material on trp is expected to change the wettability and enable te trp for effective water disinfection we then measured the water contact angle wca to evaluate the wettability of our samples as shown in fig 2e the wca of bare te nanowires was 24 6 revealing the strong hydrophilicity while the wca of bare trp was 110 fig 2g which demonstrated that trp had strong hydrophobicity unfavorable for water disinfection operations as expected the wca of the te trp composites was reduced to 45 2 fig 2f revealing that the loading of te nanowires could improve the hydrophilicity of trp thereby favoring the dispersion of the composites in water and facilitating the contact between te trp and bacterial cells 3 2 solar driven photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation performance bench scale experiments to evaluate the photothermocatalytic performance we started by investigating the bacterial inactivation of e coli k 12 one of the most commonly detected bacteria in contaminated water using the benchmark bacterial cell density 1 107 cfu ml wang et al 2019a as shown in fig 3 a the te trp composite completely inactivated 7 13 log e coli k 12 within 1 h significantly outperforming its counterparts bare trp and te nanowires which achieved only 3 52 and 3 89 log inactivation of e coli k 12 respectively the outstanding photothermocatalytic activity of te trp was primarily attributed to the synergetic effect between trp and te which will be discussed in section 3 3 the negligible biotoxicity of te trp was verified by the tiny decrease in cell population in the presence of te trp in dark sunlight alone without catalyst only inactivated 0 57 log e coli k 12 cells indicating that sunlight had almost no photolysis to bacterial cells to identify whether the te trp catalyst is uv or visible nir favored in the sodis process the photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation was also carried out under visible nir irradiation using the uv cut off simulated sunlight as shown in fig s3 the visible nir light driven antibacterial efficiency was slightly lower than that irradiated by full sunlight with 5 36 log e coli k 12 cells inactivated within 1 h therefore te trp was determined to be visible nir favored in the sodis operation optimization of te to trp mass ratio and catalyst concentration to achieve the highest photothermocatalytic efficiency parameters such as te to trp mass ratio and catalyst concentration were optimized first the performance of the te trp composites with various te trp mass ratios was evaluated as shown in fig 3b the te trp composite with te trp mass ratio of 1 1 showed the most efficient bacterial inactivation while the lower bactericidal efficiency was observed by either increasing or decreasing the te content te trp 2 1 te trp 4 1 and te trp 1 2 achieved 5 84 4 77 and 4 65 log10 cfu ml of bacterial inactivation within 1 h respectively given the fact that the photothermal effect of te trp is primarily due to the presence of te nanowires will be shown later on the one hand the insufficient te loading would lead to the lower photothermal conversion efficiency which is unfavorable for bacterial inactivation on the other hand the excessive loading of te nanowires on trp would cause a heavy coverage of the photoactive sites on trp surface and thus suppress the photocatalytic reactions subsequently the concentration of te trp catalyst was optimized using the best performing te trp composite te trp mass ratio 1 1 as shown in fig 3c the bactericidal efficiency decreased when further increasing the te trp concentration from 0 5 to 1 0 mg ml or above the results were ascribed to the reduced light penetration and insufficient light harvesting owing to the excessive dosage of te trp decreasing the catalyst concentration from 0 5 to 0 25 mg ml also led to a lower bactericidal efficiency which was due to the ineffective photothermal conversion and the limited number of photoactive sites photothermocatalytic inactivation of other bacteria considering the presence of bacteria other than e coli in water matrixes the photothermocatalytic inactivation of other bacteria i e gram negative spingopyxis sp bm1 1 and gram positive s aureus bacteria were studied spingopyxis sp bm1 1 is highly resistant to chlorine and would survive in sewage after chlorination treatment impressively te trp completely inactivated 7 1 log spingopyxis sp bm1 1 cells within 40 min under simulated sunlight representing an efficiency even higher than that towards e coli k 12 in comparison with spingopyxis sp bm1 1 it took longer 90 min to inactivate s aureus 6 7 log under the same condition but the efficiency was still satisfactory it could be deduced that te trp would be more applicable for the inactivation of gram negative bacteria the above results emphasized the great potential of te trp in inactivating a wide range of bacteria especially gram negative organisms stability and reusability of te trp the stability and reusability of catalysts are important for their practical applications as such we evaluated the stability and reusability of our catalyst by repeating the photothermocatalytic experiments 5 times and examining the morphology of te trp by sem after multiple reuses as shown in fig 4 a the bactericidal efficiency slightly decreased after each cycle which was mainly due to the mass loss of te trp and the accumulation of bacterial residues on te trp but te trp still realized 6 log e coli k 12 inactivation in the 5th run corresponding to as high as 99 inactivation efficiency the sem images of te trp before and after 5 cycle runs showed negligible changes fig 4b and c therefore the structure of te trp remained intact after multiple runs these results demonstrated the high stability and reusability of te trp flow through water disinfection to evaluate the potential of our catalysts for more practical pou operations a pilot scale circulating flow through disinfection system was constructed and used for sodis the diagram and photographs of the flow through reactor are presented in fig 5 a c as shown in fig 5d after being irradiated by natural sunlight for 60 min e coli k 12 bacteria in the flow through disinfection system were completely inactivated by te trp whereas sunlight alone and bare trp achieved 0 18 and 0 58 log bacterial inactivation under the same conditions respectively indicating the significantly enhanced disinfection by te trp in addition the spread plate assay fig 5e and f showed that the bacteria after 60 min treatment were non culturable demonstrating the complete bacterial inactivation by te trp the affordable recovery of catalysts for reuse is important in a real world water treatment as shown in fig 5g i thanks to the low material density of te trp as high as 99 67 of te trp was recovered via a floating method in 30 min without additional energy supply the preliminary cost of this flow through water disinfection system was estimated to be ca 0 001 l text s3 which is similar to or even lower than that of other pou water disinfection methods such as edible dye enhanced sodis 0 001 0 002 l ryberg et al 2018 and water boiling 0 001 0 007 l clasen et al 2008a 2008b thus te trp showed great potential for cost effective bacterial inactivation in practical water treatment operations 3 3 mechanistic investigations bulk water heating to explore the photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation mechanisms we started by evaluating the photothermal conversion performance by monitoring the bulk water heating the thermo images fig 6 a showed that the temperature of te trp suspension increased from ca 27 c to 55 60 c within 30 min under sunlight irradiation enabling the photothermal effect and promoting the photocatalytic reactions by contrast the thermo images of pure water fig 6b showed a negligible temperature increase within 30 min under the same condition the solid state infrared thermographic images fig 6c demonstrated that the local temperature of te trp powder 99 3 c was higher than that of te 86 5 c and trp 61 9 c powders the localized high temperature of catalysts would heat the surrounding environment and attack bacterial cells the in situ temperature measurement fig 6d showed that the temperature of te trp suspension rapidly increased from 27 to 57 c within 20 min and stayed at this value afterward for pure water and trp suspension their temperature increased to 38 5 c and 42 3 c after 10 min and remained unchanged with prolonged irradiation these results revealed that te trp exhibited an efficient photothermal conversion of sunlight and rapidly heated the bulk water to a relatively high temperature capable of facilitating bacterial inactivation ni et al 2015 simulation of the near field electric optical intensity to better understand the photothermal mechanisms the simulation of electric optical intensity near trp and te trp particles upon irradiation was carried out text s1 the catalyst models were constructed based on the sem results fig 2b and d where the quantity ratio of te nanowires located on trp framework te nanowires located on trp pores and trp pores was estimated to be 13 1 1 as shown in fig 7 and supplementary fig s4 when the plane wave reached the surface of trp and te trp the distribution of electric field exhibited a heterogeneity with periodic oscillation due to the scattering effect of samples for bare trp figs 7a and s4b high optical intensity was observed in pores and partial regions of the inside hollow space intensity higher than the plane wave therefore the porous and hollow structures of trp would favor light harvesting and the subsequent photothermal conversion regarding the te trp composite with all te nanowires on the framework figs 7b and s4c the optical intensity upon light irradiation almost remained unchanged compared with that of bare trp indicating that such te distribution played a negligible role in alerting the optical properties of te trp by contrast te nanowires on the tpr pores could significantly improve the optical intensity fig 7c with the average enhancement locally reaching up to approximately 5 times of incident light intensity compared to the values observed in fig 7b the results revealed that the enhanced near field optical intensity of te trp was primarily ascribed to the presence of te nanowires located on the trp pores it should be noted that although te nanowires on trp framework showed an insignificant effect on the optical intensity their contributions to photothermocatalytic treatment cannot be underestimated due to their lspr effect and important roles in facilitating charger transfer and reducing the recombination of electron hole pairs as we will show later ros analysis to verify the generated ros from te trp via photocatalytic photothermal and photothermocatalytic processes esr measurement was carried out under different conditions as shown in fig 8 a the peak of dmpo o2 complexes with a quadruple characteristic peak peak intensity 1 1 1 1 were observed in the photothermocatalytic system wang et al 2021b whereas such peaks were absent in photocatalytic and photothermal systems indicating that the generation of o2 required the synergy of photocatalysis and photothermal conversion the peak intensity of dmpo o2 at 2 min was close to that at 5 min fig 8b thus the concentration of the steady state o2 was stable after 2 min as displayed in fig 8c temp 1o2 signals with triple characteristic peaks peak intensity 1 1 1 appeared in all systems whereas the signals in photothermocatalytic system were stronger than those in the other two systems suggesting the generation of more 1o2 by photothermocatalytic behaviors the presence of dmpo oh peaks peak intensity 1 2 2 1 in photothermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems and the absence of dmpo oh peaks in photothermal system were observed fig 8e indicating that the photothermal process could hardly produce oh radicals given the slightly higher intensities of dmpo oh peaks in photothermocatalytic system than that in photocatalytic systems oh radicals should be mainly produced via photocatalysis to obtain an in depth understanding of the roles of o2 1o2 and oh in bacterial inactivation scavenging studies were carried out using the specific scavengers to quench the individual ros and verify its contribution to bacterial inactivation as shown in fig 8g the significant decrease in bacterial inactivation efficiencies after adding tempol and nan3 unveiled the crucial roles of o2 and 1o2 the moderate decrease of cell density from 7 14 to 3 69 log10 cfu ml indicated that oh radicals were involved in bacterial inactivation but they were not the major contributor synergetic effect between photothermal conversion and photocatalysis although the high photothermal activity of te trp was confirmed the individual contribution of photothermal effect to photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation and the synergy between photocatalytic and photothermal inactivation are unclear therefore a water bath was used in bacterial inactivation experiments to control the environment temperature and to differentiate the roles of photocatalysis and photothermal effect experiments were first carried out at a fixed room temperature under sunlight irradiation to eliminate the photothermal conversion as displayed in fig 8h only 3 29 log e coli k 12 cells were inactivated within 1 h in addition the bacterial inactivation experiment was performed at 55 c in dark to simulate the photothermal conversion alone such temperature was the same as the photothermocatalytic system using te trp upon sunlight irradiation fig 6d in this case 3 58 log e coli k 12 was inactivated similar as that in photocatalysis therefore photothermal effect and photocatalysis almost contributed equally to bacterial inactivation in the photothermocatalytic process given the efficient 7 13 log bacterial inactivation by photothermocatalytic treatment we argue that the photothermal effect and photocatalysis show a synergetic effect that enables the more efficient bacterial inactivation band structure characterization and photoelectrochemical properties to further investigate the mechanism of the enhanced photothermocatalytic activity of te trp the band structures and photoelectrochemical properties of trp and te trp were analyzed the positive slopes of mott schottky plots fig 9 a revealed the n type semiconductor feature of trp and te trp therefore the conduction band minimum cbm position was close to the flat potential which was 0 39 v and 0 45 v vs saturated calomel electrode sce for trp and te trp respectively determined by the intercept of x axis the equation e nhe e sce 0 24 v was applied to convert sce to normal hydrogen electrode nhe xu et al 2018 as a result the cbm positions were 0 63 v and 0 69 v vs nhe for trp and te trp respectively the bandgap of trp and te trp was calculated to be 1 85 ev and 1 01 ev respectively as shown in the tauc plots fig 9b the narrowed bandgap of te trp could lead to easier photo excitation and better light harvesting according to kubelka munk function wang et al 2018c the valence band maximum vbm positions of trp and te trp were estimated to be 1 22 and 0 32 ev respectively the band structure characterization allows us to further investigate the generation of ros by te trp theoretically the photogenerated e at the conduction band of te trp is negative enough to convert o2 h2o into 1o2 0 11 v xia et al 2018a as shown in eq 2 which was validated by the critical role of 1o2 in bacterial inactivation fig 8g as shown in eq 3 the photogenerated e by te trp was able to reduce the dissolved oxygen to o2 0 33 ev wang et al 2020a xia et al 2016 the generated o2 could further transfer into 1o2 and h2o2 eq 4 the photogenerated h from vb of te trp 0 32 v is not positive enough to convert o2 h2o into oh 2 8 v xia et al 2015 causing the insignificant bactericidal role of oh the generation of oh as confirmed in the earlier esr result should be achieved via a multi step pathway as shown in eqs 3 5 electrons generated by trp would enrich on te nanowires and thus inhibited the recombination of electrons and holes so that the adsorbed o2 h2o could capture electrons more efficiently to form ros furthermore the heat generated by the photothermal conversion could attack cell membrane and facilitate the damage from ros to bacterial cells based on the above discussion the process of photothermocatalytic e coli k 12 inactivation over te trp was shown in eqs 1 6 1 te trp sunlight h e 2 o2 h 1o2 3 e o2 o2 4 o2 h2o h2o2 oh 5 h2o2 hν 2 oh 6 oh o2 1o2 heat e coli cell debris to evaluate the recombination of electron hole pairs and the charge transfer behaviors photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted the smaller arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectra eis plots of te trp than pristine trp indicated the lower charge transfer resistance fig 9c wang et al 2018c in addition the higher photocurrent density of te trp than trp revealed the more abundant charge carriers and the more efficient charge transfer in te trp fig 9d benefiting the photocatalytic reactions 3 4 damage to bacterial cells destruction of bacterial cells to look into the destruction process of bacterial cells upon photothermaocatalytic treatment we first identified the cell activity with a fluorescence microscope where cells were stained by live dead baclight bacterial viability kit as shown in fig 10 a c almost all e coli k 12 exhibited green fluorescence revealing that the cell membrane of e coli k 12 was intact before treatment after being irradiated by sunlight for 10 min a small number of e coli k 12 cells showed red fluorescence indicating the partial inactivation of bacteria when the reaction time was extended to 60 min all the bacteria displayed red fluorescence demonstrating the complete inactivation of e coli k 12 the sem images of e coli k 12 cells were recorded to monitor the damage of cell membrane as shown in fig 10d f e coli k 12 cells showed a typical rod shape with intact cell membrane structure before treatment meanwhile a large number of e coli k 12 cells were adsorbed on the surface of te trp this would be favorable for photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation because many photocatalytic and thermal reactions necessitate the short range contact between catalysts and targets with the treatment for 10 min the cell membranes of e coli k 12 shrunk and became unsmooth indicating the heavy attacks on cell membranes wang et al 2018b finally the cell membrane was seriously broken when the treatment was prolonged to 60 min resulting in the disability of energy dependent reactions as well as the oxidation and or leakage of the cytoplasmic substances enzyme activity the bacterial cell membrane was responsible for the production of enzymes to resist external attacks therefore the activity of anti oxidative enzymes was detected by measuring the generation of superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat by cells sod can react with o2 to form o2 and h2o2 and cat can trigger h2o2 to form o2 and h2o thus reducing the attack of these ros xiao et al 2019 as shown in fig 10g in the first 30 min the contents of these two enzymes increased gradually at the beginning of the photothermocatalytic treatment the stress antioxidant system of the cell membrane produced sufficient sod and cat to fight against ros after 30 min the cell membrane of e coli was seriously damaged and lost the ability to produce antioxidant enzymes owing to the persistent attacks of ros as suggested by the decreased concentration of sod and cat cell membrane permeability the inner membrane cytoplasmic membrane permeability of bacteria was investigated by onpg a higher value of od420 indicates the increased bacterial inner membrane permeability as shown in fig 10h in the photothermal system od420 increased from 0 011 to 0 046 within 60 min indicating that the photothermal effect of te trp would slightly increase the membrane permeability regarding the photocatalytic system od420 reached to 0 084 at 60 min suggesting that photocatalysis contributed more to altering the membrane permeability than the photothermal effect compared with the individual photocatalytic and photothermal system od420 values in the photothermocatalytic system were significantly higher indicating that photocatalysis and photothermal conversion had a synergistic effect on attacking the cell inner membrane vbnc analysis under certain environmental conditions bacteria would present a viable but non culturable vbnc state although cells in the vbnc state cannot form colonies they remain alive and can recover the culturability in appropriate conditions zhang et al 2015 therefore the d2o labeled confocal raman micro spectroscopy was utilized to verify if vbnc bacteria are completely inactivated vbnc cells can absorb d2o and form c d bonds showing a broad peak at 2040 2300 cm 1 in the raman spectrum while c d peaks are absent or appear at very low levels in the raman spectrum of dead cells wang et al 2021a as shown in fig 10i strong c d peaks were observed before treatment indicating the presence of the vbnc state bacterial cells upon the photothermocatalytic treatment by te trp for 60 min c d peaks almost disappeared suggesting that nearly all bacterial cells including but not limited to vbnc state ones were completely killed scheme 1 4 conclusions in this work ultrafine te nanowires were successfully loaded on porous trp by a hydrothermal method to form the te trp composites which achieved superior photothermocatalytic inactivation of bacteria under sunlight on one hand te trp composites exhibited increased hydrophilicity due to the loading of highly hydrophilic te nanowires favoring the liquid phase reactions on the other hand te nanowires and trp exhibited a synergetic effect between photocatalytic and photothermal conversion leading to the outstanding photothermocatalytic activity towards bacterial inactivation such as e coli k 12 spingopyxis sp bm1 1 and s aureus te trp also performed well in a flow through water disinfection system suggesting the great potential of using te trp in the practical water treatment devices the mechanistic study showed that ros such as 1o2 and o2 were the most important contributors in bacterial inactivation the damage to bacterial cells was studied by monitoring the cell membrane destruction examining the enzyme activity and semi quantifying the vbnc state cells this study provides a green

the in depth mechanistic study revealed the synergetic effect between photocatalysis and photothermal conversion and identified the bacterial inactivation pathway 1o2 and o2 were verified to be the dominant reactive oxygen species involved in the bacterial inactivation the damage to bacterial cells caused by photothermocatalytic reactions was systematically investigated demonstrating the cell membrane destruction the loss of enzyme activity the increased cell membrane permeability and the complete inactivation of bacteria without the viable but nonculturable state cells this work not only affords a facile approach to preparing biomaterial based catalysts capable of efficient photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation but also proposes a prototype of pou water treatment opening up an avenue for sustainable environmental remediation graphical abstract this study developed a biomass based system for affordable and effective photothermocatalytic water disinfection and revealed the underlying mechanisms image graphical abstract keywords solar disinfection nature inspired material photothermal photocatalytic bactericidal mechanism 1 introduction although huge efforts have been made in the last few decades to disinfect water the lack of access to safe drinking water is still one of the greatest challenges worldwide especially in low and lower middle income countries the population who has no access to safe water and sanitation services is as large as 4 5 billion ferreira et al 2021 along with annual deaths of over half a million caused by the consumption of contaminated water loeb et al 2018 pichel et al 2019 driven by the urgent social needs for safe drinking water the united nations proposed a goal of ensure access to water and sanitation for all to be accomplished by 2030 ryberg et al 2021 therefore affordable low cost and effective water disinfection systems are urgently needed to achieve universal access to safe drinking water wang et al 2019b in comparison with centralized water treatment point of use pou water treatment demonstrates the advantages of low initial investment cost and easy operation matching well with the needs from rural communities ryberg et al 2018 2021 solar disinfection sodis is one of the most intensively used pou water disinfection methods taking advantage of the short wavelength uv and the thermal effect of sunlight to inactivate hazardous microorganisms however sodis suffers from the insufficient disinfection efficiency e g less than 0 5 log inactivation of e coli k 12 within 1 h and the requirement for long time exposure e g 1 to 2 days to sunlight cowie et al 2020 loeb et al 2018 ozores diez et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b the use of additives such as photothermal catalysts is an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of sodis thanks to the synergetic effect between photocatalysis and photothermal conversion photothermocatalytic materials potentially outperform their semiconductor and photothermal catalyst counterparts rommozzi et al 2020 our recent work reported an ag mno2 catalyst capable of achieving significantly enhanced inactivation of e coli k 12 upon sunlight irradiation thanks to the synergetic effect between the substantially increased temperature of the bulk water from 25 to 60 c and the generation of reactive oxygen species ros xia et al 2019 however the metal based catalysts have certain drawbacks such as high cost photo corrosion and metal leaching which limit their large scale practical applications chang et al 2016 taniguchi et al 2020 wang et al 2020b these issues drive researchers to explore low cost and metal free materials capable of efficient photothermocatalytic pou water disinfection ding et al 2020 li et al 2019 xia et al 2015 zhang et al 2020a learning from nature offers a promising approach for the development of cost effective and metal free biomaterials for water treatment plenty of biological sources in nature are qualified as environmental functional materials with minor modifications some of us have found that the treated rape pollen trp was a promising biomass derived photocatalyst exhibiting a high density of active sites and wide spectrum response jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a it could inactivate 7 log10 cfu ml of e coli k 12 within 4 h under visible light given the good photocatalytic activity trp would be qualified as a photocatalyst candidate to be coupled with an effective photothermal material thus realizing the synergetic photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation noble metals e g au ag and pt etc with localized surface plasmon resonance lspr effect have been intensively used as photothermal materials fan et al 2016 seh et al 2012 wang et al 2018a xia et al 2018b zhang et al 2019 zhou et al 2016 2017 zielinski et al 2016 these noble metals can generate hot charge carriers and dissipate their energy by local heating of the surroundings kale et al 2013 mateo et al 2021 favorable for the photocatalytic and photothermal reactions however considering the low investment cost of pou water treatment at a rural household level noble metals are cost prohibitive this motivates researchers to search non noble metals as alternative photothermal catalysts recently the semi metallic tellurium te has been demonstrated to exhibit broadband solar energy harvesting and efficient photothermal conversion yu et al 2018 te nanoparticles show broad optical absorption up to 3500 nm making te nanoparticles rapidly increase from 29 to 85 c within 100 s irradiated by a halogen tungsten lamp with the spectrum similar to sunlight ma et al 2018 in addition the small bandgap 0 35 ev of te may facilitate the separation of charge carriers of a te loaded semiconductor and thus contribute to the photocatalytic performance lee et al 2013 the unique three dimensional porous structure of trp provides large accessible surface areas for loading te nanomaterials therefore we hypothesize that the combination of te with trp would lead to the desirable properties for water disinfection in this work the te nanowires loaded trp te trp was for the first time developed and applied to sodis the rapid 100 bacterial inactivation of 7 13 log e coli k 12 was achieved by te trp under simulated sunlight within 60 min mechanistic study showed that te trp exhibited altered wettability synergetic photocatalytic and photothermal effect and improved photocatalytic properties leading to the efficient sodis performance to realize a real world pou water treatment the flow through sodis system was established and the performance of te trp catalyst was examined the mechanisms of the significantly increased activity of te trp was systematically investigated followed by the study of bactericidal pathway in the photothermocatalytic treatment to guide future design of advanced catalysts 2 experimental 2 1 materials all chemicals used in this work are analytical grade and used without further

60 c for 48 h the brown trp powder was obtained fig s1 2 2 2 fabrication of te trp the ultrafine te nanowires loaded trp was fabricated by a hydrothermal method he et al 2016 liang et al 2013 typically 0 05 g of the as prepared trp 0 08 g of sodium tellurite na2teo3 and 0 5 g of polyvinylpyrrolidone pvp were dispersed in 50 ml of deionized water under violent stirring with the assistance of ultrasound then 3 5 ml of nh3 h2o and 1 5 ml of n2h4 h2o were added as reducing agents and stirred for another 1 h after that the mixture was transferred into a 100 ml autoclave and heated in an oven at 200 c for 10 h after cooling to room temperature the resultant product was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm min for 10 min and washed with deionized water until the solution ph turned neutral after vacuum drying at 60 c for 24 h the te trp composite with the te to trp mass ratio of being 1 1 was obtained in addition the te trp composites with the te trp mass ratio of 1 2 2 1 and 4 1 were prepared by varying the dosage of na2teo3 being 0 08 0 32 and 0 64 g respectively unless otherwise specified the te trp mass ratio in te trp is 1 1 2 3 material characterizations the x ray diffraction xrd patterns of samples were recorded on a rigaku d max 2200 diffractometer with monochromatic cu kα radiation at a scanning speed of 8 s from 10 0 to 80 0 the morphology of samples was investigated by a quanta 400f thermal field emission scanning electron microscopy sem shimazhu japan fourier transform infrared ftir spectra were recorded using a nicolet is10 ftir spectrometer thermofisher scientific u s a with 0 2 cm 1 resolution uv vis nir diffuse reflectance spectra drs were measured by a lambda 950 uv vis nir spectrophotometer perkinelmer u s a photoelectrochemical experiments were carried out in 1 0m na2so4 solution with a chi 660d electrochemical workstation using a three electrode system in which a platinum electrode was used as the counter electrode and a saturated calomel electrode sce was used as the reference electrode photothermal conversion performance of te trp in water 0 5 mg ml was investigated by an infrared thermal imager flir c3 under simulated sunlight irradiation the solid state infrared thermographic images of the powdered samples were recorded by an infrared thermal imager fotric 226s u s a the wettability of samples was investigated by a contact angle tester kruss dsa25 germany the submerged thermocouple microprobe was used to monitor the solution temperature under irradiation 2 4 photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation e coli k 12 was chosen as the model bacterium to evaluate the bacterial inactivation bacterial cells were cultured in 25 ml of nutrient broth nb at 37 c for 16 h under shaking then 10 ml of the e coli k 12 suspension was collected centrifugated at 5000 rpm for 5 min and washed with sterilized water twice subsequently 2 5 mg of catalyst was added into 5 ml of deionized water containing 107 cfu ml of e coli k 12 and irradiated by the simulated sunlight light intensity 200 mw cm2 spectrum is shown in fig s2 provided by a xenon lamp pls sxe300d beijing perfectlight china at given time intervals samples were collected and spread on agar plates for incubation the viable cells were counted after incubation at 37 c for 24 h to investigate the effectivity of te trp to inactivate other types of bacteria spingopyxis sp bm1 1 and staphylococcus s aureus were also used to evaluate the reusability and stability the photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation was repeated 5 times using the recycled te trp before each run the suspended te trp would float to the water surface which can be easily recovered by skimming followed by a thorough wash with ethanol and deionized water to remove the adhered bacterial residues and other substances before being dried at 60 c overnight to move toward practical pou operations a continuous flow through disinfection system was built to examine the disinfection performance of te trp in flowing water under natural sunlight irradiation 35 mw cm2 as shown in fig 4a c this system consisted of a circulating pump a bench scale reactor and a triangle bottle with a magnetic stirrer upon bacterial inactivation the water flow was cycled through the flow through disinfection system the concentration of te trp catalyst was 0 2 mg ml the initial e coli k 12 concentration was 3 7 log10 cfu ml close to that in natural water the suspended te trp catalyst in water was recovered by a floating method as shown in fig 5g i to estimate the catalyst recovery rate using this method the te trp residues in the purified water from outlet were collected by filtration for weight measurement 2 5 ros analysis ros were detected and analyzed by an electron spin resonance esr spectrometer bruker a300 spin traps can capture ros and produce spin adducts 2 4 6 trimethylpyridine temp aqueous solution 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo in dimethyl sulfoxide dmso solution and 5 5 dimethyl 1 pyrroline n oxide dmpo aqueous solution were used to trap 1o2 o2 and oh respectively to identify the ros generated via photothermocatalytic photocatalytic and photothermal reactions respectively the esr spectra for each ros were recorded under various conditions 1 irradiated by simulated sunlight without temperature adjustment 2 irradiated by simulated sunlight with temperature adjustment fixed at 25 c to allow photocatalysis alone and 3 without irradiation but with temperature adjustment fixed at 55 c to simulate the photothermal process in addition to esr a scavenger study was carried out to evaluate the roles of reactive species in the bacterial inactivation process 2 mm of sodium azide nan3 tempol and isopropyl alcohol ipa were used to quench 1o2 o2 and oh respectively 2 6 biomolecule oxidation assay and enzyme activity cell viability assay sem imaging qualification of superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat enzymes analysis of bacterial membrane permeability and determination of single cell activity were shown in supplementary text s2 3 results and discussion 3 1 material characterizations xrd was used to analyze the crystal structure and phase composition of te nanowires trp and te trp as shown in fig 1 a pure te nanowires displayed sharp and strong diffraction peaks at 2θ 23 04 27 56 38 26 40 45 43 33 45 9 47 05 49 63 51 24 51 94 56 88 and 62 81 which were well indexed to the t te phase jcpds no 36 1452 the xrd patterns of bare trp only exhibited a wide diffraction peak at around 20 revealing the amorphous structure jiang et al 2018 wang et al 2019a the te trp composites showed the same diffraction peak positions as te but the intensity of some diffraction peaks varied which was attributed to the changed surface exposure of te nanowires after loading on trp the ftir spectra fig 1b showed that trp was mainly composed of c o ch3 and ch ch bonds peaks appeared at 1720 cm 1 and 1230 cm 1 indicated the presence of c o bond in trp the peak at 2930 cm 1 was assigned to the stretching of c h wang et al 2019a the ftir spectrum of te trp mainly followed suit indicating the preserved tpr structure upon te loading the uv vis nir drs spectra were performed to investigate the optical property of trp and te trp as shown in fig 1c te trp exhibited strong and broad absorption in uv visible and even infrared ir regions while trp showed strong uv but insufficient visible light absorption indicating the significantly extended spectral response and improved light harvesting capacity of te trp sem images were recorded to examine the morphologies of trp before and after te loading as shown in fig 2 a te nanowires exhibited a uniform ultrafine nanowire structure fig 2b showed the unique three dimensional porous hollow structure of trp with an average particle diameter of 1 to 2 µm this structure would not only provide abundant surface sites for the growth of te nanowires but also favor the contact with bacterial cells sem images of te trp clearly showed the well loaded te nanowires on either the inner or outer surface of trp regarding the te nanowires on the tpr outer surface they primarily concentrated on the pollen framework with a small portion across the pores the unique distribution of te nanowires would affect the near field optical intensity of te trp upon irradiation which will be discussed in section 3 3 it has been acknowledged that trp was not suitable for liquid phase operations due to its high hydrophobicity xiao et al 2019 the loading of te nanowires a hydrophilic material on trp is expected to change the wettability and enable te trp for effective water disinfection we then measured the water contact angle wca to evaluate the wettability of our samples as shown in fig 2e the wca of bare te nanowires was 24 6 revealing the strong hydrophilicity while the wca of bare trp was 110 fig 2g which demonstrated that trp had strong hydrophobicity unfavorable for water disinfection operations as expected the wca of the te trp composites was reduced to 45 2 fig 2f revealing that the loading of te nanowires could improve the hydrophilicity of trp thereby favoring the dispersion of the composites in water and facilitating the contact between te trp and bacterial cells 3 2 solar driven photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation performance bench scale experiments to evaluate the photothermocatalytic performance we started by investigating the bacterial inactivation of e coli k 12 one of the most commonly detected bacteria in contaminated water using the benchmark bacterial cell density 1 107 cfu ml wang et al 2019a as shown in fig 3 a the te trp composite completely inactivated 7 13 log e coli k 12 within 1 h significantly outperforming its counterparts bare trp and te nanowires which achieved only 3 52 and 3 89 log inactivation of e coli k 12 respectively the outstanding photothermocatalytic activity of te trp was primarily attributed to the synergetic effect between trp and te which will be discussed in section 3 3 the negligible biotoxicity of te trp was verified by the tiny decrease in cell population in the presence of te trp in dark sunlight alone without catalyst only inactivated 0 57 log e coli k 12 cells indicating that sunlight had almost no photolysis to bacterial cells to identify whether the te trp catalyst is uv or visible nir favored in the sodis process the photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation was also carried out under visible nir irradiation using the uv cut off simulated sunlight as shown in fig s3 the visible nir light driven antibacterial efficiency was slightly lower than that irradiated by full sunlight with 5 36 log e coli k 12 cells inactivated within 1 h therefore te trp was determined to be visible nir favored in the sodis operation optimization of te to trp mass ratio and catalyst concentration to achieve the highest photothermocatalytic efficiency parameters such as te to trp mass ratio and catalyst concentration were optimized first the performance of the te trp composites with various te trp mass ratios was evaluated as shown in fig 3b the te trp composite with te trp mass ratio of 1 1 showed the most efficient bacterial inactivation while the lower bactericidal efficiency was observed by either increasing or decreasing the te content te trp 2 1 te trp 4 1 and te trp 1 2 achieved 5 84 4 77 and 4 65 log10 cfu ml of bacterial inactivation within 1 h respectively given the fact that the photothermal effect of te trp is primarily due to the presence of te nanowires will be shown later on the one hand the insufficient te loading would lead to the lower photothermal conversion efficiency which is unfavorable for bacterial inactivation on the other hand the excessive loading of te nanowires on trp would cause a heavy coverage of the photoactive sites on trp surface and thus suppress the photocatalytic reactions subsequently the concentration of te trp catalyst was optimized using the best performing te trp composite te trp mass ratio 1 1 as shown in fig 3c the bactericidal efficiency decreased when further increasing the te trp concentration from 0 5 to 1 0 mg ml or above the results were ascribed to the reduced light penetration and insufficient light harvesting owing to the excessive dosage of te trp decreasing the catalyst concentration from 0 5 to 0 25 mg ml also led to a lower bactericidal efficiency which was due to the ineffective photothermal conversion and the limited number of photoactive sites photothermocatalytic inactivation of other bacteria considering the presence of bacteria other than e coli in water matrixes the photothermocatalytic inactivation of other bacteria i e gram negative spingopyxis sp bm1 1 and gram positive s aureus bacteria were studied spingopyxis sp bm1 1 is highly resistant to chlorine and would survive in sewage after chlorination treatment impressively te trp completely inactivated 7 1 log spingopyxis sp bm1 1 cells within 40 min under simulated sunlight representing an efficiency even higher than that towards e coli k 12 in comparison with spingopyxis sp bm1 1 it took longer 90 min to inactivate s aureus 6 7 log under the same condition but the efficiency was still satisfactory it could be deduced that te trp would be more applicable for the inactivation of gram negative bacteria the above results emphasized the great potential of te trp in inactivating a wide range of bacteria especially gram negative organisms stability and reusability of te trp the stability and reusability of catalysts are important for their practical applications as such we evaluated the stability and reusability of our catalyst by repeating the photothermocatalytic experiments 5 times and examining the morphology of te trp by sem after multiple reuses as shown in fig 4 a the bactericidal efficiency slightly decreased after each cycle which was mainly due to the mass loss of te trp and the accumulation of bacterial residues on te trp but te trp still realized 6 log e coli k 12 inactivation in the 5th run corresponding to as high as 99 inactivation efficiency the sem images of te trp before and after 5 cycle runs showed negligible changes fig 4b and c therefore the structure of te trp remained intact after multiple runs these results demonstrated the high stability and reusability of te trp flow through water disinfection to evaluate the potential of our catalysts for more practical pou operations a pilot scale circulating flow through disinfection system was constructed and used for sodis the diagram and photographs of the flow through reactor are presented in fig 5 a c as shown in fig 5d after being irradiated by natural sunlight for 60 min e coli k 12 bacteria in the flow through disinfection system were completely inactivated by te trp whereas sunlight alone and bare trp achieved 0 18 and 0 58 log bacterial inactivation under the same conditions respectively indicating the significantly enhanced disinfection by te trp in addition the spread plate assay fig 5e and f showed that the bacteria after 60 min treatment were non culturable demonstrating the complete bacterial inactivation by te trp the affordable recovery of catalysts for reuse is important in a real world water treatment as shown in fig 5g i thanks to the low material density of te trp as high as 99 67 of te trp was recovered via a floating method in 30 min without additional energy supply the preliminary cost of this flow through water disinfection system was estimated to be ca 0 001 l text s3 which is similar to or even lower than that of other pou water disinfection methods such as edible dye enhanced sodis 0 001 0 002 l ryberg et al 2018 and water boiling 0 001 0 007 l clasen et al 2008a 2008b thus te trp showed great potential for cost effective bacterial inactivation in practical water treatment operations 3 3 mechanistic investigations bulk water heating to explore the photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation mechanisms we started by evaluating the photothermal conversion performance by monitoring the bulk water heating the thermo images fig 6 a showed that the temperature of te trp suspension increased from ca 27 c to 55 60 c within 30 min under sunlight irradiation enabling the photothermal effect and promoting the photocatalytic reactions by contrast the thermo images of pure water fig 6b showed a negligible temperature increase within 30 min under the same condition the solid state infrared thermographic images fig 6c demonstrated that the local temperature of te trp powder 99 3 c was higher than that of te 86 5 c and trp 61 9 c powders the localized high temperature of catalysts would heat the surrounding environment and attack bacterial cells the in situ temperature measurement fig 6d showed that the temperature of te trp suspension rapidly increased from 27 to 57 c within 20 min and stayed at this value afterward for pure water and trp suspension their temperature increased to 38 5 c and 42 3 c after 10 min and remained unchanged with prolonged irradiation these results revealed that te trp exhibited an efficient photothermal conversion of sunlight and rapidly heated the bulk water to a relatively high temperature capable of facilitating bacterial inactivation ni et al 2015 simulation of the near field electric optical intensity to better understand the photothermal mechanisms the simulation of electric optical intensity near trp and te trp particles upon irradiation was carried out text s1 the catalyst models were constructed based on the sem results fig 2b and d where the quantity ratio of te nanowires located on trp framework te nanowires located on trp pores and trp pores was estimated to be 13 1 1 as shown in fig 7 and supplementary fig s4 when the plane wave reached the surface of trp and te trp the distribution of electric field exhibited a heterogeneity with periodic oscillation due to the scattering effect of samples for bare trp figs 7a and s4b high optical intensity was observed in pores and partial regions of the inside hollow space intensity higher than the plane wave therefore the porous and hollow structures of trp would favor light harvesting and the subsequent photothermal conversion regarding the te trp composite with all te nanowires on the framework figs 7b and s4c the optical intensity upon light irradiation almost remained unchanged compared with that of bare trp indicating that such te distribution played a negligible role in alerting the optical properties of te trp by contrast te nanowires on the tpr pores could significantly improve the optical intensity fig 7c with the average enhancement locally reaching up to approximately 5 times of incident light intensity compared to the values observed in fig 7b the results revealed that the enhanced near field optical intensity of te trp was primarily ascribed to the presence of te nanowires located on the trp pores it should be noted that although te nanowires on trp framework showed an insignificant effect on the optical intensity their contributions to photothermocatalytic treatment cannot be underestimated due to their lspr effect and important roles in facilitating charger transfer and reducing the recombination of electron hole pairs as we will show later ros analysis to verify the generated ros from te trp via photocatalytic photothermal and photothermocatalytic processes esr measurement was carried out under different conditions as shown in fig 8 a the peak of dmpo o2 complexes with a quadruple characteristic peak peak intensity 1 1 1 1 were observed in the photothermocatalytic system wang et al 2021b whereas such peaks were absent in photocatalytic and photothermal systems indicating that the generation of o2 required the synergy of photocatalysis and photothermal conversion the peak intensity of dmpo o2 at 2 min was close to that at 5 min fig 8b thus the concentration of the steady state o2 was stable after 2 min as displayed in fig 8c temp 1o2 signals with triple characteristic peaks peak intensity 1 1 1 appeared in all systems whereas the signals in photothermocatalytic system were stronger than those in the other two systems suggesting the generation of more 1o2 by photothermocatalytic behaviors the presence of dmpo oh peaks peak intensity 1 2 2 1 in photothermocatalytic and photocatalytic systems and the absence of dmpo oh peaks in photothermal system were observed fig 8e indicating that the photothermal process could hardly produce oh radicals given the slightly higher intensities of dmpo oh peaks in photothermocatalytic system than that in photocatalytic systems oh radicals should be mainly produced via photocatalysis to obtain an in depth understanding of the roles of o2 1o2 and oh in bacterial inactivation scavenging studies were carried out using the specific scavengers to quench the individual ros and verify its contribution to bacterial inactivation as shown in fig 8g the significant decrease in bacterial inactivation efficiencies after adding tempol and nan3 unveiled the crucial roles of o2 and 1o2 the moderate decrease of cell density from 7 14 to 3 69 log10 cfu ml indicated that oh radicals were involved in bacterial inactivation but they were not the major contributor synergetic effect between photothermal conversion and photocatalysis although the high photothermal activity of te trp was confirmed the individual contribution of photothermal effect to photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation and the synergy between photocatalytic and photothermal inactivation are unclear therefore a water bath was used in bacterial inactivation experiments to control the environment temperature and to differentiate the roles of photocatalysis and photothermal effect experiments were first carried out at a fixed room temperature under sunlight irradiation to eliminate the photothermal conversion as displayed in fig 8h only 3 29 log e coli k 12 cells were inactivated within 1 h in addition the bacterial inactivation experiment was performed at 55 c in dark to simulate the photothermal conversion alone such temperature was the same as the photothermocatalytic system using te trp upon sunlight irradiation fig 6d in this case 3 58 log e coli k 12 was inactivated similar as that in photocatalysis therefore photothermal effect and photocatalysis almost contributed equally to bacterial inactivation in the photothermocatalytic process given the efficient 7 13 log bacterial inactivation by photothermocatalytic treatment we argue that the photothermal effect and photocatalysis show a synergetic effect that enables the more efficient bacterial inactivation band structure characterization and photoelectrochemical properties to further investigate the mechanism of the enhanced photothermocatalytic activity of te trp the band structures and photoelectrochemical properties of trp and te trp were analyzed the positive slopes of mott schottky plots fig 9 a revealed the n type semiconductor feature of trp and te trp therefore the conduction band minimum cbm position was close to the flat potential which was 0 39 v and 0 45 v vs saturated calomel electrode sce for trp and te trp respectively determined by the intercept of x axis the equation e nhe e sce 0 24 v was applied to convert sce to normal hydrogen electrode nhe xu et al 2018 as a result the cbm positions were 0 63 v and 0 69 v vs nhe for trp and te trp respectively the bandgap of trp and te trp was calculated to be 1 85 ev and 1 01 ev respectively as shown in the tauc plots fig 9b the narrowed bandgap of te trp could lead to easier photo excitation and better light harvesting according to kubelka munk function wang et al 2018c the valence band maximum vbm positions of trp and te trp were estimated to be 1 22 and 0 32 ev respectively the band structure characterization allows us to further investigate the generation of ros by te trp theoretically the photogenerated e at the conduction band of te trp is negative enough to convert o2 h2o into 1o2 0 11 v xia et al 2018a as shown in eq 2 which was validated by the critical role of 1o2 in bacterial inactivation fig 8g as shown in eq 3 the photogenerated e by te trp was able to reduce the dissolved oxygen to o2 0 33 ev wang et al 2020a xia et al 2016 the generated o2 could further transfer into 1o2 and h2o2 eq 4 the photogenerated h from vb of te trp 0 32 v is not positive enough to convert o2 h2o into oh 2 8 v xia et al 2015 causing the insignificant bactericidal role of oh the generation of oh as confirmed in the earlier esr result should be achieved via a multi step pathway as shown in eqs 3 5 electrons generated by trp would enrich on te nanowires and thus inhibited the recombination of electrons and holes so that the adsorbed o2 h2o could capture electrons more efficiently to form ros furthermore the heat generated by the photothermal conversion could attack cell membrane and facilitate the damage from ros to bacterial cells based on the above discussion the process of photothermocatalytic e coli k 12 inactivation over te trp was shown in eqs 1 6 1 te trp sunlight h e 2 o2 h 1o2 3 e o2 o2 4 o2 h2o h2o2 oh 5 h2o2 hν 2 oh 6 oh o2 1o2 heat e coli cell debris to evaluate the recombination of electron hole pairs and the charge transfer behaviors photoelectrochemical measurements were conducted the smaller arc radius of electrochemical impedance spectra eis plots of te trp than pristine trp indicated the lower charge transfer resistance fig 9c wang et al 2018c in addition the higher photocurrent density of te trp than trp revealed the more abundant charge carriers and the more efficient charge transfer in te trp fig 9d benefiting the photocatalytic reactions 3 4 damage to bacterial cells destruction of bacterial cells to look into the destruction process of bacterial cells upon photothermaocatalytic treatment we first identified the cell activity with a fluorescence microscope where cells were stained by live dead baclight bacterial viability kit as shown in fig 10 a c almost all e coli k 12 exhibited green fluorescence revealing that the cell membrane of e coli k 12 was intact before treatment after being irradiated by sunlight for 10 min a small number of e coli k 12 cells showed red fluorescence indicating the partial inactivation of bacteria when the reaction time was extended to 60 min all the bacteria displayed red fluorescence demonstrating the complete inactivation of e coli k 12 the sem images of e coli k 12 cells were recorded to monitor the damage of cell membrane as shown in fig 10d f e coli k 12 cells showed a typical rod shape with intact cell membrane structure before treatment meanwhile a large number of e coli k 12 cells were adsorbed on the surface of te trp this would be favorable for photothermocatalytic bacterial inactivation because many photocatalytic and thermal reactions necessitate the short range contact between catalysts and targets with the treatment for 10 min the cell membranes of e coli k 12 shrunk and became unsmooth indicating the heavy attacks on cell membranes wang et al 2018b finally the cell membrane was seriously broken when the treatment was prolonged to 60 min resulting in the disability of energy dependent reactions as well as the oxidation and or leakage of the cytoplasmic substances enzyme activity the bacterial cell membrane was responsible for the production of enzymes to resist external attacks therefore the activity of anti oxidative enzymes was detected by measuring the generation of superoxide dismutase sod and catalase cat by cells sod can react with o2 to form o2 and h2o2 and cat can trigger h2o2 to form o2 and h2o thus reducing the attack of these ros xiao et al 2019 as shown in fig 10g in the first 30 min the contents of these two enzymes increased gradually at the beginning of the photothermocatalytic treatment the stress antioxidant system of the cell membrane produced sufficient sod and cat to fight against ros after 30 min the cell membrane of e coli was seriously damaged and lost the ability to produce antioxidant enzymes owing to the persistent attacks of ros as suggested by the decreased concentration of sod and cat cell membrane permeability the inner membrane cytoplasmic membrane permeability of bacteria was investigated by onpg a higher value of od420 indicates the increased bacterial inner membrane permeability as shown in fig 10h in the photothermal system od420 increased from 0 011 to 0 046 within 60 min indicating that the photothermal effect of te trp would slightly increase the membrane permeability regarding the photocatalytic system od420 reached to 0 084 at 60 min suggesting that photocatalysis contributed more to altering the membrane permeability than the photothermal effect compared with the individual photocatalytic and photothermal system od420 values in the photothermocatalytic system were significantly higher indicating that photocatalysis and photothermal conversion had a synergistic effect on attacking the cell inner membrane vbnc analysis under certain environmental conditions bacteria would present a viable but non culturable vbnc state although cells in the vbnc state cannot form colonies they remain alive and can recover the culturability in appropriate conditions zhang et al 2015 therefore the d2o labeled confocal raman micro spectroscopy was utilized to verify if vbnc bacteria are completely inactivated vbnc cells can absorb d2o and form c d bonds showing a broad peak at 2040 2300 cm 1 in the raman spectrum while c d peaks are absent or appear at very low levels in the raman spectrum of dead cells wang et al 2021a as shown in fig 10i strong c d peaks were observed before treatment indicating the presence of the vbnc state bacterial cells upon the photothermocatalytic treatment by te trp for 60 min c d peaks almost disappeared suggesting that nearly all bacterial cells including but not limited to vbnc state ones were completely killed scheme 1 4 conclusions in this work ultrafine te nanowires were successfully loaded on porous trp by a hydrothermal method to form the te trp composites which achieved superior photothermocatalytic inactivation of bacteria under sunlight on one hand te trp composites exhibited increased hydrophilicity due to the loading of highly hydrophilic te nanowires favoring the liquid phase reactions on the other hand te nanowires and trp exhibited a synergetic effect between photocatalytic and photothermal conversion leading to the outstanding photothermocatalytic activity towards bacterial inactivation such as e coli k 12 spingopyxis sp bm1 1 and s aureus te trp also performed well in a flow through water disinfection system suggesting the great potential of using te trp in the practical water treatment devices the mechanistic study showed that ros such as 1o2 and o2 were the most important contributors in bacterial inactivation the damage to bacterial cells was studied by monitoring the cell membrane destruction examining the enzyme activity and semi quantifying the vbnc state cells this study provides a green
