23735,this paper introduces a framework for analyzing distributed ship systems the increase in interconnected and interdependent systems aboard modern naval vessels has significantly increased their complexity making them more vulnerable to cascading failures and emergent behavior that arise only once the system is complete and in operation there is a need for a systematic approach to describe and analyze distributed systems at the conceptual stage for naval vessels understanding the relationships between various aspects of these distributed systems is crucial for uninterrupted naval operations and vessel survivability the framework introduced in this paper decomposes information about an individual system into three views the physical logical and operational architectural representations these representations describe the spatial and functional relationships of the system together with their temporal behavior characteristics this paper defines how these primary architectural representations are used to describe a system the interrelations between the architectural blocks and how those blocks fit together a list of defined terms is presented and a preliminary set of requirements for specific design tools to model these architectures is discussed a practical application is introduced to illustrate how the framework can be used to describe the delivery of power to a high energy weapon keywords early stage design distributed systems complex systems design taxonomy 1 introduction the increasing importance and complexity of interdependent distributed systems people and components incorporated into naval ships makes it necessary to describe them as architectures of complex systems in this paper the authors present and demonstrate a framework to describe the architectures of distributed naval ship systems that enables engineers to better address system design in early stage naval ship design the framework is intended to provide a conceptual method of capturing the key attributes of a distributed ship system thus the objective is to describe such a system ensuring all important aspects are covered as opposed to presenting a design process for the system a distributed ship system representation needs to be multifaceted it is the interrelationships between the different representations or architectures that allows a full understanding of the system the presented framework is applicable to one given system and is designed to cover the aspects that are important when analyzing and describing that system three primary facets of a system are considered the physical logical and operational architectures the architecture of a system is defined as the manner in which its components are organized and integrated the physical architecture represents the spatial and physical characteristics of the system and of its environment the logical architecture describes functional characteristics of the system and the linkages between each component of the system the operational architecture describes temporal behavior of a system including human system interactions to some extent the architectural framework presented in this article thus provides a basis for describing and understanding the impact of the architectural properties of systems aboard a vessel on the vessel s performance the effort to develop this framework was motivated by a need to better understand the impact of distributed systems on ship design especially with regard to survivability the past half century has brought with it a radical change in the design and control of high risk systems technological change has brought with it highly complex automated capable but opaque systems reason 1990 this growth in system complexity and interdependence has made systems significantly more difficult to understand and design in part due to increased potential for emergent properties that only arise once the system is complete and in operation this increased the opportunity for latent errors i e design errors which can remain dormant for a long time before the right combination of factors align to make the error emerge and potentially catastrophic consequences on the ship s operability slabodkin 1998 uk house of commons defence committee 2016 the opacity of the systems interrelations has led to an increased opportunity for cascading failures compromising the survivability of the vessel as noted above the framework aims to better understand the multidimensional relations between distributed systems which can decrease the design s opacity with the increasing number complication and resulting complexity of systems aboard vessels the authors argue this framework will bring a major step forward in early stage naval ship design and analysis addressing a significant gap in our ability to investigate the complex nature of future naval distributed system design at this crucial decision point section 2 outlines the problem and justifies the need for an architectural framework in the design of distributed systems aboard naval vessels while section 3 presents the framework itself with its three primary architectures and their interrelations section 4 discusses requirements for analysis tools and recommendations for the architectural framework implementation in section 5 an example application is given involving the powering of a vessel s high energy weapon the appendix defines the key nomenclature used in this framework 2 background the need for an architectural framework in the past several decades technological developments have brought major changes to the way ships are designed and operated automation has pushed the boundaries of performance and increased the use of complex distributed systems aboard vessels although costly to introduce automation has had an attractive payback to the maritime industry the increase in complex systems and automatic monitoring systems has led to increased operational efficiency increased crew morale and safety and reduced maintenance cost ehlers et al 2014 the advantages of all electric powering over mechanically powered ships are also well documented and have led many organizations to move towards all electric ships some major advantages of all electric powering were identified by doerry 2014 including increased power flexibility the ability to shift power between ship systems as needed increased power efficiency and increased arrangements flexibility since prime movers are no longer restricted to the central position of the aft bottom decks the introduction of complex distributed systems and electric propulsion technologies aboard naval vessels has nevertheless significantly increased their complexity rigterink 2014 and has left a gap in ship design methods and tools the increasingly complex organizational and physical architectures of naval systems with high interdependence between distribution systems humans and onboard components are changing the design drivers and the focus of the naval architect system integration is now as important as the traditional naval architecture disciplines since the arrangement of systems and usage of system interdependencies play a significant role in vessel cost dobson 2014 miroyannis 2006 capability and survivability doerry 2007 2006 trapp 2015 thus understanding the structure of the dependencies between various aspects of a distributed system and how they are best accommodated in the ship s physical architecture in the early stages of design is critical to the maturation of state of the art vessel design brown and waltham sajdak 2015 chalfant 2015 ouroua et al 2007 the changing design considerations of naval vessels that arise from the increased use of distributed systems have left designers with an inadequate set of tools for concept exploration doerry and fireman 2006 kassel et al 2010 analyzing the implications of early stage design decisions on the physical attributes of the vessel only covers a limited aspect of early stage design how components and discrete sub systems within compartments are geometrically related and how the resulting configuration affects the functionality and performance of the vessel with simpler less demanding vessels designers were able to use their implicit knowledge to determine performance and interaction issues that could occur between systems in a given general arrangement however with the increased impact of distributed systems and smaller margins driven by the desire to further optimize designs new methods are needed to help designers integrate vessel solutions these need to reflect the interdependent functionality of components within a vessel how the functionalities provided by the whole vessel and the component sub systems will be achieved and geometric relationships caused by an arrangement to the authors knowledge no cohesive framework exists for evaluating how the coupling of these interrelated design aspects culminates in determining the overall system performance common methodologies for concept design of interacting ship architectures range from low fidelity parameterization based modeling to high fidelity simulation of systems andrews 2012 brown and waltham sajdak 2015 chalfant 2015 chandrasegaran et al 2013 parametric methods perform well for evolutionary designs however their basis in previous data makes them ill suited for the design of revolutionary vessels chalfant 2015 low fidelity simulation is also used for concept exploration in distributed system design trapp 2015 uses optimization on a multi commodity flow network to explore a large state space and find a minimum cost of a vessel s integrated engineering plant with a given survivability constraint his algorithm seeks the minimum cost survivability and avoids predicating a single solution cramer et al 2009 use a genetic algorithm to solve minimax problems and applies it to the design of an integrated engineering plant with respect to survivability after the set of possible solutions is narrowed using low fidelity simulation high fidelity analysis of specific systems can be targeted for instance high fidelity analyses have been performed to analyze the tradeoff between ac and dc electrical distribution systems chalfant et al 2010 understand the impact of electrical weapons on power supply stability whitelegg et al 2015 but also to understand the relationship between propulsion and maneuvering systems altosole et al 2010 however high fidelity models often require a significant jump in design detail and can take up valuable time to model in early stage design especially at a point in time where the chosen design solution has yet to emerge the time issue can be addressed using tools that can easily produce and analyze distributed systems based on templates and product catalogues the electric ship research and development consortium esrdc has developed the smart ship systems design s3d tool to perform high fidelity design and analysis of distributed naval systems chalfant 2015 fiedel et al 2011 developed a cooling system design tool to analyze thermal loading and design appropriate cooling systems this is a task which will become harder and more critical as the number of electrical systems aboard ships increases the jump in design detail required for high fidelity models and templates still remains an issue as they both strongly rely on previous solutions and assumptions and on modeling detail which is based on decisions that can predicate the design influencing it at a point in time where the chosen design solution has yet to emerge this makes them ill suited for concept design or for the creation of revolutionary designs like naval all electric ships and radical ship configurations greig et al 2009 where one should not fix large portions of the design while still conducting requirements elucidation andrews 2013 2011 addressing the architecture of naval distributed systems in novel vessel design is becoming a major component of concept exploration and is beset by technology uncertainty and concurrent mission development developing vessel concepts from legacy designs tools and fixed solution options significantly limits the designer s ability to take advantage of emergent opportunities and properly cope with evolving design requirements in early stage design when decision freedom is highest andrews 2013 new methods are needed to guide the development of architectures of distributed systems from conception through early stage design and into more detailed effort without requiring leaps to high fidelity tools while the ship design is far from fixed 3 architectural framework for naval distributed systems the architectural framework of a system is defined as the manner in which its components are organized and integrated this is the focus of this paper to describe an architectural framework for naval distributed systems which accounts for the relationships concerning a specific distributed system and its relation within the ship s general arrangements in the context of naval survivability specifically the authors use the definition of the open group architecture framework togaf which defines and describes procedures for developing an architectural framework as an architectural framework is a foundational structure or set of structures which can be used for developing a broad range of different architectures it should describe a method for designing a target state of the enterprise in terms of a set of building blocks and for showing how the building blocks fit together it should contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary it should also include a list of recommended standards and compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks togaf 2011 in general a framework consists of the structure of a system its properties and behaviors and the relationships that exist within it architectural frameworks are often used to analyze and to describe the organization of systems like buildings computers or even human biology they are well suited for any system with a large number of connected interdependent components for many applications a well modeled architectural framework enables reuse of components to ease development and management for current and future programs or projects in this sense the following discussion aims to 1 describe the architectural blocks used in this framework 2 describe how these architectural blocks fit together 3 provide a brief discussion of requirements for relevant analysis tools and 4 establish the common vocabulary 3 1 primary architectures in the context of naval ships the authors define the architectural framework as a conceptual model that describes the physical architecture the logical architecture and the operational architecture of vessels together with the interrelationships between the three architectures the physical architecture describes the spatial arrangement the logical architecture describes information on the functional characteristics of the system and the operational architecture contains information on the temporal behavioral characteristics of the vessel in a given mission scenario these primary architectures are discussed in more detail below in section 3 2 we describe how these architectural blocks fit together the physical architecture is a spatial architecture and it has two important classes of information 1 the constraining architecture defined by the ship configuration and the relationships between spaces essentially what spaces actually exist on the ship and how they physically relate to one another and 2 the physical attributes of components of a given distributed system and their locations relative to each other in the vessel the physical architecture defines the organization of the overall layout of major spaces and thus the possible spatial configurations a given distributed system can take within these spaces it creates bounds on the possible layout configuration of distributed systems example physical architectures are given in fig 1 the radial configuration shown on the left exhibits a smaller footprint but has less potential for system routing redundancy than the ring configuration on the right the choice of style as discussed by andrews 2012 and pawling et al 2014 2013 is a major driver of any ship design option and hence has a significant influence on the physical architectures style could be the basis of producing a set of design options for the ship and a given distributed system within it style refers to a set of options resulting from choices in design e g the choice of a survivability zoning configuration that are usually cross cutting between various disciplines thus two vessels with the same requirements can have very different characteristics and performances for example a common set of performance requirements for a frigate was once provided to both the uk and the us navies though the performance requirements were similar the resultant uk and us designs were very different ferreiro and stonehouse 1991 these designs differed in size displacement number of decks shape of the superstructure etc in other words the physical architecture of the designs was different though the high level operational requirements were identical pawling et al 2014 the logical architecture describes functional characteristics of the system and the linkages between each component of the system logical architecture is a multidisciplinary term and in this paper its definition is similar to the one used in information technology specifically desfray 2008 states that logical architecture addresses the information system seen macroscopically by focusing on its main components their interactions and the flows exchanged and by structuring them by group into larger scale modules it is this essence of the term that the authors aim to apply to naval systems and arrangements in that case components could refer to a machine system component and an auxiliary power source while flows exchange could comprise power distribution between power sources and sinks another example of a logical architecture may be a single line diagram describing the way components are connected or should be connected to each other to provide a given service or function in the case of a ship s machinery system this may detail that a system component must be connected to a main auxiliary power source and to multiple emergency power sources fig 2 shows an example logical architecture of distributed systems represented as a multiplex network the components are the same in both networks the left one shows the relations in a cooling system and the right one shows the electrical power system in the electrical power system the radar is connected to the power source node and the backup power node thus the radar has power redundancy however the chiller is not connected to the backup power source node if the main power source fails the radar will eventually become inoperable from overheating and this relationship between power and cooling has not been captured by the individual systems the operational architecture defines the temporal behavior of system temporal behavior is intended to capture what needs to happen through time to accomplish a given mission scenario it defines what systems are needed in which order or what processes and input outputs are needed through time like personnel movement or the charging of a capacitor it characterizes the way systems and spaces are used over time for a given operational scenario and the required system demands over time their input and output needs since the operational architecture describes how a system is used over time it also describes to some extent the human interaction with the system more generally it relates to the us department of defense definition of operational architecture description of the tasks operational elements and information flows required to accomplish or support a warfighting function fry 2001 for example this may represent a load characterization based on operational use or a survivability strategy that lays out what processes must take place to mitigate a damage scenario in the damaged or recoverability stages an example of a visualization of operational architecture is presented in fig 3 it consists of the operational need the human activity and the machine system activity the operational need describes to what extent the system is required over time this can for example be the need for a weapon system to be deployed or the need to use the steering gear in order to sail towards a desired course the human activity results from the operational need it includes the decisions made by the crew in order to fulfill the operational need the machine system activity describes to what extent the actual hardware of the system is used over time in this example the human activity and the machine system activity start at zero however they can also start above zero if the situation is continuously monitored the operational need human activity and machine system activity mutually influence each other and together form the operational architecture 3 2 interrelations between primary architectures the following discussion aims to show how the three primary architectures fit together to produce additional layers of information depth not captured by the primary architectures individually there are four interrelations defined as the physical solution functional utilization physical behavior and system response the authors have produced two representations of the architectural framework fig 4 presents a qualitative representation showing how the three dimensions of the naval distributed systems problem can be decomposed and combined to understand different perspectives of the problem each overlap shows how information from the primary architectures can be combined to provide designers a deeper understanding of a potential design solution some of the authorship of the paper has questioned whether this model is actually sustainable the basis of these concerns is that the physical logical and operational architectures each provide a different type of information and thus from a set theoretic perspective the intersection between them is empty therefore an alternative graphical representation is presented at the end of this section fig 5 meanwhile the original representation is developed further below as it is considered to provide some useful insights the interrelation between the physical and logical architectures is defined as the physical solution which describes what the system components look like in physical space of the ship in the context of the chosen physical and logical architectures this can include the physical layout of the chilled water plant radar and piping showing how the components connect together the physical solution overlays the selected logical connections according to the spatial allocations shields et al 2017 the interrelation between the logical architecture and the operational architecture is the functional utilization it characterizes the connection between system components and resource flows required in time to fulfill a mission of interest it specifies which systems are used or can be used over time from a given logical arrangement to fulfill a specified mission if generator a breaks down generator b can be substituted to supply the required power to run a mission specific load a system s functional utilization can be thought of as the system s load balance for a specified mission the physical behavior is the interrelation between the physical architecture and the operational architecture it is a measure for defining the characteristics of a physical layout for a given mission of interest it could capture interferences that occur as a result of undertaking a specified operational scenario for example electromagnetic interferences that occur if an operational scenario requires very high electrical loads or the potential degradation of human performance when operating above a certain sea state the physical performance also captures more grounded relations between physical attributes and performance attributes for example the physical size of a power generator is related to its power so the maximum power requirements for a range of operational architectures will determine the appropriate physical architecture combining the architectures and their interrelations creates a system response this is a characterization of the performance or behavior of the system for a chosen physical layout a chosen set of relations between components and a chosen mission by taking several instances of a primary architecture i e one catamaran and one mono hull physical architecture and analyzing each with respect to instances of the other two primary architectures one gets a set of system responses or the envelope of influence between architectures the system response may be defined as the primary measure of performance or measure of effectiveness for the given system in the specified operational context and gives an overview of the distributed system for example after a hostile attack the physical architecture will help determine which spaces suffered physical damage the connectivity between systems determined by the logical architecture will identify which systems will lose their connection and thus their input the operational architecture determines how systems are used and needed together these architectures provide an overview of the system the physical solution might change due to damage or isolation the physical behavior identifies how a given physical configuration affects the system s capability after damage the functional utilization might change to allow adequate operations with the system in a damaged state together all three will determine the immediate damage cascading failures but also how systems can be reconfigured to mitigate damage propagation this characterizes an overall response of the system in a selected design we now present the second representation of the architectural framework this formal description of the framework takes into account the lack of set theoretic interactions between primary architectures and is illustrated in fig 5 despite that the definitions of each architecture are identical to those of the first representation presented in fig 4 the sets of physical architectures logical architectures and operational architectures are given by pa x 1 x 2 x 3 x i la y 1 y 2 y 3 y j oa z 1 z 2 z 3 z k here each x y z are different instances of a physical logical and operational architecture for example x 1 and x 2 could represent a mono hull and double hull configuration respectively let ps x i be the set of physical solutions possible under physical architecture x i and any logical architecture that is a given physical architecture can lead to a given set of physical solutions regardless of the logical architecture similarly ps y j is the set of physical solutions possible under a specific logical architecture y j and a set of possible physical architectures for example the attack logical architecture shown in fig 8 could be achieved in a mono hull as in fig 10 or it could be achieved in a trimaran these options are the physical solutions which belong to the set ps y j together the selected logical architecture y j and the selected physical architecture x i provide the possible bounds on the set of possible physical solutions which are given by ps ps x i ps y j the physical solution is bounded by a 2 tuple of a physical architecture and a logical architecture and thus cannot be defined if one of them does not exist similarly the set of physical behaviors possible under a given physical architecture xi and operational architecture z k is given by pb pb x i pb z k where pb x i is the set of physical behaviors which exist under physical architecture x i and pb z k is the set of physical behaviors that exist under operational architecture z k the set of functional utilizations possible under a selected logical architecture y j and a scenario specific operational architecture z k is given by fu fu y j fu z k for the response r let r α be the set of overall system responses possible for the given set of physical solutions ps r β be the set of overall system responses for the given set of physical behaviors pb and r γ be the set of overall system responses for the given set of functional utilizations fu for example the physical solution will dictate the robustness of a distribution system influencing the set of responses r α possible under the chosen physical solution the functional utilization or load balance will dictate the time dependent input and output the system needs and has the set of responses r γ will characterize the system with respect to its component connections for a given time dependent operational scenario the set of responses r β for a given physical behavior is related to the influence of the physical characteristics of a distributed system on a given operational scenario all three sets of responses are required to evaluate the solution that is to get a complete characterization of the system s response r responses possible under the given physical solution physical behavior and functional utilization must be considered this is written as r r α r β r γ 4 requirements for analysis tools as with any framework a set of design and analysis tools are necessary to properly analyze the various aspects of the system while the objective of this paper is to outline the framework itself it is nevertheless beneficial to include a brief consideration of the requirements for potential design tools while the complete development of these tools is an area of continuing research this section briefly discusses some of the tools currently being considered and explored no single design tool is capable of covering the entire framework instead a set of tools is recommended to handle each part of the framework systematically these tools must model hundreds or possibly thousands of diverse components fig 6 shows an example system that shows the scope of this challenge to understand the physical architecture design tools must be able to generate and analyze physical spaces when in the concept phase this should involve the ability to generate a vast number of various architectures to properly explore the design space andrews 2013 such tools that have been developed with this specific requirement in mind include the design building block approach pioneered by andrews 1998 and realized practically by munoz and forrest 2002 and andrews and pawling 2003 or the packing based approach developed by van oers 2011 and duchateau 2016 additionally network based tools are being developed to supplement these geometric layout based concept exploration tools network tools require lower fidelity information which allows ensemble analysis in the early stages of design with less information such tools avoid predicating the design since they require fewer assumptions two current network tools are being investigated the first is to analyze the vulnerability of physical architectures with respect to internal blast and the second is to analyze the relationship between a selected physical architecture and the vessel s design complexity shields et al 2016 understanding the logical architecture requires an understanding of the relationships and dependencies between the various elements of the system this requirement lends itself to tools like network theory based metrics network theory has been used extensively to study the survivability of interdependent systems like power grids and communication networks buldyrev et al 2010 lü et al 2016 sterbenz et al 2013 newman 2010 in ship design van oers et al 2012 gillespie and singer 2013 rigterink et al 2013 de vos 2014 collins et al 2015 parker and singer 2015 and shields et al 2016 have used networks extensively to study relationships and connections during various stages of the naval ship design process including some studies focused specifically on distributed systems chalfant et al 2017 are developing two logical architecture tools to study the operation and vulnerability of a total ship system a deactivation block diagram algorithm and an architecture flow optimization expanded from trapp 2015 additional network based tools are being developed to study the combined influence of the physical and logical architectures on cascading failures inherent in operational architecture are temporal variations and personnel requirements which have to be met by requisite tool current research on studying the temporal aspects of operational architectures has looked to extend previous work on markov processes as applied to ship design and operations kana 2016 niese 2012 markov processes provide a sound foundational structure that accounts for the stochastic uncertainty that may be present in temporal processes initial investigations into applying these tools to ship board survivability have looked into the use of both discrete and continuous time markov processes to capture the temporal interplay between multiple ship systems during a damage scenario as well as the impact of individual component reliability on overall system performance and availability from a personnel perspective a distinction can be made between the logistical and non logistical parts of operational processes the logistical part requires connectivity between spaces and lends itself to a capacitated flow network based approach while the non logistical part concerns a wider variety of information where a logical rules set approach can be pursued the combination of the logistical and non logistical processes can be used to evaluate the suitability of personnel requirements within the operational architecture developing tools to study the interactions of these architectures may involve combining various currently existing tools or the development of new ones 5 framework application example when designing a new distributed ship system clearly defining which aspects belong to each portion of the framework is important however it may be challenging it is through this development and identification that insight will be gained about the system in order to illustrate how the architectural framework can be applied to the analysis of a distributed system example the use of a high energy weapon on a naval ship is presented the related distributed system is limited to the weapon the power source the radar the chiller the combat information center the cables and pipes for this example the physical architecture consists of the constraining ship architecture and the locations of the appropriate components as shown in fig 7 a logical architecture describes the relationship between the system components in this case it is the single line diagram of a set of required power information and cooling systems associated with the weapon system it is a schematic overview of the required connections between generators weapon radar chiller and cables and the associated electrical elements as shown in fig 8 system components and their connections are organized by services that must exist for the attack system to function powering information and cooling the operational architecture is a way of representing how the system is employed over time it can be visualized using a graph of the operational need and the system activity both human systems and machine systems as a function of time for a specific mission scenario this graph can be dependent on the system of interest and external factors appropriate to a selected operational scenario for this case the associated graph is presented in fig 9 the weapon operating process consists of several phases in phase 1 an operational need for employing the weapon arises this could be a hostile attack the activity of the machine system which is the weapon in this case is still zero the human activity is slightly above zero since humans are always monitoring the situation prior to taking decisions in phase 2 the crew has observed the hostile attack the human activity increases because the crew has to decide how to react to the attack the crew decides to employ the weapon in phase 3 the machine system activity therefore increases the human activity decreases slightly because the machine system has partly taken over the action in phase 4 the hostile attack is effectively combatted the human activity increases again because the crew has to decide how next to act it is decided that the external threat is over phase 5 the operational need decreases to zero and the weapon is deactivated the human activity is reduced to the original level it is characteristic of an operational architecture that there will be a certain degree of time lag between operational need human activity and system activity furthermore the plot lines clearly illustrate the balance between the operational need and the system activity and how it develops over time for that scenario subsequently the interrelations of the diagram can be determined the physical solution which links the location of the attack system components to the required connections that must exist between them includes the chosen components and the cable and pipe routing between them it is likely to be restricted by the design constraints of the physical architecture such as the placement of bulkheads the physical solution of the attack system is shown in fig 10 the attack system is dependent on powering information and cooling services to function a breakdown of any of these services through a failure of the system components of their human or system management or of their routing could cause the system to fail or exhibit a degraded performance the overlap between the single line diagram logical architecture and the specific power demand operational architecture is the functional utilization of the system needed to power a high energy weapon in a specific scenario it is the load balance for this electrically based system the physical behavior links the location and size of the weapon and generator to the power demand which influences both the generator size and the physical and electromagnetic footprint of the cables in this case due to high power requirements necessary for high energy weapons the physical size of the power source may limit its location on the vessel thus highlighting the relationship to the physical architecture and the potential need to evaluate different options for the ship s overall architecture and that of the relevant distributed systems additionally in the above example the operational architecture dictates large hangars for vehicle stowage movement and transport which limits the ability to route a large number of systems straight up from the engine room through the hangars the operational architecture thus influences the physical architecture through the constraining topology and size demands will influence the physical architecture and vice versa the response of the system is the power distribution this describes both the magnitude of the power of the system and how it is distributed through the system to meet the envelope of the scenarios and logics the graphical representation of the framework for this example is presented in fig 11 the framework can be used to evaluate changes in the distributed system architecture due to shifting requirements for instance if there is a need to fire the weapon the operational architecture is influenced since the power demand increases this could influence the load balance the generator size and the power distribution however the effects will be dependent on the configuration of the power distribution system which must be considered from the physical logical and operational points of view it can also be deduced that the generator size is related to the physical architecture though increasing the generator size can fulfill the power demand it may not be a practical solution it might make more sense to focus on the load balance an inspection of the system s single line diagram should be able to inform this decision the increase in power demand could be obtained by adjusting the logical architecture such as activating switches by adopting a holistic view of distributed systems one can start to analyze the influences of the primary architectures configurations on one another 6 conclusions this paper has introduced an architectural framework for designing and analyzing distributed systems within the context of naval ship survivability the increasing number and importance of distributed systems aboard naval vessels has led to major increases in vessel complexity the design and analysis of architectures of distributed systems will become an important design driver in modern naval ships thus new tools and methods are required at the concept design phase of vessels whose architecture is likely to be dominated by future distributed systems the framework presented in this paper aims to fill this gap by providing the basis to better investigate the coupling between the various architectural properties of a vessel and its distributed systems and their relationship to the vessel s performance the physical logical and operational characteristics of a vessel with regard to distributed ship systems have been addressed as well as their interactions providing designers a more holistic view of the ship its distributed systems and their behaviours under specific scenarios having this knowledge in early stage design will give designers a better understanding of the changing design drivers of future naval vessels which will have a higher reliance on interconnected distributed systems it will also provide designers with a better basis for evolving appropriate tools needed to take advantage of the new opportunities these opportunities will be realized by these distributed systems and by recent technology developments such as all electric power and propulsion systems 7 future work the research presented here is part of a multi year multi university project and thus several items have been identified for future work the framework itself will serve as a foundation to our work and the authors will work to develop and refine various aspects of it moving forward specifically this future development may be split between application and theory for application the authors are working to develop case studies explaining the framework in practice on top of the development of a detailed case study there is also the need to document a list of tool requirements for analyses of each portion of the framework including information exchange and to outline recommended standards for practice on the theoretical side the authors are working to extend this framework to include relations between systems themselves as well as systems of systems and sub systems later applications and case studies will be developed focusing specifically on the multi layered distributed ship systems architectural framework 8 project biography this research stems out of a multinational university collaboration involving university of michigan delft university of technology university college london and virginia tech these partners gratefully acknowledge the funding of this naval international cooperative opportunities in science and technology program nicop sponsored by ms kelly cooper of the us navy office of naval research which is a follow on of a previously successful collaboration the original work was focused on studying methods for generating and analyzing general arrangements in early stage ship design this follow on project extends that work to study the relationship between distributed system design and general arrangements in the context of ship survivability the initial task of this recent project was to develop a common vernacular between the universities and a framework to which all parties could agree upon that vernacular and framework are the foundation of this article acknowledgements the authors would like to thank ms kelly cooper and the office of naval research for their support on this collaborative study of the relationship between general arrangements and distributed systems with a focus on survivability funded under the naval international cooperative opportunities in science and technology program nicop contract number n00014 15 1 2752 appendix nomenclature this project identified the need to define several terms related to distributed systems general arrangements and survivability this was done because many of these terms have similar meanings in other fields and there was a desire to maintain consistency and clarity throughout the duration of this project the authors have tried to retain the definitions found in relevant literature however some modifications were necessary in some cases entirely new definitions were developed definitions from literature have been cited accordingly architectural framework a foundational structure or set of structures which can

23735,this paper introduces a framework for analyzing distributed ship systems the increase in interconnected and interdependent systems aboard modern naval vessels has significantly increased their complexity making them more vulnerable to cascading failures and emergent behavior that arise only once the system is complete and in operation there is a need for a systematic approach to describe and analyze distributed systems at the conceptual stage for naval vessels understanding the relationships between various aspects of these distributed systems is crucial for uninterrupted naval operations and vessel survivability the framework introduced in this paper decomposes information about an individual system into three views the physical logical and operational architectural representations these representations describe the spatial and functional relationships of the system together with their temporal behavior characteristics this paper defines how these primary architectural representations are used to describe a system the interrelations between the architectural blocks and how those blocks fit together a list of defined terms is presented and a preliminary set of requirements for specific design tools to model these architectures is discussed a practical application is introduced to illustrate how the framework can be used to describe the delivery of power to a high energy weapon keywords early stage design distributed systems complex systems design taxonomy 1 introduction the increasing importance and complexity of interdependent distributed systems people and components incorporated into naval ships makes it necessary to describe them as architectures of complex systems in this paper the authors present and demonstrate a framework to describe the architectures of distributed naval ship systems that enables engineers to better address system design in early stage naval ship design the framework is intended to provide a conceptual method of capturing the key attributes of a distributed ship system thus the objective is to describe such a system ensuring all important aspects are covered as opposed to presenting a design process for the system a distributed ship system representation needs to be multifaceted it is the interrelationships between the different representations or architectures that allows a full understanding of the system the presented framework is applicable to one given system and is designed to cover the aspects that are important when analyzing and describing that system three primary facets of a system are considered the physical logical and operational architectures the architecture of a system is defined as the manner in which its components are organized and integrated the physical architecture represents the spatial and physical characteristics of the system and of its environment the logical architecture describes functional characteristics of the system and the linkages between each component of the system the operational architecture describes temporal behavior of a system including human system interactions to some extent the architectural framework presented in this article thus provides a basis for describing and understanding the impact of the architectural properties of systems aboard a vessel on the vessel s performance the effort to develop this framework was motivated by a need to better understand the impact of distributed systems on ship design especially with regard to survivability the past half century has brought with it a radical change in the design and control of high risk systems technological change has brought with it highly complex automated capable but opaque systems reason 1990 this growth in system complexity and interdependence has made systems significantly more difficult to understand and design in part due to increased potential for emergent properties that only arise once the system is complete and in operation this increased the opportunity for latent errors i e design errors which can remain dormant for a long time before the right combination of factors align to make the error emerge and potentially catastrophic consequences on the ship s operability slabodkin 1998 uk house of commons defence committee 2016 the opacity of the systems interrelations has led to an increased opportunity for cascading failures compromising the survivability of the vessel as noted above the framework aims to better understand the multidimensional relations between distributed systems which can decrease the design s opacity with the increasing number complication and resulting complexity of systems aboard vessels the authors argue this framework will bring a major step forward in early stage naval ship design and analysis addressing a significant gap in our ability to investigate the complex nature of future naval distributed system design at this crucial decision point section 2 outlines the problem and justifies the need for an architectural framework in the design of distributed systems aboard naval vessels while section 3 presents the framework itself with its three primary architectures and their interrelations section 4 discusses requirements for analysis tools and recommendations for the architectural framework implementation in section 5 an example application is given involving the powering of a vessel s high energy weapon the appendix defines the key nomenclature used in this framework 2 background the need for an architectural framework in the past several decades technological developments have brought major changes to the way ships are designed and operated automation has pushed the boundaries of performance and increased the use of complex distributed systems aboard vessels although costly to introduce automation has had an attractive payback to the maritime industry the increase in complex systems and automatic monitoring systems has led to increased operational efficiency increased crew morale and safety and reduced maintenance cost ehlers et al 2014 the advantages of all electric powering over mechanically powered ships are also well documented and have led many organizations to move towards all electric ships some major advantages of all electric powering were identified by doerry 2014 including increased power flexibility the ability to shift power between ship systems as needed increased power efficiency and increased arrangements flexibility since prime movers are no longer restricted to the central position of the aft bottom decks the introduction of complex distributed systems and electric propulsion technologies aboard naval vessels has nevertheless significantly increased their complexity rigterink 2014 and has left a gap in ship design methods and tools the increasingly complex organizational and physical architectures of naval systems with high interdependence between distribution systems humans and onboard components are changing the design drivers and the focus of the naval architect system integration is now as important as the traditional naval architecture disciplines since the arrangement of systems and usage of system interdependencies play a significant role in vessel cost dobson 2014 miroyannis 2006 capability and survivability doerry 2007 2006 trapp 2015 thus understanding the structure of the dependencies between various aspects of a distributed system and how they are best accommodated in the ship s physical architecture in the early stages of design is critical to the maturation of state of the art vessel design brown and waltham sajdak 2015 chalfant 2015 ouroua et al 2007 the changing design considerations of naval vessels that arise from the increased use of distributed systems have left designers with an inadequate set of tools for concept exploration doerry and fireman 2006 kassel et al 2010 analyzing the implications of early stage design decisions on the physical attributes of the vessel only covers a limited aspect of early stage design how components and discrete sub systems within compartments are geometrically related and how the resulting configuration affects the functionality and performance of the vessel with simpler less demanding vessels designers were able to use their implicit knowledge to determine performance and interaction issues that could occur between systems in a given general arrangement however with the increased impact of distributed systems and smaller margins driven by the desire to further optimize designs new methods are needed to help designers integrate vessel solutions these need to reflect the interdependent functionality of components within a vessel how the functionalities provided by the whole vessel and the component sub systems will be achieved and geometric relationships caused by an arrangement to the authors knowledge no cohesive framework exists for evaluating how the coupling of these interrelated design aspects culminates in determining the overall system performance common methodologies for concept design of interacting ship architectures range from low fidelity parameterization based modeling to high fidelity simulation of systems andrews 2012 brown and waltham sajdak 2015 chalfant 2015 chandrasegaran et al 2013 parametric methods perform well for evolutionary designs however their basis in previous data makes them ill suited for the design of revolutionary vessels chalfant 2015 low fidelity simulation is also used for concept exploration in distributed system design trapp 2015 uses optimization on a multi commodity flow network to explore a large state space and find a minimum cost of a vessel s integrated engineering plant with a given survivability constraint his algorithm seeks the minimum cost survivability and avoids predicating a single solution cramer et al 2009 use a genetic algorithm to solve minimax problems and applies it to the design of an integrated engineering plant with respect to survivability after the set of possible solutions is narrowed using low fidelity simulation high fidelity analysis of specific systems can be targeted for instance high fidelity analyses have been performed to analyze the tradeoff between ac and dc electrical distribution systems chalfant et al 2010 understand the impact of electrical weapons on power supply stability whitelegg et al 2015 but also to understand the relationship between propulsion and maneuvering systems altosole et al 2010 however high fidelity models often require a significant jump in design detail and can take up valuable time to model in early stage design especially at a point in time where the chosen design solution has yet to emerge the time issue can be addressed using tools that can easily produce and analyze distributed systems based on templates and product catalogues the electric ship research and development consortium esrdc has developed the smart ship systems design s3d tool to perform high fidelity design and analysis of distributed naval systems chalfant 2015 fiedel et al 2011 developed a cooling system design tool to analyze thermal loading and design appropriate cooling systems this is a task which will become harder and more critical as the number of electrical systems aboard ships increases the jump in design detail required for high fidelity models and templates still remains an issue as they both strongly rely on previous solutions and assumptions and on modeling detail which is based on decisions that can predicate the design influencing it at a point in time where the chosen design solution has yet to emerge this makes them ill suited for concept design or for the creation of revolutionary designs like naval all electric ships and radical ship configurations greig et al 2009 where one should not fix large portions of the design while still conducting requirements elucidation andrews 2013 2011 addressing the architecture of naval distributed systems in novel vessel design is becoming a major component of concept exploration and is beset by technology uncertainty and concurrent mission development developing vessel concepts from legacy designs tools and fixed solution options significantly limits the designer s ability to take advantage of emergent opportunities and properly cope with evolving design requirements in early stage design when decision freedom is highest andrews 2013 new methods are needed to guide the development of architectures of distributed systems from conception through early stage design and into more detailed effort without requiring leaps to high fidelity tools while the ship design is far from fixed 3 architectural framework for naval distributed systems the architectural framework of a system is defined as the manner in which its components are organized and integrated this is the focus of this paper to describe an architectural framework for naval distributed systems which accounts for the relationships concerning a specific distributed system and its relation within the ship s general arrangements in the context of naval survivability specifically the authors use the definition of the open group architecture framework togaf which defines and describes procedures for developing an architectural framework as an architectural framework is a foundational structure or set of structures which can be used for developing a broad range of different architectures it should describe a method for designing a target state of the enterprise in terms of a set of building blocks and for showing how the building blocks fit together it should contain a set of tools and provide a common vocabulary it should also include a list of recommended standards and compliant products that can be used to implement the building blocks togaf 2011 in general a framework consists of the structure of a system its properties and behaviors and the relationships that exist within it architectural frameworks are often used to analyze and to describe the organization of systems like buildings computers or even human biology they are well suited for any system with a large number of connected interdependent components for many applications a well modeled architectural framework enables reuse of components to ease development and management for current and future programs or projects in this sense the following discussion aims to 1 describe the architectural blocks used in this framework 2 describe how these architectural blocks fit together 3 provide a brief discussion of requirements for relevant analysis tools and 4 establish the common vocabulary 3 1 primary architectures in the context of naval ships the authors define the architectural framework as a conceptual model that describes the physical architecture the logical architecture and the operational architecture of vessels together with the interrelationships between the three architectures the physical architecture describes the spatial arrangement the logical architecture describes information on the functional characteristics of the system and the operational architecture contains information on the temporal behavioral characteristics of the vessel in a given mission scenario these primary architectures are discussed in more detail below in section 3 2 we describe how these architectural blocks fit together the physical architecture is a spatial architecture and it has two important classes of information 1 the constraining architecture defined by the ship configuration and the relationships between spaces essentially what spaces actually exist on the ship and how they physically relate to one another and 2 the physical attributes of components of a given distributed system and their locations relative to each other in the vessel the physical architecture defines the organization of the overall layout of major spaces and thus the possible spatial configurations a given distributed system can take within these spaces it creates bounds on the possible layout configuration of distributed systems example physical architectures are given in fig 1 the radial configuration shown on the left exhibits a smaller footprint but has less potential for system routing redundancy than the ring configuration on the right the choice of style as discussed by andrews 2012 and pawling et al 2014 2013 is a major driver of any ship design option and hence has a significant influence on the physical architectures style could be the basis of producing a set of design options for the ship and a given distributed system within it style refers to a set of options resulting from choices in design e g the choice of a survivability zoning configuration that are usually cross cutting between various disciplines thus two vessels with the same requirements can have very different characteristics and performances for example a common set of performance requirements for a frigate was once provided to both the uk and the us navies though the performance requirements were similar the resultant uk and us designs were very different ferreiro and stonehouse 1991 these designs differed in size displacement number of decks shape of the superstructure etc in other words the physical architecture of the designs was different though the high level operational requirements were identical pawling et al 2014 the logical architecture describes functional characteristics of the system and the linkages between each component of the system logical architecture is a multidisciplinary term and in this paper its definition is similar to the one used in information technology specifically desfray 2008 states that logical architecture addresses the information system seen macroscopically by focusing on its main components their interactions and the flows exchanged and by structuring them by group into larger scale modules it is this essence of the term that the authors aim to apply to naval systems and arrangements in that case components could refer to a machine system component and an auxiliary power source while flows exchange could comprise power distribution between power sources and sinks another example of a logical architecture may be a single line diagram describing the way components are connected or should be connected to each other to provide a given service or function in the case of a ship s machinery system this may detail that a system component must be connected to a main auxiliary power source and to multiple emergency power sources fig 2 shows an example logical architecture of distributed systems represented as a multiplex network the components are the same in both networks the left one shows the relations in a cooling system and the right one shows the electrical power system in the electrical power system the radar is connected to the power source node and the backup power node thus the radar has power redundancy however the chiller is not connected to the backup power source node if the main power source fails the radar will eventually become inoperable from overheating and this relationship between power and cooling has not been captured by the individual systems the operational architecture defines the temporal behavior of system temporal behavior is intended to capture what needs to happen through time to accomplish a given mission scenario it defines what systems are needed in which order or what processes and input outputs are needed through time like personnel movement or the charging of a capacitor it characterizes the way systems and spaces are used over time for a given operational scenario and the required system demands over time their input and output needs since the operational architecture describes how a system is used over time it also describes to some extent the human interaction with the system more generally it relates to the us department of defense definition of operational architecture description of the tasks operational elements and information flows required to accomplish or support a warfighting function fry 2001 for example this may represent a load characterization based on operational use or a survivability strategy that lays out what processes must take place to mitigate a damage scenario in the damaged or recoverability stages an example of a visualization of operational architecture is presented in fig 3 it consists of the operational need the human activity and the machine system activity the operational need describes to what extent the system is required over time this can for example be the need for a weapon system to be deployed or the need to use the steering gear in order to sail towards a desired course the human activity results from the operational need it includes the decisions made by the crew in order to fulfill the operational need the machine system activity describes to what extent the actual hardware of the system is used over time in this example the human activity and the machine system activity start at zero however they can also start above zero if the situation is continuously monitored the operational need human activity and machine system activity mutually influence each other and together form the operational architecture 3 2 interrelations between primary architectures the following discussion aims to show how the three primary architectures fit together to produce additional layers of information depth not captured by the primary architectures individually there are four interrelations defined as the physical solution functional utilization physical behavior and system response the authors have produced two representations of the architectural framework fig 4 presents a qualitative representation showing how the three dimensions of the naval distributed systems problem can be decomposed and combined to understand different perspectives of the problem each overlap shows how information from the primary architectures can be combined to provide designers a deeper understanding of a potential design solution some of the authorship of the paper has questioned whether this model is actually sustainable the basis of these concerns is that the physical logical and operational architectures each provide a different type of information and thus from a set theoretic perspective the intersection between them is empty therefore an alternative graphical representation is presented at the end of this section fig 5 meanwhile the original representation is developed further below as it is considered to provide some useful insights the interrelation between the physical and logical architectures is defined as the physical solution which describes what the system components look like in physical space of the ship in the context of the chosen physical and logical architectures this can include the physical layout of the chilled water plant radar and piping showing how the components connect together the physical solution overlays the selected logical connections according to the spatial allocations shields et al 2017 the interrelation between the logical architecture and the operational architecture is the functional utilization it characterizes the connection between system components and resource flows required in time to fulfill a mission of interest it specifies which systems are used or can be used over time from a given logical arrangement to fulfill a specified mission if generator a breaks down generator b can be substituted to supply the required power to run a mission specific load a system s functional utilization can be thought of as the system s load balance for a specified mission the physical behavior is the interrelation between the physical architecture and the operational architecture it is a measure for defining the characteristics of a physical layout for a given mission of interest it could capture interferences that occur as a result of undertaking a specified operational scenario for example electromagnetic interferences that occur if an operational scenario requires very high electrical loads or the potential degradation of human performance when operating above a certain sea state the physical performance also captures more grounded relations between physical attributes and performance attributes for example the physical size of a power generator is related to its power so the maximum power requirements for a range of operational architectures will determine the appropriate physical architecture combining the architectures and their interrelations creates a system response this is a characterization of the performance or behavior of the system for a chosen physical layout a chosen set of relations between components and a chosen mission by taking several instances of a primary architecture i e one catamaran and one mono hull physical architecture and analyzing each with respect to instances of the other two primary architectures one gets a set of system responses or the envelope of influence between architectures the system response may be defined as the primary measure of performance or measure of effectiveness for the given system in the specified operational context and gives an overview of the distributed system for example after a hostile attack the physical architecture will help determine which spaces suffered physical damage the connectivity between systems determined by the logical architecture will identify which systems will lose their connection and thus their input the operational architecture determines how systems are used and needed together these architectures provide an overview of the system the physical solution might change due to damage or isolation the physical behavior identifies how a given physical configuration affects the system s capability after damage the functional utilization might change to allow adequate operations with the system in a damaged state together all three will determine the immediate damage cascading failures but also how systems can be reconfigured to mitigate damage propagation this characterizes an overall response of the system in a selected design we now present the second representation of the architectural framework this formal description of the framework takes into account the lack of set theoretic interactions between primary architectures and is illustrated in fig 5 despite that the definitions of each architecture are identical to those of the first representation presented in fig 4 the sets of physical architectures logical architectures and operational architectures are given by pa x 1 x 2 x 3 x i la y 1 y 2 y 3 y j oa z 1 z 2 z 3 z k here each x y z are different instances of a physical logical and operational architecture for example x 1 and x 2 could represent a mono hull and double hull configuration respectively let ps x i be the set of physical solutions possible under physical architecture x i and any logical architecture that is a given physical architecture can lead to a given set of physical solutions regardless of the logical architecture similarly ps y j is the set of physical solutions possible under a specific logical architecture y j and a set of possible physical architectures for example the attack logical architecture shown in fig 8 could be achieved in a mono hull as in fig 10 or it could be achieved in a trimaran these options are the physical solutions which belong to the set ps y j together the selected logical architecture y j and the selected physical architecture x i provide the possible bounds on the set of possible physical solutions which are given by ps ps x i ps y j the physical solution is bounded by a 2 tuple of a physical architecture and a logical architecture and thus cannot be defined if one of them does not exist similarly the set of physical behaviors possible under a given physical architecture xi and operational architecture z k is given by pb pb x i pb z k where pb x i is the set of physical behaviors which exist under physical architecture x i and pb z k is the set of physical behaviors that exist under operational architecture z k the set of functional utilizations possible under a selected logical architecture y j and a scenario specific operational architecture z k is given by fu fu y j fu z k for the response r let r α be the set of overall system responses possible for the given set of physical solutions ps r β be the set of overall system responses for the given set of physical behaviors pb and r γ be the set of overall system responses for the given set of functional utilizations fu for example the physical solution will dictate the robustness of a distribution system influencing the set of responses r α possible under the chosen physical solution the functional utilization or load balance will dictate the time dependent input and output the system needs and has the set of responses r γ will characterize the system with respect to its component connections for a given time dependent operational scenario the set of responses r β for a given physical behavior is related to the influence of the physical characteristics of a distributed system on a given operational scenario all three sets of responses are required to evaluate the solution that is to get a complete characterization of the system s response r responses possible under the given physical solution physical behavior and functional utilization must be considered this is written as r r α r β r γ 4 requirements for analysis tools as with any framework a set of design and analysis tools are necessary to properly analyze the various aspects of the system while the objective of this paper is to outline the framework itself it is nevertheless beneficial to include a brief consideration of the requirements for potential design tools while the complete development of these tools is an area of continuing research this section briefly discusses some of the tools currently being considered and explored no single design tool is capable of covering the entire framework instead a set of tools is recommended to handle each part of the framework systematically these tools must model hundreds or possibly thousands of diverse components fig 6 shows an example system that shows the scope of this challenge to understand the physical architecture design tools must be able to generate and analyze physical spaces when in the concept phase this should involve the ability to generate a vast number of various architectures to properly explore the design space andrews 2013 such tools that have been developed with this specific requirement in mind include the design building block approach pioneered by andrews 1998 and realized practically by munoz and forrest 2002 and andrews and pawling 2003 or the packing based approach developed by van oers 2011 and duchateau 2016 additionally network based tools are being developed to supplement these geometric layout based concept exploration tools network tools require lower fidelity information which allows ensemble analysis in the early stages of design with less information such tools avoid predicating the design since they require fewer assumptions two current network tools are being investigated the first is to analyze the vulnerability of physical architectures with respect to internal blast and the second is to analyze the relationship between a selected physical architecture and the vessel s design complexity shields et al 2016 understanding the logical architecture requires an understanding of the relationships and dependencies between the various elements of the system this requirement lends itself to tools like network theory based metrics network theory has been used extensively to study the survivability of interdependent systems like power grids and communication networks buldyrev et al 2010 lü et al 2016 sterbenz et al 2013 newman 2010 in ship design van oers et al 2012 gillespie and singer 2013 rigterink et al 2013 de vos 2014 collins et al 2015 parker and singer 2015 and shields et al 2016 have used networks extensively to study relationships and connections during various stages of the naval ship design process including some studies focused specifically on distributed systems chalfant et al 2017 are developing two logical architecture tools to study the operation and vulnerability of a total ship system a deactivation block diagram algorithm and an architecture flow optimization expanded from trapp 2015 additional network based tools are being developed to study the combined influence of the physical and logical architectures on cascading failures inherent in operational architecture are temporal variations and personnel requirements which have to be met by requisite tool current research on studying the temporal aspects of operational architectures has looked to extend previous work on markov processes as applied to ship design and operations kana 2016 niese 2012 markov processes provide a sound foundational structure that accounts for the stochastic uncertainty that may be present in temporal processes initial investigations into applying these tools to ship board survivability have looked into the use of both discrete and continuous time markov processes to capture the temporal interplay between multiple ship systems during a damage scenario as well as the impact of individual component reliability on overall system performance and availability from a personnel perspective a distinction can be made between the logistical and non logistical parts of operational processes the logistical part requires connectivity between spaces and lends itself to a capacitated flow network based approach while the non logistical part concerns a wider variety of information where a logical rules set approach can be pursued the combination of the logistical and non logistical processes can be used to evaluate the suitability of personnel requirements within the operational architecture developing tools to study the interactions of these architectures may involve combining various currently existing tools or the development of new ones 5 framework application example when designing a new distributed ship system clearly defining which aspects belong to each portion of the framework is important however it may be challenging it is through this development and identification that insight will be gained about the system in order to illustrate how the architectural framework can be applied to the analysis of a distributed system example the use of a high energy weapon on a naval ship is presented the related distributed system is limited to the weapon the power source the radar the chiller the combat information center the cables and pipes for this example the physical architecture consists of the constraining ship architecture and the locations of the appropriate components as shown in fig 7 a logical architecture describes the relationship between the system components in this case it is the single line diagram of a set of required power information and cooling systems associated with the weapon system it is a schematic overview of the required connections between generators weapon radar chiller and cables and the associated electrical elements as shown in fig 8 system components and their connections are organized by services that must exist for the attack system to function powering information and cooling the operational architecture is a way of representing how the system is employed over time it can be visualized using a graph of the operational need and the system activity both human systems and machine systems as a function of time for a specific mission scenario this graph can be dependent on the system of interest and external factors appropriate to a selected operational scenario for this case the associated graph is presented in fig 9 the weapon operating process consists of several phases in phase 1 an operational need for employing the weapon arises this could be a hostile attack the activity of the machine system which is the weapon in this case is still zero the human activity is slightly above zero since humans are always monitoring the situation prior to taking decisions in phase 2 the crew has observed the hostile attack the human activity increases because the crew has to decide how to react to the attack the crew decides to employ the weapon in phase 3 the machine system activity therefore increases the human activity decreases slightly because the machine system has partly taken over the action in phase 4 the hostile attack is effectively combatted the human activity increases again because the crew has to decide how next to act it is decided that the external threat is over phase 5 the operational need decreases to zero and the weapon is deactivated the human activity is reduced to the original level it is characteristic of an operational architecture that there will be a certain degree of time lag between operational need human activity and system activity furthermore the plot lines clearly illustrate the balance between the operational need and the system activity and how it develops over time for that scenario subsequently the interrelations of the diagram can be determined the physical solution which links the location of the attack system components to the required connections that must exist between them includes the chosen components and the cable and pipe routing between them it is likely to be restricted by the design constraints of the physical architecture such as the placement of bulkheads the physical solution of the attack system is shown in fig 10 the attack system is dependent on powering information and cooling services to function a breakdown of any of these services through a failure of the system components of their human or system management or of their routing could cause the system to fail or exhibit a degraded performance the overlap between the single line diagram logical architecture and the specific power demand operational architecture is the functional utilization of the system needed to power a high energy weapon in a specific scenario it is the load balance for this electrically based system the physical behavior links the location and size of the weapon and generator to the power demand which influences both the generator size and the physical and electromagnetic footprint of the cables in this case due to high power requirements necessary for high energy weapons the physical size of the power source may limit its location on the vessel thus highlighting the relationship to the physical architecture and the potential need to evaluate different options for the ship s overall architecture and that of the relevant distributed systems additionally in the above example the operational architecture dictates large hangars for vehicle stowage movement and transport which limits the ability to route a large number of systems straight up from the engine room through the hangars the operational architecture thus influences the physical architecture through the constraining topology and size demands will influence the physical architecture and vice versa the response of the system is the power distribution this describes both the magnitude of the power of the system and how it is distributed through the system to meet the envelope of the scenarios and logics the graphical representation of the framework for this example is presented in fig 11 the framework can be used to evaluate changes in the distributed system architecture due to shifting requirements for instance if there is a need to fire the weapon the operational architecture is influenced since the power demand increases this could influence the load balance the generator size and the power distribution however the effects will be dependent on the configuration of the power distribution system which must be considered from the physical logical and operational points of view it can also be deduced that the generator size is related to the physical architecture though increasing the generator size can fulfill the power demand it may not be a practical solution it might make more sense to focus on the load balance an inspection of the system s single line diagram should be able to inform this decision the increase in power demand could be obtained by adjusting the logical architecture such as activating switches by adopting a holistic view of distributed systems one can start to analyze the influences of the primary architectures configurations on one another 6 conclusions this paper has introduced an architectural framework for designing and analyzing distributed systems within the context of naval ship survivability the increasing number and importance of distributed systems aboard naval vessels has led to major increases in vessel complexity the design and analysis of architectures of distributed systems will become an important design driver in modern naval ships thus new tools and methods are required at the concept design phase of vessels whose architecture is likely to be dominated by future distributed systems the framework presented in this paper aims to fill this gap by providing the basis to better investigate the coupling between the various architectural properties of a vessel and its distributed systems and their relationship to the vessel s performance the physical logical and operational characteristics of a vessel with regard to distributed ship systems have been addressed as well as their interactions providing designers a more holistic view of the ship its distributed systems and their behaviours under specific scenarios having this knowledge in early stage design will give designers a better understanding of the changing design drivers of future naval vessels which will have a higher reliance on interconnected distributed systems it will also provide designers with a better basis for evolving appropriate tools needed to take advantage of the new opportunities these opportunities will be realized by these distributed systems and by recent technology developments such as all electric power and propulsion systems 7 future work the research presented here is part of a multi year multi university project and thus several items have been identified for future work the framework itself will serve as a foundation to our work and the authors will work to develop and refine various aspects of it moving forward specifically this future development may be split between application and theory for application the authors are working to develop case studies explaining the framework in practice on top of the development of a detailed case study there is also the need to document a list of tool requirements for analyses of each portion of the framework including information exchange and to outline recommended standards for practice on the theoretical side the authors are working to extend this framework to include relations between systems themselves as well as systems of systems and sub systems later applications and case studies will be developed focusing specifically on the multi layered distributed ship systems architectural framework 8 project biography this research stems out of a multinational university collaboration involving university of michigan delft university of technology university college london and virginia tech these partners gratefully

follow on of a previously successful collaboration the original work was focused on studying methods for generating and analyzing general arrangements in early stage ship design this follow on project extends that work to study the relationship between distributed system design and general arrangements in the context of ship survivability the initial task of this recent project was to develop a

23736,vessels and other marine structures are frequently subject to intense loads deriving from water impact under various conditions such forces influence both the structural resistance and the maneuvering capabilities of boats water impacts are also relevant in other fields such as civil engineering energy harvesting and aerospace engineering in this paper we numerically investigate the hydrodynamics related to the asymmetric water impact of a two dimensional wedge shape we study the combined effects of geometrical and kinematic asymmetry by systematically varying the wedge roll angle and the direction of the impact velocity the volume of fluid vof is utilized to model the free surface flow the numerical model is validated against independent experimental data available in the literature the results provided evidence the capabilities of multidimensional modeling in predicting global hydrodynamics and local fluid dynamics features of asymmetric impacts moreover we demonstrate the importance of some fundamental methodological aspects such as the correct initialization of the computational domain the role of kinematic asymmetry in flow ventilation occurrence is also clearly highlighted our results are expected to facilitate the development of analytical and semi analytical models and to offer guidelines for conducting experiments and parametric studies for

of great interest for ship design abrate 2011 and other engineering applications such as aerospace seddon and moatamedi 2006 and off shore structures faltinsen 1993 facci et al 2016 special attention has been given to the hull slamming phenomenon which usually occurs when a high speed planing boat hull or a sea plane impacts the water abrate 2011 faltinsen et al 2004 the generated fluid flow is quite complex and includes free surface piercing and deformation water sprays air entrainment and under some circumstances flow separation and ventilation judge et al 2004 shams et al 2015 all these aspects significantly influence the maneuvering characteristics as well as the hydrodynamic loading and consequently structural fatigue behavior of marine vessels gu and moan 2002 faltinsen et al 2004 silva and ravichandran 2012 a special case is represented by asymmetric impacts which are typical of heeled or yawed planing hulls and at high speeds can produce dynamic instability effects which still have to be fully understood judge et al 2004 impact asymmetry can also occur when any kind of vessel moves with multiple degrees of freedom into steep waves attempts of solving analytically the slamming problem were initially focused on the hydrodynamic load estimation for two dimensional wedge like vertical entry configurations von kármán 1929 wagner 1932 these early studies were then progressively extended to different hull geometries and adding more physics to the underlying basic assumptions dobrovol skaya 1969 cointe and armand 1987 cointe 1989 cointe 1991 howinson et al 1991 greenhow 1987 most of these studies are focused on vertical symmetric impacts although still elegant in their formulation the few known analytical studies on asymmetric water entry korobkin 1988 miloh 1991 chekin 1989 are generally not meant to describe the asymmetry generated flow separation and ventilation most known experimental works on the water entry are also limited to symmetric impacts

qualitatively consistent behavior to the best of our knowledge a systematic validation of cfd models for different oblique entry configurations and an insight on the physical and geometrical parameters which influence the transition from non ventilating to ventilating flow are missing in the scientific literature this paper presents a detailed numerical study of a wedge like two dimensional section impacting water surface under a variety of geometrical and kinematic asymmetry conditions the simulations are performed through a vof based algorithm rider and kothe 1998 scardovelli and zaleski 1999 rusche 2002 coupled with a laplacian mesh motion solver jasak and tukovic 2007 jasak 2009 kassiotis 2008 already employed and validated for symmetric water entry problems facci et al 2015 facci and ubertini 2015 the paper is organized as follows the main features of the problem in study are described in section 2 then a focus on the numerical approach including details on the computational domain and numerical setup is given in section 3 1 in section 4 the methodology is validated by comparing present numerical results to literature experimental data judge et al 2004 the hydrodynamics related to the water impact is discussed in section 5 conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 problem statement in this paper we investigate the two dimensional hydrodynamics related to the asymmetric water impact of a rigid wedge through computational fluid dynamics cfd the problem is schematically represented in fig 1 which reports the relevant characteristics of the specimen and of the fluid flow the geometry of the wedge is defined in terms of its width l 0 20 m height h 0 08 m and dead rise angle β 37 such a geometry is selected to reproduce the experiments described by judge et al 2004 we hypothesize that the wedge breadth is much larger compared to l and to h such that the geometry and the hydrodynamics can be considered two dimensional jalalisendi et al 2015 a fixed cartesian reference frame is selected with the x axis along the horizontal direction i e along the water free surface and the y axis along the vertical direction the hull keel impacts on the water surface at the origin of the reference frame and at time t 0 s we denote with ε t the abscissa of the wedge keel and with ξ t its ordinate at time t the wedge kinematics is defined by its constant velocity v ε ξ being the superimposed dot the time derivative and by the constant roll angle θ the velocity ratio τ ε ξ quantitatively represents the kinematic asymmetry of the water entry and the angle θ represents the geometrical asymmetry we assume that the two fluids air and water are immiscible and the flow is incompressible thereafter the flow field is described by the mass conservation and momentum balance equations as follows 1a u 0 1b d ρ u d t p μ u ρ g where u is the fluid velocity p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is the density g is the gravitational acceleration and d d t denotes the material derivative note that ρ and μ vary in space and time according to the fluid phase air or water in particular the air density and viscosity are ρ a 1 kg m3 and μ a 1 48 10 5 pa s respectively and the water density and viscosity are ρ w 1000 kg m3 and μ w 1 10 3 pa s respectively experimental observations show that for low τ and θ the flow remains attached on both sides of the wedge judge et al 2004 shams et al 2015 as qualitatively represented in fig 1a and the flow asymmetry is defined by the ratio b b 2 b 1 where b 1 and b 2 are the jet root abscissa on the lower and upper side of the wedge respectively as in judge et al 2004 from now on we will refer to such a flow as type a flow increasing the asymmetry i e decreasing b a cavity should appear on the upper side of the hull see fig 1b and the flow is denoted as type b flow judge et al 2004 the encompassing fluid reacts to the wedge motion generating a force that can be expressed as 2 f σ p i μ u u t n dς where i is the identity matrix σ is the hull surface and n is the unit normal to the hull we define the moment of f with respect to the wedge keel as 3 m σ d p i μ u u t n dς being d the position vector evaluated from the keel itself with reference to fig 1 the geometrical wetted length projection onto the undisturbed water line is defined as 4 l w ξ t 1 t a n β θ 1 t a n β θ considering l w and v as the impact characteristic length and velocity scales we define the following non dimensional force and moment coefficients 5 c f x 2 f x ρ w v 2 l w 6 c f y 2 f y ρ w v 2 l w 7 c m z 2 m z ρ w v 2 l w 2 with f x f y and m z being the force components and tilting moment per unit span respectively to study pressure variations during water entry we also introduce the following non dimensional pressure coefficient 8 c p 2 p p ρ w v 2 with p being the air pressure at ambient conditions finally we define the impact characteristic reynolds number as 9 r e ρ w v δ r e f μ w where δ r e f is a reference value of the keel penetration along the impact direction 3 methodology 3 1 numerical method we numerically study the flow induced by the wedge motion through a method based on a special vof implementation rider and kothe 1998 scardovelli and zaleski 1999 rusche 2002 that is included in the openfoam 2 4 cfd package openfoam 2015 similar applications of such a method are for instance facci et al 2015 2016 facci and ubertini 2015 cavalagli et al 2017 the incompressible flow of two immiscible fluids is modeled through a single set of the navier stokes and continuity equations see eq 1 the interface between the two phases is defined solving eq 10 rusche 2002 10 d α d t u r α 1 α 0 where α is the water volume fraction and u r is the relative velocity of the two phases the second term of eq 10 is introduced to compensate the numerical smearing of the fluid interface rusche 2002 equations 1 and 10 are discretized through a generalized unstructured finite volume approach with a collocated arrangement of all the flow variables ferziger and periç 2002 greenshields 2015a the pressure velocity coupling and the non linearity of eq 1 are solved using the pressure implicit with split operators piso algorithm issa 1985 keeping the original two stage pressure correction scheme for each time integration step δ t the discrete version of eq 10 is solved through the multidimensional universal limiter with explicit solution mules procedure greenshields 2015b the solution of eq 10 is sub cycled in four steps for each δ t and it is linearized using two additional steps of a fixed point iteration temporal integration is performed through the euler implicit method greenshields 2015b the gaussian integration with second order linear interpolation is adopted for all the spatial terms other than the convective ones for the latter a high resolution nvd scheme jasak et al 1999 is utilized to balance numerical stability and accuracy depending on the local flow conditions this scheme bridges the standard second order central differencing with first order upwind differencing by means of a specifically designed nonlinear function a smoothness factor γ controls the behavior of the bridging function where γ 0 corresponds to pure central differencing and γ 1 to the maximum boundedness level here we set γ 0 2 which means that central differencing is applied in most of the cases the motion of the wedge within the computational domain is obtained by reallocating the mesh nodes at each time step topology modifications are not allowed the grid deformation is performed using the laplace smoothing methodology jasak and tukovic 2007 jasak 2009 kassiotis 2008 assuming a diffusivity coefficient distribution that concentrates most of the deformation away from the wedge surface the linear systems of equations resulting from temporal and spatial discretization are solved using the geometric agglomerated algebraic multi grid gamg iterative algorithm for pressure and the gauss seidel method for other scalar quantities greenshields 2015b we comment that turbulence modeling is not required for the numerical solution of the hull slamming problem in fact the impulsive nature of the water entry related phenomena does not allow the development of a proper energy cascade as demonstrated by seng et al 2012 the same consideration applies also for three dimensional effects seng et al 2012 that may only derive from edge effects that can be safely discarded when the transversal dimension of the falling body is much larger than the other ones as we assume without loosing generality in the present study 3 2 domain discretization and boundary conditions a domain of dimensions 2m 2m is considered to minimize the effects of the imposed boundary conditions on the fluid flow in the vicinity of the hull the domain is discretized through the openfoam built in meshing tool snappyhexmesh which is able to generate unstructured but highly hexa dominant grids with optional layer generation at the solid surfaces regardless of the θ value all the employed meshes have the following common characteristics see fig 2 i a background spacing level which covers most of the domain ii a first refinement zone extending from the left to the right wall and including the falling wedge and the whole free surface iii a second refinement zone placed below the lower surfaces of the wedge and covering the free surface portion that is actually affected by the impact iv a third refinement zone represented by a 1 cm wide belt around the wedge v three low aspect ratio extrusion layers at the walls of the wedge 1 1 in single phase flows highly stretched wall layers are commonly introduced to solve boundary layers assuming that gradients in the wall normal direction are the most relevant ones in vof solvers stretched cells should be avoided as they tend to produce an inconsistently biased transport of the liquid volume fraction boundary conditions are set following the conclusions of previous computational studies facci et al 2015 2016 facci and ubertini 2015 the domain is considered as a tank with free slip walls and an open end on top table 1 summarizes the bc settings for pressure velocity and the liquid volume fraction α note that to avoid backflow phenomena the α bc at the open end changes its behavior depending on the flux direction 4 validation in this section we compare our numerical results with experimental measurements collected by judge et al 2004 on various asymmetric impact configurations table 2 shows the configurations considered for this validation stage in terms of the velocity ratio τ and rolling angle θ the impact velocity magnitude varies between 2 m s and 5 m s depending on the τ value judge 4 1 effects of grid refinement and initial conditions preliminary computations are made to check the effects of grid refinement and domain initialization at this point τ and θ are fixed to 0 75 and 26 respectively experimental evidence has shown that these values should produce a type b flow close to the transition from non ventilating to ventilating flow judge et al 2004 the simulations have been performed with three different computational grids each one characterized by a different minimum cell size in the belt region see table 3 the water free surface is initialized at 1 6 cm below the wedge keel and the specimen falls for 5 ms before impacting the water surface fig 3 a c show the time history of the forces and tilting moment per unit span for the three considered meshes up to 3 5 ms after the water impact and with a 0 25 ms sampling resolution for each mesh we calculate an average relative deviation parameter across the sampling interval which is defined as follows 11 δ ψ 100 1 n 1 i 1 n ψ i ψ i max ψ i min ψ i where n is the number of sampling points ψ is alternatively f x f y or m z and the overline operator represents the mean of the values predicted by all meshes at a given sampling point table 4 collects the deviation parameters for each mesh and force component evidencing that the overall dispersion is well below what would be typically desirable for experimental data sets in addition to the integral forces analysis we perform a local pressure coefficient monitoring over time at a given measuring point located on the high pressure side of the impacting wedge monitoring starts 5 ms before and ends 5 ms after the water impact fig 3d shows the c p time traces recorded for each mesh it highlights a close correspondence between the medium and fine cases instead the coarse mesh resolution seems not sufficient for the accurate description of the steep pressure raise that occurs right after the impact based on these considerations the medium mesh is assumed as the baseline option for all the subsequent simulations in addition to the effects of grid refinement we analyze the influence of the initial conditions on water impact hydrodynamics we call type i the initialization strategy already used for the grid analysis with the free surface placed at 1 6 cm below the keel of the wedge at the beginning of the simulation conversely we call type ii an alternative strategy with the keel placed exactly at the free surface when the simulation starts both air and water are at rest the latter besides being a rather common practice for the numerical simulation of water entry problems facci and ubertini 2015 facci et al 2015 seng et al 2012 might also be useful to save computational time in demanding scenarios such as very fast impacts and or three dimensional and complex geometrical configurations fig 4 represents the water free surface for three time steps after the impact obtained with the two initializations for τ 0 75 θ 26 such a configuration is ventilating type b flow according to the experiments in judge et al 2004 only type i initialization predicts the transition to type b flow in fact the air motion induced by falling wedge before the water entry has a crucial influence on the ventilation occurrence during the initial impact stage on the other hand type ii initialization assumes air is at rest at the impact time a rather unrealistic initial condition further tests with increased vertical pre impact paths 3 2 cm and 6 4 cm have shown no significant changes therefore we utilize type i initialization for all the configurations specifically we assume that the specimen falls for 5 ms before entering calm water for all configurations the distance of the wedge keel at the beginning of the simulation varies between 0 5 cm and 2 5 cm depending on the τ value we note that we mark the impact time with t 0 s therefore t represents the time after the water impact and t 0 s unequivocally identifies the impact time for all the configurations 4 2 comparison with experimental data the flow asymmetry ratio b is selected as the main validation parameter data sampling is made every 0 5 ms starting from water impact while following the approach suggested by judge et al 2004 the b value is determined from the average of 4 sequential samples as follows 12 b 1 4 j 3 7 b j where b j represents the j t h sample fig 5 shows b as a function of θ for three different values of τ present numerical results are compared with the experimental and numerical results in judge et al 2004 for τ 0 25 the numerical trends are very similar and both agree well with the experiments up to θ 22 for θ 22 the measured values seem to point faster towards b 0 which represents the flow transition from type a to type b for τ 0 5 our cfd simulations still well agree with the experimental trend including the correct prediction of type b flow occurrence at θ 30 on the other hand the numerical results from judge et al 2004 generally underpredict b but consistently capture the flow transition to type b the τ 0 75 graph is particularly interesting because it shows how for large impact asymmetries i e large τ and θ values the reduced order numerical method proposed by judge et al 2004 fails to correctly describe the wetted lengths ratio and the transition to ventilation on the low pressure side of the wedge this aspect is also commented in judge et al 2004 and represents one of the main motivations for the development of multidimensional simulation methods such as the one presented in our paper in fact for τ 0 75 the value of b calculated through cfd is coherent with experimental evaluations on the whole theta range in particular cfd correctly capture the transition from type a to type b flow further validation is provided by comparing the free surface evolution in cfd and experiments fig 6 shows type a and type b flow cases clearly highlighting that our computational model correctly predicts the pileup and the interface dynamics in particular for the non ventilating case cfd correctly predicts the height of the risen water on both sides of the wedge in the considered time interval such an aspect is particularly relevant for the hull slamming as it largely determines the position and the value of the pressure peak on the structure in the ventilating case cfd captures both the risen water height on the high pressure side of the wedge as well as the position and dimension of the air cavity on the low pressure side 5 numerical analysis of asymmetric impact in this section we leverage on cfd to dissect the hydrodynamics related to the asymmetric water impact in terms of hydrodynamic loading pressure field and free surface evolution specifically we seek to assess the relative effect of τ and θ on impact hydrodynamics 5 1 free surface dynamics the free surface dynamics and in particular the occurrence of flow separation are distinctive aspects of asymmetric water impact judge et al 2004 when the wedge enters the water the free surface warps and the water level is increased with respect to the undisturbed one such a deformation generates the well known pileup phenomenon that is widely studied for symmetric impacts wagner 1932 facci et al 2015 panciroli et al 2015b in case of asymmetric impacts the effective wetted length is different on the two sides of the wedge as already discussed in the previous section the flow asymmetry can be quantitatively assessed through the non dimensional ratio b reported in fig 5 therein it is shown that b is consistently reduced by increasing the geometrical asymmetry for all the non ventilating cases in fact for a fixed penetration the rotation of the wedge increases b 1 leaving substantially unchanged b 2 as depicted in fig 7 increasing the kinematic asymmetry also reduces b but the kinematic asymmetry has a weaker effect on b compared to θ both cfd and experiments demonstrate that for τ 0 a type b flow never occurs not even for θ as large as 30 for τ 0 5 type b flow is obtained only for θ 30 which is a very large geometrical asymmetry considered that β 37 finally for τ 0 75 a completely ventilating flow is detected for θ 26 both according to cfd and to experiments judge et al 2004 all these findings suggests that the ventilating cavity formation should be mostly dominated by the direction of the impact velocity relative to the geometrical symmetry axis in a perfectly symmetric impact the relative velocity is parallel to the symmetry axis of the wedge and two equally directed liquid jets are generated by the flow splitting at the keel if such parallelism is broken due to a rolling angle and or kinematic asymmetry one of the two jets will start aligning with the solid surface on the low pressure side at some point the jet will be ideally parallel to the low pressure side and further changes in the impact direction will produce favorable conditions for liquid flow separation with air entrainment for the given geometrical features of the wedge in study such conditions cannot be apparently reached with changes in the rolling angle only further details on the free surface evolution and on flow ventilation are gained from fig 7 which represents the free surface evolution through the water volume fraction as a function of t and θ for τ 0 75 we selected a case with a large kinematic asymmetry because it allows dissecting the transition from type a to type b flow by varying θ for low values of θ fig 7 a d the flow is completely attached to the wedge surface during the whole period of observation increasing the asymmetry fig 7 e h a small air cavity appears immediately after water impact the cavity suddenly closes and the flow reattaches as the penetration is increased for θ 30 the cavity does not close during the whole simulation and the transition to type b flow is completed as shown in fig 7 i l the role of kinematic asymmetry in promoting the transition to type b flow is also evidenced in fig 6 which shows that for τ 2 flow ventilation is already obtained for θ as low as 5 5 2 pressure field fig 8 shows the c p on the high pressure side of the wedge as a function of the non dimensional wetted length and of the flow configuration on the high pressure side c p exhibits a self similar behavior analogous to the symmetric impact pressure facci et al 2015 facci and ubertini 2015 panciroli et al 2015b therefore in fig 8 we systematically represent c p for a single time after the impact onset i e t 2 ms we comment that y ξ 1 corresponds to the wedge keel y ξ 0 identifies the intersection between the wedge and the undisturbed water level and y ξ 0 represents the pileup region the contour plots of the non dimensional pressure depicted in fig 9 for τ 0 75 and as a function of t and θ confirm the self similarity of the pressure on the high pressure side of the wedge note that in fig 9l the high pressure side of the wedge is already completely submerged see fig 7 thereafter there is no pressure peak on the wetted surface and self similarity with the contour plots depicted in fig 9 i k is not expected for all the considered combinations of θ and τ the pressure peak is located at the same non dimensional coordinate y ξ that corresponds to the jet root location as can be argued by comparing figs 9 7 the pressure peak is dramatically increased by increasing the geometrical asymmetry such an evidence can be interpreted noting that the larger is θ the lower is the effective deadrise angle and thus the larger is the pressure peak wagner 1932 fig 8 shows that the pressure is significantly reduced by increasing τ this is explained by considering that the pressure force represents the reaction of the displaced fluid to the acceleration imposed by the wedge added mass effect the velocity of increment of the displaced water is proportional to the vertical penetration velocity that in turn decreases by increasing τ see table 2 on the other hand the velocity scale selected for the definition of c p v is theoretically not influenced by the kinematic asymmetry experiments show only a minor reduction of v with τ increasing from 0 to 0 75 presumably caused by the increased friction on the experimental struts as a consequence c p is reduced by increasing the kinematic asymmetry fig 9 shows that the pressures field in the low pressure side of the wedge is not self similar in time in particular the partially ventilating configuration see fig 9e h is characterized by an evident low pressure zone close to the keel that exhibits a clearly unsteady behavior nevertheless to dissect the effects of kinematic and geometrical asymmetry in fig 10 we systematically represent c p on the low pressure side of the wedge as a function of τ and θ for t 2 ms when θ 13 τ has a minor impact on c p with a slight progressive pressure reduction in the proximity of the keel as τ increases this is presumably related to the increasing horizontal component of the water velocity relative to the wedge keel in these configurations the water flow is completely attached as for instance the one represented in fig 7 for larger θ and τ values the pressure drop becomes stronger and extends along the wedge surface by comparing fig 10 to figs 7 and 9 we note that such a low pressure zone is distinctive of a flow transition from type a to type b during this transition air is trapped on the low pressure side but without the formation of a fully ventilating cavity after the complete transition to type b flow that is for τ 0 75 and θ 26 the cavity is completely open and thus the pressure flattens towards the atmospheric pressure fig 11 displays the temporal evolution of c p on the low pressure side for τ 0 75 and should be evaluated together with figs 7 and 9 which show the free surface and two dimensional pressure contours dynamics under the same flow conditions for type a flow θ 9 and for completely developed type b flow θ 30 the variation of c p in time is insignificant on the other hand for θ 22 during the flow transition from type a to type b c p shows an unsteady behavior initially as shown in fig 7 the cavity is open and p p afterwards for t 2 ms the cavity closes see fig 7 and p is reduced below atmospheric pressure the linear dimension of the air cavity is initially larger and is gradually reduced compared to the wedge penetration the pressure within the closed air cavity does not vary significantly in time the dependence of the flow on the reynolds number is analyzed in fig 12 a and b for a type a to type b transitional configuration τ 0 75 θ 26 the different r e values are obtained by changing the impact velocity magnitude while δ r e f is kept constant to 8 10 3 m note that r e 16000 corresponds to the impact speed previously adopted for all the cases with τ 0 75 on the high pressure side the c p distribution reveals a substantial insensitivity to r e which again is consistent with previous findings on symmetrical impact wedge studies facci and ubertini 2015 the low pressure side shows a relatively weak dependence on the reynolds number thus indicating that viscous dissipation related to the large velocity gradients at the wedge keel concurs at the pressure reduction on the low pressure side for partially ventilating configurations 5 3 fluid forces the fluid force time history has been already shown in section 4 1 for a single combination of τ and θ to gain a better insight on how hydrodynamic loads are affected by the two types of asymmetry considered we adopt the non dimensional force coefficients introduced in section 2 it is worth to note that if the following fitting curves are used for f t and m t 13a f t a t 13b m t b t 2 the time dependence is effectively removed from the non dimensional coefficients definitions therefore coefficients are plotted as a function of τ and θ only horizontal force trends are reported in fig 13 a when the asymmetry is introduced a non zero horizontal force rises and points towards the negative x direction from the high to the low pressure side of the wedge such an horizontal force is generated by a pressure unbalance between the two sides of the wedge clearly visible from figs 8 10 we also comment that in the case of symmetric impact τ 0 and θ 0 and the numerical model correctly returns c f x 0 for all the τ values c f x increases with θ the trend is linear for θ 19 this situation corresponds to the flow configuration depicted in fig 7 a d that is for completely attached configurations notably in partially ventilating configurations the c f x is insensitive to τ this means that while on the high pressure side c p is reduced increasing τ see fig 8 on the low pressure side the size of the low pressure bubble increases as evidenced in fig 10 when the flow transition to type b is completed c f x suddenly decreases because as the cavity opens p p on the low pressure side as expected c f x increases with τ such a dependency is larger at low θ and saturates for θ 9 the vertical force coefficient is reported in fig 13b as a function of θ and τ the kinematic asymmetry has a minor impact on c f y only for τ 0 75 c f y is appreciably lower compared to the other cases on the contrary θ dominates the c f y behavior in fact the larger is θ the lower will be the effective deadrise angle on the pressure side of the wedge and in turn the larger is the wetted surface for a fixed penetration as evidenced in fig 7 the effect of the effective deadrise angle is coherent with symmetric impacts wagner 1932 in conclusion the vertical hydrodynamic force behavior for asymmetrical and symmetrical water impacts is similar being c f y largely determined by the pressure on the high pressure side of the wedge this can be explained by observing from figs 7 10 that not only c p but also the effective wetted area is much larger on the high pressure side of the wedge with respect to the low pressure one the c m z trends are shown in fig 13c for θ 19 the moment generation is largely dominated by the geometrical asymmetry and the effect of τ is negligible further increasing θ for partially ventilating flows there is a systematic drop in c m z followed by a recovery at higher θ values except for τ 0 such a recovery is much faster for τ 0 25 and τ 0 5 thus producing an increment of c m z at θ 30 of about 50 compared to the case with τ 0 75 this again could be related to the type b flow occurrence 6 conclusions in this paper the 2d hydrodynamics generated by the asymmetric water impact of a wedge like section was numerically investigated the free surface flow modeling is based on a finite volume vof implementation with a special numerical treatment to avoid artificial smearing of the air water interface across the computational domain the study was focused on the influence of geometrical and kinematic asymmetries on the impact hydrodynamics and includes a preliminary assessment on the adopted numerical setup the preliminary analysis showed a high sensitivity of the computed flow with respect to the numerical domain initialization more in details to correctly predict flow splitting at the keel a free path prior to water impact should be introduced this was found to be fundamental for the prediction of ventilation on the low pressure side of the wedge thus providing a useful information for the practical setup of such type of numerical simulations a comparison between cfd and experimental data available in literature demonstrated the reliability of the proposed numerical method in predicting the wetted lengths and the transition from non ventilating to ventilating flow conditions as functions of the kinematic and geometrical asymmetry the validated methodology was used to investigate fluid forces and pressure field variations with respect to the asymmetry angle θ and the kinematic asymmetry ratio τ the horizontal force generation strongly depends on the level of asymmetry introduced for θ 19 both parameters affect the horizontal force coefficient value while above this threshold the θ influence becomes largely dominant the vertical force coefficient appears to be weakly dependent on the kinematic asymmetry showing a nonlinear increase with θ and a nearly self similar trend for the considered τ values the tilting moment coefficient has a characteristic drop and recovery trend for τ 0 with the drop located approximately at θ 22 prior to the drop point there is very small τ dependence while after that the recovery is faster for lower τ values the slow recovery for τ 0 75 might be explained by transition to fully ventilated low pressure side the pressure distribution on the wedge surface is essentially self similar on the high pressure side which is consistent with previous theoretical and numerical findings on symmetric impact cases the low pressure side has a less predictable behavior due to the changes in the flow regime depending on the impact asymmetry level for small θ and τ the flow remains attached and with a pressure drop close to the keel at intermediate θ and τ the pressure drop becomes stronger and a dynamic flow separation reattachment process occurs when θ and τ get both large the separation dominates and the low pressure side becomes fully ventilated with a pressure recovery towards the atmospheric value the effect of r e is negligible on the high pressure side and appears to be relatively weak also on the low pressure side even for transitional configurations overall the hydrodynamic load characteristics of wedge like sections during asymmetric water entry seems to be mostly governed by the geometrical parameters of the impact which essentially determine vertical force and tilting moment coefficients the kinematic asymmetry is less important in the main integral force components generation but produces significant local fluid dynamics phenomena that may lead to sudden liquid flow separation and air entrainment on the low pressure side of the wedge future studies should be focused on coupled analysis of the fluid structure interaction for asymmetric

maneuvering capabilities of boats water impacts are also relevant in other fields such as civil engineering energy harvesting and aerospace engineering in this paper we numerically investigate the hydrodynamics related to the asymmetric water impact of a two dimensional wedge shape we study the combined effects of geometrical and kinematic asymmetry by systematically varying the wedge roll angle and the direction of the impact velocity the volume of fluid vof is utilized to model the free surface flow the numerical model is validated against independent experimental data available in the literature the results provided evidence the capabilities of multidimensional modeling in predicting global hydrodynamics and local fluid dynamics features of asymmetric impacts moreover we demonstrate the importance of some fundamental methodological aspects such as the correct initialization of the computational domain the role of kinematic asymmetry in flow ventilation occurrence is

of great interest for ship design abrate 2011 and other engineering applications such as aerospace seddon and moatamedi 2006 and off shore structures faltinsen 1993 facci et al 2016 special attention has been given to the hull slamming phenomenon which usually occurs when a high speed planing boat hull or a sea plane impacts the water abrate 2011 faltinsen et al 2004 the generated fluid flow is quite complex and includes free surface piercing and deformation water sprays air entrainment and under some circumstances flow separation and ventilation judge et al 2004 shams et al 2015 all these aspects significantly influence the maneuvering characteristics as well as the hydrodynamic loading and consequently structural fatigue behavior of marine vessels gu and moan 2002 faltinsen et al 2004 silva and ravichandran 2012 a special case is represented by asymmetric impacts which are typical of heeled or yawed planing hulls and at high speeds can produce dynamic instability effects which still have to be fully understood judge et al 2004 impact asymmetry can also occur when any kind of vessel moves with multiple degrees of freedom into steep waves attempts of solving analytically the slamming problem were initially focused on the hydrodynamic load estimation for two dimensional wedge like vertical entry configurations von kármán 1929 wagner 1932 these early studies were then

1991 chekin 1989 are generally not meant to describe the asymmetry generated flow separation and ventilation most known experimental works on the water entry are also limited to symmetric impacts

qualitatively consistent behavior to the best of our knowledge a systematic validation of cfd models for different oblique entry configurations and an insight on the physical and geometrical parameters which influence the transition from non ventilating to ventilating flow are missing in the scientific literature this paper presents a detailed numerical study of a wedge like two dimensional section impacting water surface under a variety of geometrical and kinematic asymmetry conditions the simulations are performed through a vof based algorithm rider and kothe 1998 scardovelli and zaleski 1999 rusche 2002 coupled with a laplacian mesh motion solver jasak and tukovic 2007 jasak 2009 kassiotis 2008 already employed and validated for symmetric water entry problems facci et al 2015 facci and ubertini 2015 the paper is organized as follows the main features of the problem in study are described in section 2 then a focus on the numerical approach including details on the computational domain and numerical setup is given in section 3 1 in section 4 the methodology is validated by comparing present numerical results to literature experimental data judge et al 2004 the hydrodynamics related to the water impact is discussed in section 5 conclusions are drawn in section 6 2 problem statement in this paper we investigate the two dimensional hydrodynamics related to the asymmetric water impact of a rigid wedge through computational fluid dynamics cfd the problem is schematically represented in fig 1 which reports the relevant characteristics of the specimen and of the fluid flow the geometry of the wedge is defined in terms of its width l 0 20 m height h 0 08 m and dead rise angle β 37 such a geometry is selected to reproduce the experiments described by judge et al 2004 we hypothesize that the wedge breadth is much larger compared to l and to h such that the geometry and the hydrodynamics can be considered two dimensional jalalisendi et al 2015 a fixed cartesian reference frame is selected with the x axis along the horizontal direction i e along the water free surface and the y axis along the vertical direction the hull keel impacts on the water surface at the origin of the reference frame and at time t 0 s we denote with ε t the abscissa of the wedge keel and with ξ t its ordinate at time t the wedge kinematics is defined by its constant velocity v ε ξ being the superimposed dot the time derivative and by the constant roll angle θ the velocity ratio τ ε ξ quantitatively represents the kinematic asymmetry of the water entry and the angle θ represents the geometrical asymmetry we assume that the two fluids air and water are immiscible and the flow is incompressible thereafter the flow field is described by the mass conservation and momentum balance equations as follows 1a u 0 1b d ρ u d t p μ u ρ g where u is the fluid velocity p is the pressure μ is the dynamic viscosity ρ is the density g is the gravitational acceleration and d d t denotes the material derivative note that ρ and μ vary in space and time according to the fluid phase air or water in particular the air density and viscosity are ρ a 1 kg m3 and μ a 1 48 10 5 pa s respectively and the water density and viscosity are ρ w 1000 kg m3 and μ w 1 10 3 pa s respectively experimental observations show that for low τ and θ the flow remains attached on both sides of the wedge judge et al 2004 shams et al 2015 as qualitatively represented in fig 1a and the flow asymmetry is defined by the ratio b b 2 b 1 where b 1 and b 2 are the jet root abscissa on the lower and upper side of the wedge respectively as in judge et al 2004 from now on we will refer to such a flow as type a flow increasing the asymmetry i e decreasing b a cavity should appear on the upper side of the hull see fig 1b and the flow is denoted as type b flow judge et al 2004 the encompassing fluid reacts to the wedge motion generating a force that can be expressed as 2 f σ p i μ u u t n dς where i is the identity matrix σ is the hull surface and n is the unit normal to the hull we define the moment of f with respect to the wedge keel as 3 m σ d p i μ u u t n dς being d the position vector evaluated from the keel itself with reference to fig 1 the geometrical wetted length projection onto the undisturbed water line is defined as 4 l w ξ t 1 t a n β θ 1 t a n β θ considering l w and v as the impact characteristic length and velocity scales we define the following non dimensional force and moment coefficients 5 c f x 2 f x ρ w v 2 l w 6 c f y 2 f y ρ w v 2 l w 7 c m z 2 m z ρ w v 2 l w 2 with f x f y and m z being the force components and tilting moment per unit span respectively to study pressure variations during water entry we also introduce the following non dimensional pressure coefficient 8 c p 2 p p ρ w v 2 with p being the air pressure at ambient conditions finally we define the impact characteristic reynolds number as 9 r e ρ w v δ r e f μ w where δ r e f is a reference value of the keel penetration along the impact direction 3 methodology 3 1 numerical method we numerically study the flow induced by the wedge motion through a method based on a special vof implementation rider and kothe 1998 scardovelli and zaleski 1999 rusche 2002 that is included in the openfoam 2 4 cfd package openfoam 2015 similar applications of such a method are for instance facci et al 2015 2016 facci and ubertini 2015 cavalagli et al 2017 the incompressible flow of two immiscible fluids is modeled through a single set of the navier stokes and continuity equations see eq 1 the interface between the two phases is defined solving eq 10 rusche 2002 10 d α d t u r α 1 α 0 where α is the water volume fraction and u r is the relative velocity of the two phases the second term of eq 10 is introduced to compensate the numerical smearing of the fluid interface rusche 2002 equations 1 and 10 are discretized through a generalized unstructured finite volume approach with a collocated arrangement of all the flow variables ferziger and periç 2002 greenshields 2015a the pressure velocity coupling and the non linearity of eq 1 are solved using the pressure implicit with split operators piso algorithm issa 1985 keeping the original two stage pressure correction scheme for each time integration step δ t the discrete version of eq 10 is solved through the multidimensional universal limiter with explicit solution mules procedure greenshields 2015b the solution of eq 10 is sub cycled in four steps for each δ t and it is linearized using two additional steps of a fixed point iteration temporal integration is performed through the euler implicit method greenshields 2015b the gaussian integration with second order linear interpolation is adopted for all the spatial terms other than the convective ones for the latter a high resolution nvd scheme jasak et al 1999 is utilized to balance numerical stability and accuracy depending on the local flow conditions this scheme bridges the standard second order central differencing with first order upwind differencing by means of a specifically designed nonlinear function a smoothness factor γ controls the behavior of the bridging function where γ 0 corresponds to pure central differencing and γ 1 to the maximum boundedness level here we set γ 0 2 which means that central differencing is applied in most of the cases the motion of the wedge within the computational domain is obtained by reallocating the mesh nodes at each time step topology modifications are not allowed the grid deformation is performed using the laplace smoothing methodology jasak and tukovic 2007 jasak 2009 kassiotis 2008 assuming a diffusivity coefficient distribution that concentrates most of the deformation away from the wedge surface the linear systems of equations resulting from temporal and spatial discretization are solved using the geometric agglomerated algebraic multi grid gamg iterative algorithm for pressure and the gauss seidel method for other scalar quantities greenshields 2015b we comment that turbulence modeling is not required for the numerical solution of the hull slamming problem in fact the impulsive nature of the water entry related phenomena does not allow the development of a proper energy cascade as demonstrated by seng et al 2012 the same consideration applies also for three dimensional effects seng et al 2012 that may only derive from edge effects that can be safely discarded when the transversal dimension of the falling body is much larger than the other ones as we assume without loosing generality in the present study 3 2 domain discretization and boundary conditions a domain of dimensions 2m 2m is considered to minimize the effects of the imposed boundary conditions on the fluid flow in the vicinity of the hull the domain is discretized through the openfoam built in meshing tool snappyhexmesh which is able to generate unstructured but highly hexa dominant grids with optional layer generation at the solid surfaces regardless of the θ value all the employed meshes have the following common characteristics see fig 2 i a background spacing level which covers most of the domain ii a first refinement zone extending from the left to the right wall and including the falling wedge and the whole free surface iii a second refinement zone placed below the lower surfaces of the wedge and covering the free surface portion that is actually affected by the impact iv a third refinement zone represented by a 1 cm wide belt around the wedge v three low aspect ratio extrusion layers at the walls of the wedge 1 1 in single phase flows highly stretched wall layers are commonly introduced to solve boundary layers assuming that gradients in the wall normal direction are the most relevant ones in vof solvers stretched cells should be avoided as they tend to produce an inconsistently biased transport of the liquid volume fraction boundary conditions are set following the conclusions of previous computational studies facci et al 2015 2016 facci and ubertini 2015 the domain is considered as a tank with free slip walls and an open end on top table 1 summarizes the bc settings for pressure velocity and the liquid volume fraction α note that to avoid backflow phenomena the α bc at the open end changes its behavior depending on the flux direction 4 validation in this section we compare our numerical results with experimental measurements collected by judge et al 2004 on various asymmetric impact configurations table 2 shows the configurations considered for this validation stage in terms of the velocity ratio τ and rolling angle θ the impact velocity magnitude varies between 2 m s and 5 m s depending on the τ value judge 4 1 effects of grid refinement and initial conditions preliminary computations are made to check the effects of grid refinement and domain initialization at this point τ and θ are fixed to 0 75 and 26 respectively experimental evidence has shown that these values should produce a type b flow close to the transition from non ventilating to ventilating flow judge et al 2004 the simulations have been performed with three different computational grids each one characterized by a different minimum cell size in the belt region see table 3 the water free surface is initialized at 1 6 cm below the wedge keel and the specimen falls for 5 ms before impacting the water surface fig 3 a c show the time history of the forces and tilting moment per unit span for the three considered meshes up to 3 5 ms after the water impact and with a 0 25 ms sampling resolution for each mesh we calculate an average relative deviation parameter across the sampling interval which is defined as follows 11 δ ψ 100 1 n 1 i 1 n ψ i ψ i max ψ i min ψ i where n is the number of sampling points ψ is alternatively f x f y or m z and the overline operator represents the mean of the values predicted by all meshes at a given sampling point table 4 collects the deviation parameters for each mesh and force component evidencing that the overall dispersion is well below what would be typically desirable for experimental data sets in addition to the integral forces analysis we perform a local pressure coefficient monitoring over time at a given measuring point located on the high pressure side of the impacting wedge monitoring starts 5 ms before and ends 5 ms after the water impact fig 3d shows the c p time traces recorded for each mesh it highlights a close correspondence between the medium and fine cases instead the coarse mesh resolution seems not sufficient for the accurate description of the steep pressure raise that occurs right after the impact based on these considerations the medium mesh is assumed as the baseline option for all the subsequent simulations in addition to the effects of grid refinement we analyze the influence of the initial conditions on water impact hydrodynamics we call type i the initialization strategy already used for the grid analysis with the free surface placed at 1 6 cm below the keel of the wedge at the beginning of the simulation conversely we call type ii an alternative strategy with the keel placed exactly at the free surface when the simulation starts both air and water are at rest the latter besides being a rather common practice for the numerical simulation of water entry problems facci and ubertini 2015 facci et al 2015 seng et al 2012 might also be useful to save computational time in demanding scenarios such as very fast impacts and or three dimensional and complex geometrical configurations fig 4 represents the water free surface for three time steps after the impact obtained with the two initializations for τ 0 75 θ 26 such a configuration is ventilating type b flow according to the experiments in judge et al 2004 only type i initialization predicts the transition to type b flow in fact the air motion induced by falling wedge before the water entry has a crucial influence on the ventilation occurrence during the initial impact stage on the other hand type ii initialization assumes air is at rest at the impact time a rather unrealistic initial condition further tests with increased vertical pre impact paths 3 2 cm and 6 4 cm have shown no significant changes therefore we utilize type i initialization for all the configurations specifically we assume that the specimen falls for 5 ms before entering calm water for all configurations the distance of the wedge keel at the beginning of the simulation varies between 0 5 cm and 2 5 cm depending on the τ value we note that we mark the impact time with t 0 s therefore t represents the time after the water impact and t 0 s unequivocally identifies the impact time for all the configurations 4 2 comparison with experimental data the flow asymmetry ratio b is selected as the main validation parameter data sampling is made every 0 5 ms starting from water impact while following the approach suggested by judge et al 2004 the b value is determined from the average of 4 sequential samples as follows 12 b 1 4 j 3 7 b j where b j represents the j t h sample fig 5 shows b as a function of θ for three different values of τ present numerical results are compared with the experimental and numerical results in judge et al 2004 for τ 0 25 the numerical trends are very similar and both agree well with the experiments up to θ 22 for θ 22 the measured values seem to point faster towards b 0 which represents the flow transition from type a to type b for τ 0 5 our cfd simulations still well agree with the experimental trend including the correct prediction of type b flow occurrence at θ 30 on the other hand the numerical results from judge et al 2004 generally underpredict b but consistently capture the flow transition to type b the τ 0 75 graph is particularly interesting because it shows how for large impact asymmetries i e large τ and θ values the reduced order numerical method proposed by judge et al 2004 fails to correctly describe the wetted lengths ratio and the transition to ventilation on the low pressure side of the wedge this aspect is also commented in judge et al 2004 and represents one of the main motivations for the development of multidimensional simulation methods such as the one presented in our paper in fact for τ 0 75 the value of b calculated through cfd is coherent with experimental evaluations on the whole theta range in particular cfd correctly capture the transition from type a to type b flow further validation is provided by comparing the free surface evolution in cfd and experiments fig 6 shows type a and type b flow cases clearly highlighting that our computational model correctly predicts the pileup and the interface dynamics in particular for the non ventilating case cfd correctly predicts the height of the risen water on both sides of the wedge in the considered time interval such an aspect is particularly relevant for the hull slamming as it largely determines the position and the value of the pressure peak on the structure in the ventilating case cfd captures both the risen water height on the high pressure side of the wedge as well as the position and dimension of the air cavity on the low pressure side 5 numerical analysis of asymmetric impact in this section we leverage on cfd to dissect the hydrodynamics related to the asymmetric water impact in terms of hydrodynamic loading pressure field and free surface evolution specifically we seek to assess the relative effect of τ and θ on impact hydrodynamics 5 1 free surface dynamics the free surface dynamics and in particular the occurrence of flow separation are distinctive aspects of asymmetric water impact judge et al 2004 when the wedge enters the water the free surface warps and the water level is increased with respect to the undisturbed one such a deformation generates the well known pileup phenomenon that is widely studied for symmetric impacts wagner 1932 facci et al 2015 panciroli et al 2015b in case of asymmetric impacts the effective wetted length is different on the two sides of the wedge as already discussed in the previous section the flow asymmetry can be quantitatively assessed through the non dimensional ratio b reported in fig 5 therein it is shown that b is consistently reduced by increasing the geometrical asymmetry for all the non ventilating cases in fact for a fixed penetration the rotation of the wedge increases b 1 leaving substantially unchanged b 2 as depicted in fig 7 increasing the kinematic asymmetry also reduces b but the kinematic asymmetry has a weaker effect on b compared to θ both cfd and experiments demonstrate that for τ 0 a type b flow never occurs not even for θ as large as 30 for τ 0 5 type b flow is obtained only for θ 30 which is a very large geometrical asymmetry considered that β 37 finally for τ 0 75 a completely ventilating flow is detected for θ 26 both according to cfd and to experiments judge et al 2004 all these findings suggests that the ventilating cavity formation should be mostly dominated by the direction of the impact velocity relative to the geometrical symmetry axis in a perfectly symmetric impact the relative velocity is parallel to the symmetry axis of the wedge and two equally directed liquid jets are generated by the flow splitting at the keel if such parallelism is broken due to a rolling angle and or kinematic asymmetry one of the two jets will start aligning with the solid surface on the low pressure side at some point the jet will be ideally parallel to the low pressure side and further changes in the impact direction will produce favorable conditions for liquid flow separation with air entrainment for the given geometrical features of the wedge in study such conditions cannot be apparently reached with changes in the rolling angle only further details on the free surface evolution and on flow ventilation are gained from fig 7 which represents the free surface evolution through the water volume fraction as a function of t and θ for τ 0 75 we selected a case with a large kinematic asymmetry because it allows dissecting the transition from type a to type b flow by varying θ for low values of θ fig 7 a d the flow is completely attached to the wedge surface during the whole period of observation increasing the asymmetry fig 7 e h a small air cavity appears immediately after water impact the cavity suddenly closes and the flow reattaches as the penetration is increased for θ 30 the cavity does not close during the whole simulation and the transition to type b flow is completed as shown in fig 7 i l the role of kinematic asymmetry in promoting the transition to type b flow is also evidenced in fig 6 which shows that for τ 2 flow ventilation is already obtained for θ as low as 5 5 2 pressure field fig 8 shows the c p on the high pressure side of the wedge as a function of the non dimensional wetted length and of the flow configuration on the high pressure side c p exhibits a self similar behavior analogous to the symmetric impact pressure facci et al 2015 facci and ubertini 2015 panciroli et al 2015b therefore in fig 8 we systematically represent c p for a single time after the impact onset i e t 2 ms we comment that y ξ 1 corresponds to the wedge keel y ξ 0 identifies the intersection between the wedge and the undisturbed water level and y ξ 0 represents the pileup region the contour plots of the non dimensional pressure depicted in fig 9 for τ 0 75 and as a function of t and θ confirm the self similarity of the pressure on the high pressure side of the wedge note that in fig 9l the high pressure side of the wedge is already completely submerged see fig 7 thereafter there is no pressure peak on the wetted surface and self similarity with the contour plots depicted in fig 9 i k is not expected for all the considered combinations of θ and τ the pressure peak is located at the same non dimensional coordinate y ξ that corresponds to the jet root location as can be argued by comparing figs 9 7 the pressure peak is dramatically increased by increasing the geometrical asymmetry such an evidence can be interpreted noting that the larger is θ the lower is the effective deadrise angle and thus the larger is the pressure peak wagner 1932 fig 8 shows that the pressure is significantly reduced by increasing τ this is explained by considering that the pressure force represents the reaction of the displaced fluid to the acceleration imposed by the wedge added mass effect the velocity of increment of the displaced water is proportional to the vertical penetration velocity that in turn decreases by increasing τ see table 2 on the other hand the velocity scale selected for the definition of c p v is theoretically not influenced by the kinematic asymmetry experiments show only a minor reduction of v with τ increasing from 0 to 0 75 presumably caused by the increased friction on the experimental struts as a consequence c p is reduced by increasing the kinematic asymmetry fig 9 shows that the pressures field in the low pressure side of the wedge is not self similar in time in particular the partially ventilating configuration see fig 9e h is characterized by an evident low pressure zone close to the keel that exhibits a clearly unsteady behavior nevertheless to dissect the effects of kinematic and geometrical asymmetry in fig 10 we systematically represent c p on the low pressure side of the wedge as a function of τ and θ for t 2 ms when θ 13 τ has a minor impact on c p with a slight progressive pressure reduction in the proximity of the keel as τ increases this is presumably related to the increasing horizontal component of the water velocity relative to the wedge keel in these configurations the water flow is completely attached as for instance the one represented in fig 7 for larger θ and τ values the pressure drop becomes stronger and extends along the wedge surface by comparing fig 10 to figs 7 and 9 we note that such a low pressure zone is distinctive of a flow transition from type a to type b during this transition air is trapped on the low pressure side but without the formation of a fully ventilating cavity after the complete transition to type b flow that is for τ 0 75 and θ 26 the cavity is completely open and thus the pressure flattens towards the atmospheric pressure fig 11 displays the temporal evolution of c p on the low pressure side for τ 0 75 and should be evaluated together with figs 7 and 9 which show the free surface and two dimensional pressure contours dynamics under the same flow conditions for type a flow θ 9 and for completely developed type b flow θ 30 the variation of c p in time is insignificant on the other hand for θ 22 during the flow transition from type a to type b c p shows an unsteady behavior initially as shown in fig 7 the cavity is open and p p afterwards for t 2 ms the cavity closes see fig 7 and p is reduced below atmospheric pressure the linear dimension of the air cavity is initially larger and is gradually reduced compared to the wedge penetration the pressure within the closed air cavity does not vary significantly in time the dependence of the flow on the reynolds number is analyzed in fig 12 a and b for a type a to type b transitional configuration τ 0 75 θ 26 the different r e values are obtained by changing the impact velocity magnitude while δ r e f is kept constant to 8 10 3 m note that r e 16000 corresponds to the impact speed previously adopted for all the cases with τ 0 75 on the high pressure side the c p distribution reveals a substantial insensitivity to r e which again is consistent with previous findings on symmetrical impact wedge studies facci and ubertini 2015 the low pressure side shows a relatively weak dependence on the reynolds number thus indicating that viscous dissipation related to the large velocity gradients at the wedge keel concurs at the pressure reduction on the low pressure side for partially ventilating configurations 5 3 fluid forces the fluid force time history has been already shown in section 4 1 for a single combination of τ and θ to gain a better insight on how hydrodynamic loads are affected by the two types of asymmetry considered we adopt the non dimensional force coefficients introduced in section 2 it is worth to note that if the following fitting curves are used for f t and m t 13a f t a t 13b m t b t 2 the time dependence is effectively removed from the non dimensional coefficients definitions therefore coefficients are plotted as a function of τ and θ only horizontal force trends are reported in fig 13 a when the asymmetry is introduced a non zero horizontal force rises and points towards the negative x direction from the high to the low pressure side of the wedge such an horizontal force is generated by a pressure unbalance between the two sides of the wedge clearly visible from figs 8 10 we also comment that in the case of symmetric impact τ 0 and θ 0 and the numerical model correctly returns c f x 0 for all the τ values c f x increases with θ the trend is linear for θ 19 this situation corresponds to the flow configuration depicted in fig 7 a d that is for completely attached configurations notably in partially ventilating configurations the c f x is insensitive to τ this means that while on the high pressure side c p is reduced increasing τ see fig 8 on the low pressure side the size of the low pressure bubble increases as evidenced in fig 10 when the flow transition to type b is completed c f x suddenly decreases because as the cavity opens p p on the low pressure side as expected c f x increases with τ such a dependency is larger at low θ and saturates for θ 9 the vertical force coefficient is reported in fig 13b as a function of θ and τ the kinematic asymmetry has a minor impact on c f y only for τ 0 75 c f y is appreciably lower compared to the other cases on the contrary θ dominates the c f y behavior in fact the larger is θ the lower will be the effective deadrise angle on the pressure side of the wedge and in turn the larger is the wetted surface for a fixed penetration as evidenced in fig 7 the effect of the effective deadrise angle is coherent with symmetric impacts wagner 1932 in conclusion the vertical hydrodynamic force behavior for asymmetrical and symmetrical water impacts is similar being c f y largely determined by the pressure on the high pressure side of the wedge this can be explained by observing from figs 7 10 that not only c p but also the effective wetted area is much larger on the high pressure side of the wedge with respect to the low pressure one the c m z trends are shown in fig 13c for θ 19 the moment generation is largely dominated by the geometrical asymmetry and the effect of τ is negligible further increasing θ for partially ventilating flows there is a systematic drop in c m z followed by a recovery at higher θ values except for τ 0 such a recovery is much faster for τ 0 25 and τ 0 5 thus producing an increment of c m z at θ 30 of about 50 compared to the case with τ 0 75 this again could be related to the type b flow occurrence 6 conclusions in this paper the 2d hydrodynamics generated by the asymmetric water impact of a wedge like section was numerically investigated the free surface flow modeling is based on a finite volume vof implementation with a special numerical treatment to avoid artificial smearing of the air water interface across the computational domain the study was focused on the influence of geometrical and kinematic asymmetries on the impact hydrodynamics and includes a preliminary assessment on the adopted numerical setup the preliminary analysis showed a high sensitivity of the computed flow with respect to the numerical domain initialization more in details to correctly predict flow splitting at the keel a free path prior to water impact should be introduced this was found to be fundamental for the prediction of ventilation on the low pressure side of the wedge thus providing a useful information for the practical setup of such type of numerical simulations a comparison between cfd and experimental data available in literature demonstrated the reliability of the proposed numerical method in predicting the wetted lengths and the transition from non ventilating to ventilating flow conditions as functions of the kinematic and geometrical asymmetry the validated methodology was used to investigate fluid forces and pressure field variations with respect to the asymmetry angle θ and the kinematic asymmetry ratio τ the horizontal force generation strongly depends on the level of asymmetry introduced for θ 19 both parameters affect the horizontal force coefficient value while above this threshold the θ influence becomes largely dominant the vertical force coefficient appears to be weakly dependent on the kinematic asymmetry showing a nonlinear increase with θ and a nearly self similar trend for the considered τ values the tilting moment coefficient has a characteristic drop and recovery trend for τ 0 with the drop located approximately at θ 22 prior to the drop point there is very small τ dependence while after that the recovery is faster for lower τ values the slow recovery for τ 0 75 might be explained by transition to fully ventilated low pressure side the pressure distribution on the wedge surface is essentially self similar on the high pressure side which is consistent with previous theoretical and numerical findings on symmetric impact cases the low pressure side has a less predictable behavior due to the changes in the flow regime depending on the impact asymmetry level for small θ and τ the flow remains attached and with a pressure drop close to the keel at intermediate θ and τ the pressure drop becomes stronger and a dynamic flow separation reattachment process occurs when θ and τ get both large the separation dominates and the low pressure side becomes fully ventilated with a pressure recovery towards the atmospheric value the effect of r e is negligible on the high pressure side and appears to be relatively weak also on the low pressure side even for transitional configurations overall the hydrodynamic load characteristics of wedge like sections during asymmetric water entry seems to be mostly governed by the geometrical parameters of the impact which essentially determine vertical force and tilting moment coefficients the kinematic asymmetry is less important in the main integral force components generation but produces significant local fluid dynamics phenomena that may lead to sudden liquid flow separation and air entrainment on the low pressure side of the wedge future studies should be focused on coupled analysis of the fluid structure interaction for asymmetric

23737,this paper proposed an ais data based method of studying travel behavior of vessels when passing through a hotspot in a narrow waterway by building their trip information within this hotspot with trip information all trips in a hotspot can be divided into three categories inbound outbound and moored the last one refers to the trips that have ever stopped in a hotspot such stopping behavior is expected to be different from those directly passing through a hotspot without any stopping if not excluding these trips the revealed behavior pattern may be bias especially when considering speed distributions this proposed method was applied to the three hotspots in the sabine neches waterways snww identified through the analysis of vessel conflicts along the whole snww using ais data collected in the whole year of 2012 more than 10 of total vessel conflicts occurred within these three hotspots we also investigated the distributions of flow speeds and densities as well as their relationships at these hotspots respectively the findings reveal the travel patterns of inbound and outbound trips passing these three hotspots in the snww considering the heterogeneous behavior of different types of vessels these revealed patterns also help examine the risk of vessel collisions at these three spots respectively keywords travel behavior hotspot ais data narrow waterway 1 introduction since 2002 new ships and all sea going vessels that have 300 gross tons or more as well as all passenger vessels are required to equip an automatic identification system ais on board the ais transmits the sailing status information between vessels and from vessels to shore or vice versa therefore ais helps vessels see each other in the channel and the waterway management agency can also monitor the status of vessels the ais data contains the detailed and consecutive temporal and spatial information of a vessel as well as real maneuvering behavior of a vessel such as speed course etc for this reason recently ais data are widely used in the waterway transportation research including the risk analysis of vessel collisions vessel travel behavior etc in many existing models it is important to know vessel behavior and the interactions between vessels since ais data provides the navigation details of vessels the relative speed angle and distance can be revealed between two vessels such information about vessel interaction serves as input to many models mou et al 2010 developed linear regression models based on ais data to evaluate the risk of vessel collisions in the north sea off the port of rotterdam based on two indicators closest point of approach cpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa between two vessels these two factors well reflect the risk of vessel collisions in a given waterway if the cpa between two vessels are small then the risk level is high for these two vessels to collide each other using ais data weng et al 2014a 2014b investigated the frequency of vessel conflicts in singapore straits which occurs when one vessel enters or will enter the domain of another in a short time 30 s if neither change their behavior they defined a vessel s domain as a circle with three times of this vessel s length actually the definition of a vessel s domain varies in the literature fujii and tanaka 1971 defined an elliptical domain where the major and minor radii are 4 and 1 6 times of the length of the vessel respectively and qu et al 2011 proposed the fuzzy quaternion ship domain kujala et al 2009 developed a collision model to study the risk of vessel collisions and groundings in the gulf of finland requiring the information of relative speeds between vessels montewka et al 2010 developed models to calculate the probability of three types of vessel collisions overtaking head on and crossing where information of vessel interaction is required zhang et al 2015 proposed a vessel conflict ranking operator vcro model which is based on a survey among maritime experts to rank the risk of various situations about the interaction between two vessels relative speed angle and distance ais data can be also used to investigate the travel behavior of vessels at waterways compared with numerous studies of vehicles travel behavior in highways only a few look at the travel behavior of vessels in waterways for example xiao et al 2015 investigated the travel behavior of vessels at two spots one is near the port of rotterdam and another is near shanghai based on ais data they studied the distributions of vessel speeds courses and arrival time intervals especially for containers different types of vessels vary significantly in size speed and maneuvering behavior therefore they particularly studied the behavior of containers on the other hand unlike vehicles behavior in highways at some locations in a narrow and busy waterway some vessels may temporarily stop i e moored while others are still moving especially when there are many big ships moving in the channel the travel behavior of those moored vessels is expected to be quite different from those directly passing through without stopping therefore the flow of vessels is expected not to be as homogenous as that of vehicles in highways if focusing on the travel behavior of in motion vessels at a hotspot it is necessary to exclude those which have stopped in this spot when passing through meanwhile the ais records vessels real status i e spot speeds courses etc xiao et al 2015 employed the speeds and courses of vessels when crossing the border line of the section of interest however the status at one point may not be able to fully represent the whole situation when passing through the section of interest this paper aims to develop a novel framework of studying the travel behavior of vessels in given hotspots of narrow waterways first we are particularly interested in hotspots located in narrow inland waterways different from open ocean ships must strictly follow channels in inland waterways such as the sabine neches waterways snww houston ship channel due to the constraint of draft the channel was drudged out from a natural river for holding big ships therefore this type of inland waterways is like highways especially two lane highways this is one of the motivation of this paper whether we can use the highway flow theory to investigate the travel behavior in waterways however note that the intersection of waterways is different from that of highways no signal or stop sign for this reason the hotspots studied in this paper are not located in any intersection of waterways second this paper particularly focuses on the travel behavior of in motion vessels different from vehicles in a highway vessels have more freedom to be moored along a waterway therefore this paper proposed a method to separate the moored vessels from those in motion i e those directly passing through a spot without stopping when studying vessels travel behavior note that a hotspot is not a single point but a short section in a channel so it is important to look at the entire travel behavior of a vessel when it passes through the entire section third the behavior of some types of vessels that dominate the flow is further studied by doing these the behavior of vessels can be more accurately modeled and the impacts of those dominating vessel types can be better understood the hotspots can be determined according to the frequency of conflicts between big vessels i e the frequency that a vessel enters the domain of another in this paper the hotspots found in the snww see fig 1 will be used as the example of the case study in our previous study on the snww it was found that the frequency of vessel conflicts in several locations see fig 2 a b is consistently high by using various models as well as the ais data in different months wu et al 2016 the frequency of vessel conflicts only reflects the phenomena or more precisely the results of vessels behavior pattern in these hotspots with the known hotspots in the snww this paper uses the snww as a case study to investigate vessels travel behavior the snww are the major waterway in southeast texas see fig 1 a which is known as the energy gateway to the u s the snww connect the port of beaumont as well as the ports of port arthur and orange with the gulf of mexico the waterways serve four refineries and many chemical plants located along the waterway from 2002 to 2006 the import of crude oil through this waterway comprises 12 of the u s and 18 of western gulf coast imports usace 2010 as shown in fig 1 b the major route of the snww goes from the port of beaumont to the gulf via neches river and jettied entrance channel the channel is 40 ft 12 2 m deep and 400 ft 122 m wide in the section of neches river and 42 ft 13 m deep and 500 800 ft 152 244 m wide in the jettied entrance channel having the capacity for oil tankers and other big vessels in the snww big vessels usually refer to tankers and cargos up to 100 000 tons they are much larger compared with barges tugs these four types of vessels consist of around 95 of all vessels in the snww the second route goes to the port of orange in the northeast via sabine river which is 30 ft 9 m deep and 200 ft 61 m wide usace 2010 to the southwest the channel extends to galveston via the gulf intracoastal waterway giww there are two intersections in the snww as shown in fig 1 b the snww are narrow but busy waterways according to the historical data there is an average of 2 3 vessel collisions and 1 grounding per year setwac 2013 collisions in the snww are more dangerous than groundings because groundings in the snww are primarily soft wu et al 2014 based on the collected ais data in two months our previous research wu et al 2016 studied the frequency of big vessels conflicts in the snww which is defined as the case that one vessel at least 20 m enters the domain of another at least 50 m two types of domains were used respectively circular or elliptical domains and three types of vessel conflicts were considered head on overtaking and crossing a vessel conflict represents a kind of potential risk of vessel collision therefore the higher the frequency at one location the higher the risk of vessel collisions at this location along the snww this study identifies six hotspots each of which saw at least 4 of all vessel conflicts in the snww it was found that based on either circular or elliptical domains the locations of hotspots were almost the same for different types of vessel conflicts in different months fig 2 a b shows the locations of six hotspots considering crossing conflicts the most common conflicts based on the ais data in march 2012 readers are referred to wu et al 2016 for the details of the theories and procedure of identifying hotspots as well as more results of the hotspot identification vessel conflict ranking operator vcro model developed by zhang et al 2015 was also employed to identify hotspots of vessel collision risk in the snww wu et al 2016 interestingly it was also found that hotspots identified by this model are almost the same to the ones aforementioned especially for hotspots 1 2 and 6 shown in fig 2 a b they are neither at the intersection of two channels as hotspot 5 in fig 2 a b nor close to the major ports as hotspots 3 and 4 in fig 2 a b as mentioned above the intersection of waterways is quite different from that of highway neither signal nor stop sign is provided meanwhile these three hotspots have quite straight channels making it easier in modeling therefore we are particularly interested in the travel behavior pattern of vessels that pass these three hotspots especially from a microscopic viewpoint moreover this paper aims to build a common methodological framework of studying vessels travel behavior in narrow waterways note that for convenience of description hotspot 6 shown in fig 2 a b is renamed to be hotspot 3 in the following text see fig 2 c the reminder of this article is organized as follows section 2 gives the methodological framework used to investigate vessels behavior in narrow and busy waterways section 3 analyzes the distributions of trips with the consideration of vessel types section 4 analyzes the distributions of travel speeds in these hotspots section 5 analyzes the density of vessels as well as the relationship between speed and density at these hotspots and section 6 concludes the paper 2 methodology 2 1 trip information building the ais data used in this paper are from the website of marinecadastre gov http marinecadastre gov this paper uses the ais data collected in the snww in each month of 2012 each record represents a vessel s status the location longitude and latitude timestamp as accurate as second speed over ground sog course over ground cog heading rate one turn rot voyage id vessel id maritime mobile service identity i e mmsi etc the information of vessels and voyages such as vessel length type voyage destination and starting time is also available 2 1 1 calculation of trips mean speeds the ais gives the discrete status of a vessel in navigation to investigate the travel behavior of a vessel when it runs through a hotspot section one point of status may not be enough therefore it is necessary to build a vessel s trip information that covers all ais reported points within the spot however since the time interval between two ais records is around 1 min the exact entering and leaving time may not be available directly for this reason the first record after a vessel enters the spot is regarded as the starting point and last record before it leaves the spot as the ending point as demonstrated in fig 3 with the starting and ending times locations a trip s time interval and distance can be revealed respectively the time interval is the time period between the timestamps of the first and last points and the distance is the sum of the lengths between each of two consecutive points within a hotspot as shown in equations 1 and 2 1 δ t i j t i j s t i j r 2 d i j k 1 n i j 1 l i j k k 1 where δ t i j and d i j refer to the time interval and distance of trip i within hotspot j t i j r and t i j s are the first and last timestamp of trip i within hotspot j l i j k k 1 is the distance between two consecutive points the k th and k 1st points and n i j is the number of points of trip i within hotspot j some of these notations are also illustrated in fig 3 note that usually the time interval between two consecutive ais records of one vessel should be around 1 min if it is more than 3 min we should consider it as a new trip with the information of a trip s time interval and distance the mean travel speed of a trip can be defined as 3 u i j d i j δ t i j where u i j is the mean speed of trip i within hotspot j equation 3 indicates that it is a space mean speed on the other hand the time mean speed is the average of all speed records of this trip within this hotspot this paper employs the former space mean speed which is also usually used in highway traffic analysis 2 1 2 identification of moored trips trips within a hotspot can be divided into three categories inbound outbound and moored as discussed in section 1 when studying vessels travel behavior it is necessary to exclude the vessels that stop in the channel because their speed distributions are quite different from those passing through directly with ais data the direction of a trip can be also easily determined since the hotspot is almost a straight section see fig 3 if a vessel directly passes through this hotspot its heading should not change largely in other words the values of longitude or latitude or both should change monotonically for example if the latitude values increase monotonically the trip must be northbound or if the longitude values decrease monotonically the trip is westbound otherwise if their change is not monotone it implies that a vessel may make a turn even a u turn or just fluctuate around a place this is a sign of moored trips because a vessel cannot stay moored for a long time in the middle of channel fig 4 a shows the example of two trips ais data within hotspot 2 one is a trip that directly passed through the hotspot apparently the change of longitudes of three points from west to east is monotone and another is a moored trip fig 4 b shows the details of the ais data when moored lots of turns can be seen and the ais data look random note that a trip s courses can be also used to determine whether a trip is moored or not given a straight channel the ais data also include the information of course and heading since it is inland waterway and the travel speed is low a trip s course is close to its heading if its courses at all recorded points in a hotspot are close it implies that the trip went through the hotspot directly otherwise it was moored therefore in our study the identification of moored trips is not based on the time span when a vessel stays in a hotspot but by checking its moving tracks the reason is that we focus on the travel behavior of vessels those directly passing through a hotspot apparently behave very differently from those making turns therefore a vessel s trip will not be labeled as moored even if it stayed in a hotspot for a long time but not found making a turn in the channel by tracking its spatial locations however this trip will be regarded as an outlier and be excluded when analyzing the speed distribution see section 4 2 1 3 determination of hotspot density on the other hand for trip i within hotspot j given two time stamps t i j r and t i j s we can determine the number of vessels being in hotspot j when trip i was passing this hotspot by checking the time windows of all trips that passed through this spot in this paper a vessel encountering another in one hotspot means that both are in this spot at the same time they could be moving in opposite direction or the same direction or one is moving and another is moored note that a hotspot is not a point but a small section and here encountering does not necessarily mean that two are moving toward for example we have divided the entire snww into 397 small sections the length of one section is 1 5 km this distance is arbitrarily set the identification of hotspots is based on the analysis of vessel conflict frequency in each section wu et al 2016 then within hotspot j trip i encountered trip h note h i if at least one of the following three conditions is satisfied 4 t i j r t h j r t i j s 5 t i j r t h j s t i j s 6 t h j r t i j r and t h j s t i j s condition 4 or 5 means that when trip h enters or leaves hotspot j trip i is in that spot and condition 6 indicates that trip h stays in hotspot j moored or moving in a slower speed when trip i goes through this spot for a vessel passing through a hotspot the total number of vessels it encountered in this hotspot indicates the density of this spot when it goes through 2 2 methodological framework as discussed in section 1 it is important to exclude those trips which have stopped when studying the travel behavior of in motion vessels a moored trip refers to a trip where the vessel has stopped for a while in a hotspot when passing through it in the following we discuss how to identify moored trips based on ais data of vessels see section 2 3 on the other hand for a narrow waterway it is necessary to consider the direction of movement so non moored trips are divided into inbound and outbound trips respectively since the ais reports the information of vessel types it is possible to investigate the general travel behavior of different vessel types especially those types that dominate the flow so that we can see how these dominating vessel types impact the entire flow of vessels in a waterway the information of trips within a given hotspot makes it possible to analyze the distributions of trips speeds and surrounding density respectively which can help better understand vessels travel behavior moreover this information also makes it possible to investigate the relationship between speed and density in a hotspot of interest fig 5 demonstrates this methodological framework in the following this framework will be employed to analyze the travel behavior of vessels in the snww based on the ais data collected in the entire year of 2012 3 analysis of trips in the case of the snww the traffic is regarded as outbound if it moves closer to the gulf of mexico and inbound if it moves closer to the port of beaumont therefore at spots 1 and 3 see fig 2 c northbound traffic is inbound while at spot 2 westbound traffic is inbound the ais data of the entire year of 2012 were used to investigate vessels travel behavior in these three hotspots as shown in fig 2 c the length of each hotspot is 1 500 m in the whole year of 2012 1864 1 376 and 1 302 vessels were found passing these three hotspots respectively having 1 757 815 1 172 331 and 2 899 058 records at these three spots respectively the following analysis is based on these records 3 1 vessels passing through hotspots directly fig 6 reports the monthly numbers of vessels in each direction inbound outbound and moored at three hotspots respectively it is seen that hotspot 1 had more traffic than hotspots 2 and 3 because the channel at hotspot 1 also serves the traffic along the gulf intracoastal waterway giww which extends to the port of orange to the northeast and further east to florida and southwest to brownsville tx barges towing vessels are the major vessels in the giww big ships cannot run in the giww moreover it is seen that the change of traffic from month to month is small well indicating that the traffic in the snww is quite stable over time it is seen from fig 6 that at all three hotspots the number of vessels in two directions were almost identical the distributions of vessel types in the inbound and outbound traffic at three hotspots were also investigated respectively as reported in fig 7 at hotspot 1 towing vessels and tankers 35 and 40 of the total respectively were two major types of vessels while at hotspots 2 and 3 the numbers of towing vessels are much less and consequently making tankers the majority 60 70 of the total the reason is that spot 1 is in the channel shared by the giww and snww and as aforementioned the former is primary for towing vessels 3 2 vessels moored in hotspots as shown in fig 6 lots of vessels were moored in three hotspots fig 8 further shows the vessel type distributions for moored vessels at these three spots respectively it is seen that at spots 1 and 2 the number of moored vessels were much larger than those directly passed through on the other hand spot 3 has less number of moored vessels at all three spots most moored vessels were towing vessels and harbor tugs indicating that flow of these towing vessels and tugs may be frequently interrupted for example in march 2012 there are totally 450 vessels moored at hotspot 1 254 towing vessels 95 harbor tugs 7 cargos and 18 tankers on the other hand during the same time totally 293 vessels 68 towing vessels 13 harbor tugs 31 cargos and 121 tankers directly passed through this hotspot without stopping in both directions therefore it is seen that the movement of towing vessels and harbor tugs are more likely to be interrupted this is reasonable as compared with cargos and tankers these two are relatively small and easier to maneuver also they have much smaller drafts moreover note that harbor tugs are usually used for helping maneuver big ships in the channel e g sometimes they may work as the brake for tankers in some sections of the channel fig 8 reports the factions of four major type of vessels that were moored this fraction is based on the number of all vessels in the hotspot during a month note that three hotspots have different number of vessels see fig 6 so we particularly investigated the means standard deviations and medians of the numbers of different type of moored vessels based on each month s data in 2012 the results are reported in table 1 moreover table 1 also reports the statistical summary of the fractions of moored vessels in each type interestingly it is seen that the numbers of moored tankers are almost the same at all hotspots moreover for tankers the standard deviations are small implying that the month by month fluctuation is also small this reflect the flow of tankers in the snww is well planned which is based on the oil demands of each refinery along the waterway on the other hand it is seen that the number fraction of moored towing vessels and harbor tugs vary largely at different hotspots however the standard deviations are small at all hotspots still implying the travel pattern is quite stable month by month most of towing vessels and harbor tugs were moored at hotspots 1 and 2 by checking the photos of these three hotspots all hotspots have several berths on the west side of channel especially at hotspot 1 there are four docks specially for tankers this is the reason why hotspot 1 has much larger number of moored harbor tugs which help tankers mooring moreover tugs are also used to help control big tankers course and speed when they move southbound toward the gulf given that tankers need to make a sharp turn ahead at the first intersection see fig 1 the above analysis shows that the number of moored tankers is independent from the location therefore this paper will particularly study the travel behavior of tankers given that 1 they account for a large number of vessels in the traffic and 2 the number of moored tankers is almost independent from the locations moreover tankers play an important role in the snww as they serve lots of refineries and chemical plants figs 6 8 summarize the macroscopic travel patterns of all vessels at three hotspots respectively this information is not enough yet to understand vessels travel behavior at these spots in the following this paper will further investigate the travel speed distributions and density at these three spots 4 analysis of travel speed section 3 built and analyzed the information of trips at each spot each trip s mean speed is calculated from the time interval and distance of this trip within a hotspot see equation 3 therefore it is actually a space mean speed normally used in highway traffic flow theory in the following for brevity the space mean speed of a trip is just called speed of a trip as discussed in the first section to better describe the speed distribution of all trips in each direction the moored trips were not considered here given their average speed were almost 0 moreover it is usually necessary to remove outliers before analyzing speed distributions because 1 some speeds are very close to 0 probably due to the vessels which are about to stop or very large probably due to data error to define outliers an interquartile range iqr is needed which is the difference between the third and first quartiles of the dataset and then a record is regarded to be an outlier if it is less than the value of the first quartile minus the iqr multiplied by 1 5 or greater than the value of the third quartile plus the iqr multiplied by 1 5 montgomery et al 2010 at each hotspot the speed data for each direction in or outbound are ready for the following analysis after removing the outliers the study of travel speed should include at least two components 1 general statistical analysis and 2 speed distribution analysis first table 2 reports the statistical summary of the speeds of inbound and outbound trips at three spots respectively considering the trips of all vessels or tankers only respectively it is seen that generally the speed is low considering the general flow of all vessels even the 99th percentiles of speeds were less than 12 knots at hotspots 1 and 3 and less than 10 knots at hotspot 2 in all cases the means are close to medians indicating that the distribution is not heavily skewed to verify this point the skewness of each distribution was calculated and reported in table 2 the skewness is generally small and most of them are just slightly positively skewed further one sample kolmogorov smirnov k s tests were employed to test the normality using the default significant level of 0 05 of speed distribution after normalizing all speed data for each direction at each hotspot unexpectedly for the general flow covering all vessels it is seen that at hotspots 1 and 2 none of the speeds are normally distributed if only considering trips made by tankers at hotspots 1 and 2 only the speeds of the outbound flow are normally distributed these results are different from the results of the case study from xiao et al 2015 where normal distributions were found to be common however at hotspot 3 the speed distributions are all normal for general trips or tanker trips note that based on fig 2 it is seen that at hotspot 3 tankers and cargos dominate the vessel flow they are both large ships therefore the vessel flow seems more homogenous on the other hand the flow at hotspot 1 is relatively heterogenous as the proportions of tankers and towing vessels are both large and they are quite different from each other even though tankers also dominate the flow at hotspot 2 since hotspot 2 is close to some docks of some refineries the travel behavior of tankers can be more complex compared with that at hotspot 3 where tankers have relative high speeds when going through see table 2 interestingly it is found that at hotspots 1 and 2 the speeds of outbound tankers are normally distributed while the northbound are not note that outbound tankers are unloaded so their drafts are less and their travel behavior can be more normal having smaller speed variances while for loaded tankers in narrow channels their travel behavior can vary largely depending on more external factors so their speed variances are much larger see table 2 to further investigate the speed distributions of inbound and outbound trips at three hotspots we plotted these distributions in fig 9 and further fit these speeds using various distributions totally 61 distributions were checked conducted by easyfitxl still based on the k s tests the distributions with p values greater than 0 05 as the default significant level were kept for each direction up to two best fitted distributions based on p values were shown in fig 9 3 distributions were reported for outbound tankers at hotspot 2 and the p value of each fitted distribution up to three was reported in table 3 note that a set of data may fit well into different types of distributions please refer to the appendix at the end of this paper for the detailed probability density function pdf of each fitted distribution as well as the fitted values of these pdfs parameters by fitting it is found that the generalized extreme value gev distribution fits almost all speed distributions at all three hotspots at least their p values are greater than 0 05 except inbound general trips for all types of vessels at hotspot 1 equation 7 gives the probability density function pdf of a gev distribution which has three parameters shape parameter k scale parameter σ and location parameter μ 7 f x 1 σ e x p 1 k z 1 k 1 k z 1 1 k where z x μ σ please refer to the appendix at the end of this paper for the fitted values of parameters k σ and μ in different cases the findings show that the gev distribution may be good to reflect the speed distributions of vessel flows made up of different types of vessels such as tankers towing vessels and other small vessels i e good in reflecting the speed distribution of flows consisting of vessels that behave heterogeneously in travel also as found in table 2 through the one sample k s tests only at hotspot 3 all speeds can be also regarded to be normally distributed while at hotspots 1 and 2 only outbound tankers have normally distributed speeds it is seen that the speed distributions at hotspot 3 differ from those at hotspots 1 and 2 two sample k s tests were employed to investigate whether the general vessel speed distribitions are significant different from those of tankers at each hotspot and the results were reported in table 4 interestingly it is seen that at hotspot 3 the speeds of the general flows and those of tankers in the same direction can be regarded as identically distributed using 0 05 as the significant level however on the other hand at hotspots 1 and 2 the p values show that they are significantly different indicating at these two spots the flows are heterogeneous the speed distributions of tankers may be very different from those of other types of vessels or even one tanker s speed distribution could vary significantly from one to another 5 analysis of vessel density 5 1 density distribution the revealed trip information makes it possible to study the density of vessels at hotspots as discussed in section 2 1 in this paper the density at a hotspot simply refers to the number of vessels at this spot when there was a vessel passing through it because the hotspots have the same length 1 500 km this information is important because it is related to the risk of collisions note that the identification of hotspots depends on the frequency of vessel conflicts which occur when one vessel enters the domain of another wu et al 2016 when it went through a hotspot a vessel may encounter other vessels in three types of status moored running through in the opposite direction or in the same direction first during the time when a vessel passed through a hotspot without stopping the total number of vessels including this vessel itself at this hotspot can be regarded as vessel density if taking a hotspot as a unit note that such number includes the number of moored vessels to better reflect the risk the number of in motion vessels in each direction should be also identified fig 10 reports the distribution of vessel density for all inbound or outbound trips at each hotspot for the general flows considering all vessels as well as the flows of tankers respectively for example 22 6 or 22 7 of vessels in their inbound trips saw 3 or 4 other vessels at hotspot 1 in the whole year of 2012 respectively i e 4 or 5 in total including itself it is seen that at hotspot 1 it is most likely for a vessel 45 and 49 chances for inbound and outbound trips respectively to encounter 3 4 other vessels i e 4 5 vessels in total at hotspot 2 around 62 chance for a vessel inbound or outbound to encounter 2 3 other vessels i e 3 4 vessels in total and at hotspot 3 around 50 chance for a vessel to encounter 4 7 other vessels i e totally 5 8 vessels as reported in fig 6 hotspot 1 has the largest number of vessels passing and hotspot 3 has the least however interestingly hotspot 3 seems to be more congested fig 10 also reports that the number of vessels that a tanker encountered when it ran through a hotspot it is seen that at each hotspot the distribution of such numbers is quite close to that of the numbers of vessels that a general vessel encountered again two sample k s tests were used to check whether they are identically distributed and the p values were reported in table 5 these p values are quite close to 1 indicating that at each hotspot the number of vessels that a tanker could encounter are identically distributed with those that a general vessel could encounter when passing through this hotspot such findings show that unlike the heterogeneous speed distributions at hotspots 1 and 2 see section 4 the density distributions are similar for different types of vessels when they pass each hotspot implying that the density is independent of vessel types 5 2 density of in motion vessels the above analysis looks at the number of all vessels including those moored considering the risk of vessel collisions it is more critical to know the number of in motion vessels that a vessel may encounter when it passes through a hotspot therefore in this section we particularly investigate the distributions of the numbers of in motion vessels that a vessel would encounter when it passed through a hotspot given the narrow waterway and small length of a hotspot if there are more than one vessel especially if at least one is a big ship moving at the same time at the same spot the risk of vessel collision would be high as to the in motion vessels two directions are considered moving in the same or opposing direction these two directions correspond to the risk of overtaking and head on collisions respectively the distributions of the numbers of in motion vessels were reported in fig 11 clearly it is seen that even though it is most likely for a vessel to encounter more than one other vessel when it ran through a hotspot see fig 10 most of them were actually moored as reported in fig 11 at each hotspot less than 10 chance for a vessel or a tanker to encounter another one also in motion either in the same direction or opposing direction further it is seen that even though hotspot 3 was found to be the most congested among three spots a vessel is less likely to see another in motion vessel at the same time compared with the cases at hotspots 1 and 2 also it is seen that at hotspots 1 and 2 compared with those outbound vessels inbound vessels has three times higher chance to encounter another moving in the opposing direction about 9 v s 3 as to tankers at hotspots 1 and 2 inbound ones still have higher chance to encounter another moving in the opposing direction about 4 v s 2 at hotspot 1 and about 8 v s 2 at hotspot 2 it implies that the head on collision risk for inbound trips is relatively larger than those outbound trips at hotspots 1 and 2 at hotspot 1 such risk for tankers may be a little bit smaller compared with the average risk considering all types of vessels about 4 v s 9 but at hotspot 2 such risk for tankers are almost the same to the average risk about 9 on the other hand overtaking collision risk is relatively smaller at these two hotspots in the worst case about 5 of outbound vessels would see another moving in the same direction at hotspot 1 and only 2 3 for other cases while for tankers in the worst case 8 of outbound tankers would have another vessel moving in the same direction at hotspot 2 and only 1 4 for other cases by comparing figs 10 and 11 it is seen that even though hotspot 3 is a little bit more congested than the other two most vessels encountered by an in motion vessel there are actually moored therefore this congestion is actually caused by moored vessels however as shown in fig 6 hotspot 3 had the least number of moored vessels among three hotspots as discussed in section 3 2 it is seen that all hotspots have several berths available for big vessels hotspot 1 has four tanker docks and hotspot 2 and 3 also have several docks for marine services hotspot 3 also has a us coast guard station nearby interestingly it seems that the number of berths at hotspot 3 is no more than that at hotspots 2 but fig 10 shows that an in motion vessel is more likely to encounter other vessels most are moored as discussed above in hotspot 3 from figs 7 and 8 it is seen that tankers plus some cargos accounted for over 90 of vessels that directly went through hotspot 3 but most moored vessels were towing vessels and harbor tugs therefore it implies that some auxiliary vessels e g tugs were nearby when a tanker went through hotspot 3 note that the channel at hotspot 3 is much wider and deeper than that at other two hotspots 5 3 relation between speed and density the above two sections investigate the distributions of speeds and densities at three hotspots respectively in highway engineering some famous models were proposed to describe the relationship between traffic speed and density such as greenshields et al s model 1935 greenberg s model 1959 underwood s model 1961 etc however based on the authors best knowledge the fundamental relationship between traffic speed and density in narrow waterways is not investigated yet in the literature in the following for the general flow of all types of vessels and flow of tankers the distributions of speeds mean median 25 and 75 percentiles were plotted in figs 12 and 13 respectively against the total number of vessels as density defined in section 5 1 present in the hotspot note that the figures only report the density levels where there are at least 10 speed records with the distributions of medians 25 and 75 percentiles of speeds it is easier to see how the speeds were distributed at each density level interestingly based on the collected ais data it is seen that the number of vessels in each hotspot did not have apparent impact on vessel speed i e the speed does not have an apparent change when the vessel density level changes for either general trips or tanker trips in all cases the widths of 50 of speed distributions were just about 2 knots for example for inbound trips at hotspot 1 50 of speeds were between around 5 and 7 knots when the number of vessels are no more than 5 as reported in fig 11 at each hotspot most vessels encounter by a passing through vessel were actually moored at this hotspot in most cases a vessel would see at most another one in motion vessel when it ran through a hotspot it is probably the reason why the density of vessels at a hotspot did not significantly impact the vessel s speeds the nearly flat curves imply that the speeds at three hotspots are free flow speeds i e the speeds are not impacted by the density generally the three hotspots did not suffer from serious traffic congestion instead the speed largely depends on the location and direction the speed at hotspot 3 is much higher than hotspots 1 and 2 and outbound tankers unloaded have higher speeds than inbound tankers loaded 6 discussion and conclusions this paper proposed a novel ais data based methodological framework to investigate the vessels travel behavior in hotspots of a narrow and busy waterway this method looks at the entire behavior of a vessel when passing a hotspot a small section not a point therefore the behavior is analyzed based on trips rather than directly using the ais reported spot status especially this method excludes the vessels which have ever stopped in the hotspots because the behavior of those moored vessel can be quite different from that of the vessels directly passing through in many existing studies the risk of vessel collisions is usually investigated based on 1 the ship domain theory sdt which looks at the frequency when a vessel s domain is intruded by other vessels called vessel conflict by analyzing the ais data e g see mou et al 2010 weng et al 2014a wu et al 2016 etc or 2 vessels relative behavior plus expert judgement e g zhang et al 2015 etc or 3 probability theory and bayesian method e g fujii and tanaka 1971 macduff 1974 otto and pedersen 2002 etc these studies look at two vessels relative measures such as relative speed distance and angle in the channel based on ais data and or experts judgements based on different scenarios these methods estimate the risk from a macroscopic or mesoscopic viewpoint this paper on the other hand aims to investigate the vessels travel behavior from a microscopic viewpoint at specific locations using the methods applied in highway traffic flow by revealing the behavior pattern of vessels at some hotspots which are regarded to be more vulnerable to vessel collisions the vessel collision risk may be better understood for example our previous studies identified several high risky hotspots in the snww by analyzing the frequency of vessel conflict but the analysis of the speed density relationship shows that pilots actually do not slow down when a vessel conflict occurs even riding on a big tanker an important reason may be that many vessel conflicts occur when a vessel passes a moored vessel this microscopic analysis can be regarded as a supplement to the macroscopic and mesoscopic level vessel risk analysis particularly this paper proposed to separate moored vessels from those keeping running in their courses because different from highway traffic there are many moored vessels in narrow inland waterways based on our best knowledge previous studies do not consider the impacts of these moored vessels when evaluating the risk of vessel collisions on the other hand the studies of travel behavior of vessels in a channel found that the vessels behavior is different from the pattern of vehicles in highways this study helps us better understand the vessels travel behavior in narrow and busy waterways the findings of this paper based on the ais data collected in these three hotspots were summarized as follows considering the general flow of all types of vessels the speeds of vessel flows are not normally distributed if the flow is mixed by different types of vessels that behave heterogeneously it is found that gev distributions are good in representing the speed distribution of a heterogeneous flow on the other hand the speeds of a flow of a single type of vessels usually are normally distributed at three hotspots the density distribution is independent of the type of vessels that passed through in more than 90 of cases in the snww when passing through a hotspot a vessel would encounter only one in motion vessel i e the vessels that do not stop within this hotspot when passing through in the same or opposing direction the density of vessels in a hotspot seems to have litter impact on the speed distributions in other words it seems that the speed distribution in a narrow and busy waterway is almost independent from the density level of this hotspot it indicates that the snww actually does not suffer from severe traffic congestion this feature is quite different from the pattern of vehicle flows in highways this may be due to the flow control in narrow and busy waterways big vessels need get permit to enter the waterway and controlled by pilots on the other hand some small vessels may not be equipped with ais system making them not counted in the analysis unlike highway traffic the traffic flow in waterways is seldom studied the application of the proposed methodological framework helped us better understand the travel behavior of vessels and the traffic patterns in a narrow inland waterway like the snww the travel pattern shows that the snww does not suffer from severe congestion making it difficult to investigate the fundamental speed density diagram in the snww in the future this methodological framework will be applied to more waterway channels acknowledgement the authors appreciate

23737,this paper proposed an ais data based method of studying travel behavior of vessels when passing through a hotspot in a narrow waterway by building their trip information within this hotspot with trip information all trips in a hotspot can be divided into three categories inbound outbound and moored the last one refers to the trips that have ever stopped in a hotspot such stopping behavior is expected to be different from those directly passing through a hotspot without any stopping if not excluding these trips the revealed behavior pattern may be bias especially when considering speed distributions this proposed method was applied to the three hotspots in the sabine neches waterways snww identified through the analysis of vessel conflicts along the whole snww using ais data collected in the whole year of 2012 more than 10 of total vessel conflicts occurred within these three hotspots we also investigated the distributions of flow speeds and densities as well as their relationships at these hotspots respectively the findings reveal the travel patterns of inbound and outbound trips passing these three hotspots in the snww considering the heterogeneous behavior of different types of vessels these revealed patterns also help examine the risk of vessel collisions at these three spots respectively keywords travel behavior hotspot ais data narrow waterway 1 introduction since 2002 new ships and all sea going vessels that have 300 gross tons or more as well as all passenger vessels are required to equip an automatic identification system ais on board the ais transmits the sailing status information between vessels and from vessels to shore or vice versa therefore ais helps vessels see each other in the channel and the waterway management agency can also monitor the status of vessels the ais data contains the detailed and consecutive temporal and spatial information of a vessel as well as real maneuvering behavior of a vessel such as speed course etc for this reason recently ais data are widely used in the waterway transportation research including the risk analysis of vessel collisions vessel travel behavior etc in many existing models it is important to know vessel behavior and the interactions between vessels since ais data provides the navigation details of vessels the relative speed angle and distance can be revealed between two vessels such information about vessel interaction serves as input to many models mou et al 2010 developed linear regression models based on ais data to evaluate the risk of vessel collisions in the north sea off the port of rotterdam based on two indicators closest point of approach cpa and time to closest point of approach tcpa between two vessels these two factors well reflect the risk of vessel collisions in a given waterway if the cpa between two vessels are small then the risk level is high for these two vessels to collide each other using ais data weng et al 2014a 2014b investigated the frequency of vessel conflicts in singapore straits which occurs when one vessel enters or will enter the domain of another in a short time 30 s if neither change their behavior they defined a vessel s domain as a circle with three times of this vessel s length actually the definition of a vessel s domain varies in the literature fujii and tanaka 1971 defined an elliptical domain where the major and minor radii are 4 and 1 6 times of the length of the vessel respectively and qu et al 2011 proposed the fuzzy quaternion ship domain kujala et al 2009 developed a collision model to study the risk of vessel collisions and groundings in the gulf of finland requiring the information of relative speeds between vessels montewka et al 2010 developed models to calculate the probability of three types of vessel collisions overtaking head on and crossing where information of vessel interaction is required zhang et al 2015 proposed a vessel conflict ranking operator vcro model which is based on a survey among maritime experts to rank the risk of various situations about the interaction between two vessels relative speed angle and distance ais data can be also used to investigate the travel behavior of vessels at waterways compared with numerous studies of vehicles travel behavior in highways only a few look at the travel behavior of vessels in waterways for example xiao et al 2015 investigated the travel behavior of vessels at two spots one is near the port of rotterdam and another is near shanghai based on ais data they studied the distributions of vessel speeds courses and arrival time intervals especially for containers different types of vessels vary significantly in size speed and maneuvering behavior therefore they particularly studied the behavior of containers on the other hand unlike vehicles behavior in highways at some locations in a narrow and busy waterway some vessels may temporarily stop i e moored while others are still moving especially when there are many big ships moving in the channel the travel behavior of those moored vessels is expected to be quite different from those directly passing through without stopping therefore the flow of vessels is expected not to be as homogenous as that of vehicles in highways if focusing on the travel behavior of in motion vessels at a hotspot it is necessary to exclude those which have stopped in this spot when passing through meanwhile the ais records vessels real status i e spot speeds courses etc xiao et al 2015 employed the speeds and courses of vessels when crossing the border line of the section of interest however the status at one point may not be able to fully represent the whole situation when passing through the section of interest this paper aims to develop a novel framework of studying the travel behavior of vessels in given hotspots of narrow waterways first we are particularly interested in hotspots located in narrow inland waterways different from open ocean ships must strictly follow channels in inland waterways such as the sabine neches waterways snww houston ship channel due to the constraint of draft the channel was drudged out from a natural river for holding big ships therefore this type of inland waterways is like highways especially two lane highways this is one of the motivation of this paper whether we can use the highway flow theory to investigate the travel behavior in waterways however note that the intersection of waterways is different from that of highways no signal or stop sign for this reason the hotspots studied in this paper are not located in any intersection of waterways second this paper particularly focuses on the travel behavior of in motion vessels different from vehicles in a highway vessels have more freedom to be moored along a waterway therefore this paper proposed a method to separate the moored vessels from those in motion i e those directly passing through a spot without stopping when studying vessels travel behavior note that a hotspot is not a single point but a short section in a channel so it is important to look at the entire travel behavior of a vessel when it passes through the entire section third the behavior of some types of vessels that dominate the flow is further studied by doing these the behavior of vessels can be more accurately modeled and the impacts of those dominating vessel types can be better understood the hotspots can be determined according to the frequency of conflicts between big vessels i e the frequency that a vessel enters the domain of another in this paper the hotspots found in the snww see fig 1 will be used as the example of the case study in our previous study on the snww it was found that the frequency of vessel conflicts in several locations see fig 2 a b is consistently high by using various models as well as the ais data in different months wu et al 2016 the frequency of vessel conflicts only reflects the phenomena or more precisely the results of vessels behavior pattern in these hotspots with the known hotspots in the snww this paper uses the snww as a case study to investigate vessels travel behavior the snww are the major waterway in southeast texas see fig 1 a which is known as the energy gateway to the u s the snww connect the port of beaumont as well as the ports of port arthur and orange with the gulf of mexico the waterways serve four refineries and many chemical plants located along the waterway from 2002 to 2006 the import of crude oil through this waterway comprises 12 of the u s and 18 of western gulf coast imports usace 2010 as shown in fig 1 b the major route of the snww goes from the port of beaumont to the gulf via neches river and jettied entrance channel the channel is 40 ft 12 2 m deep and 400 ft 122 m wide in the section of neches river and 42 ft 13 m deep and 500 800 ft 152 244 m wide in the jettied entrance channel having the capacity for oil tankers and other big vessels in the snww big vessels usually refer to tankers and cargos up to 100 000 tons they are much larger compared with barges tugs these four types of vessels consist of around 95 of all vessels in the snww the second route goes to the port of orange in the northeast via sabine river which is 30 ft 9 m deep and 200 ft 61 m wide usace 2010 to the southwest the channel extends to galveston via the gulf intracoastal waterway giww there are two intersections in the snww as shown in fig 1 b the snww are narrow but busy waterways according to the historical data there is an average of 2 3 vessel collisions and 1 grounding per year setwac 2013 collisions in the snww are more dangerous than groundings because groundings in the snww are primarily soft wu et al 2014 based on the collected ais data in two months our previous research wu et al 2016 studied the frequency of big vessels conflicts in the snww which is defined as the case that one vessel at least 20 m enters the domain of another at least 50 m two types of domains were used respectively circular or elliptical domains and three types of vessel conflicts were considered head on overtaking and crossing a vessel conflict represents a kind of potential risk of vessel collision therefore the higher the frequency at one location the higher the risk of vessel collisions at this location along the snww this study identifies six hotspots each of which saw at least 4 of all vessel conflicts in the snww it was found that based on either circular or elliptical domains the locations of hotspots were almost the same for different types of vessel conflicts in different months fig 2 a b shows the locations of six hotspots considering crossing conflicts the most common conflicts based on the ais data in march 2012 readers are referred to wu et al 2016 for the details of the theories and procedure of identifying hotspots as well as more results of the hotspot identification vessel conflict ranking operator vcro model developed by zhang et al 2015 was also employed to identify hotspots of vessel collision risk in the snww wu et al 2016 interestingly it was also found that hotspots identified by this model are almost the same to the ones aforementioned especially for hotspots 1 2 and 6 shown in fig 2 a b they are neither at the intersection of two channels as hotspot 5 in fig 2 a b nor close to the major ports as hotspots 3 and 4 in fig 2 a b as mentioned above the intersection of waterways is quite different from that of highway neither signal nor stop sign is provided meanwhile these three hotspots have quite straight channels making it easier in modeling therefore we are particularly interested in the travel behavior pattern of vessels that pass these three hotspots especially from a microscopic viewpoint moreover this paper aims to build a common methodological framework of studying vessels travel behavior in narrow waterways note that for convenience of description hotspot 6 shown in fig 2 a b is renamed to be hotspot 3 in the following text see fig 2 c the reminder of this article is organized as follows section 2 gives the methodological framework used to investigate vessels behavior in narrow and busy waterways section 3 analyzes the distributions of trips with the consideration of vessel types section 4 analyzes the distributions of travel speeds in these hotspots section 5 analyzes the density of vessels as well as the relationship between speed and density at these hotspots and section 6 concludes the paper 2 methodology 2 1 trip information building the ais data used in this paper are from the website of marinecadastre gov http marinecadastre gov this paper uses the ais data collected in the snww in each month of 2012 each record represents a vessel s status the location longitude and latitude timestamp as accurate as second speed over ground sog course over ground cog heading rate one turn rot voyage id vessel id maritime mobile service identity i e mmsi etc the information of vessels and voyages such as vessel length type voyage destination and starting time is also available 2 1 1 calculation of trips mean speeds the ais gives the discrete status of a vessel in navigation to investigate the travel behavior of a vessel when it runs through a hotspot section one point of status may not be enough therefore it is necessary to build a vessel s trip information that covers all ais reported points within the spot however since the time interval between two ais records is around 1 min the exact entering and leaving time may not be available directly for this reason the first record after a vessel enters the spot is regarded as the starting point and last record before it leaves the spot as the ending point as demonstrated in fig 3 with the starting and ending times locations a trip s time interval and distance can be revealed respectively the time interval is the time period between the timestamps of the first and last points and the distance is the sum of the lengths between each of two consecutive points within a hotspot as shown in equations 1 and 2 1 δ t i j t i j s t i j r 2 d i j k 1 n i j 1 l i j k k 1 where δ t i j and d i j refer to the time interval and distance of trip i within hotspot j t i j r and t i j s are the first and last timestamp of trip i within hotspot j l i j k k 1 is the distance between two consecutive points the k th and k 1st points and n i j is the number of points of trip i within hotspot j some of these notations are also illustrated in fig 3 note that usually the time interval between two consecutive ais records of one vessel should be around 1 min if it is more than 3 min we should consider it as a new trip with the information of a trip s time interval and distance the mean travel speed of a trip can be defined as 3 u i j d i j δ t i j where u i j is the mean speed of trip i within hotspot j equation 3 indicates that it is a space mean speed on the other hand the time mean speed is the average of all speed records of this trip within this hotspot this paper employs the former space mean speed which is also usually used in highway traffic analysis 2 1 2 identification of moored trips trips within a hotspot can be divided into three categories inbound outbound and moored as discussed in section 1 when studying vessels travel behavior it is necessary to exclude the vessels that stop in the channel because their speed distributions are quite different from those passing through directly with ais data the direction of a trip can be also easily determined since the hotspot is almost a straight section see fig 3 if a vessel directly passes through this hotspot its heading should not change largely in other words the values of longitude or latitude or both should change monotonically for example if the latitude values increase monotonically the trip must be northbound or if the longitude values decrease monotonically the trip is westbound otherwise if their change is not monotone it implies that a vessel may make a turn even a u turn or just fluctuate around a place this is a sign of moored trips because a vessel cannot stay moored for a long time in the middle of channel fig 4 a shows the example of two trips ais data within hotspot 2 one is a trip that directly passed through the hotspot apparently the change of longitudes of three points from west to east is monotone and another is a moored trip fig 4 b shows the details of the ais data when moored lots of turns can be seen and the ais data look random note that a trip s courses can be also used to determine whether a trip is moored or not given a straight channel the ais data also include the information of course and heading since it is inland waterway and the travel speed is low a trip s course is close to its heading if its courses at all recorded points in a hotspot are close it implies that the trip went through the hotspot directly otherwise it was moored therefore in our study the identification of moored trips is not based on the time span when a vessel stays in a hotspot but by checking its moving tracks the reason is that we focus on the travel behavior of vessels those directly passing through a hotspot apparently behave very differently from those making turns therefore a vessel s trip will not be labeled as moored even if it stayed in a hotspot for a long time but not found making a turn in the channel by tracking its spatial locations however this trip will be regarded as an outlier and be excluded when analyzing the speed distribution see section 4 2 1 3 determination of hotspot density on the other hand for trip i within hotspot j given two time stamps t i j r and t i j s we can determine the number of vessels being in hotspot j when trip i was passing this hotspot by checking the time windows of all trips that passed through this spot in this paper a vessel encountering another in one hotspot means that both are in this spot at the same time they could be moving in opposite direction or the same direction or one is moving and another is moored note that a hotspot is not a point but a small section and here encountering does not necessarily mean that two are moving toward for example we have divided the entire snww into 397 small sections the length of one section is 1 5 km this distance is arbitrarily set the identification of hotspots is based on the analysis of vessel conflict frequency in each section wu et al 2016 then within hotspot j trip i encountered trip h note h i if at least one of the following three conditions is satisfied 4 t i j r t h j r t i j s 5 t i j r t h j s t i j s 6 t h j r t i j r and t h j s t i j s condition 4 or 5 means that when trip h enters or leaves hotspot j trip i is in that spot and condition 6 indicates that trip h stays in hotspot j moored or moving in a slower speed when trip i goes through this spot for a vessel passing through a hotspot the total number of vessels it encountered in this hotspot indicates the density of this spot when it goes through 2 2 methodological framework as discussed in section 1 it is important to exclude those trips which have stopped when studying the travel behavior of in motion vessels a moored trip refers to a trip where the vessel has stopped for a while in a hotspot when passing through it in the following we discuss how to identify moored trips based on ais data of vessels see section 2 3 on the other hand for a narrow waterway it is necessary to consider the direction of movement so non moored trips are divided into inbound and outbound trips respectively since the ais reports the information of vessel types it is possible to investigate the general travel behavior of different vessel types especially those types that dominate the flow so that we can see how these dominating vessel types impact the entire flow of vessels in a waterway the information of trips within a given hotspot makes it possible to analyze the distributions of trips speeds and surrounding density respectively which can help better understand vessels travel behavior moreover this information also makes it possible to investigate the relationship between speed and density in a hotspot of interest fig 5 demonstrates this methodological framework in the following this framework will be employed to analyze the travel behavior of vessels in the snww based on the ais data collected in the entire year of 2012 3 analysis of trips in the case of the snww the traffic is regarded as outbound if it moves closer to the gulf of mexico and inbound if it moves closer to the port of beaumont therefore at spots 1 and 3 see fig 2 c northbound traffic is inbound while at spot 2 westbound traffic is inbound the ais data of the entire year of 2012 were used to investigate vessels travel behavior in these three hotspots as shown in fig 2 c the length of each hotspot is 1 500 m in the whole year of 2012 1864 1 376 and 1 302 vessels were found passing these three hotspots respectively having 1 757 815 1 172 331 and 2 899 058 records at these three spots respectively the following analysis is based on these records 3 1 vessels passing through hotspots directly fig 6 reports the monthly numbers of vessels in each direction inbound outbound and moored at three hotspots respectively it is seen that hotspot 1 had more traffic than hotspots 2 and 3 because the channel at hotspot 1 also serves the traffic along the gulf intracoastal waterway giww which extends to the port of orange to the northeast and further east to florida and southwest to brownsville tx barges towing vessels are the major vessels in the giww big ships cannot run in the giww moreover it is seen that the change of traffic from month to month is small well indicating that the traffic in the snww is quite stable over time it is seen from fig 6 that at all three hotspots the number of vessels in two directions were almost identical the distributions of vessel types in the inbound and outbound traffic at three hotspots were also investigated respectively as reported in fig 7 at hotspot 1 towing vessels and tankers 35 and 40 of the total respectively were two major types of vessels while at hotspots 2 and 3 the numbers of towing vessels are much less and consequently making tankers the majority 60 70 of the total the reason is that spot 1 is in the channel shared by the giww and snww and as aforementioned the former is primary for towing vessels 3 2 vessels moored in hotspots as shown in fig 6 lots of vessels were moored in three hotspots fig 8 further shows the vessel type distributions for moored vessels at these three spots respectively it is seen that at spots 1 and 2 the number of moored vessels were much larger than those directly passed through on the other hand spot 3 has less number of moored vessels at all three spots most moored vessels were towing vessels and harbor tugs indicating that flow of these towing vessels and tugs may be frequently interrupted for example in march 2012 there are totally 450 vessels moored at hotspot 1 254 towing vessels 95 harbor tugs 7 cargos and 18 tankers on the other hand during the same time totally 293 vessels 68 towing vessels 13 harbor tugs 31 cargos and 121 tankers directly passed through this hotspot without stopping in both directions therefore it is seen that the movement of towing vessels and harbor tugs are more likely to be interrupted this is reasonable as compared with cargos and tankers these two are relatively small and easier to maneuver also they have much smaller drafts moreover note that harbor tugs are usually used for helping maneuver big ships in the channel e g sometimes they may work as the brake for tankers in some sections of the channel fig 8 reports the factions of four major type of vessels that were moored this fraction is based on the number of all vessels in the hotspot during a month note that three hotspots have different number of vessels see fig 6 so we particularly investigated the means standard deviations and medians of the numbers of different type of moored vessels based on each month s data in 2012 the results are reported in table 1 moreover table 1 also reports the statistical summary of the fractions of moored vessels in each type interestingly it is seen that the numbers of moored tankers are almost the same at all hotspots moreover for tankers the standard deviations are small implying that the month by month fluctuation is also small this reflect the flow of tankers in the snww is well planned which is based on the oil demands of each refinery along the waterway on the other hand it is seen that the number fraction of moored towing vessels and harbor tugs vary largely at different hotspots however the standard deviations are small at all hotspots still implying the travel pattern is quite stable month by month most of towing vessels and harbor tugs were moored at hotspots 1 and 2 by checking the photos of these three hotspots all hotspots have several berths on the west side of channel especially at hotspot 1 there are four docks specially for tankers this is the reason why hotspot 1 has much larger number of moored harbor tugs which help tankers mooring moreover tugs are also used to help control big tankers course and speed when they move southbound toward the gulf given that tankers need to make a sharp turn ahead at the first intersection see fig 1 the above analysis shows that the number of moored tankers is independent from the location therefore this paper will particularly study the travel behavior of tankers given that 1 they account for a large number of vessels in the traffic and 2 the number of moored tankers is almost independent from the locations moreover tankers play an important role in the snww as they serve lots of refineries and chemical plants figs 6 8 summarize the macroscopic travel patterns of all vessels at three hotspots respectively this information is not enough yet to understand vessels travel behavior at these spots in the following this paper will further investigate the travel speed distributions and density at these three spots 4 analysis of travel speed section 3 built and analyzed the information of trips at each spot each trip s mean speed is calculated from the time interval and distance of this trip within a hotspot see equation 3 therefore it is actually a space mean speed normally used in highway traffic flow theory in the following for brevity the space mean speed of a trip is just called speed of a trip as discussed in the first section to better describe the speed distribution of all trips in each direction the moored trips were not considered here given their average speed were almost 0 moreover it is usually necessary to remove outliers before analyzing speed distributions because 1 some speeds are very close to 0 probably due to the vessels which are about to stop or very large probably due to data error to define outliers an interquartile range iqr is needed which is the difference between the third and first quartiles of the dataset and then a record is regarded to be an outlier if it is less than the value of the first quartile minus the iqr multiplied by 1 5 or greater than the value of the third quartile plus the iqr multiplied by 1 5 montgomery et al 2010 at each hotspot the speed data for each direction in or outbound are ready for the following analysis after removing the outliers the study of travel speed should include at least two components 1 general statistical analysis and 2 speed distribution analysis first table 2 reports the statistical summary of the speeds of inbound and outbound trips at three spots respectively considering the trips of all vessels or tankers only respectively it is seen that generally the speed is low considering the general flow of all vessels even the 99th percentiles of speeds were less than 12 knots at hotspots 1 and 3 and less than 10 knots at hotspot 2 in all cases the means are close to medians indicating that the distribution is not heavily skewed to verify this point the skewness of each distribution was calculated and reported in table 2 the skewness is generally small and most of them are just slightly positively skewed further one sample kolmogorov smirnov k s tests were employed to test the normality using the default significant level of 0 05 of speed distribution after normalizing all speed data for each direction at each hotspot unexpectedly for the general flow covering all vessels it is seen that at hotspots 1 and 2 none of the speeds are normally distributed if only considering trips made by tankers at hotspots 1 and 2 only the speeds of the outbound flow are normally distributed these results are different from the results of the case study from xiao et al 2015 where normal distributions were found to be common however at hotspot 3 the speed distributions are all normal for general trips or tanker trips note that based on fig 2 it is seen that at hotspot 3 tankers and cargos dominate the vessel flow they are both large ships therefore the vessel flow seems more homogenous on the other hand the flow at hotspot 1 is relatively heterogenous as the proportions of tankers and towing vessels are both large and they are quite different from each other even though tankers also dominate the flow at hotspot 2 since hotspot 2 is close to some docks of some refineries the travel behavior of tankers can be more complex compared with that at hotspot 3 where tankers have relative high speeds when going through see table 2 interestingly it is found that at hotspots 1 and 2 the speeds of outbound tankers are normally distributed while the northbound are not note that outbound tankers are unloaded so their drafts are less and their travel behavior can be more normal having smaller speed variances while for loaded tankers in narrow channels their travel behavior can vary largely depending on more external factors so their speed variances are much larger see table 2 to further investigate the speed distributions of inbound and outbound trips at three hotspots we plotted these distributions in fig 9 and further fit these speeds using various distributions totally 61 distributions were checked conducted by easyfitxl still based on the k s tests the distributions with p values greater than 0 05 as the default significant level were kept for each direction up to two best fitted distributions based on p values were shown in fig 9 3 distributions were reported for outbound tankers at hotspot 2 and the p value of each fitted distribution up to three was reported in table 3 note that a set of data may fit well into different types of distributions please refer to the appendix at the end of this paper for the detailed probability density function pdf of each fitted distribution as well as the fitted values of these pdfs parameters by fitting it is found that the generalized extreme value gev distribution fits almost all speed distributions at all three hotspots at least their p values are greater than 0 05 except inbound general trips for all types of vessels at hotspot 1 equation 7 gives the probability density function pdf of a gev distribution which has three parameters shape parameter k scale parameter σ and location parameter μ 7 f x 1 σ e x p 1 k z 1 k 1 k z 1 1 k where z x μ σ please refer to the appendix at the end of this paper for the fitted values of parameters k σ and μ in different cases the findings show that the gev distribution may be good to reflect the speed distributions of vessel flows made up of different types of vessels such as tankers towing vessels and other small vessels i e good in reflecting the speed distribution of flows consisting of vessels that behave heterogeneously in travel also as found in table 2 through the one sample k s tests only at hotspot 3 all speeds can be also regarded to be normally distributed while at hotspots 1 and 2 only outbound tankers have normally distributed speeds it is seen that the speed distributions at hotspot 3 differ from those at hotspots 1 and 2 two sample k s tests were employed to investigate whether the general vessel speed distribitions are significant different from those of tankers at each hotspot and the results were reported in table 4 interestingly it is seen that at hotspot 3 the speeds of the general flows and those of tankers in the same direction can be regarded as identically distributed using 0 05 as the significant level however on the other hand at hotspots 1 and 2 the p values show that they are significantly different indicating at these two spots the flows are heterogeneous the speed distributions of tankers may be very different from those of other types of vessels or even one tanker s speed distribution could vary significantly from one to another 5 analysis of vessel density 5 1 density distribution the revealed trip information makes it possible to study the density of vessels at hotspots as discussed in section 2 1 in this paper the density at a hotspot simply refers to the number of vessels at this spot when there was a vessel passing through it because the hotspots have the same length 1 500 km this information is important because it is related to the risk of collisions note that the identification of hotspots depends on the frequency of vessel conflicts which occur when one vessel enters the domain of another wu et al 2016 when it went through a hotspot a vessel may encounter other vessels in three types of status moored running through in the opposite direction or in the same direction first during the time when a vessel passed through a hotspot without stopping the total number of vessels including this vessel itself at this hotspot can be regarded as vessel density if taking a hotspot as a unit note that such number includes the number of moored vessels to better reflect the risk the number of in motion vessels in each direction should be also identified fig 10 reports the distribution of vessel density for all inbound or outbound trips at each hotspot for the general flows considering all vessels as well as the flows of tankers respectively for example 22 6 or 22 7 of vessels in their inbound trips saw 3 or 4 other vessels at hotspot 1 in the whole year of 2012 respectively i e 4 or 5 in total including itself it is seen that at hotspot 1 it is most likely for a vessel 45 and 49 chances for inbound and outbound trips respectively to encounter 3 4 other vessels i e 4 5 vessels in total at hotspot 2 around 62 chance for a vessel inbound or outbound to encounter 2 3 other vessels i e 3 4 vessels in total and at hotspot 3 around 50 chance for a vessel to encounter 4 7 other vessels i e totally 5 8 vessels as reported in fig 6 hotspot 1 has the largest number of vessels passing and hotspot 3 has the least however interestingly hotspot 3 seems to be more congested fig 10 also reports that the number of vessels that a tanker encountered when it ran through a hotspot it is seen that at each hotspot the distribution of such numbers is quite close to that of the numbers of vessels that a general vessel encountered again two sample k s tests were used to check whether they are identically distributed and the p values were reported in table 5 these p values are quite close to 1 indicating that at each hotspot the number of vessels that a tanker could encounter are identically distributed with those that a general vessel could encounter when passing through this hotspot such findings show that unlike the heterogeneous speed distributions at hotspots 1 and 2 see section 4 the density distributions are similar for different types of vessels when they pass each hotspot implying that the density is independent of vessel types 5 2 density of in motion vessels the above analysis looks at the number of all vessels including those moored considering the risk of vessel collisions it is more critical to know the number of in motion vessels that a vessel may encounter when it passes through a hotspot therefore in this section we particularly investigate the distributions of the numbers of in motion vessels that a vessel would encounter when it passed through a hotspot given the narrow waterway and small length of a hotspot if there are more than one vessel especially if at least one is a big ship moving at the same time at the same spot the risk of vessel collision would be high as to the in motion vessels two directions are considered moving in the same or opposing direction these two directions correspond to the risk of overtaking and head on collisions respectively the distributions of the numbers of in motion vessels were reported in fig 11 clearly it is seen that even though it is most likely for a vessel to encounter more than one other vessel when it ran through a hotspot see fig 10 most of them were actually moored as reported in fig 11 at each hotspot less than 10 chance for a vessel or a tanker to encounter another one also in motion either in the same direction or opposing direction further it is seen that even though hotspot 3 was found to be the most congested among three spots a vessel is less likely to see another in motion vessel at the same time compared with the cases at hotspots 1 and 2 also it is seen that at hotspots 1 and 2 compared with those outbound vessels inbound vessels has three times higher chance to encounter another moving in the opposing direction about 9 v s 3 as to tankers at hotspots 1 and 2 inbound ones still have higher chance to encounter another moving in the opposing direction about 4 v s 2 at hotspot 1 and about 8 v s 2 at hotspot 2 it implies that the head on collision risk for inbound trips is relatively larger than those outbound trips at hotspots 1 and 2 at hotspot 1 such risk for tankers may be a little bit smaller compared with the average risk considering all types of vessels about 4 v s 9 but at hotspot 2 such risk for tankers are almost the same to the average risk about 9 on the other hand overtaking collision risk is relatively smaller at these two hotspots in the worst case about 5 of outbound vessels would see another moving in the same direction at hotspot 1 and only 2 3 for other cases while for tankers in the worst case 8 of outbound tankers would have another vessel moving in the same direction at hotspot 2 and only 1 4 for other cases by comparing figs 10 and 11 it is seen that even though hotspot 3 is a little bit more congested than the other two most vessels encountered by an in motion vessel there are actually moored therefore this congestion is actually caused by moored vessels however as shown in fig 6 hotspot 3 had the least number of moored vessels among three hotspots as discussed in section 3 2 it is seen that all hotspots have several berths available for big vessels hotspot 1 has four tanker docks and hotspot 2 and 3 also have several docks for marine services hotspot 3 also has a us coast guard station nearby interestingly it seems that the number of berths at hotspot 3 is no more than that at hotspots 2 but fig 10 shows that an in motion vessel is more likely to encounter other vessels most are moored as discussed above in hotspot 3 from figs 7 and 8 it is seen that tankers plus some cargos accounted for over 90 of vessels that directly went through hotspot 3 but most moored vessels were towing vessels and harbor tugs therefore it implies that some auxiliary vessels e g tugs were nearby when a tanker went through hotspot 3 note that the channel at hotspot 3 is much wider and deeper than that at other two hotspots 5 3 relation between speed and density the above two sections investigate the distributions of speeds and densities at three hotspots respectively in highway engineering some famous models were proposed to describe the relationship between traffic speed and density such as greenshields et al s model 1935 greenberg s model 1959 underwood s model 1961 etc however based on the authors best knowledge the fundamental relationship between traffic speed and density in narrow waterways is not investigated yet in the literature in the following for the general flow of all types of vessels and flow of tankers the distributions of speeds mean median 25 and 75 percentiles were plotted in figs 12 and 13 respectively against the total number of vessels as density defined in section 5 1 present in the hotspot note that the figures only report the density levels where there are at least 10 speed records with the distributions of medians 25 and 75 percentiles of speeds it is easier to see how the speeds were distributed at each density level interestingly based on the collected ais data it is seen that the number of vessels in each hotspot did not have apparent impact on vessel speed i e the speed does not have an apparent change when the vessel density level changes for either general trips or tanker trips in all cases the widths of 50 of speed distributions were just about 2 knots for example for inbound trips at hotspot 1 50 of speeds were between around 5 and 7 knots when the number of vessels are no more than 5 as reported in fig 11 at each hotspot most vessels encounter by a passing through vessel were actually moored at this hotspot in most cases a vessel would see at most another one in motion vessel when it ran through a hotspot it is probably the reason why the density of vessels at a hotspot did not significantly impact the vessel s speeds the nearly flat curves imply that the speeds at three hotspots are free flow speeds i e the speeds are not impacted by the density generally the three hotspots did not suffer from serious traffic congestion instead the speed largely depends on the location and direction the speed at hotspot 3 is much higher than hotspots 1 and 2 and outbound tankers unloaded have higher speeds than inbound tankers loaded 6 discussion and conclusions this paper proposed a novel ais data based methodological framework to investigate the vessels travel behavior in hotspots of a narrow and busy waterway this method looks at the entire behavior of a vessel when passing a hotspot a small section not a point therefore the behavior is analyzed based on trips rather than directly using the ais reported spot status especially this method excludes the vessels which have ever stopped in the hotspots because the behavior of those moored vessel can be quite different from that of the vessels directly passing through in many existing studies the risk of vessel collisions is usually investigated based on 1 the ship domain theory sdt which looks at the frequency when a vessel s domain is intruded by other vessels called vessel conflict by analyzing the ais data e g see mou et al 2010 weng et al 2014a wu et al 2016 etc or 2 vessels relative behavior plus expert judgement e g zhang et al 2015 etc or 3 probability theory and bayesian method e g fujii and tanaka 1971 macduff 1974 otto and pedersen 2002 etc these studies look at two vessels relative measures such as relative speed distance and angle in the channel based on ais data and or experts judgements based on different scenarios these methods estimate the risk from a macroscopic or mesoscopic viewpoint this paper on the other hand aims to investigate the vessels travel behavior from a microscopic viewpoint at specific locations using the methods applied in highway traffic flow by revealing the behavior pattern of vessels at some hotspots which are regarded to be more vulnerable to vessel collisions the vessel collision risk may be better understood for example our previous studies identified several high risky hotspots in the snww by analyzing the frequency of vessel conflict but the analysis of the speed density relationship shows that pilots actually do not slow down when a vessel conflict occurs even riding on a big tanker an important reason may be that many vessel conflicts occur when a vessel passes a moored vessel this microscopic analysis can be regarded as a supplement to the macroscopic and mesoscopic level vessel risk analysis particularly this paper proposed to separate moored vessels from those keeping running in their courses because different from highway traffic there are many moored vessels in narrow inland waterways based on our best knowledge previous studies do not consider the impacts of these moored vessels when evaluating the risk of vessel collisions on the other hand the studies of travel behavior of vessels in a channel found that the vessels behavior is different from the pattern of vehicles in highways this study helps us better understand the vessels travel behavior in narrow and busy waterways the findings of this paper based on the ais data collected in these three hotspots were summarized as follows considering the general flow of all types of vessels the speeds of vessel flows are not normally distributed if the flow is mixed by different types of vessels that behave heterogeneously it is found that gev distributions are good in representing the speed distribution of a heterogeneous flow on the other hand the speeds of a flow of a single type of vessels usually are normally distributed at three hotspots the density distribution is independent of the type of vessels that passed through in more than 90 of cases in the snww when passing through a hotspot a vessel would encounter only one in motion vessel i e the vessels that do not stop within this hotspot when passing through in the same or opposing direction the density of vessels in a hotspot seems to have litter impact on the speed distributions in other words it seems that the speed distribution in a narrow and busy waterway is almost independent from the density level of this hotspot it indicates that the snww actually does not suffer from severe traffic congestion this feature is quite different from the pattern of vehicle flows in highways this may be due to the flow control in narrow and busy waterways big vessels need get permit to enter the waterway and controlled by pilots on the other hand some small vessels may not be equipped with ais system making them not counted in the analysis unlike highway traffic the traffic flow in waterways is seldom studied the application of the proposed methodological framework helped us better understand the travel behavior of vessels and the traffic patterns in a narrow inland waterway like the snww the travel pattern shows that the snww does not suffer from severe congestion making it difficult to investigate the fundamental speed density diagram in the snww in the future this methodological framework will be applied to more waterway channels acknowledgement the authors appreciate

23738,fluid compressibility of liquids is often neglected in engineering design however the error incurred due to this simplification is not well identified this paper examines the influence of compressibility on the hydroelastic vibration of plates in contact with fluid an analytical solution for the free vibration of thick rectangular isotropic plates coupled with a bounded compressible inviscid fluid domain is developed plate displacement theories with arbitrary order are considered using the 2d carrera unified formulation which can obtain results very similar to 3d solutions the eigenvalue problem is obtained by considering the kinetic and potential energy of both the fluid and the plate the displacement variables are evaluated using the ritz method a comparison of the results with open literature and 3d finite element software is performed parametric studies are carried out in order to assess the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility as a function of plate geometry material properties and boundary conditions the influence of fluid domain size density and sonic velocity is also assessed the results indicate that the error due to neglecting fluid

engineering applications such as ships and structures containing fluid the vibrational behavior of plates in contact with fluid differ considerably from the behavior in vacuum so an accurate mathematical modeling is required in order to fully understand the mechanical problem and avoid the resonance phenomena in this kind of problems the analysis is complex since a coupled hydrodynamic and structural solution is required finite element solutions are capable of dealing with this problem but the high computational cost inhibits its use for preliminary design semi analytical methods help in understanding the interaction problem and provide accurate results with a low computational cost being adequate for the analysis of a large number of cases the analysis of a plate in contact with a fluid domain has been studied by many researchers vibration of circular plates has been analyzed considering an incompressible fluid domain jeong et al 2009 a compressible fluid domain jeong and kim 2005 and asymmetric conditions tariverdilo et al 2013 viscosity has been introduced in the analysis by phan et al 2013 atkinson and manrique de lara 2007 and kozlovsky 2009 finite element models using 2d plate elements are capable of dealing with arbitrary geometries and have been developed by kerboua et al 2008 and bermudez et al 2001 closed form solutions considering incompressible fluid and mindlin plates have been obtained by hashemi et al 2012 hydroelastic analysis considering added mass factors has been investigated by kwak and kim 1991 and in the paper by kwak 1996 analysis of the modal energy associated with the fluid and the plate has been developed by gorman and horacek 2007 magnetic plates in contact with fluid have been studied by chang 2013 and in the work by chang and liu 2009 experimental results of vibrational behavior of structures in contact with fluid can be found in refs carra et al 2013 kwon et al 2013 stenius et al 2016 vibrational analysis of shells

analysis of annular plates coupled to a compressible fluid domain has been analyzed by jeong 2006 hydroelastic analysis of rectangular plates using the velocity potential and kirchhoff plate theory was presented by cheng and zhou cheung and zhou 2000 this model has been further developed in order to consider mindlin plate theory and stiffeners cho et al 2015 fluid compressibility liao and ma

assemblies in a reactor in the literature review almost all the references model the plate displacement using either the kirchhoff plate theory or mindlin plate theory however more accurate results can be obtained by using higher order shear deformation theories hsdts other possibilities exist such as the use of a modified mindlin plate theory senjanović et al 2014 in order to develop analytical models for a hsdt of arbitrary order the carrera unified formulation cuf is of great help this formulation is known to obtain results similar to those obtained via 3d finite element analysis while retaining the computational efficiency of 1d and 2d models the formulation was presented by carrera 2003 and has been applied for the analysis of thermal stresses in plates carrera 2002 2005 robaldo et al 2005 multifield problems carrera et al 2007 2008a 2009 robaldo et al 2006 functionally graded materials carrera et al 2008b and shells cinefra et al 2012 2013 functions used to interpolate the displacements in the thickness direction can be either simple polynomials or more complex functions as presented in refs carrera et al 2013 filippi et al 2016 a detailed description of the formulation is given in refs carrera et al 2011a 2011b 2014 in order to approximate the displacement field of the plate the ritz method is often used due to its flexibility in the choice of the boundary conditions and low computational cost another common approach the finite element method is not only computationally expensive but also suffers from a phenomenon known as shear locking in which a slow convergence is observed when thin plates are analyzed reduced and selective reduced integration procedures have proven to be effective at dealing with shear locking zienkiewicz et al 1971 hughes et al 1978 hughes 1980 however these techniques are known to produce spurious energy modes on the other hand if high order interpolation functions are used in the ritz method the influence of the shear locking phenomenon is greatly reduced the fundamentals of the ritz method is described in refs leissa 2005 gander and wanner 2012 ilanko et al 2014 it is well known that the accuracy and stability of the results is greatly dependent on the shape functions used trigonometric shape functions have been used by fazzolari and carrera 2013a 2011 2014 2013b in order to analyze simply supported plates analysis of shells has also developed as given in refs fazzolari 2016 fazzolari and banerjee 2014 fazzolari and carrera 2013c using polynomial shape functions free vibration analysis of plates arbitrary boundary conditions has been developed by dozio 2013 2011a 2011b 2010 vescovini and dozio 2016 and in the work by dozio and carrera 2011 the compressibility of liquids is often neglected and the error incurred due to this simplification on the hydroelastic vibration of plates is not well identified refs jeong and kim 2005 and liao and ma 2016 show that a significant discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory can arise however it is unknown how this discrepancy varies with geometrical parameters and the solid fluid material properties consequently the aim of this work is to assess the difference in the vibrational behavior when either an incompressible or compressible fluid theory is considered for a variety of cases this is done using the very accurate cuf structural model which can consider displacement theories of arbitrary order and can obtain results similar to 3d finite element solutions with a much lower computational cost a compressible hydrodynamic model based on the velocity potential is coupled with the cuf structural model for the first time the accuracy of the formulation when compared with 3d solutions is demonstrated in the comparison study afterwards parametric studies are performed in order to evaluate the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility 2 analytical modeling a rectangular plate with length a width b and thickness h is considered as shown in fig 1 the coordinates x y z describe the motion of the plate it is assumed that the plate is in contact with a compressible inviscid and irrotational fluid bounded by a rectangular domain with length c width d and depth e as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system x y z is used to describe the fluid motion sloshing effects are neglected and only bulging modes are analyzed in the present study consequently a simplified free surface condition is sufficient the vertical walls and the bottom of the fluid domain are assumed to be rigid except for the region in contact with the top surface of the plate at z 0 or z h 2 the plate is assumed to be linearly elastic homogeneous and isotropic and the amplitude of motion is assumed to be small the energy functional is used to obtain the eigenvalue problem the structural model develops the plate potential energy u and kinetic energy t as in dozio and carrera 2011 however within the nomenclature used in the present manuscript afterwards a hydrodynamic model for the compressible fluid domain is developed in order to obtain the fluid potential energy u w and kinetic energy t w and the coupled fluid structure problem is solved in the frequency domain in order to obtain the natural frequencies of the system 2 1 structural model for convenience the derivation of the structural model is given in non

the initial eigenvalue and eigenvector are obtained by considering the incompressible fluid case i e setting k 0 when the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is high the algorithm must produce a larger eigenvalue modification with respect to the initial incompressible solution consequently large changes in eigenvalues during each iteration are expected this can produce oscillatory divergence between two different vibration modes for example this behavior is observed when a fluid with a low sonic velocity is considered a modified version of the algorithm was successful in obtaining the first five natural frequencies which is based in the following modifications setting a limit in the maximum change of the eigenvalue during each iteration using an under relaxation factor when oscillatory behavior is detected in order to reduce the change of the eigenvalue in each subsequent iteration 2 7 mode shapes and fluid velocity fields in order to obtain the j

liao and ma 2016 and from the 3d fem solution previously described are provided the maximum and average difference of the results compared to the 3d fem solution is also given higher errors are observed when cccc boundaries are considered accurate results are obtained considering the expansion order n 3 and this is further used in the present work analytical results from ref liao and ma 2016 are less accurate since the kirchhoff plate theory was used it must be mentioned that finite elements results using ansys software given in ref liao and ma 2016 have been obtained meshing the plate with shell63 elements in the present work 3d solid elements have been used to model the plate with elements in the thickness direction and thus higher accuracy of the fem results is expected fig 4 shows the first five mode shapes of the plate in contact with fluid obtained by the present formulation and by the 3d fem solution the agreement between both methods is evident 3 3 parametric studies the effect of various parameters in the natural frequencies is considered by analyzing a plate using the parameters given in table 5 as a baseline case where the fluid is considered as water note that these parameters are similar as the ones given in table 1 except that a b 1 and c d 1 the discrepancy between incompressible fluid theory ift and compressible fluid theory cft is reported in the

discrepancy increases fig 5 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a plate in contact with a fluid domain as a function of the plate thickness ratio the relative error due to

four non dimensional natural frequencies of a plate in contact with a fluid domain for various plate aspect ratios a b the discrepancy is seen to be reduced as the aspect ratio increases in particular for ssss plates with a b 2 the relative error due to neglecting fluid compressibility is negligible on the first natural frequency being less than 1 fig 6 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a plate in contact with a fluid domain as a function of the plate aspect ratio as the plate length increases the discrepancy converges asymptotically to a value dependent on the boundary

fluid domain as a function of the plate young s modulus e and the plate density ρ for cccc and ssss boundary conditions it is observed that the discrepancy increases dramatically for stiff and light materials the discrepancy for an aluminum plate e 69 g p a ρ 2705 k g m 3 with clamped edges is 7 7 on the other hand the relative error due to neglecting fluid compressibility when the plate is made of steel e 200 g p a ρ 7850 k g m 3 is much higher being 14 when simply supported plates are considered the discrepancy decreases considerably being 2 1 and 3 8 for the aluminum and steel plate respectively 3 3 4 effect of fluid domain depth table 8 presents the first four non dimensional natural frequencies of a plate in contact with a fluid domain for various fluid domain depth plate width ratios e b it can be observed that the discrepancy for the first natural frequency ω 1 increases as the fluid domain depth increases on the other hand the natural frequencies ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 are only slightly affected due to fluid domain depth for both the incompressible and compressible fluid theory due to this the discrepancy for these frequencies is nearly constant with respect to the fluid depth fig 8 shows the discrepancy in the first three natural frequencies as the fluid domain depth is increased the influence of the fluid depth on the discrepancy in ω 2 ω 3 is seen to be nearly zero beyond e b 1 5 this behavior can be explained by examining the mode shapes fig 9 shows the first five mode shapes of the vertical displacement of a plate in contact with a fluid domain considering e b 2 in the mode shapes associated to the frequencies ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 the net vertical displacement of the fluid is minimal due to the antisymmetric nature of the mode shapes it is suspected that this is the reason that ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 are nearly independent of the fluid depth and thus the discrepancy in these frequencies remains constant on the other hand in the mode shape associated to the frequency ω 1 the net vertical displacement of the fluid is maximum and the influence of the fluid depth on this frequency is expected to be significant 3 3 5 effect of fluid domain length and width fig 10 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a plate in contact with fluid as a function of the fluid domain width plate width ratio d b note that the fluid domain length is also modified since c d 1 concordant with the baseline case parameters given in table 5 as the fluid domain width d increases with respect to the plate width b the discrepancy is seen to decrease contrary to what is observed when the fluid domain depth e is increased in conjunction with the results from the previous sub section it can be expected that for a plate in contact with a wide and deep fluid domain the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is moderate on the other hand if the fluid domain is deep but with the same bottom size as the plate the discrepancy can be considerable 3 3 6 effect of fluid properties fig 11 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a plate in contact with a fluid domain as a function of the fluid sonic velocity c 0 and the fluid density ρ w for cccc and ssss boundary conditions as the fluid density increases the relative error due to neglecting fluid compressibility decreases however it must be noted that for fluids with higher densities the added mass effect is increased and thus the difference between natural frequencies in vacuum and in contact with a fluid domain considering either an incompressible or compressible fluid is higher in addition when the sound velocity in the fluid decreases the discrepancy is higher as expected 3 4 velocity fields the influence of the fluid compressibility in the velocity fields of the fluid is assessed in this section a cccc plate coupled to a fluid domain described by the parameters given in table 5 but with e b 2 is considered according to the values in table 8 the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is large with 20 7 difference for ω 1 and 7 4 difference for ω 4 fig 12 shows velocity vector plots on the planes x 0 z 0 and y 1 of the fluid domain for the first five natural frequencies considering compressible fluid theory the continuity of the fluid velocity is evident in fig 12 fig 13 shows similar velocity plots but considering incompressible fluid theory assuming c 0 infinite by comparing figs 12 and 13 it can be observed that the compressibility of the fluid has negligible influence on the velocity fields in the fluid domain 4 conclusions an analytical solution for the free vibration analysis of thick rectangular isotropic plates coupled with a compressible bounded fluid has been presented the accuracy of the cuf model used in the structural model is evident from the comparison with the 3d fem solutions the influence of the compressibility on the natural frequencies has been studied by performing parametric studies the following conclusions can be stated related to the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility in the vibrational behavior of plates in contact with a fluid domain a in thick plates h b 0 05 the error is high on the other hand in thin plates h b 0 01 the compressibility effects are negligible b in square stiff and light plates the error is higher compared to rectangular non square flexible and heavy plates c fluid depth influences only certain natural frequencies of a submerged plate depending of the symmetric or the antisymmetric nature of the mode shape d the discrepancy for the first natural frequency of a submerged plate increases with fluid depth e in plates coupled to a wide fluid domain the error is lower compared to a fluid domain with the same bottom size as the plate f if light fluids are considered a higher discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is observed however the added mass effect of the fluid the difference with the behavior in vacuum is lower 
23738,fluid compressibility of liquids is often neglected in engineering design however the error incurred due to this simplification is not well identified this paper examines the influence of compressibility on the hydroelastic vibration of plates in contact with fluid an analytical solution for the free vibration of thick rectangular isotropic plates coupled with a bounded compressible inviscid fluid domain is developed plate displacement theories with arbitrary order are considered using the 2d carrera unified formulation which can obtain results very similar to 3d solutions the eigenvalue problem is obtained by considering the kinetic and potential energy of both the fluid and the plate the displacement variables are evaluated using the ritz method a comparison of the results with open literature and 3d finite element software is performed parametric studies are carried out in order to assess the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility as a function of plate geometry material properties and boundary conditions the influence of fluid domain size density and sonic velocity is also assessed the results indicate that the error due to neglecting fluid

engineering applications such as ships and structures containing fluid the vibrational behavior of plates in contact with fluid differ considerably from the behavior in vacuum so an accurate mathematical modeling is required in order to fully understand the mechanical problem and avoid the resonance phenomena in this kind of problems the analysis is complex since a coupled hydrodynamic and structural solution is required finite element solutions are capable of dealing with this problem but the high computational cost inhibits its use for preliminary design semi analytical methods help in understanding the interaction problem and provide accurate results with a low computational cost being adequate for the analysis of a large number of cases the analysis of a plate in contact with a fluid domain has been studied by many researchers vibration of circular plates has been analyzed considering an incompressible fluid domain jeong et al 2009 a compressible fluid domain jeong and kim 2005 and asymmetric conditions tariverdilo et al 2013 viscosity has been introduced in the analysis by phan et al 2013 atkinson and manrique de lara 2007 and kozlovsky 2009 finite element models using 2d plate elements are capable of dealing with arbitrary geometries and have been developed by kerboua et al 2008 and bermudez et al 2001 closed form solutions considering incompressible fluid and mindlin plates have been obtained by hashemi et al 2012 hydroelastic analysis considering added mass factors has been investigated by kwak and kim 1991 and in the paper by kwak 1996 analysis of the modal energy associated with the fluid and the plate has been developed by gorman and horacek 2007 magnetic plates in contact with fluid have been studied by chang 2013 and in the work by chang and liu 2009 experimental results of vibrational behavior of structures in contact with fluid can be found in refs carra et al 2013 kwon et al 2013 stenius et al 2016 vibrational analysis of shells containing fluid has been developed for cylindrical askari and jeong 2010 thinh and nguyen 2016 paak et al 2014 alijani and amabili 2014 and conical rahmanian et al 2016 kerboua et al 2010 geometries analysis of annular plates coupled to a compressible fluid domain has been analyzed by jeong 2006 hydroelastic analysis of rectangular plates using the velocity potential and kirchhoff plate theory was presented by cheng and zhou cheung and zhou 2000 this model has been further developed in order to consider mindlin plate theory and stiffeners cho et al 2015 fluid compressibility liao and ma 2016 plates in elastic foundations and with in plane loads hashemi et al 2010a 2010b shahbaztabar and ranji 2016 excitation forces seung cho et al 2015 and geometric non linearity combined with sloshing effects khorshid and farhadi 2013 the vibrational behavior of multiple plates in contact with fluid has been developed by jeong and kang 2013 being applicable for the analysis of fuel assemblies in a reactor in the literature review almost all the references model the plate displacement using either the kirchhoff plate theory or mindlin plate theory however more accurate results can be obtained by using higher order shear deformation theories hsdts other possibilities exist such as the use of a modified mindlin plate theory senjanović et al 2014 in order to develop analytical models for a hsdt of arbitrary order the carrera unified formulation cuf is of great help this formulation is known to obtain results similar to those obtained via 3d finite element analysis while retaining the computational efficiency of 1d and 2d models the formulation was presented by carrera 2003 and has been applied for the analysis of thermal stresses in plates carrera 2002 2005 robaldo et al 2005 multifield problems carrera et al 2007 2008a 2009 robaldo et al 2006 functionally graded materials carrera et al 2008b and shells cinefra et al 2012 2013 functions used to interpolate the displacements in the thickness direction can be either simple polynomials or more complex functions as presented in refs carrera et al 2013 filippi et al 2016 a detailed description of the formulation is given in refs carrera et al 2011a 2011b 2014 in order to approximate the displacement field of the plate the ritz method is often used due to its flexibility in the choice of the boundary conditions and low computational cost another common approach the finite element method is not only computationally expensive but also suffers from a phenomenon known as shear locking in which a slow convergence is observed when thin plates are analyzed reduced and selective reduced integration procedures have proven to be effective at dealing with shear locking zienkiewicz et al 1971 hughes et al 1978 hughes 1980 however these techniques are known to produce spurious energy modes on the other hand if high order interpolation functions are used in the ritz method the influence of the shear locking phenomenon is greatly reduced the fundamentals of the ritz method is described in refs leissa 2005 gander and wanner 2012 ilanko et al 2014 it is well known that the accuracy and stability of the results is greatly dependent on the shape functions used trigonometric shape functions have been used by fazzolari and carrera 2013a 2011 2014 2013b in order to analyze simply supported plates analysis of shells has also developed as given in refs fazzolari 2016 fazzolari and banerjee 2014 fazzolari and carrera 2013c using polynomial shape functions free vibration analysis of plates arbitrary boundary conditions has been developed by dozio 2013 2011a 2011b 2010 vescovini and dozio 2016 and in the work by dozio and carrera 2011 the compressibility of liquids is often neglected and the error incurred due to this simplification on the hydroelastic vibration of plates is not well identified refs jeong and kim 2005 and liao and ma 2016 show that a significant discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory can arise however it is unknown how this discrepancy varies with geometrical parameters and the solid fluid material properties consequently the aim of this work is to assess the difference in the vibrational behavior when either an incompressible or compressible fluid theory is considered for a variety of cases this is done using the very accurate cuf structural model which can consider displacement theories of arbitrary order and can obtain results similar to 3d finite element solutions with a much lower computational cost a compressible hydrodynamic model based on the velocity potential is coupled with the cuf structural model for the first time the accuracy of the formulation when compared with 3d solutions is demonstrated in the comparison study afterwards parametric studies are performed in order to evaluate the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility 2 analytical modeling a rectangular plate with length a width b and thickness h is considered as shown in fig 1 the coordinates x y z describe the motion of the plate it is assumed that the plate is in contact with a compressible inviscid and irrotational fluid bounded by a rectangular domain with length c width d and depth e as shown in fig 2 the coordinate system x y z is used to describe the fluid motion sloshing effects are neglected and only bulging modes are analyzed in the present study consequently a simplified free surface condition is sufficient the vertical walls and the bottom of the fluid domain are assumed to be rigid except for the region in contact with the top surface of the plate at z 0 or z h 2 the plate is assumed to be linearly elastic homogeneous and isotropic and the amplitude of motion is assumed to be small the energy functional is used to obtain the eigenvalue problem the structural model develops the plate potential energy u and kinetic energy t as in dozio and carrera 2011 however within the nomenclature used in the present manuscript afterwards a hydrodynamic model for the compressible fluid domain is developed in order to obtain the fluid potential energy u w and kinetic energy t w and the coupled fluid structure problem is solved in the frequency domain in order to obtain the natural frequencies of the system 2 1 structural model for convenience the derivation of the structural model is given in non

the initial eigenvalue and eigenvector are obtained by considering the incompressible fluid case i e setting k 0 when the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is high the algorithm must produce a larger eigenvalue modification with respect to the initial incompressible solution consequently large changes in eigenvalues during each iteration are expected this can produce oscillatory divergence between two different vibration modes for example this behavior is observed when a fluid with a low sonic velocity is considered a modified version of the algorithm was successful in obtaining the first five natural frequencies which is based in the following modifications setting a limit in the maximum change of the eigenvalue during each iteration using an under relaxation factor when oscillatory behavior is detected in order to reduce the change of the eigenvalue in each subsequent iteration 2 7 mode shapes and fluid velocity fields in order to obtain the j vibrational mode it is required to perform a summation of the set of admissible functions evaluated at the point of interest times the term with indices τ i of the eigenvector x j for each of the generalized displacement variables afterwards the use of eq 11 is required in order to obtain the plate displacement amplitudes for the displacement in the z axis it is given as follows 80 m o d e j ξ η z τ 0 n i 1 m x w τ i j f τ z ψ w τ i ξ η values of the velocity potential in the fluid domain associated with the j mode shape can be obtained by substituting the coefficients of the x j eigenvector in eq 64 and then combining with eqs 34 and 39 the coefficient a p q is derived as follows 81 a p q ε p q d f p q d ζ ζ 0 γ p f τ z z h 2 c w τ i ψ w τ i ξ η cos p π ξ cos q π η d ξ d η in eq 81 the variables ξ η must be expressed in terms of the variables ξ η in order to evaluate the integral over γ p the relation between both sets of non dimensional variables is dependent on the geometry if the plate geometric center is coincident with the geometric center of the bottom of the fluid domain this relation is given as follows 82 ξ a c ξ 1 2 1 a c η b d η 1 2 1 b d after obtaining each coefficient a p q and substituting into eq 34 the velocity potential can be evaluated in order to determine amplitudes of velocity the velocity potential is differentiated with respect to the variables x y or z in order to obtain velocities in the x y and z axis respectively 3 numerical results and discussion the present formulation has been used in a matlab code and in the present section numerical results are given the boundary conditions of the plate are described using a four letter symbolic notation letters s and c denote simply supported and clamped edges respectively the boundaries of the plate are numbered in a counterclockwise manner starting from x 0 the natural frequencies are given in the following non dimensional form 83 ω ω a 2 ρ h d where ω is the natural frequency given in rad s and d is the flexural rigidity of the plate i e d e h 3 12 1 v 2 the plate geometric center is assumed to be coincident with the geometric center of the bottom of the fluid domain in all the numerical results in all the tables pm stands for present method 3 1 convergence study the stability of the results as the number of trigonometric terms p q and the polynomial degree of the ritz expansion p is analyzed in the present sub section a cccc plate with parameters given in table 1 is considered table 2 presents the non dimensional natural frequencies of a cccc plate as the polynomial degree p is increased considering p q 10 slower convergence is observed when higher expansion orders n are considered results within 0 25 of the converged solution is obtained by using a polynomial degree p 11 in the present work a polynomial degree p 15 is considered sufficiently accurate and is used in the remainder of the manuscript table 3 presents the non dimensional natural frequencies of a cccc plate as the number of trigonometric terms p q is increased and for various fluid domain width plate width ratios d b equal number of trigonometric terms in the x and y directions is considered for the case with d b 1 coincident plate and fluid domain bottom surface results within 0 20 of the converge solution can be obtained by using p q 6 however as the fluid domain size is increased more trigonometric terms are required the present work considers numerical results with d b 3 and thus for computational efficiency the number of trigonometric terms used is p q 10 when d b 1 and p q 24 when 1 d b 3 3 2 validation of the results a numerical example is developed and the results from the present theory are compared with ref liao and ma 2016 and with results from a finite element software a 3d fem solution for the free vibration of a plate coupled with a compressible fluid domain has been developed using ansys general purpose program the three dimensional model is made of 20 node 3d fluid elements fluid220 and 20 node 3d solid elements solid186 with the same size as shown in fig 3 the parameters used in the numerical example are given in table 1 the fluid domain is segmented into 128000 80 40 x 40 elements and the plate is divided into 6400 80 40 x 2 elements the viscosity of the fluid is neglected the boundary conditions for the fluid domain are given in eqs 18 20 the coupling is considered by activating the fluid structure interaction flag in the fluid elements adjacent to the solid elements in order to satisfy eq 21 table 4 presents the first five natural frequencies of the plate in contact with a compressible fluid domain considering cccc and ssss boundary conditions results from the present theory for various expansion orders n ref liao and ma 2016 and from the 3d fem solution previously described are provided the maximum and average difference of the results compared to the 3d fem solution is also given higher errors are observed when cccc boundaries are considered accurate results are obtained considering the expansion order n 3 and this is further used in the present work analytical results from ref liao and ma 2016 are less accurate since the kirchhoff plate theory was used it must be mentioned that finite elements results using ansys software given in ref liao and ma 2016 have been obtained meshing the plate with shell63 elements in the present work 3d solid elements have been used to model the plate with elements in the thickness direction and thus higher accuracy of the fem results is expected fig 4 shows the first five mode shapes of the plate in contact with fluid obtained by the present formulation and by the 3d fem solution the agreement between both methods is evident 3 3 parametric studies the effect of various parameters in the natural frequencies is considered by analyzing a plate using the parameters given in table 5 as a baseline case where the fluid is considered as water note that these parameters are similar as the ones given in table 1 except that a b 1 and c d 1 the discrepancy between incompressible fluid theory ift and compressible fluid theory cft is reported in the tables and it is defined as follows 84 discrepancy results from ift results from cft results from cft 100 the present model can reproduce an incompressible fluid as a special case when the speed of sound in the fluid is infinite considering c 0 inf in eq 17 85 2 ϕ 0 in ω eq 85 describes the velocity potential associated to an incompressible fluid as it is well known from fluid mechanics 3 3 1 effect of plate thickness ratio table 6 presents the first four non dimensional natural frequencies of a plate in contact with a fluid domain for various plate thickness ratios h b results considering an incompressible ift and compressible cft fluid are given as well as the discrepancy for thin plates with h b 0 01 the discrepancy is negligible 0 2 on the other hand for thicker plates the discrepancy increases fig 5 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a plate in contact with a fluid domain as a function of the plate thickness ratio the relative error due to neglecting fluid compressibility is higher for plates with clamped boundary conditions and is significant for thick plates with h b 0 05 3 3 2 effect of plate aspect ratio table 7 presents the first four non dimensional natural frequencies of a plate in contact with a fluid domain for various plate aspect ratios a b the discrepancy is seen to be reduced as the aspect ratio increases in particular for ssss plates with a b 2 the relative error due to neglecting fluid compressibility is negligible on the first natural frequency being less than 1 fig 6 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a plate in contact with a fluid domain as a function of the plate aspect ratio as the plate length increases the discrepancy converges asymptotically to a value dependent on the boundary conditions at the edges parallel to the x axis i e at y 0 and y b 3 3 3 effect of plate material properties figure 7 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a plate in contact with a fluid domain as a function of the plate young s modulus e and the plate density ρ for cccc and ssss boundary conditions it is observed that the discrepancy increases dramatically for stiff and light materials the discrepancy for an aluminum plate e 69 g p a ρ 2705 k g m 3 with clamped edges is 7 7 on the other hand the relative error due to neglecting fluid compressibility when the plate is made of steel e 200 g p a ρ 7850 k g m 3 is much higher being 14 when simply supported plates are considered the discrepancy decreases considerably being 2 1 and 3 8 for the aluminum and steel plate respectively 3 3 4 effect of fluid domain depth table 8 presents the first four non dimensional natural frequencies of a plate in contact with a fluid domain for various fluid domain depth plate width ratios e b it can be observed that the discrepancy for the first natural frequency ω 1 increases as the fluid domain depth increases on the other hand the natural frequencies ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 are only slightly affected due to fluid domain depth for both the incompressible and compressible fluid theory due to this the discrepancy for these frequencies is nearly constant with respect to the fluid depth fig 8 shows the discrepancy in the first three natural frequencies as the fluid domain depth is increased the influence of the fluid depth on the discrepancy in ω 2 ω 3 is seen to be nearly zero beyond e b 1 5 this behavior can be explained by examining the mode shapes fig 9 shows the first five mode shapes of the vertical displacement of a plate in contact with a fluid domain considering e b 2 in the mode shapes associated to the frequencies ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 the net vertical displacement of the fluid is minimal due to the antisymmetric nature of the mode shapes it is suspected that this is the reason that ω 2 ω 3 and ω 4 are nearly independent of the fluid depth and thus the discrepancy in these frequencies remains constant on the other hand in the mode shape associated to the frequency ω 1 the net vertical displacement of the fluid is maximum and the influence of the fluid depth on this frequency is expected to be significant 3 3 5 effect of fluid domain length and width fig 10 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a plate in contact with fluid as a function of the fluid domain width plate width ratio d b note that the fluid domain length is also modified since c d 1 concordant with the baseline case parameters given in table 5 as the fluid domain width d increases with respect to the plate width b the discrepancy is seen to decrease contrary to what is observed when the fluid domain depth e is increased in conjunction with the results from the previous sub section it can be expected that for a plate in contact with a wide and deep fluid domain the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is moderate on the other hand if the fluid domain is deep but with the same bottom size as the plate the discrepancy can be considerable 3 3 6 effect of fluid properties fig 11 shows the discrepancy in the first natural frequency of a plate in contact with a fluid domain as a function of the fluid sonic velocity c 0 and the fluid density ρ w for cccc and ssss boundary conditions as the fluid density increases the relative error due to neglecting fluid compressibility decreases however it must be noted that for fluids with higher densities the added mass effect is increased and thus the difference between natural frequencies in vacuum and in contact with a fluid domain considering either an incompressible or compressible fluid is higher in addition when the sound velocity in the fluid decreases the discrepancy is higher as expected 3 4 velocity fields the influence of the fluid compressibility in the velocity fields of the fluid is assessed in this section a cccc plate coupled to a fluid domain described by the parameters given in table 5 but with e b 2 is considered according to the values in table 8 the discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is large with 20 7 difference for ω 1 and 7 4 difference for ω 4 fig 12 shows velocity vector plots on the planes x 0 z 0 and y 1 of the fluid domain for the first five natural frequencies considering compressible fluid theory the continuity of the fluid velocity is evident in fig 12 fig 13 shows similar velocity plots but considering incompressible fluid theory assuming c 0 infinite by comparing figs 12 and 13 it can be observed that the compressibility of the fluid has negligible influence on the velocity fields in the fluid domain 4 conclusions an analytical solution for the free vibration analysis of thick rectangular isotropic plates coupled with a compressible bounded fluid has been presented the accuracy of the cuf model used in the structural model is evident from the comparison with the 3d fem solutions the influence of the compressibility on the natural frequencies has been studied by performing parametric studies the following conclusions can be stated related to the error due to neglecting fluid compressibility in the vibrational behavior of plates in contact with a fluid domain a in thick plates h b 0 05 the error is high on the other hand in thin plates h b 0 01 the compressibility effects are negligible b in square stiff and light plates the error is higher compared to rectangular non square flexible and heavy plates c fluid depth influences only certain natural frequencies of a submerged plate depending of the symmetric or the antisymmetric nature of the mode shape d the discrepancy for the first natural frequency of a submerged plate increases with fluid depth e in plates coupled to a wide fluid domain the error is lower compared to a fluid domain with the same bottom size as the plate f if light fluids are considered a higher discrepancy between incompressible and compressible fluid theory is observed however the added mass effect of the fluid the difference with the behavior in vacuum is lower 
23739,a new type of floating wind turbine in which the floater itself can rotate from the wind is proposed in this paper a new single point mooring system is necessary for the development of this new wind turbine in this paper the single point mooring system which includes component such as catenary chains the slip ring for the electric cable and the control cable were researched this work will examine two different configurations of the single point mooring system that we developed one uses a thrust bearing at the connecting points between the mooring parts and the floater parts the other one uses not only a thrust bearing but also an aligning bearing weather vane tests about the offshore wind turbine with each mooring system were conducted in an ocean basin after performing wind tests of both configurations of the single point mooring system it was concluded that the latter one functioned superior to the former one this work discusses and clarifies the reason based on a physics model which focuses on the relation between the restoring yaw moment caused by the mooring chains and the static friction moment due to the bearing unit we also performed a wind test at a real sea and verified that the bearing unit with not only the thrust bearing but also the aligning bearing could function properly keywords single point mooring system floating offshore wind turbine weather vane system real sea test 1 introduction utilizing ocean renewable energy is promising as an efficient energy resource in the future particularly offshore wind energy is one of the most anticipated solutions in japan s case we have a vast exclusive economic zone eez new energy and industrial technology in japan has estimated that the potential quality of wind power can reach from roughly 1500 million kw to 1600 million kw floating wind turbines fwts can be used for this even if the sea depth is over 50 m for this reason fwts are researched and developed all over the world for example the first full scale fwt is being tested off the shores of norway hywind demo 2009 in the hywind project a 2 3 mw wind turbine is mounted on a spar type platform with four catenary chains another fwt project is being performed off the shores of portugal windfloat 2011 in that project a 2 0 mw wind turbine is mounted on a three column semi submersible a 7 mw semi submersible floating wind turbine in which the tower of the turbine stands on one of the three columns of the semi submersible similar to windfloat was recently manufactured by mitsubishi heavy industry mhi http www fukushima forward jp english mhi s fwt was installed near the shores of fukushima japan and as of 2016 is currently being tested for power functionality and it s cost efficiency performance is also being measured as well many other projects like these are also being conducted all over the world goto fowt 2013 deepcwind consortium 2013 we would like to mention some technical problems here regarding offshore wind turbines in the case of horizontal wind turbines blades a rotor a blade pitch control motor a shaft a gear box a generator a yaw control unit and many other mechanical components are located on the top of the tower this top heavy state leads to the floater being heavier and bigger it is better for some mechanical parts to be set below the tower in addition when an electricity based accident occurs in severe weather conditions the yaw control gear or the pitch control gear will not function in the case of trouble with the yaw control gear the wind turbine will fail to move properly based on the direction of the wind causing potential blade damage due to the lack of control if the wind conditions are too harsh pitch control motor failure is also a problem for the horizontal wind turbines faulstich et al 2011 this motor failure leads to heavy bending at the base of the tower due to too much thrust force damage to the tower as a result of this heavy bending has been reported the accident investigation committee of wind park kasatori power plant 2013 mizukami et al 2016 our new concept for a floating wind turbine adopts the single point mooring system the first small model test which used a 1 100 model of the 5 mw wind turbine with a stainless wire as its mooring cable was conducted murai et al 2014 the authors pointed out that the attachment point of the mooring cables must not be attached to the bottom of the floater but rather some distance between the rotation axis and the point of the wind load is needed for the fwt to follow the direction of the wind they conducted weather vane tests for the offshore wind turbine in an ocean basin the weather vane test checks to see it the wind turbine can rotate appropriately in order for the turbine to obtain wind power recently other fwts using a single point mooring system were developed and studied sway in norway proposed and developed a spar type fwt using a single mooring system in 2012 sway 2012 they performed a 1 5 scale test with the single point mooring but with a tension leg as its mooring line in order to restrict the movement of the fwt iijima et al performed a scale model test of a semi submersible fwt iijima et al 2013 their semi submersible fwt was moored by a single point mooring but with the tension leg as its mooring cable they evaluated the slewing motion of the semi submersible fwt iijima et al 2015 in their study they derived a system of equations to outline the turning motions in the horizontal plane under various environmental conditions then the stability of the turning motion of the fwt was simulated another example of a single point mooring being used for a fwt was the company scd who created the nezzy fwt scd technology 2014 in the field of fpso technologies some previous studies about single point mooring systems have been conducted the single point mooring system which was composed of a floating structure and an articulated tower was analyzed by observing demonstrations of the simple harmonic motion of the floating vessel and the tower in waves chakrabarti and cotter 1989 in the designing of the single point mooring systems the dynamic stability of the weather vane motion was discussed obokata 1987 in that paper he applied his dynamic stability analysis to the single point mooring vessel there has been some research which addressed the dynamic behavior of the horizontal motion of the single point mooring vessel obokata and nakajima 1988 jiang et al 1995 nishimoto et al 2002 the research paid attention not only to the horizontal motion of the vessel but also to the mooring tensions in addition the effect of the turret mooring location on the vertical movement of the vessel which was caused by waves was investigated thiagarajan and finch 1999 in another study a self tuning fuzzy controller for the dynamic positioning system of a single point mooring vessel was tested and applied to the fpso system inoue and du 1996 when we apply the single point mooring system to an offshore wind turbine this system is roughly composed of the mooring chains the rotation axis the bearing unit and the slip ring for the electric cables as mentioned above some research about this system has been conducted however the specifics of the mechanics component are not clear so in this paper two types of the single point mooring system will be designed in order to study the physics model of this mooring system to achieve the weather vane effect the requirements for the single point mooring system are clarified in section 4 of this paper we conducted a tank test and a real sea test using an offshore wind turbine model with single point mooring in this paper we will show the results of the weather vane tests 2 test model 2 1 wind turbine model and floater model we considered the detailed principal particulars of fwt which is based on the design method of fwt the japanese industrial standards jis c 1400 and wind energy handbook were referred to for the design of the wind turbine japanese standards association 2013 burton et al 2011 table 1 shows the principal particulars of the wind turbine considering the power output the diameter of the rotor is 2 4 m the naca 4412 was selected as the wind turbine blade the blade is made of urethane and there is a carbon fiber reinforced plastics rod inside each blades for reinforcement the pitch control gear is located inside the nacelle fig 1 shows a photo of the completed wind turbine also there is no yaw control system since the single point mooring system itself can function as the yaw control system table 2 shows the principal particulars of the floating body the floating body is designed considering not only the buoyancy but also the natural frequency of the floating body the natural period of the heave and pitch is 1 9 s and 3 7 s respectively fig 2 shows the 2d cad drawing of the fwt the floating body consists of two parts one is a spar part that is made of steel and the other is a floater part the spar part has a diameter of 0 609 m and a length of 2 78 m the floater part has a diameter of 1 2 m the fwt model mentioned in this section is used not only for the tank test but also for the real sea test for this reason we don t have to take scale into consideration for building the model more detailed information about this fwt can be found in this paper matsuda et al 2015 nihei et al 2015 in the case of a single point mooring system the slewing motion of the mooring system must be considered however the natural period of the slewing motion was not considered in this work 2 2 mooring system 2 2 1 weather vane system for an offshore wind turbine a new single point mooring system for offshore wind turbines was proposed murai et al 2014 fig 3 shows a schematic chart of the system as shown in fig 3 an appropriate distance between the mooring point and the application point of the wind force is necessary in order to create the weather vane effect when the wind force blows on the wind turbine rotational moment around the mooring point occurs eventually the wind turbine rotates in the appropriate position where the turbine can obtain wind power in this case the appropriate position for that to occur is down wind in the test the mooring line is one wire cable the swivel fig 3 acts as a free joint between the mooring line and the floater when an electric cable and a control cable that is connected onshore are used these cables should be passed through at least two mooring lines or a pipe as not to twist the cables together 2 2 2 weather vane system type 1 we developed a practical weather vane system based on the study that was introduced in section 2 2 1 fig 4 shows a fundamental structure of the system we will refer to it as type 1 in this paper the part of the floating body with the wind turbine is named fwt floating body with wind turbine and the rotation axis is named ra rotation axis the mooring chains are connected at the upper part of the ra through the hollow steel pipe and fairleads the electrical cable and the control cable are attached at the slip ring and are passed through the pipe the members of the solid lines shown in fig 4 b and c are connected each other so they do not rotate because of the chains when the fwt receives the wind the fwt rotates around the ra until it reaches the appropriate position the resinous thrust bearing as shown in fig 5 is used to make the fwt rotate smoothly around the ra the slip ring to connect the electric cable and the control cable is shown in fig 6 type 1 can be summarized as follows resinous thrust bearings are used for the upper and lower part the mooring chains are connected at the upper part of the ra 2 2 3 weather vane system type 2 in this section another weather vane system we developed is mentioned it will be referred to as type 2 in this paper fig 7 shows a fundamental structure of the system similar to type1 the electric cables pass through a steel pipe the differences from type 1 are as follows a thrust bearing fig 8 a and an aligning bearing fig 8 b which allow the steel pipe to become more flexible are used together at the upper part of the ra both bearings are stainless steel the lower part of the structure is submerged in water so a stainless steel bearing cannot be used therefore flexible rubber which functions as a fender when the pipe contorts is used instead the steel chains are connected at the bottom of the ra the steel pipe and the attachment structure of the chains are fixed and do not rotate type 2 can be summarized as follows a thrust bearing and an aligning bearing are used together at the upper part of the ra the lower part of the ra is composed of flexible rubber steel chains are connected at the bottom of the ra 3 physics model of the weather vane system a physics model that explains how a weather vane system functions will be introduced here we are specifically going to focus on the rotation device and discuss which configuration of the rotation device is effective and why as shown in fig 9 the relation between the yaw moment caused by the friction in the connecting point and the restoring yaw moment caused by the mooring system is the focal point here whether the system functions or not depends on whether the restoring yaw moment caused by the mooring system is larger than the static frictional yaw moment due to the bearing system or other small factors so we can formulate this idea as follows 1 m r m f where m r is the restoring yaw moment caused by the mooring system m f is the yaw moment caused by static friction due to the bearing system or the other small factors a static frictional moment m f must be measured in the test however the restoring yaw moment m r caused by the mooring system can be calculated by the catenary theory taking its geometrical configuration into account the derivation process of the restoring moment used in this work will be shown by using some figures the left model in fig 10 shows the mooring point under normal conditions the right model shows the mooring point with the fwt and the ra rotated by 90 counterclockwise fig 11 shows the mooring system of the right model as seen from above when the rotation axis twists θ degree in the yaw direction the horizontal force caused by mooring cable can be calculated by the geometrical conditions as shown in fig 11 after the horizontal force is calculated the restoring yaw moment mr in the rotation direction can be obtained here i designates the number of the mooring cables then the restoring yaw moment is expressed by multiplying each moment lever l i by the restoring force fr i as follows m r i 1 n n f r i l i fr i value is a projected value and includes a factor sin α α being the angle between the mooring line horizontal force vector and the lever arm vector with length value equal to the horizontal distance from the axis to the top connection point of a mooring line to the platform if α reaches 180 deg then mr 0 4 experiment and discussion on the single point mooring system to know whether a weather vane system functions or not is the most important and unknown part of a fwt with the single point mooring system in this work we are focusing on the relation between the frictional moment of the bearing unit and the restoring yaw moment of the mooring cable when the fwt rotates there is the possibility of the mooring cables becoming twisted figuring out the requirements in order for this not to happen has proven to be a challenging point throughout this experiment for this purpose we measured the static frictional moment of the bearing unit we are also going to show the weather vane experiment results and discuss the key factors of the single point mooring device using the physics model we proposed in section 3 in this case the down wind turbine that we developed was used in this scenario the floating wind turbine has to rotate around the single point mooring system until it reaches the down wind position even if the floating wind turbine is upwind it needs to be able to rotate into the downwind position 4 1 set up of the experiment 4 1 1 set up of the weather vane test whether the weather vane system functions or not is confirmed by a visual observation we carried out weather vane tests at an ocean basin at the university of tokyo this basin is 5 m in depth 10 m in width and 50 m in length respectively the wind in the tank can only blow in one direction this facility also has a device that can create waves and control the current of the water in the tank however our experiment had no need for this device as we focused solely on the effects of the wind rather than the effects of the water fig 12 designates the relation between the fwt the ra and a wind making machine using an x y coordinate system the wind blows from the upper side to the lower side in this figure the origin o is fixed on the ra a rotating coordinate system as seen in fig 13 is also used as commonly known when the fwt is located at 0 deg it is said that the fwt is set in the down wind position the weather vane test is summarized as follows in figs 12 and 13 the fwt shown in black is located 90deg as its initial position as an example if the fwt can rotate around the ra the fwt moves to the 0deg position shown in a translucent color the weather vane test was carried out multiple times with the starting position of the fwt and the velocity of the wind being the only variances the fwt s starting point was rotated for each test each time by 45 for 2 min wind would blow on the turbine and we observed the fwt to confirm whether rotation occurred or not 4 1 2 set up of the measurement of the static friction in this test the factors that have an effect on the static friction of the ra can be revealed fig 14 illustrates the schematic chart of the measurement system we conducted this test outside of the tank the floater was set in place using a jig to hold the floater then the handle of the ra was pulled using a spring balance to measure the static friction of the ra the tests were carried out under four different conditions details of the condition are shown in subsection 4 2 2 4 1 3 set up of the measurement of the static friction in the yaw direction of the floating wind turbine we measured the static friction in yaw direction of the floating wind turbine fig 15 illustrates the measurement set up first the ra is fixed by ropes not to rotate with the fwt second the fwt is pulled in the tangential direction using a spring balance when the fwt starts to rotate we measured its load the test is performed at the same ocean basin as mentioned in subsection 4 1 1 the tests were carried out five times for each of the two types of fwt 4 2 test results and discussion 4 2 1 the type1 system weather vane test whether the weather vane system functions or not is confirmed by a visual observation the overview of the tank can be seen in fig 16 this test is conducted by following the procedure mentioned in 4 1 1 fig 17 shows the underwater photos of type 1 fig 17 a shows the initial state while b shows the result immediately after the floater started to rotate as shown in fig 17 b the mooring system didn t generate a large enough restoring moment in the yaw direction and the mooring chains twisted together in b the dotted lines show the chains which were twisted together 4 2 2 examination of the factors of the static friction the purpose of this test is to examine the factors of the static friction of type 1 and to derive a new bearing system the test was conducted according to the set up mentioned in subsection 4 1 2 as shown in fig 18 a the measurement of the ra with no extra weight was taken in order to be used as the control experiment case 1 in case 2 weights were hung at both sides of the handles as shown in fig 18 b in this case the weights are used to simulate the weight of the removed mooring chains three kinds of weights are used here the weights used here are 20 40 and 60kgf case 3 in fig 18 c is an asymmetric pattern in which a 40kgf weight is hung at one side of the handle when the fwt floats environmental loads such as wind loads wave loads and current loads act on the floating body the ra may become tilted in case 3 the effects of these asymmetric conditions are simulated in case 4 as illustrated in fig 18 d the resinous bearing at the bottom is removed in order to figure out how to make the static friction smaller using only the resinous bearing at the top under these same conditions an asymmetric test using a 40kgf weight was also carried out fig 19 shows each static frictional moment obtained from the experiments each test was carried out in five times the bar graphs represent the averaged values while the error bars show the maximum value and the minimum value of each test the distance between the center of the ra and the attached point of the spring balance the handle is 100 mm from these results the following points can be observed in the symmetrical test the static friction increases in proportion to the weight the increasing rate of static frictional moment in relation to the weight attached to the ra is estimated at roughly 0 012kgfm kgf in the asymmetrical test even when a 40kgf weight is used the static friction is almost the same as that of the 60kgf weight during the symmetrical test out of all the tests the bottom free condition has the smallest amount of static friction however the asymmetric weight condition makes the static friction larger even when the resinous bearing at the bottom is removed another single point mooring system type 2 was introduced based on the above results that is the reduction of the number of bearings and reduction of the weight of the mooring chains are effective for decreasing the amount of static friction in addition an aligning bearing which allows the steel pipe to become more flexible during the movement of the ra is effective too 4 3 measurement of the static friction of the bearing unit in the yaw direction we discovered that the small yaw restoring moment due to the mooring system is one of two major reasons why the single point mooring system does not function as intended the other major reason is the large amount of static friction caused by the mooring system which makes it difficult for the ra to rotate so we measured the static friction of the bearing unit in the yaw direction the measurement results are shown in fig 20 the tests were carried out five times for each of the two types of fwt the distance between the center of the ra and the spring balance is 1 100 mm the static friction moment of the bearing unit can be calculated by multiplying the load of the spring balance by the distance of the fulcrum the results are shown in fig 20 as well the averaged values are also shown there fig 20 shows the results of the type 2 fwt pulled by a spring balance as shown in fig 15 according to these results the average static friction moment of the type 2 fwt is roughly 77 8 less than that of type1 fwt 4 4 discussion using physics model the physics model as we proposed in section 3 will be used to discuss why the type 1 fwt did not function as intended and why type 2 fwt did function as intended during the weather vane test fig 21 shows the relation between the restoring yaw moment due to the mooring chains and the static frictional moment obtained from the tank test for the type 1 fwt in this calculation the length of the chains is 6 5 m and the density of the chains per meter is 1 5kgf m water depth is set as 5 m essentially the restoring yaw moment of the chains increases depending on the yaw displacement of the fwt the horizontal axis designates the yaw displacement of the fwt while the vertical axis shows the restoring moment and the static friction moment as we previously mentioned the requirement of m r m f is necessary for the fwt to function because that requirement cannot be fulfilled the type 1 fwt cannot function at all in the same manner as figs 21 and 22 shows the same results as fig 21 but for the type 2 fwt instead from these results the requirement of m r m f is satisfied when the fwt rotates at least roughly 40deg in the yaw direction photos from videos we took of type2 are shown in fig 23 the wind turbine with type 2 is located at 180deg from the initial state in fig 23 a after the wind blew the wind turbine rotated around the rotational axis ra as shown in fig 23 b eventually the wind turbine moved to the downwind position in fig 23 c 5 real sea test 5 1 summary of the real sea test after the tank test the real sea test was carried out for about two months in anamizu cho ishikawa prefecture japan the test site and the setting point of our offshore wind turbine are shown in fig 24 in fig 25 the water depth which we measured by using a depth gauge is seen as well the c cross section shown in fig 25 is illustrated in fig 24 the water depth gradually becomes shallower the closer it is to land the average water depth is about 7 8 m using a website called neowins which shows a map detailing various wind conditions we calculated that the annual average wind velocity is 4 2 m s at a 10 m height from the sea surface neowinds 2017 the sea state was calm since the site is inside the bay see fig 26 the rotation angle of the floater is measured by using a position sensor inside the slip ring the wind speed and the wind direction are measured at point x as seen in fig 24 in addition the three axis acceleration of the nacelle and the bending moment of the tower are also measured every minute by various sensors and sent to the measurement room on shore via a telemeter device in the area where we conducted the test the tide level in our test period was small and the tidal current in that area was also very small the electric power produced by the fwt is sent to the land through an electric cable the pitch control system and the braking system of the turbine are connected to the shore control cable the detailed information of our real sea test can be referred to in the paper written by one of the author of this paper nihei et al 2015 matsuda et al 2015 5 2 test result as shown in fig 27 when the offshore wind turbine is located the south of the rotation axis facing north we will define that as 0 location will be shown in an ascending order clockwise from the top down view in figs 28 and 29 the results of weather vane tests are shown the blue and green dotted mark shows the wind direction and the direction of the offshore wind turbine respectively the solid red line shows the wind speed the horizontal axis shows the time sec and the vertical axis shows the wind speed left or the direction right it can be verified that the offshore wind turbine rotated following the wind direction from 1900 s to 2000 s the offshore wind turbine also rotated following to the wind direction from 2300 s to 2400 s on the other hand some wind velocity is necessary to rotate around the mooring axis when the wind velocity was less than about 3 m s 3 m s was the average from 380 s to 480 s the weather vane system didn t work it is hypothesized that whether weather vane system works or doesn t work is based on the wind speed the upper structure of the offshore wind turbine the inertia of the floater and many other factors this problem will be discussed in the next work 6 conclusion a new type of floating wind tubine in which the single point mooring is equipped as a mooring system was designed in this work the following conclusions were obtained this work examined two different configurations of the single point mooring system the type 1 configuration uses a thrust bearing which is made of resin at the connecting points between the mooring parts and the floater parts the type 2 configuration uses not only a thrust bearing but also an aligning bearing which is made of stainless steel the lower part of the rotational axis of the type 2 configuration uses flexible rubber the static friction of the bearing unit in the mooring system in both configurations was clarified in the tank test the average static frictional moment of the type 2 configuration is roughly 77 8 less than that of the type 1 configuration the physics model that focused on the yaw moment caused by the friction in the connecting point and the restoring yaw moment caused by the mooring chains is introduced in the present paper the physics model clarified why type 1 did not function during the weather vane test the real sea test was carried out using the type 2 configuration fwt when the average wind blows over 3 m s it is verified that the type 2 did function however it didn t function when the average wind speed was under 3 m s recently floating wind turbines with a single point mooring system are being developed when designing a mooring system special attention should be paid to the relation between the static friction of the bearing unit and the restoring yaw moment of the chains at present 700 w is the targeted power output in full scale however it can be typically concluded that the relationship between the static friction of the bearing unit and the restoring yaw moment of the mooring chains needs to be carefully evaluated even for multi mega watt fowt systems depending on the mooring and bearing characteristics in this paper the importance and relevance of this relation is clarified not only based on physics model but also through tank test results 
23739,a new type of floating wind turbine in which the floater itself can rotate from the wind is proposed in this paper a new single point mooring system is necessary for the development of this new wind turbine in this paper the single point mooring system which includes component such as catenary chains the slip ring for the electric cable and the control cable were researched this work will examine two different configurations of the single point mooring system that we developed one uses a thrust bearing at the connecting points between the mooring parts and the floater parts the other one uses not only a thrust bearing but also an aligning bearing weather vane tests about the offshore wind turbine with each mooring system were conducted in an ocean basin after performing wind tests of both configurations of the single point mooring system it was concluded that the latter one functioned superior to the former one this work discusses and clarifies the reason based on a physics model which focuses on the relation between the restoring yaw moment caused by the mooring chains and the static friction moment due to the bearing unit we also performed a wind test at a real sea and verified that the bearing unit with not only the thrust bearing but also the aligning bearing could function properly keywords single point mooring system floating offshore wind turbine weather vane system real sea test 1 introduction utilizing ocean renewable energy is promising as an efficient energy resource in the future particularly offshore wind energy is one of the most anticipated solutions in japan s case we have a vast exclusive economic zone eez new energy and industrial technology in japan has estimated that the potential quality of wind power can reach from roughly 1500 million kw to 1600 million kw floating wind turbines fwts can be used for this even if the sea depth is over 50 m for this reason fwts are researched and developed all over the world for example the first full scale fwt is being tested off the shores of norway hywind demo 2009 in the hywind project a 2 3 mw wind turbine is mounted on a spar type platform with four catenary chains another fwt project is being performed off the shores of portugal windfloat 2011 in that project a 2 0 mw wind turbine is mounted on a three column semi submersible a 7 mw semi submersible floating wind turbine in which the tower of the turbine stands on one of the three columns of the semi submersible similar to windfloat was recently manufactured by mitsubishi heavy industry mhi http www fukushima forward jp english mhi s fwt was installed near the shores of fukushima japan and as of 2016 is currently being tested for power functionality and it s cost efficiency performance is also being measured as well many other projects like these are also being conducted all over the world goto fowt 2013 deepcwind consortium 2013 we would like to mention some technical problems here regarding offshore wind turbines in the case of horizontal wind turbines blades a rotor a blade pitch control motor a shaft a gear box a generator a yaw control unit and many other mechanical components are located on the top of the tower this top heavy state leads to the floater being heavier and bigger it is better for some mechanical parts to be set below the tower in addition when an electricity based accident occurs in severe weather conditions the yaw control gear or the pitch control gear will not function in the case of trouble with the yaw control gear the wind turbine will fail to move properly based on the direction of the wind causing potential blade damage due to the lack of control if the wind conditions are too harsh pitch control motor failure is also a problem for the horizontal wind turbines faulstich et al 2011 this motor failure leads to heavy bending at the base of the tower due to too much thrust force damage to the tower as a result of this heavy bending has been reported the accident investigation committee of wind park kasatori power plant 2013 mizukami et al 2016 our new concept for a floating wind turbine adopts the single point mooring system the first small model test which used a 1 100 model of the 5 mw wind turbine with a stainless wire as its mooring cable was conducted murai et al 2014 the authors pointed out that the attachment point of the mooring cables must not be attached to the bottom of the floater but rather some distance between the rotation axis and the point of the wind load is needed for the fwt to follow the direction of the wind they conducted weather vane tests for the offshore wind turbine in an ocean basin the weather vane test checks to see it the wind turbine can rotate appropriately in order for the turbine to obtain wind power recently other fwts using a single point mooring system were developed and studied sway in norway proposed and developed a spar type fwt using a single mooring system in 2012 sway 2012 they performed a 1 5 scale test with the single point mooring but with a tension leg as its mooring line in order to restrict the movement of the fwt iijima et al performed a scale model test of a semi submersible fwt iijima et al 2013 their semi submersible fwt was moored by a single point mooring but with the tension leg as its mooring cable they evaluated the slewing motion of the semi submersible fwt iijima et al 2015 in their study they derived a system of equations to outline the turning motions in the horizontal plane under various environmental conditions then the stability of the turning motion of the fwt was simulated another example of a single point mooring being used for a fwt was the company scd who created the nezzy fwt scd technology 2014 in the field of fpso technologies some previous studies about single point mooring systems have been conducted the single point mooring system which was composed of a floating structure and an articulated tower was analyzed by observing demonstrations of the simple harmonic motion of the floating vessel and the tower in waves chakrabarti and cotter 1989 in the designing of the single point mooring systems the dynamic stability of the weather vane motion was discussed obokata 1987 in that paper he applied his dynamic stability analysis to the single point mooring vessel there has been some research which addressed the dynamic behavior of the horizontal motion of the single point mooring vessel obokata and nakajima 1988 jiang et al 1995 nishimoto et al 2002 the research paid attention not only to the horizontal motion of the vessel but also to the mooring tensions in addition the effect of the turret mooring location on the vertical movement of the vessel which was caused by waves was investigated thiagarajan and finch 1999 in another study a self tuning fuzzy controller for the dynamic positioning system of a single point mooring vessel was tested and applied to the fpso system inoue and du 1996 when we apply the single point mooring system to an offshore wind turbine this system is roughly composed of the mooring chains the rotation axis the bearing unit and the slip ring for the electric cables as mentioned above some research about this system has been conducted however the specifics of the mechanics component are not clear so in this paper two types of the single point mooring system will be designed in order to study the physics model of this mooring system to achieve the weather vane effect the requirements for the single point mooring system are clarified in section 4 of this paper we conducted a tank test and a real sea test using an offshore wind turbine model with single point mooring in this paper we will show the results of the weather vane tests 2 test model 2 1 wind turbine model and floater model we considered the detailed principal particulars of fwt which is based on the design method of fwt the japanese industrial standards jis c 1400 and wind energy handbook were referred to for the design of the wind turbine japanese standards association 2013 burton et al 2011 table 1 shows the principal particulars of the wind turbine considering the power output the diameter of the rotor is 2 4 m the naca 4412 was selected as the wind turbine blade the blade is made of urethane and there is a carbon fiber reinforced plastics rod inside each blades for reinforcement the pitch control gear is located inside the nacelle fig 1 shows a photo of the completed wind turbine also there is no yaw control system since the single point mooring system itself can function as the yaw control system table 2 shows the principal particulars of the floating body the floating body is designed considering not only the buoyancy but also the natural frequency of the floating body the natural period of the heave and pitch is 1 9 s and 3 7 s respectively fig 2 shows the 2d cad drawing of the fwt the floating body consists of two parts one is a spar part that is made of steel and the other is a floater part the spar part has a diameter of 0 609 m and a length of 2 78 m the floater part has a diameter of 1 2 m the fwt model mentioned in this section is used not only for the tank test but also for the real sea test for this reason we don t have to take scale into consideration for building the model more detailed information about this fwt can be found in this paper matsuda et al 2015 nihei et al 2015 in the case of a single point mooring system the slewing motion of the mooring system must be considered however the natural period of the slewing motion was not considered in this work 2 2 mooring system 2 2 1 weather vane system for an offshore wind turbine a new single point mooring system for offshore wind turbines was proposed murai et al 2014 fig 3 shows a schematic chart of the system as shown in fig 3 an appropriate distance between the mooring point and the application point of the wind force is necessary in order to create the weather vane effect when the wind force blows on the wind turbine rotational moment around the mooring point occurs eventually the wind turbine rotates in the appropriate position where the turbine can obtain wind power in this case the appropriate position for that to occur is down wind in the test the mooring line is one wire cable the swivel fig 3 acts as a free joint between the mooring line and the floater when an electric cable and a control cable that is connected onshore are used these cables should be passed through at least two mooring lines or a pipe as not to twist the cables together 2 2 2 weather vane system type 1 we developed a practical weather vane system based on the study that was introduced in section 2 2 1 fig 4 shows a fundamental structure of the system we will refer to it as type 1 in this paper the part of the floating body with the wind turbine is named fwt floating body with wind turbine and the rotation axis is named ra rotation axis the mooring chains are connected at the upper part of the ra through the hollow steel pipe and fairleads the electrical cable and the control cable are attached at the slip ring and are passed through the pipe the members of the solid lines shown in fig 4 b and c are connected each other so they do not rotate because of the chains when the fwt receives the wind the fwt rotates around the ra until it reaches the appropriate position the resinous thrust bearing as shown in fig 5 is used to make the fwt rotate smoothly around the ra the slip ring to connect the electric cable and the control cable is shown in fig 6 type 1 can be summarized as follows resinous thrust bearings are used for the upper and lower part the mooring chains are connected at the upper part of the ra 2 2 3 weather vane system type 2 in this section another weather vane system we developed is mentioned it will be referred to as type 2 in this paper fig 7 shows a fundamental structure of the system similar to type1 the electric cables pass through a steel pipe the differences from type 1 are as follows a thrust bearing fig 8 a and an aligning bearing fig 8 b which allow the steel pipe to become more flexible are used together at the upper part of the ra both bearings are stainless steel the lower part of the structure is submerged in water so a stainless steel bearing cannot be used therefore flexible rubber which functions as a fender when the pipe contorts is used instead the steel chains are connected at the bottom of the ra the steel pipe and the attachment structure of the chains are fixed and do not rotate type 2 can be summarized as follows a thrust bearing and an aligning bearing are used together at the upper part of the ra the lower part of the ra is composed of flexible rubber steel chains are connected at the bottom of the ra 3 physics model of the weather vane system a physics model that explains how a weather vane system functions will be introduced here we are specifically going to focus on the rotation device and discuss which configuration of the rotation device is effective and why as shown in fig 9 the relation between the yaw moment caused by the friction in the connecting point and the restoring yaw moment caused by the mooring system is the focal point here whether the system functions or not depends on whether the restoring yaw moment caused by the mooring system is larger than the static frictional yaw moment due to the bearing system or other small factors so we can formulate this idea as follows 1 m r m f where m r is the restoring yaw moment caused by the mooring system m f is the yaw moment caused by static friction due to the bearing system or the other small factors a static frictional moment m f must be measured in the test however the restoring yaw moment m r caused by the mooring system can be calculated by the catenary theory taking its geometrical configuration into account the derivation process of the restoring moment used in this work will be shown by using some figures the left model in fig 10 shows the mooring point under normal conditions the right model shows the mooring point with the fwt and the ra rotated by 90 counterclockwise fig 11 shows the mooring system of the right model as seen from above when the rotation axis twists θ degree in the yaw direction the horizontal force caused by mooring cable can be calculated by the geometrical conditions as shown in fig 11 after the horizontal force is calculated the restoring yaw moment mr in the rotation direction can be obtained here i designates the number of the mooring cables then the restoring yaw moment is expressed by multiplying each moment lever l i by the restoring force fr i as follows m r i 1 n n f r i l i fr i value is a projected value and includes a factor sin α α being the angle between the mooring line horizontal force vector and the lever arm vector with length value equal to the horizontal distance from the axis to the top connection point of a mooring line to the platform if α reaches 180 deg then mr 0 4 experiment and discussion on the single point mooring system to know whether a weather vane system functions or not is the most important and unknown part of a fwt with the single point mooring system in this work we are focusing on the relation between the frictional moment of the bearing unit and the restoring yaw moment of the mooring cable when the fwt rotates there is the possibility of the mooring cables becoming twisted figuring out the requirements in order for this not to happen has proven to be a challenging point throughout this experiment for this purpose we measured the static frictional moment of the bearing unit we are also going to show the weather vane experiment results and discuss the key factors of the single point mooring device using the physics model we proposed in section 3 in this case the down wind turbine that we developed was used in this scenario the floating wind turbine has to rotate around the single point mooring system until it reaches the down wind position even if the floating wind turbine is upwind it needs to be able to rotate into the downwind position 4 1 set up of the experiment 4 1 1 set up of the weather vane test whether the weather vane system functions or not is confirmed by a visual observation we carried out weather vane tests at an ocean basin at the university of tokyo this basin is 5 m in depth 10 m in width and 50 m in length respectively the wind in the tank can only blow in one direction this facility also has a device that can create waves and control the current of the water in the tank however our experiment had no need for this device as we focused solely on the effects of the wind rather than the effects of the water fig 12 designates the relation between the fwt the ra and a wind making machine using an x y coordinate system the wind blows from the upper side to the lower side in this figure the origin o is fixed on the ra a rotating coordinate system as seen in fig 13 is also used as commonly known when the fwt is located at 0 deg it is said that the fwt is set in the down wind position the weather vane test is summarized as follows in figs 12 and 13 the fwt shown in black is located 90deg as its initial position as an example if the fwt can rotate around the ra the fwt moves to the 0deg position shown in a translucent color the weather vane test was carried out multiple times with the starting position of the fwt and the velocity of the wind being the only variances the fwt s starting point was rotated for each test each time by 45 for 2 min wind would blow on the turbine and we observed the fwt to confirm whether rotation occurred or not 4 1 2 set up of the measurement of the static friction in this test the factors that have an effect on the static friction of the ra can be revealed fig 14 illustrates the schematic chart of the measurement system we conducted this test outside of the tank the floater was set in place using a jig to hold the floater then the handle of the ra was pulled using a spring balance to measure the static friction of the ra the tests were carried out under four different conditions details of the condition are shown in subsection 4 2 2 4 1 3 set up of the measurement of the static friction in the yaw direction of the floating wind turbine we measured the static friction in yaw direction of the floating wind turbine fig 15 illustrates the measurement set up first the ra is fixed by ropes not to rotate with the fwt second the fwt is pulled in the tangential direction using a spring balance when the fwt starts to rotate we measured its load the test is performed at the same ocean basin as mentioned in subsection 4 1 1 the tests were carried out five times for each of the two types of fwt 4 2 test results and discussion 4 2 1 the type1 system weather vane test whether the weather vane system functions or not is confirmed by a visual observation the overview of the tank can be seen in fig 16 this test is conducted by following the procedure mentioned in 4 1 1 fig 17 shows the underwater photos of type 1 fig 17 a shows the initial state while b shows the result immediately after the floater started to rotate as shown in fig 17 b the mooring system didn t generate a large enough restoring moment in the yaw direction and the mooring chains twisted together in b the dotted lines show the chains which were twisted together 4 2 2 examination of the factors of the static friction the purpose of this test is to examine the factors of the static friction of type 1 and to derive a new bearing system the test was conducted according to the set up mentioned in subsection 4 1 2 as shown in fig 18 a the measurement of the ra with no extra weight was taken in order to be used as the control experiment case 1 in case 2 weights were hung at both sides of the handles as shown in fig 18 b in this case the weights are used to simulate the weight of the removed mooring chains three kinds of weights are used here the weights used here are 20 40 and 60kgf case 3 in fig 18 c is an asymmetric pattern in which a 40kgf weight is hung at one side of the handle when the fwt floats environmental loads such as wind loads wave loads and current loads act on the floating body the ra may become tilted in case 3 the effects of these asymmetric conditions are simulated in case 4 as illustrated in fig 18 d the resinous bearing at the bottom is removed in order to figure out how to make the static friction smaller using only the resinous bearing at the top under these same conditions an asymmetric test using a 40kgf weight was also carried out fig 19 shows each static frictional moment obtained from the experiments each test was carried out in five times the bar graphs represent the averaged values while the error bars show the maximum value and the minimum value of each test the distance between the center of the ra and the attached point of the spring balance the handle is 100 mm from these results the following points can be observed in the symmetrical test the static friction increases in proportion to the weight the increasing rate of static frictional moment in relation to the weight attached to the ra is estimated at roughly 0 012kgfm kgf in the asymmetrical test even when a 40kgf weight is used the static friction is almost the same as that of the 60kgf weight during the symmetrical test out of all the tests the bottom free condition has the smallest amount of static friction however the asymmetric weight condition makes the static friction larger even when the resinous bearing at the bottom is removed another single point mooring system type 2 was introduced based on the above results that is the reduction of the number of bearings and reduction of the weight of the mooring chains are effective for decreasing the amount of static friction in addition an aligning bearing which allows the steel pipe to become more flexible during the movement of the ra is effective too 4 3 measurement of the static friction of the bearing unit in the yaw direction we discovered that the small yaw restoring moment due to the mooring system is one of two major reasons why the single point mooring system does not function as intended the other major reason is the large amount of static friction caused by the mooring system which makes it difficult for the ra to rotate so we measured the static friction of the bearing unit in the yaw direction the measurement results are shown in fig 20 the tests were carried out five times for each of the two types of fwt the distance between the center of the ra and the spring balance is 1 100 mm the static friction moment of the bearing unit can be calculated by multiplying the load of the spring balance by the distance of the fulcrum the results are shown in fig 20 as well the averaged values are also shown there fig 20 shows the results of the type 2 fwt pulled by a spring balance as shown in fig 15 according to these results the average static friction moment of the type 2 fwt is roughly 77 8 less than that of type1 fwt 4 4 discussion using physics model the physics model as we proposed in section 3 will be used to discuss why the type 1 fwt did not function as intended and why type 2 fwt did function as intended during the weather vane test fig 21 shows the relation between the restoring yaw moment due to the mooring chains and the static frictional moment obtained from the tank test for the type 1 fwt in this calculation the length of the chains is 6 5 m and the density of the chains per meter is 1 5kgf m water depth is set as 5 m essentially the restoring yaw moment of the chains increases depending on the yaw displacement of the fwt the horizontal axis designates the yaw displacement of the fwt while the vertical axis shows the restoring moment and the static friction moment as we previously mentioned the requirement of m r m f is necessary for the fwt to function because that requirement cannot be fulfilled the type 1 fwt cannot function at all in the same manner as figs 21 and 22 shows the same results as fig 21 but for the type 2 fwt instead from these results the requirement of m r m f is satisfied when the fwt rotates at least roughly 40deg in the yaw direction photos from videos we took of type2 are shown in fig 23 the wind turbine with type 2 is located at 180deg from the initial state in fig 23 a after the wind blew the wind turbine rotated around the rotational axis ra as shown in fig 23 b eventually the wind turbine moved to the downwind position in fig 23 c 5 real sea test 5 1 summary of the real sea test after the tank test the real sea test was carried out for about two
