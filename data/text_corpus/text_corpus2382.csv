11910,excessive fluoride concentration 1 5 mg l in water adversely affects human teeth and bones the present study focuses on the development of a fluoride adsorbentvia wet chemical method by treating activated carbon and cao derived from rice straw and egg shell respectively with alum the prepared adsorbents were characterized for various physico chemical parameters and fluoride adsorption test the optimized composite with highest fluoride adsorption capacity was further subjected to batch adsorption study the adsorbent followed second order kinetic model with intra particle diffusion revealing that the adsorption was controlled by pore diffusion along with the other process i e electrostatic interaction between opposite charges this has been explained by a mechanism which in turn is supported by xps data langmuir isotherm fitted well with experimental data suggesting homogenous and monolayer adsorption of fluoride the adsorption capacity obtained from langmuir isotherm model is 48 78 mg g thus the adsorbent is highly effective in removing fluoride from the initial concentration of 10 ppm to less than 0 2 ppm which is safe for drinking purpose graphical abstract image 1 keywords fluoride removal adsorption activated carbon calcium oxide temkin isotherm 1 introduction fluoride is one of the most hazardous anion present in drinking water wan et al 2019 according to who acceptable fluoride concentration in drinking water is 1 5 ppm organization 2006 which helps to preserve the solidity of bones and prohibit dental fluorosis chiavola et al 2019 however fluoride concentration of more than 1 5 ppm causes dental fluorosis skeleton fluorosis damage to the fetal cerebral function dna structure and even neurotransmission wan et al 2019 presence of higher fluoride concentration than the permissible limit in drinking water is found in more than 35 countries throughout the world ayoob and gupta 2009 and nearly 62 million people are exposed to excessive fluoride through the water they consume sarkar et al 2007 fluoride enters the human body via different methods such as food medicines and cosmetics and through municipal water supply which is a primary source of drinking water cai et al 2015 fluoride naturally leaches out from fluorine containing natural rocks and minerals into the ground water from where it enters the drinking water kundu et al 2017 however the concentration of fluoride due to industrial leach out in aquatic environment is 100 times more than natural leaching of fluoride from fluoride containing rocks kamble et al 2010 different methods have been used for fluoride removal in the past which includes precipitation huang and liu 1999 saha 1993 coagulation gong et al 2012 hu et al 2005 membrane separation dolar et al 2011 hu and

adsorption chaudhary and prasad 2015 dechnik et al 2016 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2017 each of them having some advantages as well as limitations coagulation and precipitation methods produce large amount of waste sludge and are less effective for water having high tds value in case of aluminum based materials there is a probability that some amount of aluminum leach out in the treated water which may cause alzheimer s disease sarkar et al 2007 membrane separation technology is expensive and also removes lot of valuable minerals along with wasting huge amount of water electro coagulation method requires electricity and high conductivity of wastewater suspension waghmare and arfin 2015b ion exchange resin separation technology is expensive due to cost of resin and produces hazardous waste sludge treated water from ion exchange resin is low in ph and has high concentration of chloride maheshwari 2006 out of all the above mentioned separation techniques adsorption is a cost effective and easy to operate technology due to which it has been most widely used and accepted mohapatra et al 2009 various adsorbents have been used for fluoride removal from drinking water like bio

fluoride from drinking water fluoride stock solution 1000 mg l was prepared using 1 105 g of high purity sodium fluoride anhydrous dissolved in 500 ml of milli q water a wide neck polypropylene pp regent bottle was used for the same fluoride stock solution was further diluted to prepare fluoride solutions of desirable different concentrations bansiwal et al 2010 batch adsorption experiments were conducted by taking required amount of adsorbent doses in 25 ml of fluoride contaminated water kept in 50 ml of polypropylene beaker at 27 1 c temperature with continuous stirring after required contact time the adsorbent mixed fluoride contaminated water was centrifuged and the supernatant was collected and filtered with nylon based micron syringe filter so that filtrate without solid adsorbent was collected which was finally used to detect residual fluoride concentration the residual fluoride concentration in water was detected using orion make fluoride ion selective electrode

concentration and c denotes fluoride concentration at equilibrium the fluoride adsorbed mg g was calculated by the following equation 2 q e v c o c m where v is volume of aqueous solution used during adsorption experiment and m is mass of adsorbent used asgari et al 2012 3 results and discussions 3 1 physico chemical characterization of adsorbents 3 1 1 x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffraction analysis of prepared composites is reported in fig 2 formation of calcium oxide by calcination of egg shell at 850 c can be confirmed by the peaks occurring at 2 theta values of 32 33 37 48 53 98 64 15 and 67 50 corresponding to the 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of cao these peaks are in accordance to standard jcpds data file 48 1467 laskar et al 2018 there is no peak of calcium carbonate which indicates that either it is not present at all or is present in very small amount indicating that almost complete calcination of egg shells has taken place activated carbon derived from rice straw shows a broad peak at 25 12 corresponding to 002 plane of carbon wherein the peak broadening points towards its amorphous nature in case of aiac no characteristic peak of alum is obtained which may be due to small amount of alum as compared to carbon treatment of cao with alum to form alcao creates additional peaks of alum and al oh 3 in xrd pattern the presence of alum is confirmed by the following peaks and their corresponding planes at 12 42 003 20 680 104 23 32 110 29 05 024 40 59 215 50 27 134 51 32 012 and relates to the standard jcpds data file 81 1835 presence of aluminum hydroxide is confirmed by the peaksat 2 theta values of 31 07 212 33 31 301 43 35 114 47 83 313 standard jcpds data file 74 1725 peaks of cao in alcao show a shift in the position and a marked reduction in intensity probably due to the bonding impregnation of calcium oxide with alumina or aluminum hydroxide a further slight shift in the 2θ value was observed in the aicao ccomposite as compared to alcao this reveals that there may be some change in d spacing of layers of alum and cao 3 1 2 thermo gravimetric analysis thermo gravimetric analysis of the prepared adsorbentsis shown in fig 3 residual weight obtained in case of calcium oxide is 72 15 weight loss in cao occurs in 2 steps first a reduction of about 19 from 350 c to 424 c because of the evaporation of free moisture and second a slight reduction of 6 3 in the temperature range 553 c 668 c due to decomposition of small amount of calcium carbonate present into calcium oxide jitjamnong et al 2019 residual weight obtained in case of activated carbon ac is 4 5 this weight residue contains mainly silicon oxide and small amount of other metal oxide maximum weight loss occurs between temperature range 264 c 519 c due to decomposition of carbon in form of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide residual weight obtained in case of aiac aicao and aicao c composite are 9 96 74 32 and 63 48 respectively alum al2 so4 3 16h2o degradation occurs in 3 steps first step involves degradation of 10 h2o molecule and formation of stable al2 so4 3 6h2o complex in temperature range 61 c 185 c second step involves degradation of 6h2o molecules and formation of al2 so4 3 in temperature range 185 c 707 c third and last step is due to sulphate decomposition and formation of alumina in temperature range 707 c 844 c sulphate decomposition itself happens in 2 steps çılgı and cetişli 2009 aiac dehydration occurs up to 86 c temperature and carbon decomposition takes place in temperature range of 400 c 440 c this is followed by sulphatedecomposition between 740 c and 760 c aicao dehydration occurred between 65 5 c and 322 c and decomposition of sulphate occurs at 825 c 904 c in aicao c dehydration takes place between 86 37 c 197 15 c and carbon decomposition occurs in temperature range 390 c 499 9 c sulphate decomposition follows between temperature range 849 8 c 969 c leading to the formation of alumina 3 1 3 morphology studies the morphology of different samples is depicted in fig 4 whereas the edax data are given in table 2 cao derived from egg shell wastes shows a porous structure fig 4a that can assist the process of adsorption buasri et al 2013 edx of samples indicates the presence of calcium and oxygen activated carbon ac sample shows a porous morphology as is clear from fig 4 b chemical treatment of carbon derived from rice straw with strong base removes the silica as sodium silicate which creates pores in carbon matrix saini et al 2020 sudhan et al 2017 edx of samples shows the presence of carbon oxygen and very small amount of silica sem images of alum impregnated cao and alum impregnated activated carbon samples are shown in fig 4 c and d respectively alum impregnation doesn t have much effect on the surface morphology of samples however alum is deposited in the pores as observed and further confirmed by edax as given in a table 2 edx shows the presence of aluminum with base element like calcium carbon oxygen and sulfur alum impregnated cao carbon aicao c composites is shown in fig 4 e and f activated carbon and calcium oxide interfaces are clearly observed in the image which shows that there may be some bonding between the two alum impregnation is further confirmed by the edax data table 2 3 1 4 adsorption study table 3 shows the residual fluoride content while using different adsorbent materials as characterized above wherein the initial fluoride concentration was 100 ppm on the basis of the results sample aicao c was chosen for further studies 3 1 5 bet surface area and pore size distribution the surface area of the adsorbent sample aicao c and the adsorption desorption isotherm were obtained by n2 adsorption desorption curve at 77 k bet surface area of aicao was computed to be 18 m2 g and in case of aicao c it slightly increased to 22 m2 g the adsorption and desorption curves as shown in fig 5 a in the adsorption desorption isotherm closely resembles type ii and type iv curves the type ii isotherm represents unrestricted monolayer multilayer adsorption and also indicates that some surface area of the adsorbent is non porous type iv isotherm indicates the presence of mesopores through which the adsorption takes place via capillary condensation the presence of mesopores is confirmed by fig 5 b which indicates the average pore diameter of 3 06 nm with pore volume 0 015 cm3 g 3 1 6 point of zero charge method of rapid titration with 0 1 n nacl was applied to find out the point of zero charge i e the phpzc of the adsorbent aicao c it was titrated with 0 1 n naoh and 0 1 n hcl solutions saini et al 2020 fig 6 shows the amount of acid and base consumed as a function of ph the point of intersection is observed at ph values around 8 5 which is due to the alum impregnation on cao ac 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on adsorption of fluoride from fluoride contaminated water is shown in fig 7 ph of fluoride solutions was varied between 2 7 and 9 4 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solution at ph 2 7 fluoride adsorption efficiency is only 58 at lower ph high concentration of moving h ions support the formation of weak hf which eventually produce h2f and hf2 via homo association reducing the concentration of free fluoride ions in fluoride contamination solution nayak et al 2017 with increase in ph the adsorption efficiency increases and reaches 88 5 at ph 5 2 maximum adsorption efficiency achieved is 94 13 at ph 6 adsorption efficiency decreases from 94 13 to 74 as ph increases from 6 to 9 4 adsorption of fluoride on surface of adsorbent is electrostatic in nature at basic ph fluoride adsorption decreases because of repulsive forces between the ionic oh ions present on the surface of adsorbent and f ion present in aqueous fluoride solution nayak et al 2017 adsorption of fluoride ions also reduces due to oh ion competing with f ion to bind on the surface of aicao c kundu et al 2017 the speciation curve as shown in fig 8 depicts the various species of fluoride present in the solute at different ph during adsorption process 3 2 2 effect of adsorbent dose the effect of adsorbent dose on removal of fluoride from contaminated water was studied by varying the adsorbent dose from 0 2 g l to 4 g l with initial fluoride concentration 10 mg l and ph 6 at temperature 27 1 c and is shown in fig 9 fluoride removal efficiency increases sharply from 57 to 92 36 as the adsorbent dose increases from 0 2 g l to 1 g l and thereafter till 4 g l there is a very gradual increase to 97 1 the rise in adsorption efficiency on increasing the adsorbent doses is due to the increase in the availability of active adsorption sites zhang et al 2012 the decline in the fluoride adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent was observed with increasing doses of the adsorbent this decrease is probably because of the dominance of adsorbent adsorbent interaction over the fluoride interaction with adsorbent surfaces the strong interaction between the particles of adsorbent adsorbent interaction shows the conglomeration of the adsorbent particles this overlap reduces the active sites present on the surface of adsorbent particle and hinders the surface area which had increased due to increase of adsorbent doses nayak et al 2017 fig 10 describes the deviation in the distribution coefficient kd as a function of adsorbent dose here kd is the ratio of fluoride equilibrium concentrations adsorbed on the adsorbent to that suspended or remnant in the solution with increasing adsorbent dose kd reaches a maximum at 1 g l indicating highest efficiency of the adsorbent for fluoride removal at this dose variation of kd with adsorbent doses indicates towards heterogeneous adsorption behavior aicao c surface 3 2 3 kinetic study effect of contact time on adsorption capacity of fluoride is shown in fig 11 a effect of contact time on removal of fluoride was studied by varying contact time from 1 min to 5 h with starting fluoride concentration 10 ppm 1 g l adsorbent dose ph 6 and at 27 1 c maximum fluoride adsorption nearly 87 from contaminated water occurs within initial 10 minutes and further increases in an hour and reaches 93 10 thereafter the increase is quite gradual different kinetic models were applied on the experimental data obtained from contact time studies and portrayed as follow 3 2 3 1 pseudo first order model pseudo first order kinetic model given by lagergren for sorption of solid liquid system lv et al 2006 is expressed in the form of following linear eq 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t here k1 denotes the rate constant qe and qt denotes the amount of adsorbed fluoride at equilibrium and at a given time t respectively ln qe qt plotted against time t gives a correlation factor of 0 883 and is therefore not fitted with the experimental data 3 2 3 2 pseudo second order model pseudo second order kinetic model is expressed as 4 dq t dt k 2 q e q t 2 here k2 denotes the second order rate constant for adsorption integrating above equation by applying boundary condition qt 0 when t 0 and qt qt when t t gives 5 1 q e q t 1 q e kt rearranging above equation in linear form gives 6 t q t 1 h 1 q e t fig 11 b shows the curve for pseudo second order model where t qt is plotted as a function of t and shows high correlation coefficient 0 999 slope of the curve provides the adsorption capacity while the intercept value gives the rate constant ho and mckay 1999 smaller the value of rate constant faster is the rate of reaction adsorption capacity value achieved from pseudo second order kinetics is 9 52 mg g and pseudo second order rate constant value obtained is 14 49 so the rate of reaction is fast and fluoride adsorption on the adsorbent is dependent on the properties of both adsorbent and adsorbate 3 2 3 3 intra particle diffusion model intra particle diffusion model by weber and morris was used to simulate the experimental data linear equation used to fit the experimental data is given as follow 7 q t k id t 0 5 c 1 here kid refers to the constant of diffusion rate qt denotes the amount of fluoride adsorbed at time t and c1 denotes constant corresponding to the thickness of the boundary layer if the plot between t0 5 versus qt is a straight line passing through the origin then intra particle diffusion should be our rate determining step else other process are also involve in the adsorption process donia et al 2013 as shown in fig 11 c adsorption process is controlled by three steps and hence three processes one out of three is a rate limiting step at a particular time interval rate of adsorption is defined by slope of the linear portions wherein an increase in slope indicates faster adsorption process cheung et al 2007 thus the initial straight line with a steep slope passing close to the origin indicates a fast and maximum diffusion of fluoride through macrospores and mesopores the second straight line in the plot defines the diffusion of fluoride through micropores the third straight line conveys a moderate adsorption on the adsorbent extrapolation of none of the linear plot passes through the origin which indicates that along with pore diffusion other process are also involved in the adsorption of fluoride mariappan et al 2015 fig 12 shows the proposed mechanism that involves adsorption of fluoride from water occurring due to electrostatic interaction of fluoride with al3 and ca2 most of the fluoride is adsorbed on metal oxides moieties activated carbon do not adsorbed fluoride as such but the presence of al3 and ca2 produces positive polarity on the activated carbon structure due to which there is a possibility of f being bound to si present on the carbon which would be there even if in small amount despite most of it being removed as silicate and has the inclination to bond with f the above mechanism is supported by xps spectra of raw adsorbent and fluoride adsorbed adsorbent the spectra of the two samples in the entire range are presented in fig 13 a the de convoluted f 1s peak of aicao c f fig 13 b gives peaks at 685 7 and 687 9ev analogous to metal fluoride i e al f and ca f and fluoride bound to any organic constituent respectively c or si for aicao c the de convoluted xps curves for carbon 1s are depicted in fig 13 c d the sp2 peak of carbon is observed at 284 6ev additional peaks were found at 285 1 286 7 289 2evs corresponding to the functionalized carbons though the fraction of sp2 hybridized carbon is high a major part of other functionalized species is also present the peak corresponding to c 1s peak of sample aicao c f fig 13 d shows a significant reduction in sp2 carbon and also an additional peak at 287 14 ev analogous to c f this proves the fluoride adsorption on the given adsorbent the 2p peak of al for aicao c sample is observed at 75 9 ev and corresponds to al2o3 as shown in fig 13 e however in case of aicao c f sample the peak shifts slightly fig 13 f ca 2p3 2 peak obtained at 348 49 ev corresponding to cao fig 13 g in case of aicao c shows minor shift for aicao c f fig 13 h edax analysis was further used to analyze the elemental constituents of as such alcao c and aicao c f fluoride adsorbed sample edax reveals the presence of fluoride besides al ca c and si table 4 fig 14 shows the sem images of aicao c and alcao c f a significant amount of fluoride has been adsorbed on the surface of alcao c fluoride adsorption on adsorbent does not affect much on the morphology of adsorbents 3 2 4 isotherm study the effect of initial fluoride concentration on the fluoride removal capacity is investigated by varying fluoride concentration from 1 mg l to 100 mg l the study is reported using adsorbent dose 1 g l at ph 6 contact time 1 h at temperatures 300 k 310 k and 320 k as shown in fig 15 a the fluoride removal capacity increases with increase in the initial fluoride concentration different isotherm models were simulated with the experiment data and the related parameters are tabulated in table 5 3 2 4 1 langmuir isotherm model langmuir isotherm for fluoride removal states that active adsorption sites for adsorbent are present in a definite number each active site can absorb only one adsorbate molecule and that adsorption is monolayer in nature and energy of adsorption is constant linear equation for langmuir isotherm is written as follows raghav and kumar 2018 8 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m here qm and kl denotes the max adsorption capacity and langmuir constant respectively ce and qe is fluoride concentration at equilibrium and adsorption capacity at equilibrium respectively maximum adsorption capacity and the value of langmuir constant are determined by plotting a graph between ce qe and ce shown in fig 15 b the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from langmuir isotherm model are 48 78 mg g 55 55 mg g and 60 60 mg g at 300 k 310 k and 320 k respectively these values are greater than that obtained by activated carbons egg shell based composites and various aluminum based adsorbents reported in literature 3 2 4 2 freundlich isotherm model the obtained experimental data was simulated with freundlich isotherm model which is used for heterogeneous surfaces freundlich isotherm model describes both monolayer and multilayer adsorption it points towards a heterogeneous adsorbent surface with varying affinity for adsorption freundlich isotherm equation is written as follows raghav and kumar 2018 9 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e kf and n are freundlich constant and exponent of non linearity lnkf and 1 n values have been determined from the intercept and slope of the plot as shown in fig 15 c 1 n is freundlich exponent the exponent n is the diversity index of free energies related with the adsorption of the solute fluoride by multiple components of a heterogeneous adsorbent it indicates both monolayer and multilayer adsorption as also indicated by the adsorption desorption isotherm as is usually the case with composites which have the tendency to be heterogeneous however the correlation coefficient of nearly 0 93 indicates partial heterogeneity schwarzenbach and gschwend 2016 3 2 4 3 temkin isotherm model temkin isotherm describes the interaction of adsorbate with adsorbent while excluding extremely high and low concentrations this model deduce that heat of adsorption of molecule does not reduce logarithmically but linearly with coverage dada et al 2012 the equation for the same is given as follows 10 q e rt b t ln a t rt b where b rt b t 11 q e b ln a t b lnc e here bt and at denotes the temkin isotherm constant and equilibrium binding constant l g obtained from fig 15 d b is a constant corresponding to the heat of sorption j mol r and t are rate constant and temperature respectively temkin model fitted with the experimental data the correlation coefficient values obtained were of 0 97 0 96 and 0 97 at temperature 300 k 310 k and 320 k the slope and intercept of the line plotted between qe and ln ce gives the value of constant b and at the values of b were computed to be 7 8 8 6 9 5 and those of at were found to be 12 8 16 2 18 6 at temperature 300 k 310 k and 320 k respectively heat of sorption points towards physical nature of adsorption dada et al 2012 3 2 5 thermodynamic parameters thermodynamic study has been carried out to find out the thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs thermodynamic parameters were calculated by the following equation 12 δg rt lnk 13 ln k δ s r δ h r 1 t where k denotes the distribution coefficient langmuir constant and r denotes universal gas constant standard gibbs free energy at 300 k 310 k and 320 k was calculated from equation 12 the van thoffplot between ln k and 1 t is depicted in fig 16 and is used to calculate δh and δs all thermodynamic parameters calculated are indicated in table 6 negative values of δg reveals that adsorption of fluoride on adsorbents is spontaneous in nature positive value of δh reveals that adsorption of fluoride on the adsorbent is endothermic in nature the change in entropy showing a positive value represents the spontaneity of reaction i e change in adsorbent in the presence of adsorbate which shows that it is active towards adsorption g3 2 6 interfering anion study generally there are other anions co existing in natural water along with the fluoride ions these ions may or may not interfere with the removal of fluoride the effect of different interfering anion likes chloride nitrate sulphate phosphate and carbonates have been studied fluoride concentration of 10 ppm along with interfering anions 100 ppm with contact time 1 h adsorbent doses 1 g l at ph 6 and temperature 27 2 c were studied fig 17 shows the effect of interfering anion on the fluoride removal capacity of aicao c chloride nitrate and sulphate ions do not affect the adsorption of fluoride on the surface of adsorbent phosphate interferes very slightly while carbonate ions decreases the fluoride removal to nearly 65 6 when all anions are employed together then 49 3 fluoride removal is achieved 3 2 7 desorption study for desorption study first the adsorption test was conducted using 1 g l adsorbent dose for adsorption of fluoride from contaminated water having fluoride concentration 100 mg l at ph 6 for 1 h contact time the fluoride adsorbed aicao c was then used to carry out the leaching studies at different ph the ph values were varied by using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl fig 18 shows that fluoride leached out is less than 1 5 mg l at low ph in range of 1 5 7 25 fluoride leaching increases as ph increases from 7 25 and reaches a maximum i e 28 86 14 4 mg l at ph 11 45 4 conclusions alum impregnated cao activated carbon composite has been successfully developed for de fluoridation of drinking water alum impregnation of cao and activated carbon not only increases its affinity towards fluoride but also generates positive polarity on the carbon thus enhancing its adsorption capacity batch adsorption studies with aicao c composite was carried out for various parameters like ph adsorbent dose contact time initial fluoride concentration with temperature variation effect of interfering anion the adsorbent follows second order kinetic model and intra particle diffusion model reveals that although adsorption of fluoride occurs through meso and macro pore diffusion other processes i e electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged adsorbate and adsorbent contribute to the same mechanism for the same is supported by the xps data of the as such and fluoride adsorbed composite aicao c langmuir model fitted best with the experimental data which assumes homogeneous adsorbent surface with monolayer adsorption freundlich isotherm also assumes partial heterogeneity of the composites thermodynamic study shows that fluoride adsorption is spontaneous in nature and is almost unaffected by the presence of other interfering anions except carbonate leaching study shows that nearly 28 leaching of fluoride occurs from fluoride adsorbed aicao c composite hence aicao so formed is effective in removing fluoride from the initial concentration of 10 ppm to less than 0 2 ppm declaration of competing interest the

11910,excessive fluoride concentration 1 5 mg l in water adversely affects human teeth and bones the present study focuses on the development of a fluoride adsorbentvia wet chemical method by treating activated carbon and cao derived from rice straw and egg shell respectively with alum the prepared adsorbents were characterized for various physico chemical parameters and fluoride adsorption test the optimized composite with highest fluoride adsorption capacity was further subjected to batch adsorption study the adsorbent followed second order kinetic model with intra particle diffusion revealing that the adsorption was controlled by pore diffusion along with the other process i e electrostatic interaction between opposite charges this has been explained by a mechanism which in turn is supported by xps data langmuir isotherm fitted well with experimental data suggesting homogenous and monolayer adsorption of fluoride the adsorption capacity obtained from langmuir isotherm model

adsorption experiment and m is mass of adsorbent used asgari et al 2012 3 results and discussions 3 1 physico chemical characterization of adsorbents 3 1 1 x ray diffraction analysis x ray diffraction analysis of prepared composites is reported in fig 2 formation of calcium oxide by calcination of egg shell at 850 c can be confirmed by the peaks occurring at 2 theta values of 32 33 37 48 53 98 64 15 and 67 50 corresponding to the 111 200 220 311 and 222 planes of cao these peaks are in accordance to standard jcpds data file 48 1467 laskar et al 2018 there is no peak of calcium carbonate which indicates that either it is not present at all or is present in very small amount indicating that almost complete calcination of egg shells has taken place activated carbon derived from rice straw shows a broad peak at 25 12 corresponding to 002 plane of carbon wherein the peak broadening points towards its amorphous nature in case of aiac no characteristic peak of alum is obtained which may be due to small amount of alum as compared to carbon treatment of cao with alum to form alcao creates additional peaks of alum and al oh 3 in xrd pattern the presence of alum is confirmed by the following peaks and their corresponding planes at 12 42 003 20 680 104 23 32 110 29 05 024 40 59 215 50 27 134 51 32 012 and relates to the standard jcpds data file 81 1835 presence of aluminum

reduction in intensity probably due to the bonding impregnation of calcium oxide with alumina or aluminum hydroxide a further slight shift in the 2θ value was observed in the aicao ccomposite as compared to alcao this reveals that there may be some change in d spacing of layers of alum and cao 3 1 2 thermo gravimetric analysis thermo gravimetric analysis of the prepared adsorbentsis shown in fig 3 residual weight obtained in case of calcium oxide is 72 15 weight loss in cao occurs in 2 steps first a reduction of about 19 from 350 c to 424 c because of the evaporation of free moisture and second a slight reduction of 6 3 in the temperature range 553 c 668 c due to decomposition of small amount of calcium carbonate present into calcium oxide jitjamnong et al 2019 residual weight obtained in case of activated carbon ac is 4 5 this weight residue contains mainly silicon oxide and small amount of other metal oxide maximum weight loss occurs between temperature range 264 c 519 c due to decomposition of carbon in form of carbon dioxide or carbon monoxide residual weight obtained in case of aiac aicao and aicao c composite are 9 96 74 32 and 63 48 respectively alum al2 so4 3 16h2o degradation occurs in 3 steps first step involves degradation of 10 h2o molecule and formation of stable al2 so4 3 6h2o complex in temperature range 61 c 185 c second step involves degradation of 6h2o molecules and formation of al2 so4 3 in temperature range 185 c 707 c third and last step is due to sulphate decomposition and formation of alumina in temperature range 707 c 844 c sulphate decomposition itself happens in 2 steps çılgı and cetişli 2009 aiac dehydration occurs up to 86 c temperature and carbon decomposition takes place in temperature range of 400 c 440 c this is followed by sulphatedecomposition between 740 c and 760 c aicao dehydration occurred between 65 5 c and 322 c and decomposition of sulphate occurs at 825 c 904 c in aicao c dehydration takes place between 86 37 c 197 15 c and carbon decomposition occurs in temperature range 390 c 499 9 c sulphate decomposition follows between temperature range 849 8 c 969 c leading to the formation of alumina 3 1 3 morphology studies the morphology of different samples is depicted in fig 4 whereas the edax data are given in table 2 cao derived from egg shell wastes shows a porous structure fig 4a that can assist the process of adsorption buasri et al 2013 edx of samples indicates the presence of calcium and oxygen activated carbon ac sample shows a porous morphology as is clear from fig 4 b chemical treatment of carbon derived from rice straw with strong base removes the silica as sodium silicate which creates pores in carbon matrix saini et al 2020 sudhan et al 2017 edx of samples shows the presence of carbon oxygen and very small amount of silica sem images of alum impregnated cao and alum impregnated activated carbon samples are shown in fig 4 c and d respectively alum impregnation doesn t have much effect on the surface morphology of samples however alum is deposited in the pores as observed and further confirmed by edax as given in a table 2 edx shows the presence of aluminum with base element like calcium carbon oxygen and sulfur alum impregnated cao carbon aicao c composites is shown in fig 4 e and f activated carbon and calcium oxide interfaces are clearly observed in the image which shows that there may be some bonding between the two alum impregnation is further confirmed by the edax data table 2 3 1 4 adsorption study table 3 shows the residual fluoride content while using different adsorbent materials as characterized above wherein the initial fluoride concentration was 100 ppm on the basis of the results sample aicao c was chosen for further studies 3 1 5 bet surface area and pore size distribution the surface area of the adsorbent sample aicao c and the adsorption desorption isotherm were obtained by n2 adsorption desorption curve at 77 k bet surface area of aicao was computed to be 18 m2 g and in case of aicao c it slightly increased to 22 m2 g the adsorption and desorption curves as shown in fig 5 a in the adsorption desorption isotherm closely resembles type ii and type iv curves the type ii isotherm represents unrestricted monolayer multilayer adsorption and also indicates that some surface area of the adsorbent is non porous type iv isotherm indicates the presence of mesopores through which the adsorption takes place via capillary condensation the presence of mesopores is confirmed by fig 5 b which indicates the average pore diameter of 3 06 nm with pore volume 0 015 cm3 g 3 1 6 point of zero charge method of rapid titration with 0 1 n nacl was applied to find out the point of zero charge i e the phpzc of the adsorbent aicao c it was titrated with 0 1 n naoh and 0 1 n hcl solutions saini et al 2020 fig 6 shows the amount of acid and base consumed as a function of ph the point of intersection is observed at ph values around 8 5 which is due to the alum impregnation on cao ac 3 2 batch adsorption studies 3 2 1 effect of ph the effect of ph on adsorption of fluoride from fluoride contaminated water is shown in fig 7 ph of fluoride solutions was varied between 2 7 and 9 4 using 0 1 m hcl and 0 1 m naoh solution at ph 2 7 fluoride adsorption efficiency is only 58 at lower ph high concentration of moving h ions support the formation of weak hf which eventually produce h2f and hf2 via homo association reducing the concentration of free fluoride ions in fluoride contamination solution nayak et al 2017 with increase in ph the adsorption efficiency increases and reaches 88 5 at ph 5 2 maximum adsorption efficiency achieved is 94 13 at ph 6 adsorption efficiency decreases from 94 13 to 74 as ph increases from 6 to 9 4 adsorption of fluoride on surface of adsorbent is electrostatic in nature at basic ph fluoride adsorption decreases because of repulsive forces between the ionic oh ions present on the surface of adsorbent and f ion present in aqueous fluoride solution nayak et al 2017 adsorption of fluoride ions also reduces due to oh ion competing with f ion to bind on the surface of aicao c kundu et al 2017 the speciation curve as shown in fig 8 depicts the various species of fluoride present in the solute at different ph during adsorption process 3 2 2 effect of adsorbent dose the effect of adsorbent dose on removal of fluoride from contaminated water was studied by varying the adsorbent dose from 0 2 g l to 4 g l with initial fluoride concentration 10 mg l and ph 6 at temperature 27 1 c and is shown in fig 9 fluoride removal efficiency increases sharply from 57 to 92 36 as the adsorbent dose increases from 0 2 g l to 1 g l and thereafter till 4 g l there is a very gradual increase to 97 1 the rise in adsorption efficiency on increasing the adsorbent doses is due to the increase in the availability of active adsorption sites zhang et al 2012 the decline in the fluoride adsorbed per unit weight of the adsorbent was observed with increasing doses of the adsorbent this decrease is probably because of the dominance of adsorbent adsorbent interaction over the fluoride interaction with adsorbent surfaces the strong interaction between the particles of adsorbent adsorbent interaction shows the conglomeration of the adsorbent particles this overlap reduces the active sites present on the surface of adsorbent particle and hinders the surface area which had increased due to increase of adsorbent doses nayak et al 2017 fig 10 describes the deviation in the distribution coefficient kd as a function of adsorbent dose here kd is the ratio of fluoride equilibrium concentrations adsorbed on the adsorbent to that suspended or remnant in the solution with increasing adsorbent dose kd reaches a maximum at 1 g l indicating highest efficiency of the adsorbent for fluoride removal at this dose variation of kd with adsorbent doses indicates towards heterogeneous adsorption behavior aicao c surface 3 2 3 kinetic study effect of contact time on adsorption capacity of fluoride is shown in fig 11 a effect of contact time on removal of fluoride was studied by varying contact time from 1 min to 5 h with starting fluoride concentration 10 ppm 1 g l adsorbent dose ph 6 and at 27 1 c maximum fluoride adsorption nearly 87 from contaminated water occurs within initial 10 minutes and further increases in an hour and reaches 93 10 thereafter the increase is quite gradual different kinetic models were applied on the experimental data obtained from contact time studies and portrayed as follow 3 2 3 1 pseudo first order model pseudo first order kinetic model given by lagergren for sorption of solid liquid system lv et al 2006 is expressed in the form of following linear eq 3 ln q e q t ln q e k 1 t here k1 denotes the rate constant qe and qt denotes the amount of adsorbed fluoride at equilibrium and at a given time t respectively ln qe qt plotted against time t gives a correlation factor of 0 883 and is therefore not fitted with the experimental data 3 2 3 2 pseudo second order model pseudo second order kinetic model is expressed as 4 dq t dt k 2 q e q t 2 here k2 denotes the second order rate constant for adsorption integrating above equation by applying boundary condition qt 0 when t 0 and qt qt when t t gives 5 1 q e q t 1 q e kt rearranging above equation in linear form gives 6 t q t 1 h 1 q e t fig 11 b shows the curve for pseudo second order model where t qt is plotted as a function of t and shows high correlation coefficient 0 999 slope of the curve provides the adsorption capacity while the intercept value gives the rate constant ho and mckay 1999 smaller the value of rate constant faster is the rate of reaction adsorption capacity value achieved from pseudo second order kinetics is 9 52 mg g and pseudo second order rate constant value obtained is 14 49 so the rate of reaction is fast and fluoride adsorption on the adsorbent is dependent on the properties of both adsorbent and adsorbate 3 2 3 3 intra particle diffusion model intra particle diffusion model by weber and morris was used to simulate the experimental data linear equation used to fit the experimental data is given as follow 7 q t k id t 0 5 c 1 here kid refers to the constant of diffusion rate qt denotes the amount of fluoride adsorbed at time t and c1 denotes constant corresponding to the thickness of the boundary layer if the plot between t0 5 versus qt is a straight line passing through the origin then intra particle diffusion should be our rate determining step else other process are also involve in the adsorption process donia et al 2013 as shown in fig 11 c adsorption process is controlled by three steps and hence three processes one out of three is a rate limiting step at a particular time interval rate of adsorption is defined by slope of the linear portions wherein an increase in slope indicates faster adsorption process cheung et al 2007 thus the initial straight line with a steep slope passing close to the origin indicates a fast and maximum diffusion of fluoride through macrospores and mesopores the second straight line in the plot defines the diffusion of fluoride through micropores the third straight line conveys a moderate adsorption on the adsorbent extrapolation of none of the linear plot passes through the origin which indicates that along with pore diffusion other process are also involved in the adsorption of fluoride mariappan et al 2015 fig 12 shows the proposed mechanism that involves adsorption of fluoride from water occurring due to electrostatic interaction of fluoride with al3 and ca2 most of the fluoride is adsorbed on metal oxides moieties activated carbon do not adsorbed fluoride as such but the presence of al3 and ca2 produces positive polarity on the activated carbon structure due to which there is a possibility of f being bound to si present on the carbon which would be there even if in small amount despite most of it being removed as silicate and has the inclination to bond with f the above mechanism is supported by xps spectra of raw adsorbent and fluoride adsorbed adsorbent the spectra of the two samples in the entire range are presented in fig 13 a the de convoluted f 1s peak of aicao c f fig 13 b gives peaks at 685 7 and 687 9ev analogous to metal fluoride i e al f and ca f and fluoride bound to any organic constituent respectively c or si for aicao c the de convoluted xps curves for carbon 1s are depicted in fig 13 c d the sp2 peak of carbon is observed at 284 6ev additional peaks were found at 285 1 286 7 289 2evs corresponding to the functionalized carbons though the fraction of sp2 hybridized carbon is high a major part of other functionalized species is also present the peak corresponding to c 1s peak of sample aicao c f fig 13 d shows a significant reduction in sp2 carbon and also an additional peak at 287 14 ev analogous to c f this proves the fluoride adsorption on the given adsorbent the 2p peak of al for aicao c sample is observed at 75 9 ev and corresponds to al2o3 as shown in fig 13 e however in case of aicao c f sample the peak shifts slightly fig 13 f ca 2p3 2 peak obtained at 348 49 ev corresponding to cao fig 13 g in case of aicao c shows minor shift for aicao c f fig 13 h edax analysis was further used to analyze the elemental constituents of as such alcao c and aicao c f fluoride adsorbed sample edax reveals the presence of fluoride besides al ca c and si table 4 fig 14 shows the sem images of aicao c and alcao c f a significant amount of fluoride has been adsorbed on the surface of alcao c fluoride adsorption on adsorbent does not affect much on the morphology of adsorbents 3 2 4 isotherm study the effect of initial fluoride concentration on the fluoride removal capacity is investigated by varying fluoride concentration from 1 mg l to 100 mg l the study is reported using adsorbent dose 1 g l at ph 6 contact time 1 h at temperatures 300 k 310 k and 320 k as shown in fig 15 a the fluoride removal capacity increases with increase in the initial fluoride concentration different isotherm models were simulated with the experiment data and the related parameters are tabulated in table 5 3 2 4 1 langmuir isotherm model langmuir isotherm for fluoride removal states that active adsorption sites for adsorbent are present in a definite number each active site can absorb only one adsorbate molecule and that adsorption is monolayer in nature and energy of adsorption is constant linear equation for langmuir isotherm is written as follows raghav and kumar 2018 8 c e q e 1 k l q m c e q m here qm and kl denotes the max adsorption capacity and langmuir constant respectively ce and qe is fluoride concentration at equilibrium and adsorption capacity at equilibrium respectively maximum adsorption capacity and the value of langmuir constant are determined by plotting a graph between ce qe and ce shown in fig 15 b the maximum adsorption capacity obtained from langmuir isotherm model are 48 78 mg g 55 55 mg g and 60 60 mg g at 300 k 310 k and 320 k respectively these values are greater than that obtained by activated carbons egg shell based composites and various aluminum based adsorbents reported in literature 3 2 4 2 freundlich isotherm model the obtained experimental data was simulated with freundlich isotherm model which is used for heterogeneous surfaces freundlich isotherm model describes both monolayer and multilayer adsorption it points towards a heterogeneous adsorbent surface with varying affinity for adsorption freundlich isotherm equation is written as follows raghav and kumar 2018 9 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e kf and n are freundlich constant and exponent of non linearity lnkf and 1 n values have been determined from the intercept and slope of the plot as shown in fig 15 c 1 n is freundlich exponent the exponent n is the diversity index of free energies related with the adsorption of the solute fluoride by multiple components of a heterogeneous adsorbent it indicates both monolayer and multilayer adsorption as also indicated by the adsorption desorption isotherm as is usually the case with composites which have the tendency to be heterogeneous however the correlation coefficient of nearly 0 93 indicates partial heterogeneity schwarzenbach and gschwend 2016 3 2 4 3 temkin isotherm model temkin isotherm describes the interaction of adsorbate with adsorbent while excluding extremely high and low concentrations this model deduce that heat of adsorption of molecule does not reduce logarithmically but linearly with coverage dada et al 2012 the equation for the same is given as follows 10 q e rt b t ln a t rt b where b rt b t 11 q e b ln a t b lnc e here bt and at denotes the temkin isotherm constant and equilibrium binding constant l g obtained from fig 15 d b is a constant corresponding to the heat of sorption j mol r and t are rate constant and temperature respectively temkin model fitted with the experimental data the correlation coefficient values obtained were of 0 97 0 96 and 0 97 at temperature 300 k 310 k and 320 k the slope and intercept of the line plotted between qe and ln ce gives the value of constant b and at the values of b were computed to be 7 8 8 6 9 5 and those of

thermodynamic study has been carried out to find out the thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy δg enthalpy change δh and entropy change δs thermodynamic parameters were calculated by the following equation 12 δg rt lnk 13 ln k δ s r δ h r 1 t where k denotes the distribution coefficient langmuir constant and r denotes universal gas constant standard gibbs free energy at 300 k 310 k and 320 k was calculated from equation 12 the van thoffplot between ln k and 1 t is depicted in fig 16 and is used to calculate δh and δs all thermodynamic parameters calculated are indicated in table 6 negative values of δg reveals that adsorption of fluoride on adsorbents is spontaneous in nature positive value of δh reveals that adsorption of fluoride on the adsorbent is endothermic in nature the change in entropy showing a positive value represents the spontaneity of reaction i e change in adsorbent in the presence of adsorbate which shows that it is active towards adsorption g3 2 6 interfering anion study generally there are other anions co existing in natural water along with the fluoride ions these ions may or may not interfere with the removal of fluoride the effect of different interfering anion likes chloride nitrate sulphate phosphate and carbonates have been studied fluoride concentration of 10 ppm along with interfering anions 100 ppm with contact time 1 h adsorbent doses 1 g l at ph 6 and temperature 27 2 c were studied fig 17 shows the effect of interfering anion on the fluoride removal capacity of aicao c chloride nitrate and sulphate ions do not affect the adsorption of fluoride on the surface of adsorbent phosphate interferes very slightly while carbonate ions decreases the fluoride removal to nearly 65 6 when all anions are employed together then 49 3 fluoride removal is achieved 3 2 7 desorption study for desorption study first the adsorption test was conducted using 1 g l adsorbent dose for adsorption of fluoride from contaminated water having fluoride concentration 100 mg l at ph 6 for 1 h contact time the fluoride adsorbed aicao c was then used to carry out the leaching studies at different ph the ph values were varied by using 0 1 m naoh and 0 1 m hcl fig 18 shows that fluoride leached out is less than 1 5 mg l at low ph in range of 1 5 7 25 fluoride leaching increases as ph increases from 7 25 and reaches a maximum i e 28 86 14 4 mg l at ph 11 45 4 conclusions alum impregnated cao activated carbon composite has been successfully developed for de fluoridation of drinking water alum impregnation of cao and activated carbon not only increases its affinity towards fluoride but also generates positive polarity on the carbon thus enhancing its adsorption capacity batch adsorption studies with aicao c composite was carried out for various parameters like ph adsorbent dose contact time initial fluoride concentration with temperature variation effect of interfering anion the adsorbent follows second order kinetic model and intra particle diffusion model reveals that although adsorption of fluoride occurs through meso and macro pore diffusion other processes i e electrostatic attraction between the oppositely charged adsorbate and adsorbent contribute to the same mechanism for the same is supported by the xps data of the as such and fluoride adsorbed composite aicao c langmuir model fitted best with the experimental data which assumes homogeneous adsorbent surface with monolayer adsorption freundlich isotherm also assumes partial heterogeneity of the composites thermodynamic study shows that fluoride adsorption is spontaneous in nature and is almost unaffected by the presence of other interfering anions except carbonate leaching study shows that nearly 28 leaching of fluoride occurs from fluoride adsorbed aicao c composite hence aicao so formed is effective in removing fluoride from the initial concentration of 10 ppm to less than 0 2 ppm declaration of competing interest the

11911,a study on quality of groundwater in a volcanic region in northwest of iran was carried out both spatial and temporal variations of the water quality were investigated using geographical information system and groundwater quality index the results show that 74 of the groundwater were of calcium bicarbonate type based on piper diagram tds values varied between 116 and 470 mg l and concentration of salts was high in the western part the sahand mountain compared to that of eastern parts the groundwater quality parameters for the last 8 years were employed to investigate the temporal variation gwqi was calculated to be 17 in 2011 while it was gently increasing so that in 2018 it reached 22 indicating that groundwater quality in the studied area is deteriorating however all the values indicated that the groundwater is still reaching the national water quality guidelines multivariate statistical analysis including pearson correlation cluster analysis and principal component analysis were also performed the groundwater in the study area was divided into 2 distinct clusters based on their tds values in addition pca demonstrated 3 different components covering almost 86 of the water samples finally it can be concluded that multivariate statistical techniques could be useful in identifying the natural and non natural sources governing the groundwater quality

resources among the water resources groundwater is considered among the commonly used one especially in rural communities this is due to the advantages of groundwater such as easily access to water almost in every places without any pipe transformation hygienically acceptable water and generally constant composition groundwater generally does not require further purification and it can be used as potable water with a usual disinfection process shakerkhatibi et al 2019 taghipour et al 2016 fahiminia et al 2014 groundwater is the water resource for almost one third of the people around the world therefore higher consumption of groundwater along with various pollution sources both natural pollution and anthropogenic pollution makes the groundwater quality management an important factor for sustaining and developing community health kumar 2014 mosaferi et al 2014 lithology of the study area and hydrological processes are the two determining factors in groundwater quality topographical features such as groundwater flow retention time relief of landscape etc are also controlling the groundwater quality furthermore groundwater quality is adversely impacted by

industrialized areas taghipour et al 2012 trabelsi and zouari 2019 water never exists in its pure form in the environment major and minor elements in limited quantities are essential for the human metabolism but if present in undesirable level they are proved to be very harmful and the same water turns into a threat to the public health therefore knowledge about groundwater quality and its variations is of great importance fahiminia et al 2014 taghipour et al 2012 space and time are the two determining factor in groundwater quality changes which is due to the natural hydrological processes along with anthropogenic activities therefore groundwater monitoring from time to time to ascertain its suitability for drinking is of great importance chemical analysis of the water is the common way to investigate groundwater quality dhanasekarapandian et al 2016 kannel et al 2008 there are various methods for the interpretation of groundwater quality including multivariate statistical techniques principal component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca hca and pca have been recently used by researchers for categorizing groundwater samples based on their similarity in case of chemical compositions pca is used to identify important underlying factors describing the correlations pattern between chemical parameters cluster analysis categorize the water samples based

spatial and temporal variation of groundwater could be investigated by developing thematic maps geographical information system gis is one of the management tools which has been in various studies to facilitate laborious procedures zanotti et al 2019 to our knowledge there is no study investigating the groundwater quality in the vicinity of sahand volcanic mountain therefore present study was aimed to investigate the rural drinking groundwater quality in the vicinity of sahand mountain in northwest of iran multivariate statistical analysis and gis based thematic maps were employed for the investigation of spatial and temporal changes of groundwater quality 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area present study was conducted in the rural communities of tabriz conuty in the vicinity of sahand mountain it is one of the highest mountains in iran and is one of the important dormant volcano in the country the sahand mountain is directly south of tabriz city with the highest peak at an elevation of 3707 m groundwater is the only source of water in the rural communities around sahand in the present study two different sides of the mountain which are highly populated were selected for groundwater quality assessment fig 1 shows the study area and the sampling points the groundwater chemical composition in the studied area was derived from the archive of rural water and wastewater company since 2011 2 2 chemical parameters and gwqi physicochemical parameters including anions bicarbonate sulfate chloride nitrate nitrite and fluoride and cations calcium magnesium sodium and potassium electric conductivity ec ph and water hardness were the investigated parameters in order to check the accuracy of the collected chemical composition the anion cation balance of the data were investigated groundwater quality index was also calculated to simplify the chemical properties of the water in the investigated area the gwqi was calculated using the assigned weight of each parameter table 1 the weights of the parameters vary between 1 and 5 depending on the importance of the parameters in water quality for calculation of gwqi the relative weight wi is calculated using eq 1 where wi is the weight of each investigated parameter and n is the number of all investigated parameters afterward the quality rating qi of the each parameter was calculated based on the standard values of the parameters given by world health organization who the qi was calculated using eq 2 2 q i c i s i 100 where ci is the concentration of the investigated parameter and si is the respective standard value finally for calculating the gwqi the sub index of the ith parameter si was calculated eq 3 and then the gwqi was determined using the si values eq 4 raju et al 2015 3 s i i w i q i 4 g w q i s i i based on the gwqi water quality could be classified as excellent water gwqi 50 good water 50 gwqi 100 poor water 100 gwqi 200 very poor water 200 gwqi 300 and non potable water gwqi 300 2 3 spatial and temporal variations the spatial and temporal distribution of groundwater quality parameters in the study area were illustrated using gis maps in arc gis software version 10 0 the inverse distance weighting idw interpolation procedure was used to develop the gis maps all the data were entered into a spatial database in the idw interpolation it is assumed that each sampling point has a local influence which is diminishing with distance therefore points which are close to the sampling point are given high weights while points far from the sampling points receive small weights eqs 5 and 6 gives the general formula for the idw interpolation 5 w x y i 1 n ƛ i w i 6 ƛ i 1 d i p i 1 n 1 d i p where w x y is the measured value in the sampling point x y n is the number of nearest sampling points ƛi are the weights assigned to each known point value wi at location xi yi di are the 2 d euclidean distances between each xi yi and x y and p is the experiment which influences the weighting of wi on w shekhar and xiong 2007 2 4 hydrochemical and multivariate statistical analysis the groundwater quality in the studied area was classified by piper diagram using aqqa software each water sample is characterized by various physicochemical parameters making the hydrochemical analysis more complicated to make it easy to understand principle component analysis pca and hierarchical cluster analysis hca were developed by spss 20 equamax rotation method was used in pca equamax rotation is usually used at one level of factor analysis as an attempt to clarify the relationship among factors pca can help identify important underlying factors that describe the pattern of correlations between chemical parameters agglomerative hierarchical clustering is a method of cluster analysis aiming to build a hierarchy of clusters cluster analysis are usually used for classifying the samples based on their similarity in chemical compositions and the results of are usually presented in the form of dendrogram liu et al 2017 blake et al 2016 bucci et al 2017 3 results and discussion 3 1 physicochemical characteristics of the water samples physicochemical characteristics of the groundwater samples along with descriptive statistics of the investigated water samples are given in table 2 based on the results tds in present study is lower than the values which have been reported by mosaferi et al 2014 in rural groundwater resources in northwest of iran 80 1200 mg l in another study conducted in malekan county northwest of iran the tds value have been reported to be about 300 1800 mg l shakerkhatibi et al 2019 the hardness of the investigated samples in the present study ranges between 60 and 252 mg l as caco3 with an averaged value of 164 mg l comparing the results of water hardness as one of the influencing parameter on the suitability of water for drinking is smaller than that of similar studies in northwest of iran e g shakerkhatibi et al 2019 reported that water hardness in malekan county was 220 720 mg l mosaferi et al 2014 reported that hardness of water samples in groundwater was 52 476 mg l with an average value of 185 88 mg l considering the water classification based on the water hardness soft water 75 mg l as caco3 75 medium hard 150 mg l caco3 150 hard water 300 mg l as caco3 and very hard water 300 mg l as caco3 balakrishnan et al 2011 the groundwater in the investigated area could be regarded as hard water 3 2 spatial and temporal variation of the groundwater quality in order to ease the interpretation of the physicochemical parameters both in different locations and times gwqi was calculated the calculated gwqi shows that drinking groundwater in the rural communities of tabriz county has the acceptable properties for drinking however considering the spatial distribution of the gwqi fig 2 it is found that groundwater quality in the southeast of sahand mountain is better than that of southwest as it is seen in the figure the highest gwqi is about 32 which is in the western part this difference in groundwater quality could be attributed to the geological structure of the studied area however anthropogenic activities could be the other reason affecting the groundwater quality in the studied area fig 3 shows the geological structure of the studied area as it is shown in the figure the geological structure of the studied area is not significantly different and all the samples are taken almost from the similar geological structure therefore lithology of the studied area cannot be determining factor in the groundwater quality in the investigated area however main the anthropogenic activities and industries of tabriz county are located in the western part of the study area therefore anthropogenic activities could be considered as the potential source of groundwater quality deterioration in order to investigate temporal variation of the groundwater quality in the studied area gwqi was calculated for consecutive 8 years fig 4 shows the spatial distribution of gwqi since 2011 as it is shown in the figure in the all investigated years gwqi falls in the acceptable level and the eastern part of the study area has better groundwater quality in addition to the spatial distribution of the groundwater quality comparing the average values of the gwqi within the years of 2011 2018 it is found that the gwqi shows an increasing trend and therefore water quality deteriorate in the study area fig 5 shows the gwqi trend within the investigated years as it is shown in the figure there is an increasing trend in the gwqi therefore the quality of drinking water in the study area is deteriorating this could be due to the increase of the anthropogenic activities and release of industrial and agricultural waste streams to the environment in recent years 3 3 hydrogeochemical characteristics of the groundwater in order to find out the hydrochemical faces of the groundwater piper diagram was plotted fig 6 illustrates the piper diagram of the investigated water samples in 2018 water quality could be divided into 6 different faces using the piper diagram mosaferi et al 2014 haselbeck et al 2019 gopinath et al 2019 cahco3 nacl mixed cana hco3 mixed camg cl cacl and nahco3 based on fig 6 it is found that investigated water samples fall into two of the hydrochemical faces almost 74 of water samples are calcium bicarbonate type and 26 of the samples are mixed camg cl type considering the spatial distribution of the water samples also shows a meaningful relation with the hydrochemical faces of the water type and their location majority of the cahco3 type water samples are located in the eastern part of the study area and the mixed camg cl type are in the western part the results of present study are in accordance with the findings of mosaferi et al mosaferi et al 2014 in tabriz county they also reported that 68 75 of water sample are calcium bicarbonate type and 25 are mixed camg cl type 3 4 multivariate statistical analysis the correlation study was carried out to find out relationship between physicochemical parameters table 3 represents the correlation matrix between the investigated parameters in the study area as it is shown in the table there is high correlation coefficient between tds and the other investigated parameters this is due to the direct influence of water ingredients on the tds level of water while there is a lower correlation 0 47 between nitrate and the tds value mosaferi et al 2014 also reported similar results in case of tds correlation with the other water ingredients and the correlation between nitrate and tds was reported to be 0 53 which is close to the value found in the present study the correlation between ph and all the other parameters is negative which more outstanding in case of bicarbonate and total hardness calcium and magnesium at lower ph values the carbonate alkalinity of water reduces therefore negative correlation between ph and alkalinity is observed raju et al 2015 also reported that there is negative correlation between ph and the other water ingredients another significant correlation is shown between nitrate and sulfate this could be due to the consumption of fertilizers as the study area is rural community with agricultural activities having major constituents of nitrogen along with sulfate the high correlation between nitrate and chloride could also be due to the municipal waste disposal in the study area raju et al 2015 fig 7 is illustrating the hca in the studied area based on tds values as it is depicted in the diagram the groundwater quality could be divided into two distinct clusters cluster 1 corresponds to about 58 of the samples with tds values higher than 300 mg l and cluster 2 involves about 42 of the water samples with tds values lower than 300 mg l based on the results all the water samples are suitable for drinking provided that the other toxic chemicals such as heavy metals are in accordance with the national water quality guidelines hca classifies the groundwater samples based on their quality therefore this classification could help for the future investigations in case of number of samples and consequently managing the monitoring costs table 4 represents the pca results of the groundwater quality in the study area as it is given in the table 3 different components have been extracted from the dataset including 85 46 of the total variance sample fluoride chloride sulfate nitrate sodium and potassium has strong positive loading in factor 1 pc1 could be linked to mineralization of rocks and soil could be the other source of the factors in pc1 alaya et al 2014 bicarbonate calcium magnesium and hardness have the strong positive loading in pc2 the source of this pc could be attributed to the lithology of the study area bicarbonate in this pc originates from carbonate mineral dissolution and soil co2 in addition bicarbonate could also come from biodegradation of organic contaminants ph has a strong negative loading in pc2 this can be due to the intrusion of surface water into the groundwater during heavy rainfall gulgundi and shetty 2018 dehghanzadeh et al 2015 phosphate and nitrite are the other remaining parameters having strong positive loading in pc3 due to the agricultural activities in the study area and application of fertilizers phosphorus and nitrogen are the elements entering the groundwater therefore fertilizers could be the possible source of factors loading in pc3 4 conclusion in the present study the groundwater quality was investigated in a volcanic region in northwest of iran for better understanding of the quality of groundwater in the studied area spatial and temporal variation of the groundwater were investigated in the last 8 years using groundwater quality index the results show that groundwater quality in the western part of sahand volcano is poor compared to that of eastern part in addition the groundwater quality in the last 8 years is deteriorating and the gwqi value is showing and increasing trend however the water quality is still suitable for drinking and meets the national drinking water guidelines multivariate statistical analysis was also conducted and classification of the groundwater was effectively carried out based on the cluster analysis a future optimal sampling strategy can be designed reducing the groundwater quality monitoring costs finally principle component analysis was useful in identifying the factors or sources responsible for variations in

parameters is negative which more outstanding in case of bicarbonate and total hardness calcium and magnesium at lower ph values the carbonate alkalinity of water reduces therefore negative correlation between ph and alkalinity is observed raju et al 2015 also reported that there is negative correlation between ph and the other water ingredients another significant correlation is shown between nitrate and sulfate this could be due to the consumption of fertilizers as the study area is rural community with agricultural activities having major constituents of nitrogen along with sulfate the high correlation between nitrate and chloride could also be due to the municipal waste disposal in the study area raju et al 2015 fig 7 is illustrating the hca in the studied area based on tds values as it is depicted in the diagram the groundwater quality could be divided into two distinct clusters cluster 1 corresponds to about 58 of the samples with tds values higher than 300 mg l and cluster 2 involves about 42 of the water samples with tds values lower than 300 mg l based on the results all the water samples are suitable for drinking provided that the other toxic chemicals such as heavy metals are in accordance with the national water quality guidelines hca classifies the groundwater samples based on their quality therefore this classification could help for the future investigations in case of number of samples and consequently managing the monitoring costs table 4 represents the pca results of the groundwater quality in the study area as it is given in the table 3 different components have been extracted from the dataset including 85 46 of the total variance sample fluoride chloride sulfate nitrate sodium and potassium has strong positive loading in factor 1 pc1 could be linked to mineralization of rocks and soil could be the other source of the factors in pc1 alaya et al 2014 bicarbonate calcium magnesium and hardness have the strong positive loading in pc2 the source of this pc could be attributed to the lithology of the study area bicarbonate in this pc originates from carbonate mineral dissolution and soil co2 in addition bicarbonate could also come from biodegradation of organic contaminants ph has a strong negative loading in pc2 this can be due to the intrusion of surface water into the groundwater during heavy rainfall gulgundi and shetty 2018 dehghanzadeh et al 2015 phosphate and nitrite are the other remaining parameters having strong positive loading in pc3 due to the agricultural activities in the study area and application of fertilizers phosphorus and nitrogen are the elements entering the groundwater therefore fertilizers could be the possible source of factors loading in pc3 4 conclusion in the present study the groundwater quality was investigated in a volcanic region in northwest of iran for better understanding of the quality of groundwater in the studied area spatial and temporal variation of the groundwater were investigated in the last 8 years using groundwater quality index the results show that groundwater quality in the western part of sahand volcano is poor compared to that of eastern part in addition the groundwater quality in the last 8 years is deteriorating and the gwqi value is showing and increasing trend however the water quality is still suitable for drinking and meets the national drinking water guidelines multivariate statistical analysis was also conducted and classification of the groundwater was effectively carried out based on the cluster analysis a future optimal sampling strategy can be designed reducing the groundwater quality monitoring costs finally principle component analysis was useful in identifying the factors or sources responsible for variations in

environment and water bodies resulting from various human activities industrial effluents and waste water discharge the various methods for the removal of these heavy metal ions are ion exchange adsorption electrochemical deposition membrane separation and gas separation various literatures focuses on adsorption method for bioi to show its high photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation suggesting that it could be a promising photocatalyst in the treatment of wastewaters containing organic pollutants ren et al 2012 1 and also showed its adsorption capabilities for phosphate in water liu et al 2013a 2 however separation membranes have become essential parts of the human life because of their growing industrial applications in hi tech areas such as biotechnology nano technology and membrane based energy devices in addition to different membrane based separation and purification processes nagarale et al 2006 3 these membranes have been utilized in separation process technologies because these processes are highly economically viable due to low energy requirements and facile scale up of membrane modular design various types of membranes have been developed for the use in reverse osmosis nanofiltration ultrafiltration microfiltration pervaporation electrodialysis solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell applications membrane based sensors medical use such as artificial organs and controlled release and different ion exchange membrane based electro membrane processes nagarale et al 2006 seno et al 1993 3 4 among these membranes ion exchange membranes are one of the most advanced separation membranes the basic principle on which the applications of these process lies is the donnan membrane equilibrium it is used for the recovery and enrichment of valuable ions and the removal of undesirable ions from waste water huang and wang 1993 5 especially to extract toxic metal ions from effluents kedem and bromberg 1993 6 the separation efficiency of a membrane is significantly influenced not only by the sieving action but also by the membrane charge takagi et al 2000 higa et al 1991 7 8 the membrane charge interacts with ions electrostatically and affects the separation efficiency of ions through the partition of ions from bulk solution into the membrane takagi et al 2000 7 thus it is important to know the electrical properties of the membrane around the interface for the separation efficiency of a membrane the ion transport properties across a charged membrane are determined by the measure of membrane potential the membrane selectivity towards particular ionic species and the concentration range of the external salt solution in which it behaves as a cation exchange membrane depends strongly on the fixed charge concentration of the membrane membrane potential can also give information about the membrane fixed charge effectiveness which is a central parameter governing transport phenomena in this kind of membranes barragán and pérez haro 2011 9 the origin of charge effectiveness is a result of the membrane inhomogeneities or ion pair formation between the fixed charge group and the counterion in the membrane matsumoto et al 2005 chou and tanioka 1998 10 11 it is well known that incorporating inorganic fillers into the polymer membranes matrices have attracted tremendous research interest in both academia and industry due to their structural diversity flexibility and has improved the physical and chemical properties of polymers the properties of the materials are not only the sum of individual contributions of both phases but also the role of the internal interfaces could be predominant imteyaz and rafiuddin 2015 12 these interfaces provide cohesion and linking to the composite materials the polymers can interact or be trapped within the inorganic matrix through a large set of weak interactions h bonds π π interactions van der waals sanchez et al 2005 13 in this paper composite membrane of polystyrene ps blended with bismuth oxyiodide bioi was synthesized to know the transport properties of the membrane the measure of the membrane potential is just a significant method for characterizing the ion transport phenomena across a charged membrane nagasawa et al tasaka et al 1975 nagasawa and kobatake 1952 14 15 kobatake and co workers kobatake et al 1965 kamo et al 1971a kamo et al 1971b toyoshima et al 1967 yuasa et al 1968 kamo et al 1973 16 21 teorell 1956 meyer and sievers 1936a 1936b 1936c schaep and vandecasteele 2001 22 24 have given theoretical models to describe the ion transport across a charged membrane in terms of fixed charge density transport number mobility ratio distribution coefficient charge effectiveness and other related parameters were also investigated various parameters governing the influence of counter and co ions on permeselectivity has been investigated binding affinity of counter ions with polymer matrix hydrated radii of co ions and dielectric exclusion of ions between media of different dielectric constants in particular a membrane matrix and a solvent were also taken into consideration thus with the proper modification we can use these membranes in removing the polluted and waste water being discharge off from the households or contaminated water run off from urban areas which pollute both the surface water body as well as groundwater 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of bismuth oxyiodide bioi all the reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification in a typical synthesis procedure of bioi 0 97 g of bi no3 3 5h2o bn was dissolved into 100 ml of aqueous solution having 9 ml of acetic acid under vigorous stirring for 15 min reddy et al 2013 25 then the obtained bn solution was added dropwise into another solution containing 0 33 g of ki in 100 ml of distilled water and was magnetically stirred for 1 h to obtain gel which was left for ageing at room temperature for 4 h the resulting reddish brown precipitate of bioi was filtered washed multiple times with distilled water to remove excess salts and then dried at 60 c for 24 h to get the final product there are more recent papers involving bioi synthesis using hydrothermal method jiang et al 2015 lee et al 2015 xiao et al 2012 26 28 2 2 preparation of polystyrene ps bioi composite material and membrane fabrication the ps bioi composite membrane was prepared out as follows ps was sieved with a sieve having mesh size of 200 75 μm and it was used as a binder to enhance the structural integrity and stability of the composite material the selection of optimum quantity of binder is of immense importance in membrane fabrication the membrane prepared by embedding 25 of ps was suitable for our purpose larger amount 25 and lesser amount 5 of ps did not give reproducible results and appeared to be unstable jabeen and rafiuddin 2009 arfin and rafiuddin 2011 29 30 with increase in the ratio of polymer there is increase in the number of polymer chains which further increases the number of obstacles in the membrane as a consequence the number of cation exchange sites decreases which ultimately decreases the electrochemical and transport property of the membrane and affects its application in membrane processes thus the powder with 25 75 polymer inorganic ratio by weight was mixed in mortar pestle to have uniform contact amid them and was placed in furnace maintained at 60 c for 1 h to equilibrate the reaction mixture it was then pressed in a hydraulic press sl 89 uk by applying pressure of 7 tons for 5 min the fabricated membrane samples were equilibrated in electrolyte solution of interest for at least 24 h prior to the measurement 2 3 physico chemical characterization of the membrane the crystal structure and phase purity of the material was done by x ray diffraction xrd analysis using rigaku miniflex x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å having scanning speed of 4 min with diffraction angle in the range of 2 θ 20 80 fourier transform infrared ft ir absorption peaks of the synthesized material was recorded on perkinelmer spectrum version 10 03 09 using kbr disc method at room temperature to elucidate various functional groups and chemical structure simultaneously thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis tg dta was performed using shimadzu dtg 60 h operated under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 20 c min from 25 to 600 c the morphology of the materials was observed by scanning electron microscopy jeol jsm 6510 lv operated at 15 kv the samples were mounted on a sample stud using double sided conductive tape 2 4 water uptake properties of the composite membrane the water uptake properties of the membranes were studied by the usual gravimetric method the membrane was first immersed in 1 m solutions of nacl and kcl separately at room temperature for 24 h the excess moisture was wiped carefully with whatman filter paper and the swollen membrane was weighed w w e t secondly the same membrane was dried at 60 c in an oven and weight w d r y was recorded once again the water uptake percentage of the composite membrane was estimated by the following equation barragán and pérez haro 2011 9 1 water uptake w w e t w d r y w d r y 100 where w w e t and w d r y are weight of wet and dry mass of the membrane respectively the increase in weight of the membrane was equal to the weight of the liquid sorbed by it the process was repeated several times using different membrane samples to avoid error due to the surface water and the average value was taken swelling ratio was obtained as imteyaz and rafiuddin 2016 31 2 swelling ratio a wet a dry a dry 100 where a wet and a dry are wet and dry area of membranes respectively to know about the swelling ratio of membranes in different concentrations of all the electrolytic salt used the membranes were immersed in 1 m 0 1 m and 0 01 m salt solutions the swelling ratio experiment was performed at room temperature the swelling characteristics of polymeric membranes are closely related to the structural properties of the polymers and their permeability to solutes crank and park 1975 meares 1977 muhr and blanshard 1982 32 34 2 5 electrochemical characterization of the membrane the membrane sample of 4 71 cm2 effective area was placed in between a 2 compartment glass cell with a volume of each half cell being 30 ml the salts of nacl kcl nano3 and kno3 were used as electrolytes and were filled in glass cell in 6 series with varying concentrations ranging from 1m to 0 0001 m maintaining the ratio of concentrations c2 c1 γ to a constant value of 10 to minimize concentration polarization at the membrane surface magnetic stirrer was placed at the bottom of each half cell silver electrode was used as a reference electrode and the electrode potential was calculated using digital potentiometer electronics india 118 the process was repeated 3 times by replacing the solutions with new one and the average of experimental potential ψ ex was taken as the desired result membrane potential ψm is given as imteyaz and rafiuddin 2016 31 3 ψ m ψ ex ψ offset where ψ offset is the offset potential which arises due to difference between electrodes 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the composite membrane fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of pure bioi and ps bioi composite the main diffraction peaks of ps bioi composite at 2θ levels 29 46 31 46 37 01 39 19 45 24 49 77 51 10 54 97 60 01 61 34 65 55 and 66 21 are almost similar to pure bioi and can be indexed to the tetragonal phase of bioi jcpds 10 0445 yu et al 2014 1 which indicates that the presence of ps in composite does not result in the development of new crystal orientations or changes in preferential orientations of bioi no characteristic peaks assigned to ps in the ps bioi composite can be attributed to the low amount and relatively low diffraction intensity of ps liu and wang 2013 35 however the presence of ps in ps bioi composite can be easily evidenced by fourier transform infrared as discussed later the average crystallite size of composite and pure bioi was estimated using the scherrer formula scherrer 1918 patterson 1939 36 37 4 d k λ λ cos θ where k is the scherrer s constant k 0 94 λ is the wavelength of x ray radiation λ 0 15406 nm for cu λ is the full width at half maximum fwhm and θ is the diffraction angle the average crystallite size of the composite was found to be around 31 nm whereas that of pure bioi was around 38 nm ft ir spectra of ps pure bioi and ps bioi composite are illustrated in fig 2 the characteristic strong peak around 3413 cm 1 was attributed to interstitial water molecules and non bonding ν o h stretching vibrations the absorption bands at 3010 cm 1 and 2899 cm 1 affirms the c h mode of aromatic and aliphatic groups of ps warsi et al 2020 38 the absorption peaks of pure bioi at low frequency below 1000 cm 1 corresponded to the vibration of biobi bonds liu et al 2013b 35 and to the stretching vibration of the tetragonal crystal links of bioi mansilla et al 2014 39 however the ps bioi composite below 1000 cm 1 shows shifting in the absorption bands towards lower wave number suggesting an intensive chemical interaction between ps and bioi in ps bioi composite there is increment in the intensity of absorption bands at 491 537 699 and 753 cm 1 as compared to pure bioi attributed to the presence of aromatic ring in the composite thus the spectrum clearly shows the presence of ps in the composite tga curves for pure bioi and ps bioi composite are shown in fig 3 a the weight loss of 3 53 of pure bioi up to 300 c is attributed to the loss of absorbed moisture or the residual or absorbed solvent sahoo et al 2013 40 from the temperature 300 600 c 18 67 of weight loss has been observed owing to the decomposition of bioi however for composite the curve shows a higher weight loss of about 22 27 from 350 c onwards caused by the thermo oxidation of the polymer matrix dta curves for pure bioi and ps bioi composite are shown in fig 3b pure bioi shows a slight beginning of exothermic peak at about 600 c whereas the composite shows an obvious exothermic peak at 572 c a marked deviation attributed to the melting of the material the decrease in exotherm shows a strong evidence of composite formation as suggested in literature ponomareva et al 2001 uvarov et al 2000 41 42 the surface of bioi and ps bioi was observed by sem and the images are shown in fig 4 the sem study was done to depict the morphological changes produced at the surface after binding of bioi with ps fig 4a shows smooth planar structure of constituent inorganic part which upon binding with polymer fig 4b shows intergranular cavitation with porous structure having loose array of grains and micro voids without any aggregation on the surface this confirms the composite membrane to be porous in nature 3 2 properties of the composite membrane water uptake property of the composite membrane plays a significant role in the transport of ions across it the membrane shows comparable water uptake due to inherent property of the inorganic part to keep both physical and chemically bound moisture and pore formation creating free space to absorb more water since water channel promotes the migration of the ionic species with the increase in transport phenomena the presence of electrolyte plays an important role in the swelling of membrane membrane immersed in nacl solution shows highest swelling in comparison to other electrolytes used in the experiment table 1 gives the swelling ratio of membrane in electrolytic solutions at different concentration this relies on the fact that the swelling of the membrane decreases with the increase in ionic radius of cation randová et al 2008 43 swelling of the composite membrane results from the balance between the internal osmotic pressure and the forces associated with the elasticity of the polymer matrix moreover the internal osmotic pressure is due to the presence in the polymeric groups counter ions and sorbed electrolyte barragán and pérez haro 2011 9 it was found that the water uptake of a membrane depends on the water s vapour pressure of the surroundings the water uptake of the membrane depends upon the process of water sorption from liquid and vapour phases known as schroeder s paradox schroeder 1903 zawodzinski jr et al 1993 44 45 water uptake from the liquid phase is direct whereas water sorption from the vapour phase occurs by capillary condensation deodar and luner 1980 the inorganic material increases water sorption however the organic material results in poor wettability on the hydrophobic surface of the membrane zawodzinski jr et al 1993 duan et al 2013 li et al 2010 45 47 48 in general membranes having the same chemical composition should absorb comparable amounts of water the water uptake properties depend on density of the polymer network hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the polymer and also on the membrane morphology this confirms that interstices are insignificant and the dense ionizable groups are the same throughout the membrane and suggests that diffusion would occur mainly through ion exchange sites across the membrane arfin et al 2012 49 3 3 electrochemical properties of the composite membrane 3 3 1 membrane potential membranes often respond to a few gradients that they experience between either sides of the membrane for concentration as gradient dialysis process took place higa et al 1998 50 charged membrane when brought in contact with same electrolytic salt of unequal concentrations develop a contact region across the membrane and acquires an electrical charge because of this unequal concentration of electrolytes there is unequal flow of ions and thus develops a potential difference resulting from the two contributions of donnan and a diffusion potential the teorell meyer and sievers meyer and sievers 1936a 1936b 1936c teorell 1935 23 51 theoretical model well explained these phenomena by giving an idealized equation 5 ψ m 59 2 log c 2 4 c 1 2 x 2 x c 1 4 c 2 2 x 2 x u log 4 c 2 2 x 2 x u 4 c 1 2 x 2 x u 6 u u v u v where u and v are the cation and anion mobilities m2v 1s 1 respectively and x is the fixed charge density of the membrane expressed in equivalents per unit volume the diffusion potential arises because of the difference in mobilities of cations and anions the fast moving ions diffuses rapidly from high concentrated side to low concentrated side through junctions to maintain the electro neutrality condition meanwhile the slow moving ions are left behind on the higher concentration side the ion distribution is purely due to the diffusion and electro migration this type of separation of charge would cause an electrical potential the donnan potential arises because of the charge on pore walls of the membrane this charge repels the co ions having same charge to that of the pore walls and attracts the counter ions having opposite charge to that of pore walls as a consequence the counter ions diffuse through the pores and will have higher concentration in the membrane phase than in solution phase whereas the co ions are excluded from the pores and will have lower concentration in the membrane phase than in solution phase because of this concentration difference a potential difference known as donnan potential is generated between the membrane and solution interface to maintain the electrochemical equilibrium thereby showing conducive effects in repulsion of co ions and attraction of counter ions by the membrane peeters et al 1998 52 this leads to the formation of an electrical double layer so that a charged surface and a neutralizing excess of counter ions exists in the adjacent solution hall et al 1997 schaep 1999 53 54 according to tms theory an equilibrium process develops at each membrane solution interface which has a formal similarity with the donnan equilibrium this theory rely on following assumptions 1 all electrolytes dissolve perfectly 2 the electrical charge of the membrane is uniform 3 the transference of water from either side of the membrane may be ignored 4 the effect of the diffusion boundary layer at membrane solution interface is negligible 5 the activity coefficients of all ions are equal to unity 6 the fixed charge groups are homogeneously distributed in the membrane 7 the cation and anion mobilities and fixed charge concentrations are constant throughout the membrane phase and are independent of the electrolyte concentration another assumption is that the activity coefficient of the salt is the same in both the membrane and solution phase the introduction of activities for salt concentrations can only be correctly made for the donnan potential whereas the expression for the diffusion potential using either the integration of planck or henderson meyer and sievers 1936a 1936b 1936c 23 equations fig 5 a shows the potential values table 2 of ps bioi composite membrane observed at 25 2 c for different concentrations of nacl kcl nano3 and kno3 salts and were plotted against log c 2 the membrane potential shows positive values on decreasing the electrolyte concentrations and thus confirms the composite membrane to be of cation selective in nature attributed to the structural changes produced in the electrical double layer at the solution membrane interface arfin and rafiuddin 2009 55 the electrical double layer at the membrane solution interface seems to control the ion permeation as suggested by tien and ting tien and ting 1968 56 the potential values follow the order nacl kcl nano3 kno3 with different sizes of electrolytic ions the membrane potential increased with the decrease in cation size for anions differences found are according to the size mobility ratio and strong interaction with the membrane matrix small size and higher mobility of cl ion shows greater value of the membrane potential whereas no3 ion shows lower value because of its large size and strong interaction with the membrane matrix both cl and no3 co ions will be repelled by the charges present on the pore walls of the membrane the membrane potential depends on the diffusion of ions hence cl ion small size would diffuse more rapidly leaving behind no3 ion large size which would get more time for repulsion and get attracted towards the opposite charge present on the wall of the membrane 3 3 2 transport number and mobility ratio transport number is the fraction of total current carried by counter ions passing through the membrane klaysom et al 2010 57 membrane when separated by unequal electrolyte solutions develops membrane potential which can be used to calculate the transport number and is given by the following equation klaysom et al 2010 kang et al 2003 57 58 7 ψ m r t f t t ln c 2 c 1 where r t and f are gas constant absolute temperature and faraday constant respectively c 1 and c 2 are the concentrations of electrolyte solutions in the testing glass chamber the transport property depends on the characteristic electrical charge of the membrane the effective charge of the membrane affects the transport of ions for slightly charged membranes the donnan effect of the co ions can be neglected and the diffusion potential is mainly responsible for the membrane potential due to the different mobilities of co ions and counter ions in the membrane and its expression for 1 1 electrolytes is arfin et al 2012 laksminarayanahia 1969 49 59 8 u t z t z 9 ω t t u v where u is a parameter related to the combined transport numbers of the ions in the membrane t and t are the transport number of cation and anion z and z are the valences of cation and anion u and v are their molar mobilities respectively the ratio of molar mobilities of cation to anion is given by the mobility ratio ω in this report the transport number at lower concentration of sodium salt for the composite membrane reached up to 0 90 demonstrated slight deviations from the ideal ion selective property of 1 00 the values of both transport number t and mobility ratio ω as given in table 3 shows positive trend with dilution i e increases with decreasing the electrolyte concentrations due to flow of electrolytic ions through the membrane matrix thus the membrane exhibits very good selectivity for na it can clearly be seen that transport numbers for na decreased with increasing concentration of the nacl solution which is considered to be due to the decrease in donnan exclusion apart from these two parameters the membrane potential ψ m can also be used to determine the counter ion transport number in the membrane phase assuming the transport number to be constant throughout the membrane aizawa et al 1980 60 proposed the following relationship between ψ m and 1 c 1 to calculate the transport number of counter ions 10 ψ m r t f 2 t m 1 l n γ 2 γ 1 γ 1 t m t m θ x c 1 where t m and θ x are the counter ion transport number and concentration of fixed charge in the membrane phase respectively and γ 10 for better determination of transport number in the membrane phase the effective concentration of exchange site of the membrane should be much lower than electrolyte concentration benavente and canas 1999 61 slope θ x and intercept t m values can be obtained by plotting the graph of ψ m against 1 c 1 using eq 10 the value of t m and θ x table 4 follows the order nacl kcl nano3 kno3 it can be well concluded from the above table that the membrane is more selective towards li ion as selectivity is proportional to the counter ion transport number 3 4 evaluation and comparison of fixed charge density by various theoretical models 3 4 1 nagasawa nagasawa et al has given the equation tasaka et al 1975 nagasawa and kobatake 1952 14 15 11 ψ m r t f γ γ 1 x 2 1 c 1 to calculate the fixed charge density of a charged membrane when separated by unequal electrolyte concentrations c1 and c2 where x is the fixed charge density of the membrane and γ 10 fig 5b shows the membrane potential as function of electrolyte concentration ψ m vs 1 c 1 straight lines were obtained for the membrane in the range of concentration studied this suggests that the membrane potential is inversely related to the electrolyte concentrations the slope values can be further used to evaluate the fixed charge density table 5 of the composite membrane 3 4 2 kobatake et al starting with the basic flow equation based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes kobatake has given a theory for membrane potential which is applicable for the charged membrane separated by electrolyte solutions of variable concentrations it has two limiting forms 1 when c 1 becomes sufficiently small with fixed γ 10 value the fixed charge density of the composite membrane can be calculated as 12 ψ m r t f 1 β l n γ γ 1 α β γ 1 1 β 2 α c 1 x where β is related to the effect of adsorption of ions upon the membrane material α is related to membrane selectivity of ions by plotting a graph of ψ m vs c 1 intercept and slope gave the values of β and α respectively thereafter the fixed charge density can be calculated 2 at high salt concentration with fixed γ 10 value the fixed charge density can be further evaluated using membrane potential values and t a p p from the equation 13 1 t a p p 1 1 α α γ 1 1 α γ l n γ x c 1 where the inverse of an apparent transport number for the co ion species in a negatively charged membrane is proportional to the inverse of concentration the apparent transport number can be calculated using the nernst form of equation 14 ψ m r t f 1 2 t a p p ln c 2 c 1 using eqs 13 and 14 the plot of inverse of apparent transport number 1 t a p p against 1 c 1 as shown in fig 5c gives the value of fixed charge density of the membrane from intercept value the values of α and β as calculated above are given in table 4 3 4 3 teorell meyer and sievers the theory considered membrane potential as a sum of donnan potentials occurring at each membrane solution interface and a diffusion potential within the membrane as shown in fig 6 a set of theoretical curves were obtained using eqs 5 and 6 of the tms theory that can be further utilized to calculate the fixed charge density of the membrane the curves in the plot fig 7 show the theoretical potential values for the composite membrane at different mobility ratio with constant x value the experimental curve for membrane potential of nacl was also plotted in the same plot nacl shows the highest membrane potential and thus was used in the plot for determination of fixed charge density the experimental potential curve was shifted horizontally and ran parallel to one of the theoretical potential curves this shift gave log x values within the membrane phase the values of x derived in this way for various 1 1 electrolytes are given in table 4 the order of fixed charge density for various monovalent electrolytes was found to be nacl kcl nano3 kno3 thus the membrane potential greatly affects the effective fixed charge density which further depends on ionic species and potential distributions in the systems in fig 7 the solid lines represent the theoretical expected behavior of an ideal membrane resting potential approaching to 59 mv in nacl solutions at different mobility ratios on comparing fig 7 with fig 5a the membrane potential of nacl shows deviation from the ideal value this occurs mainly because of decrease of transport number of cations on increasing electrolyte concentration barragán and pérez haro 2011 9 form these theoretical models the calculated values of fixed charge density of the composite membrane for various monovalent electrolytes comparatively agreed with one another the two limiting forms of kobatake show slight deviation due to the low estimation of charge density thereby confirming its applicability in the system the assumption made by the above theoretical models result in the deviation of fixed charge density values of the composite membrane the fixed charge density given here could not reflect the effects of the distribution of charge groups or the morphology of the hydrophilic part of the charged membrane however it was assumed that the fixed charge groups were distributed homogeneously in the ideal charged membrane thus it should be taken into account to develop the tms theory matsumoto et al 1998 62 another deviation is due to the difference in mobility ratio of cation to anion in the water and membrane phase however it was assumed to be constant throughout the membrane phase thus these assumptions must be taken into consideration on the basis of results it can be concluded that in high concentration range the electrical double layers formed at the interface in the pores gets compressed and the entire pore volume becomes electrically neutral so under this condition donnan effect can be neglected in low concentration range the distribution of ions arising by the diffusion of counter ions is the main reason to the membrane potential this is mainly because of complete exclusion of co ions from the pores due to the high double layer repulsion under these circumstances the diffusion effect can be ignored however in the intermediate concentration range neither the donnan effect nor diffusion effect can be negligible as a result the values of membrane potential between the above two limits increases as the concentrations of the electrolytes become lower sasidhar and ruckenstein 1982 shang et al 2006 63 64 teorell meyer and sievers tms theory was further extended to calculate the charge effectiveness distribution coefficient and counter and co ion concentrations 15 ψ m r t v k f ln γ 2 c 2 c 1 γ 1 c 1 c 2 r t v k f ω 1 ω 1 ln ω 1 c 2 v x v k x ω 1 c 1 v x v k x where r is real gas constant t is temperature and f is faraday constant γ is the mean ionic activity coefficients c 1 and c 2 are cation concentrations on opposite side of the membrane ω is the mobility ratio of cation to anion in the membrane phase v x and v k are the valences of fixed charge group on polymer and cation respectively the membrane counter c and co ion c concentration can be obtained from the given relation and the values are given in table 3 16 c v x x 2 v k 2 γ c q 2 v x x 2 v k 17 c v x x 2 v k 2 γ c q 2 v x x 2 v k the charge effectiveness q can be given as 18 q γ k where k is the charge distribution coefficient and is given by 19 k c i c i and c i c i x where c i and c i are the i th concentration of ion in the membrane phase and external solution respectively the distribution coefficient k values when plotted against log c 2 shows a drop down trend with the decrease in electrolyte concentration for various monovalent electrolytes up to certain concentration range as shown in fig 8 a and then shows an abrupt increase at lowest concentration this large deviation in the k value at lowest electrolyte concentration is attributed to the high mobility of comparatively free charges as a result reaches into the membrane phase easily as compared to higher electrolyte concentration however kno3 shows deviation in the lowest concentration region because of the low mobility of free charges in this range as compared to other electrolytes the charge effectiveness q values when plotted against log c 2 shows a trend opposite to k values for various monovalent electrolyte concentrations as shown in fig 8b at higher and lower electrolyte concentrations the charge effectiveness decreases whereas at moderate concentration it shows a maximum value this deviation in charge effectiveness values can be explained on the basis of fixed charge groups associated with the membrane phase at higher or lower external electrolyte concentrations there is inequality in the concentration of fixed charged groups in the membrane phase and the counter ion concentration of external electrolyte as a result a number of counter ions reaches into the membrane phase easily and shows enhanced binding affinity for polymer fixed charge groups thus the value of charge effectiveness goes down imteyaz and rafiuddin 2015 12 in contrary to the above results in moderate concentration region the concentration of fixed charged groups in the membrane phase and the counter ion concentration are comparable and thus show maximum value in this region however kno3 does not attain the maximum value at moderate concentration due to low binding affinity of ions with the fixed charge groups 3 5 permselectivity of the composite membrane a cation exchange membrane that permits only the transport of counter ions while blocking the co ions is said to be perfectly permselective co ion transport could results from either diffusive i e concentration driven transport from high to low concentration or field driven migration of co ions where the relative magnitude of each form of transport is sensitive to the concentration difference and the magnitude of the applied electric field geise et al 2014a helfferich 1995 65 66 the permselectivity p s of a cation exchange membrane can be calculated from the transport number using the eq 20 p s t m t t where t m refers to the transport number of counter ions in the membrane phase t and t refers to the transport number of counter and co ions in the solution phase respectively from the p s value we can further calculate the fixed charge density of the membrane x using the equation kobatake et al 1965 16 21 1 4 ξ 2 1 1 t a p p α α 2 α 1 1 t a p p p s where ξ c x a cation exchange membrane when brought in contact with unequal electrolyte concentrations develops a transport phenomenon exclusively via counter ions and co ions are completely excluded from the membrane as depicted in fig 9 this explanation of permselectivity has been confirmed by the different values of p s using eq 21 1 if p s becomes equal to unity t a p p 0 i e no transport of co ions whereas 2 if p s becomes zero t a p p 1 α i e anions behave as in bulk solution or as in a membrane having no fixed charge the value of fixed charge density can be further evaluated by considering the fact that when c becomes equal to θ x in the above equation then p s attains the value of 1 5 or 0 447 the value of the c corresponding to which p s 0 447 gives the values of fixed charge density x from the plots of p s against log c where c c 1 c 2 2 as shown in fig 10 the values of fixed charge density was calculated for various monovalent electrolytes table 5 nacl shows the highest value of permselectivity as well as fixed charge density confirming maximum selectivity of the membrane for na ions which is in accordance with the other methods described above 3 5 1 effect of counter ions on permselectivity the binding affinity of counter ions with polymer fixed charge group shows a significant effect on permselectivity higher the binding affinity lower will be the permselectivity among the used counter ions k counter ion shows strong interaction with the fixed charge group on the polymer thereby decreasing the effective membrane charge density bonner 1954 67 as a result permselectivity decreases the decrease in effective fixed charge density value of kcl was confirmed by various theoretical membrane models used in this report among the used electrolytes nacl shows maximum permselectivity because the na counter ion has greater tendency to exclude co ions as compared to the other counter ions followed by k donnan theory predicts that co ion sorption in the membrane decreases as fixed charge concentration increases since co ion sorption is related to co ion transport helfferich 1995 geise et al 2014b 66 68 reduced fixed charge concentration in the membrane is expected to reduce permselectivity based on this theory it can be concluded that na has greater tendency to exclude co ions than other counter ions and had highest permselectivity value 3 5 2 effect of co ions on permselectivity the hydrated radii of co ions play an important role in permselectivity of the membrane imteyaz and rafiuddin 2016 69 both the nitrate and chloride co ions used in this report carry a unit negative charge with the basic difference in their hydrated radii nitrate ions has greater hydrated radius 335pm as compared to chloride ions 331pm nightingale jr 1959 70 as a consequence more sorption of nitrate into the membrane took place as compared to chloride this results into greater chloride exclusion because of strong interactions between the charge dense chloride ion and the polymer matrix of the membrane thus chloride co ion shows high value of permselectivity the electrolytes follows the order nacl kcl nano3 kno3 for permselectivity values dielectric exclusion is caused by the interactions of ions with the bound electric charges induced by ions at interfaces between media of different dielectric constants in particular a membrane matrix and a solvent yaroshchuk 2000 71 apart from donnan exclusion the ions can also be excluded from polymers via dielectric exclusion this can be based on the fact that both the media electrolytes dissolved in water and water swollen polymer has different dielectric constants matsumoto et al 1998 62 the ions prefer to partition into high dielectric constant media i e water compared to lower dielectric constant media i e water swollen polymer among chloride and nitrate co ions chloride may be less soluble in swollen polymer membranes which will likely have a static dielectric constant lower than that of water compared to nitrate ions this causes greater dielectric exclusion of chloride co ions from the membrane and results into higher permselectivity than nitrate co ions 4 conclusions a new type of composite cation exchange membrane ps bioi was synthesized by dispersing inorganic bioi in the matrix of ps the membrane was broadly characterized for its physico chemical properties the xrd confirms the composite membrane to be crystalline in nature with average crystallite size of 31 nm ft ir spectra show intermolecular interaction of peaks at different wave numbers suggesting intensive chemical interaction between ps and bioi tg dta curve confirms the thermal stability of the membrane whereas sem images show the surface morphology with porous structure the membrane is considered as charged pore model and is treated with different monovalent unequal electrolyte bulk concentrations 1m 0 0001 m in both sides of the membrane here current flows due to the establishment of concentration and potential gradients in the system the membrane potential followed the trend nacl kcl nano3 kno3 attributed to the different sizes of electrolytic ions the composite membrane immersed in 1 m nacl solution shows high water uptake because of small ionic radius of na ion as compared to 1 m kcl solution the cl ion with higher mobility ratio and small size shows greater value of membrane potential as compared to no3 ion because of its large size and strong interaction with the membrane matrix the potential shows positive values with the decrease in electrolyte concentrations confirming the membrane to be cation selective membrane potential also gave fixed charge density value of the membrane evaluated and compared using various theoretical models a nagasawa b kobatake and c teorell meyer and sievers na ion shows highest value of fixed charge density in all the methods as the donnan exclusion is highest for the electrolyte of smaller cation size the experimental results were verified which comparatively agreed with theoretical models tms theory was further extended to calculate the distribution coefficient charge effectiveness and ions concentration in the membrane phase among the used counter ions k shows low value of permselectivity because of its strong binding affinity for the polymer fixed charge groups than that of na counter ion for co ions the value depends on hydrated radii no3 with higher hydrated radii and lower charge density also tended to result in low membrane permselectivity dielectric exclusion of co ions is another factor responsible for the values of permselectivity thus the donnan membrane equilibrium process can be used for the removal of undesirable ions from the waste water these membranes can differentiate cations and anions and have a higher transport number of counter

environment and water bodies resulting from various human activities industrial effluents and waste water discharge the various methods for the removal of these heavy metal ions are ion exchange adsorption electrochemical deposition membrane separation and gas separation various literatures focuses on adsorption method for bioi to show its high photocatalytic activity under visible light irradiation suggesting that it could be a promising photocatalyst in the treatment of wastewaters containing organic pollutants ren et al 2012 1 and also showed its adsorption capabilities for phosphate in water liu et al 2013a 2 however separation membranes have become essential parts of the human life because of their growing industrial applications in hi tech areas such as biotechnology nano technology and membrane based energy devices in addition to different membrane based separation and purification processes nagarale et al 2006 3 these membranes have been utilized in separation process technologies because these processes are highly economically viable due to low energy requirements and facile scale up of membrane modular design various types of membranes have been developed for the use in reverse osmosis nanofiltration ultrafiltration microfiltration pervaporation electrodialysis solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell applications membrane based sensors medical use such as artificial organs and controlled release and different ion exchange membrane based electro membrane processes nagarale et al 2006 seno et al 1993 3 4 among these membranes ion exchange membranes are one of the most advanced separation membranes the basic principle on which the applications of these process lies is the donnan membrane equilibrium it is used for the recovery and enrichment of valuable ions and the removal of undesirable ions from waste water huang and wang 1993 5 especially to extract toxic metal ions from effluents kedem and bromberg 1993 6 the separation efficiency of a membrane is significantly influenced not only by the sieving action but also by the membrane charge takagi et al 2000 higa et al 1991 7 8 the membrane charge interacts with ions electrostatically and affects the separation efficiency of ions through the partition of ions from bulk solution into the membrane takagi et al 2000 7 thus it is important to know the electrical properties of the membrane around the interface for the separation efficiency of a membrane the ion transport properties across a charged membrane are determined by the measure of membrane potential the membrane selectivity towards particular ionic species and the concentration range of the external salt solution in which it behaves as a cation exchange membrane depends strongly on the fixed charge concentration of the membrane membrane potential can also give information about the membrane fixed charge effectiveness which is a central parameter governing transport phenomena in this kind of membranes barragán and pérez haro 2011 9 the origin of charge effectiveness is a result of the membrane inhomogeneities or ion pair formation between the fixed charge group and the counterion in the membrane matsumoto et al 2005 chou and tanioka 1998 10 11 it is well known that incorporating inorganic fillers into the polymer membranes matrices have attracted tremendous research interest in both academia and industry due to their structural diversity flexibility and has improved the physical and chemical properties of polymers the properties of the materials are not only the sum of individual contributions of both phases but also the role of the internal interfaces could be predominant imteyaz and rafiuddin 2015 12 these interfaces provide cohesion and linking to the composite materials the polymers can interact or be trapped within the inorganic matrix through a large set of weak interactions h bonds π π interactions van der waals sanchez et al 2005 13 in this paper composite membrane of polystyrene ps blended with bismuth oxyiodide bioi was synthesized to know the transport properties of the membrane the measure of the membrane potential is just a significant method for characterizing the ion transport phenomena across a charged membrane nagasawa et al tasaka et al 1975 nagasawa and kobatake 1952 14 15 kobatake and co workers kobatake et al 1965 kamo et al 1971a kamo et al 1971b toyoshima et al 1967 yuasa et al 1968 kamo et al 1973 16 21 teorell 1956 meyer and sievers 1936a 1936b 1936c schaep and vandecasteele 2001 22 24 have given theoretical models to describe the ion transport across a charged membrane in terms of fixed charge density transport number mobility ratio distribution coefficient charge effectiveness and other related parameters were also investigated various parameters governing the influence of counter and co ions on permeselectivity has been investigated binding affinity of counter ions with polymer matrix hydrated radii of co ions and dielectric exclusion of ions between media of different dielectric constants in particular a membrane matrix and a solvent were also taken into consideration thus with the proper modification we can use these membranes in removing the polluted and waste water being discharge off from the households or contaminated water run off from urban areas which pollute both the surface water body as well as groundwater 2 experimental section 2 1 preparation of bismuth oxyiodide bioi all the reagents and chemicals were of analytical grade and used without further purification in a typical synthesis procedure of bioi 0 97 g of bi no3 3 5h2o bn was dissolved into 100 ml of aqueous solution having 9 ml of acetic acid under vigorous stirring for 15 min reddy et al 2013 25 then the obtained bn solution was added dropwise into another solution containing 0 33 g of ki in 100 ml of distilled water and was magnetically stirred for 1 h to obtain gel which was left for ageing at room temperature for 4 h the resulting reddish brown precipitate of bioi was filtered washed multiple times with distilled water to remove excess salts and then dried at 60 c for 24 h to get the final product there are more recent papers involving bioi synthesis using hydrothermal method jiang et al 2015 lee et al 2015 xiao et al 2012 26 28 2 2 preparation of polystyrene ps bioi composite material and membrane fabrication the ps bioi composite membrane was prepared out as follows ps was sieved with a sieve having mesh size of 200 75 μm and it was used as a binder to enhance the structural integrity and stability of the composite material the selection of optimum quantity of binder is of immense importance in membrane fabrication the membrane prepared by embedding 25 of ps was suitable for our purpose larger amount 25 and lesser amount 5 of ps did not give reproducible results and appeared to be unstable jabeen and rafiuddin 2009 arfin and rafiuddin 2011 29 30 with increase in the ratio of polymer there is increase in the number of polymer chains which further increases the number of obstacles in the membrane as a consequence the number of cation exchange sites decreases which ultimately decreases the electrochemical and transport property of the membrane and affects its application in membrane processes thus the powder with 25 75 polymer inorganic ratio by weight was mixed in mortar pestle to have uniform contact amid them and was placed in furnace maintained at 60 c for 1 h to equilibrate the reaction mixture it was then pressed in a hydraulic press sl 89 uk by applying pressure of 7 tons for 5 min the fabricated membrane samples were equilibrated in electrolyte solution of interest for at least 24 h prior to the measurement 2 3 physico chemical characterization of the membrane the crystal structure and phase purity of the material was done by x ray diffraction xrd analysis using rigaku miniflex x ray diffractometer with cu kα radiation λ 1 54 å having scanning speed of 4 min with diffraction angle in the range of 2 θ 20 80 fourier transform infrared ft ir absorption peaks of the synthesized material was recorded on perkinelmer spectrum version 10 03 09 using kbr disc method at room temperature to elucidate various functional groups and chemical structure simultaneously thermogravimetric differential thermal analysis tg dta was performed using shimadzu dtg 60 h operated under nitrogen atmosphere with a heating rate of 20 c min from 25 to 600 c the morphology of the materials was observed by scanning electron microscopy jeol jsm 6510 lv operated at 15 kv the samples were mounted on a sample stud using double sided conductive tape 2 4 water uptake properties of the composite membrane the water uptake properties of the membranes were studied by the usual gravimetric method the membrane was first immersed in 1 m solutions of nacl and kcl separately at room temperature for 24 h the excess moisture was wiped carefully with whatman filter paper and the swollen membrane was weighed w w e t secondly the same membrane was dried at 60 c in an oven and weight w d r y was recorded once again the water uptake percentage of the composite membrane was estimated by the following equation barragán and pérez haro 2011 9 1 water uptake w w e t w d r y w d r y 100 where w w e t and w d r y are weight of wet and dry mass of the membrane respectively the increase in weight of the membrane was equal to the weight of the liquid sorbed by it the process was repeated several times using different membrane samples to avoid error due to the surface water and the average value was taken swelling ratio was obtained as imteyaz and rafiuddin 2016 31 2 swelling ratio a wet a dry a dry 100 where a wet and a dry are wet and dry area of membranes respectively to know about the swelling ratio of membranes in different concentrations of all the electrolytic salt used the membranes were immersed in 1 m 0 1 m and 0 01 m salt solutions the swelling ratio experiment was performed at room temperature the swelling characteristics of polymeric membranes are closely related to the structural properties of the polymers and their permeability to solutes crank and park 1975 meares 1977 muhr and blanshard 1982 32 34 2 5 electrochemical characterization of the membrane the membrane sample of 4 71 cm2 effective area was placed in between a 2 compartment glass cell with a volume of each half cell being 30 ml the salts of nacl kcl nano3 and kno3 were used as electrolytes and were filled in glass cell in 6 series with varying concentrations ranging from 1m to 0 0001 m maintaining the ratio of concentrations c2 c1 γ to a constant value of 10 to minimize concentration polarization at the membrane surface magnetic stirrer was placed at the bottom of each half cell silver electrode was used as a reference electrode and the electrode potential was calculated using digital potentiometer electronics india 118 the process was repeated 3 times by replacing the solutions with new one and the average of experimental potential ψ ex was taken as the desired result membrane potential ψm is given as imteyaz and rafiuddin 2016 31 3 ψ m ψ ex ψ offset where ψ offset is the offset potential which arises due to difference between electrodes 3 results and discussion 3 1 characterization of the composite membrane fig 1 shows the xrd patterns of pure bioi and ps bioi composite the main diffraction peaks of ps bioi composite at 2θ levels 29 46 31 46 37 01 39 19 45 24 49 77 51 10 54 97 60 01 61 34 65 55 and 66 21 are almost similar to pure bioi and can be indexed to the tetragonal phase of bioi jcpds 10 0445 yu et al 2014 1 which indicates that the presence of ps in composite does not result in the development of new crystal orientations or changes in preferential orientations of bioi no characteristic peaks assigned to ps in the ps bioi composite can be attributed to the low amount and relatively low diffraction intensity of ps liu and wang 2013 35 however the presence of ps in ps bioi composite can be easily evidenced by fourier transform infrared as discussed later the average crystallite size of composite and pure bioi was estimated using the scherrer formula scherrer 1918 patterson 1939 36 37 4 d k λ λ cos θ where k is the scherrer s constant k 0 94 λ is the wavelength of x ray radiation λ 0 15406 nm for cu λ is the full width at half maximum fwhm and θ is the diffraction angle the average crystallite size of the composite was found to be around 31 nm whereas that of pure bioi was around 38 nm ft ir spectra of ps pure bioi and ps bioi composite are illustrated in fig 2 the characteristic strong peak around 3413 cm 1 was attributed to interstitial water molecules and non bonding ν o h stretching vibrations the absorption bands at 3010 cm 1 and 2899 cm 1 affirms the c h mode of aromatic and aliphatic groups of ps warsi et al 2020 38 the absorption peaks of pure bioi at low frequency below 1000 cm 1 corresponded to the vibration of biobi bonds liu et al 2013b 35 and to the stretching vibration of the tetragonal crystal links of bioi mansilla et al 2014 39 however the ps bioi composite below 1000 cm 1 shows shifting in the absorption bands towards lower wave number suggesting an intensive chemical interaction between ps and bioi in ps bioi composite there is increment in the intensity of absorption bands at 491 537 699 and 753 cm 1 as compared to pure bioi attributed to the presence of aromatic ring in the composite thus the spectrum clearly shows the presence of ps in the composite tga curves for pure bioi and ps bioi composite are shown in fig 3 a the weight loss of 3 53 of pure bioi up to 300 c is attributed to the loss of absorbed moisture or the residual or absorbed solvent sahoo et al 2013 40 from the temperature 300 600 c 18 67 of weight loss has been observed owing to the decomposition of bioi however for composite the curve shows a higher weight loss of about 22 27 from 350 c onwards caused by the thermo oxidation of the polymer matrix dta curves for pure bioi and ps bioi composite are shown in fig 3b pure bioi shows a slight beginning of exothermic peak at about 600 c whereas the composite shows an obvious exothermic peak at 572 c a marked deviation attributed to the melting of the material the decrease in exotherm shows a strong evidence of composite formation as suggested in literature ponomareva et al 2001 uvarov et al 2000 41 42 the surface of bioi and ps bioi was observed by sem and the images are shown in fig 4 the sem study was done to depict the morphological changes produced at the surface after binding of bioi with ps fig 4a shows smooth planar structure of constituent inorganic part which upon binding with polymer fig 4b shows intergranular cavitation with porous structure having loose array of grains and micro voids without any aggregation on the surface this confirms the composite membrane to be porous in nature 3 2 properties of the composite membrane water uptake property of the composite membrane plays a significant role in the transport of ions across it the membrane shows comparable water uptake due to inherent property of the inorganic part to keep both physical and chemically bound moisture and pore formation creating free space to absorb more water since water channel promotes the migration of the ionic species with the increase in transport phenomena the presence of electrolyte plays an important role in the swelling of membrane membrane immersed in nacl solution shows highest swelling in comparison to other electrolytes used in the experiment table 1 gives the swelling ratio of membrane in electrolytic solutions at different concentration this relies on the fact that the swelling of the membrane decreases with the increase in ionic radius of cation randová et al 2008 43 swelling of the composite membrane results from the balance between the internal osmotic pressure and the forces associated with the elasticity of the polymer matrix moreover the internal osmotic pressure is due to the presence in the polymeric groups counter ions and sorbed electrolyte barragán and pérez haro 2011 9 it was found that the water uptake of a membrane depends on the water s vapour pressure of the surroundings the water uptake of the membrane depends upon the process of water sorption from liquid and vapour phases known as schroeder s paradox schroeder 1903 zawodzinski jr et al 1993 44 45 water uptake from the liquid phase is direct whereas water sorption from the vapour phase occurs by capillary condensation deodar and luner 1980 the inorganic material increases water sorption however the organic material results in poor wettability on the hydrophobic surface of the membrane zawodzinski jr et al 1993 duan et al 2013 li et al 2010 45 47 48 in general membranes having the same chemical composition should absorb comparable amounts of water the water uptake properties depend on density of the polymer network hydrophobic or hydrophilic nature of the polymer and also on the membrane morphology this confirms that interstices are insignificant and the dense ionizable groups are the same throughout the membrane and suggests that diffusion would occur mainly through ion exchange sites across the membrane arfin et al 2012 49 3 3 electrochemical properties of the composite membrane 3 3 1 membrane potential membranes often respond to a few gradients that they experience between either sides of the membrane for concentration as gradient dialysis process took place higa et al 1998 50 charged membrane when brought in contact with same electrolytic salt of unequal concentrations develop a contact region across the membrane and acquires an electrical charge because of this unequal concentration of electrolytes there is unequal flow of ions and thus develops a potential difference resulting from the two contributions of donnan and a diffusion potential the teorell meyer and sievers meyer and sievers 1936a 1936b 1936c teorell 1935 23 51 theoretical model well explained these phenomena by giving an idealized equation 5 ψ m 59 2 log c 2 4 c 1 2 x 2 x c 1 4 c 2 2 x 2 x u log 4 c 2 2 x 2 x u 4 c 1 2 x 2 x u 6 u u v u v where u and v are the cation and anion mobilities m2v 1s 1 respectively and x is the fixed charge density of the membrane expressed in equivalents per unit volume the diffusion potential arises because of the difference in mobilities of cations and anions the fast moving ions diffuses rapidly from high concentrated side to low concentrated side through junctions to maintain the electro neutrality condition meanwhile the slow moving ions are left behind on the higher concentration side the ion distribution is purely due to the diffusion and electro migration this type of separation of charge would cause an electrical potential the donnan potential arises because of the charge on pore walls of the membrane this charge repels the co ions having same charge to that of the pore walls and attracts the counter ions having opposite charge to that of pore walls as a consequence the counter ions diffuse through the pores and will have higher concentration in the membrane phase than in solution phase whereas the co ions are excluded from the pores and will have lower concentration in the membrane phase than in solution phase because of this concentration difference a potential difference known as donnan potential is generated between the membrane and solution interface to maintain the electrochemical equilibrium thereby showing conducive effects in repulsion of co ions and attraction of counter ions by the membrane peeters et al 1998 52 this leads to the formation of an electrical double layer so that a charged surface and a neutralizing excess of counter ions exists in the adjacent solution hall et al 1997 schaep 1999 53 54 according to tms theory an equilibrium process develops at each membrane solution interface which has a formal similarity with the donnan equilibrium this theory rely on following assumptions 1 all electrolytes dissolve perfectly 2 the electrical charge of the membrane is uniform 3 the transference of water from either side of the membrane may be ignored 4 the effect of the diffusion boundary layer at membrane solution interface is negligible 5 the activity coefficients of all ions are equal to unity 6 the fixed charge groups are homogeneously distributed in the membrane 7 the cation and anion mobilities and fixed charge concentrations are constant throughout the membrane phase and are independent of the electrolyte concentration another assumption is that the activity coefficient of the salt is the same in both the membrane and solution phase the introduction of activities for salt concentrations can only be correctly made for the donnan potential whereas the expression for the diffusion potential using either the integration of planck or henderson meyer and sievers 1936a 1936b 1936c 23 equations fig 5 a shows the potential values table 2 of ps bioi composite membrane observed at 25 2 c for different concentrations of nacl kcl nano3 and kno3 salts and were plotted against log c 2 the membrane potential shows positive values on decreasing the electrolyte concentrations and thus confirms the composite membrane to be of cation selective in nature attributed to the structural changes produced in the electrical double layer at the solution membrane interface arfin and rafiuddin 2009 55 the electrical double layer at the membrane solution interface seems to control the ion permeation as suggested by tien and ting tien and ting 1968 56 the potential values follow the order nacl kcl nano3 kno3 with different sizes of electrolytic ions the membrane potential increased with the decrease in cation size for anions differences found are according to the size mobility ratio and strong interaction with the membrane matrix small size and higher mobility of cl ion shows greater value of the membrane potential whereas no3 ion shows lower value because of its large size and strong interaction with the membrane matrix both cl and no3 co ions will be repelled by the charges present on the pore walls of the membrane the membrane potential depends on the diffusion of ions hence cl ion small size would diffuse more rapidly leaving behind no3 ion large size which would get more time for repulsion and get attracted towards the opposite charge present on the wall of the membrane 3 3 2 transport number and mobility ratio transport number is the fraction of total current carried by counter ions passing through the membrane klaysom et al 2010 57 membrane when separated by unequal electrolyte solutions develops membrane potential which can be used to calculate the transport number and is given by the following equation klaysom et al 2010 kang et al 2003 57 58 7 ψ m r t f t t ln c 2 c 1 where r t and f are gas constant absolute temperature and faraday constant respectively c 1 and c 2 are the concentrations of electrolyte solutions in the testing glass chamber the transport property depends on the characteristic electrical charge of the membrane the effective charge of the membrane affects the transport of ions for slightly charged membranes the donnan effect of the co ions can be neglected and the diffusion potential is mainly responsible for the membrane potential due to the different mobilities of co ions and counter ions in the membrane and its expression for 1 1 electrolytes is arfin et al 2012 laksminarayanahia 1969 49 59 8 u t z t z 9 ω t t u v where u is a parameter related to the combined transport numbers of the ions in the membrane t and t are the transport number of cation and anion z and z are the valences of cation and anion u and v are their molar mobilities respectively the ratio of molar mobilities of cation to anion is given by the mobility ratio ω in this report the transport number at lower concentration of sodium salt for the composite membrane reached up to 0 90 demonstrated slight deviations from the ideal ion selective property of 1 00 the values of both transport number t and mobility ratio ω as given in table 3 shows positive trend with dilution i e increases with decreasing the electrolyte concentrations due to flow of electrolytic ions through the membrane matrix thus the membrane exhibits very good selectivity for na it can clearly be seen that transport numbers for na decreased with increasing concentration of the nacl solution which is considered to be due to the decrease in donnan exclusion apart from these two parameters the membrane potential ψ m can also be used to determine the counter ion transport number in the membrane phase assuming the transport number to be constant throughout the membrane aizawa et al 1980 60 proposed the following relationship between ψ m and 1 c 1 to calculate the transport number of counter ions 10 ψ m r t f 2 t m 1 l n γ 2 γ 1 γ 1 t m t m θ x c 1 where t m and θ x are the counter ion transport number and concentration of fixed charge in the membrane phase respectively and γ 10 for better determination of transport number in the membrane phase the effective concentration of exchange site of the membrane should be much lower than electrolyte concentration benavente and canas 1999 61 slope θ x and intercept t m values can be obtained by plotting the graph of ψ m against 1 c 1 using eq 10 the value of t m and θ x table 4 follows the order nacl kcl nano3 kno3 it can be well concluded from the above table that the membrane is more selective towards li ion as selectivity is proportional to the counter ion transport number 3 4 evaluation and comparison of fixed charge density by various theoretical models 3 4 1 nagasawa nagasawa et al has given the equation tasaka et al 1975 nagasawa and kobatake 1952 14 15 11 ψ m r t f γ γ 1 x 2 1 c 1 to calculate the fixed charge density of a charged membrane when separated by unequal electrolyte concentrations c1 and c2 where x is the fixed charge density of the membrane and γ 10 fig 5b shows the membrane potential as function of electrolyte concentration ψ m vs 1 c 1 straight lines were obtained for the membrane in the range of concentration studied this suggests that the membrane potential is inversely related to the electrolyte concentrations the slope values can be further used to evaluate the fixed charge density table 5 of the composite membrane 3 4 2 kobatake et al starting with the basic flow equation based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes kobatake has given a theory for membrane potential which is applicable for the charged membrane separated by electrolyte solutions of variable concentrations it has two limiting forms 1 when c 1 becomes sufficiently small with fixed γ 10 value the fixed charge density of the composite membrane can be calculated as 12 ψ m r t f 1 β l n γ γ 1 α β γ 1 1 β 2 α c 1 x where β is related to the effect of adsorption of ions upon the membrane material α is related to membrane selectivity of ions by plotting a graph of ψ m vs c 1 intercept and slope gave the values of β and α respectively thereafter the fixed charge density can be calculated 2 at high salt concentration with fixed γ 10 value the fixed charge density can be further evaluated using membrane potential values and t a p p from the equation 13 1 t a p p 1 1 α α γ 1 1 α γ l n γ x c 1 where the inverse of an apparent transport number for the co ion species in a negatively charged membrane is proportional to the inverse of concentration the apparent transport number can be calculated using the nernst form of equation 14 ψ m r t f 1 2 t a p p ln c 2 c 1 using eqs 13 and 14 the plot of inverse of apparent transport number 1 t a p p against 1 c 1 as shown in fig 5c gives the value of fixed charge density of the membrane from intercept value the values of α and β as calculated above are given in table 4 3 4 3 teorell meyer and sievers the theory considered membrane potential as a sum of donnan potentials occurring at each membrane solution interface and a diffusion potential within the membrane as shown in fig 6 a set of theoretical curves were obtained using eqs 5 and 6 of the tms theory that can be further utilized to calculate the fixed charge density of the membrane the curves in the plot fig 7 show the theoretical potential values for the composite membrane at different mobility ratio with constant x value the experimental curve for membrane potential of nacl was also plotted in the same plot nacl shows the highest membrane potential and thus was used in the plot for determination of fixed charge density the experimental potential curve was shifted horizontally and ran parallel to one of the theoretical potential curves this shift gave log x values within the membrane phase the values of x derived in this way for various 1 1 electrolytes are given in table 4 the order of fixed charge density for various monovalent electrolytes was found to be nacl kcl nano3 kno3 thus the membrane potential greatly affects the effective fixed charge density which further depends on ionic species and potential distributions in the systems in fig 7 the solid lines represent the theoretical expected behavior of an ideal membrane resting potential approaching to 59 mv in nacl solutions at different mobility ratios on comparing fig 7 with fig 5a the membrane potential of nacl shows deviation from the ideal value this occurs mainly because of decrease of transport number of cations on increasing electrolyte concentration barragán and pérez haro 2011 9 form these theoretical models the calculated values of fixed charge density of the composite membrane for various monovalent electrolytes comparatively agreed with one another the two limiting forms of kobatake show slight deviation due to the low estimation of charge density thereby confirming its applicability in the system the assumption made by the above theoretical models result in the deviation of fixed charge density values of the composite membrane the fixed charge density given here could not reflect the effects of the distribution of charge groups or the morphology of the hydrophilic part of the charged membrane however it was assumed that the fixed charge groups were distributed homogeneously in the ideal charged membrane thus it should be taken into account to develop the tms theory matsumoto et al 1998 62 another deviation is due to the difference in mobility ratio of cation to anion in the water and membrane phase however it was assumed to be constant throughout the membrane phase thus these assumptions must be taken into consideration on the basis of results it can be concluded that in high concentration range the electrical double layers formed at the interface in the pores gets compressed and the entire pore volume becomes electrically neutral so under this condition donnan effect can be neglected in low concentration range the distribution of ions arising by the diffusion of counter ions is the main reason to the membrane potential this is mainly because of complete exclusion of co ions from the pores due to the high double layer repulsion under these circumstances the diffusion effect can be ignored however in the intermediate concentration range neither the donnan effect nor diffusion effect can be negligible as a result the values of membrane potential between the above two limits increases as the concentrations of the electrolytes become lower sasidhar and ruckenstein 1982 shang et al 2006 63 64 teorell meyer and sievers tms theory was further extended to calculate the charge effectiveness distribution coefficient and counter and co ion concentrations 15 ψ m r t v k f ln γ 2 c 2 c 1 γ 1 c 1 c 2 r t v k f ω 1 ω 1 ln ω 1 c 2 v x v k x ω 1 c 1 v x v k x where r is real gas constant t is temperature and f is faraday constant γ is the mean ionic activity coefficients c 1 and c 2 are cation concentrations on opposite side of the membrane ω is the mobility ratio of cation to anion in the membrane phase v x and v k are the valences of fixed charge group on polymer and cation respectively the membrane counter c and co ion c concentration can be obtained from the given relation and the values are given in table 3 16 c v x x 2 v k 2 γ c q 2 v x x 2 v k 17 c v x x 2 v k 2 γ c q 2 v x x 2 v k the charge effectiveness q can be given as 18 q γ k where k is the charge distribution coefficient and is given by 19 k c i c i and c i c i x where c i and c i are the i th concentration of ion in the membrane phase and external solution respectively the distribution coefficient k values when plotted against log c 2 shows a drop down trend with the decrease in electrolyte concentration for various monovalent electrolytes up to certain concentration range as shown in fig 8 a and then shows an abrupt increase at lowest concentration this large deviation in the k value at lowest electrolyte concentration is attributed to the high mobility of comparatively free charges as a result reaches into the membrane phase easily as compared to higher electrolyte concentration however kno3 shows deviation in the lowest concentration region because of the low mobility of free charges in this range as compared to other electrolytes the charge effectiveness q values when plotted against log c 2 shows a trend opposite to k values for various monovalent electrolyte concentrations as shown in fig 8b at higher and lower electrolyte concentrations the charge effectiveness decreases whereas at moderate concentration it shows a maximum value this deviation in charge effectiveness values can be explained on the basis of fixed charge groups associated with the membrane phase at higher or lower external electrolyte concentrations there is inequality in the concentration of fixed charged groups in the membrane phase and the counter ion concentration of external electrolyte as a result a number of counter ions reaches into the membrane phase easily and shows enhanced binding affinity for polymer fixed charge groups thus the value of charge effectiveness goes down imteyaz and rafiuddin 2015 12 in contrary to the above results in moderate concentration region the concentration of fixed charged groups in the membrane phase and the counter ion concentration are comparable and thus show maximum value in this region however kno3 does not attain the maximum value at moderate concentration due to low binding affinity of ions with the fixed charge groups 3 5 permselectivity of the composite membrane a cation exchange membrane that permits only the transport of counter ions while blocking the co ions is said to be perfectly permselective co ion transport could results from either diffusive i e concentration driven transport from high to low concentration or field driven migration of co ions where the relative magnitude of each form of transport is sensitive to the concentration difference and the magnitude of the applied electric field geise et al 2014a helfferich 1995 65 66 the permselectivity p s of a cation exchange membrane can be calculated from the transport number using the eq 20 p s t m t t where t m refers to the transport number of counter ions in the membrane phase t and t refers to the transport number of counter and co ions in the solution phase respectively from the p s value we can further calculate the fixed charge density of the membrane x using the equation kobatake et al 1965 16 21 1 4 ξ 2 1 1 t a p p α α 2 α 1 1 t a p p p s where ξ c x a cation exchange membrane when brought in contact with unequal electrolyte concentrations develops a transport phenomenon exclusively via counter ions and co ions are completely excluded from the membrane as depicted in fig 9 this explanation of permselectivity has been confirmed by the different values of p s using eq 21 1 if p s becomes equal to unity t a p p 0 i e no transport of co ions whereas 2 if p s becomes zero t a p p 1 α i e anions behave as in bulk solution or as in a membrane having no fixed charge the value of fixed charge density can be further evaluated by considering the fact that when c becomes equal to θ x in the above equation then p s attains the value of 1 5 or 0 447 the value of the c corresponding to which p s 0 447 gives the values of fixed charge density x from the plots of p s against log c where c c 1 c 2 2 as shown in fig 10 the values of fixed charge density was calculated for various monovalent electrolytes table 5 nacl shows the highest value of permselectivity as well as fixed charge density confirming maximum selectivity of the membrane for na ions which is in accordance with the other methods described above 3 5 1 effect of counter ions on permselectivity the binding affinity of counter ions with polymer fixed charge group shows a significant effect on permselectivity higher the binding affinity lower will be the permselectivity among the used counter ions k counter ion shows strong interaction with the fixed charge group on the polymer thereby decreasing the effective membrane charge density bonner 1954 67 as a result permselectivity decreases the decrease in effective fixed charge density value of kcl was confirmed by various theoretical membrane models used in this report among the used electrolytes nacl shows maximum permselectivity because the na counter ion has greater tendency to exclude co ions as compared to the other counter ions followed by k donnan theory predicts that co ion sorption in the membrane decreases as fixed charge concentration increases since co ion sorption is related to co ion transport helfferich 1995 geise et al 2014b 66 68 reduced fixed charge concentration in the membrane is expected to reduce permselectivity based on this theory it can be concluded that na has greater tendency to exclude co ions than other counter ions and had highest permselectivity value 3 5 2 effect of co ions on permselectivity the hydrated radii of co ions play an important role in permselectivity of the membrane imteyaz and rafiuddin 2016 69 both the nitrate and chloride co ions used in this report carry a unit negative charge with the basic difference in their hydrated radii nitrate ions has greater hydrated radius 335pm as compared to chloride ions 331pm nightingale jr 1959 70 as a consequence more sorption of nitrate into the membrane took place as compared to chloride this results into greater chloride exclusion because of strong interactions between the charge dense chloride ion and the polymer matrix of the membrane thus chloride co ion shows high value of permselectivity the electrolytes follows the order nacl kcl nano3 kno3 for permselectivity values dielectric exclusion is caused by the interactions of ions with the bound electric charges induced by ions at interfaces between media of different dielectric constants in particular a membrane matrix and a solvent yaroshchuk 2000 71 apart from donnan exclusion the ions can also be excluded from polymers via dielectric exclusion this can be based on the fact that both the media electrolytes dissolved in water and water swollen polymer has different dielectric constants matsumoto et al 1998 62 the ions prefer to partition into high dielectric constant media i e water compared to lower dielectric constant media i e water swollen polymer among chloride and nitrate co ions chloride may be less soluble in swollen polymer membranes which will likely have a static dielectric constant lower than that of water compared to nitrate ions this causes greater dielectric exclusion of chloride co ions from the membrane and results into higher permselectivity than nitrate co ions 4 conclusions a new type of composite cation exchange membrane ps bioi was synthesized by dispersing inorganic bioi in the matrix of ps the membrane was broadly characterized for its physico chemical properties the xrd confirms the composite membrane to be crystalline in nature with average crystallite size of 31 nm ft ir spectra show intermolecular interaction of peaks at different wave numbers suggesting intensive chemical interaction between ps and bioi tg dta curve confirms the thermal stability of the membrane whereas sem images show the surface morphology with porous structure the membrane is considered as charged pore model and is treated with different monovalent unequal electrolyte bulk concentrations 1m 0 0001 m in both sides of the membrane here current flows due to the establishment of concentration and potential gradients in the system the membrane potential followed the trend nacl kcl nano3 kno3 attributed to the different sizes of electrolytic ions the composite membrane immersed in 1 m nacl solution shows high water uptake because of small ionic radius of na ion as compared to 1 m kcl solution the cl ion with higher mobility ratio and small size shows greater value of membrane potential as compared to no3 ion because of its large size and strong interaction with the membrane matrix the potential shows positive values with the decrease in electrolyte concentrations confirming the membrane to be cation selective membrane potential also gave fixed charge density value of the membrane evaluated and compared using various theoretical models a nagasawa b kobatake and c teorell meyer and sievers na ion shows highest value of fixed charge density in all the methods as the donnan exclusion is highest for the electrolyte of smaller cation size the experimental results were verified which comparatively agreed with theoretical models tms theory was further extended to calculate the distribution coefficient charge effectiveness and ions concentration in the membrane phase among the used counter ions k shows low value of permselectivity because of its strong binding affinity for the polymer fixed charge groups than that of na counter ion for co ions the value depends on hydrated radii no3 with higher hydrated radii and lower charge density also tended to result in low membrane permselectivity dielectric exclusion of co ions is another factor responsible for the values of permselectivity thus the donnan membrane equilibrium process can be used for the removal of undesirable ions from the waste water these membranes can differentiate cations and anions and have a higher transport number of counter

phyllanthus emblica exclusion uranyl ion 1 introduction uranium is a radioactive element mostly used as fuel in nuclear industries wang et al 2014 uranium is a hazardous element that exists in various oxidation states if it is disposed without proper treatment in environment it may cause health problem for the living beings liangshu et al 2013 it is the common radionuclide involved in nuclear power production uranium vi is highly toxic and carcinogenic in nature due to the establishment of a sensitive radionuclide detection separation or sequestration method it is a significant challenge that is yet to be overcome various methods are involved to eliminate uranium vi from liquid effluents such as volume reduction chemical physical and biological reverse osmosis ion exchange precipitation and adsorption processes agricultural material is a significant adsorbent in the effluent treatment process many researchers supported the use of eco friendly and low cost bio adsorbents such as agricultural byproducts and microbial bio mass mohamed a 2013 in the present study a magnetic bio adsorbent consisting of terrestrial tree bark phyllanthus emblica was chosen the magnetic bio adsorbent material has the best removal capacities amanda et al 2009 magnetic particles have high efficiency for the exclusion of toxic heavy metals present in water as well as in aqueous environments rahnama et al 2014 the adsorption phenomenon is a quite adequate and economically viable approach that is widely used for the remediation of pollutants for example toxic metals pb2 cd2 present in aquatic media sharma et al 2017 magnetic bio adsorption can be adopted as a reliable method for the elimination of metal ion uranium vi from aquatic path magnetic bio sorbents have been of great interest in research in recent years magnetic sorption is an important technique for effective exclusion of organic and inorganic pollutants heavy metals tree barks are the most abundant natural bio adsorbents in the world it is usually available following forestry operations as well as industrial processes the bark of the tree is very useful in adsorbing the heavy metals present in water waste barks are widely available and have no economic value sen et al 2015 hence in the present investigation as an affordable adsorbent tree bark of amla indian gooseberry phyllanthus emblica was taken for the exclusion of uranyl ions from water phyllanthus emblica is commonly named amla or indian gooseberry composite magnetic particles are an effective adsorbent for the exclusion of pollutants present in water in recent years magnetically modified materials have been investigated due to their potential application in various fields such as biology and the environment since iron is more reactive it comes in various oxidation states because of this it coordinates with other elements the modified magnetic material consists of iron oxide magnetite fe3o4 hematite α fe2o3 and maghemite ƴ fe2o3 are presumably the common oxide forms in which iron oxide magnetic particles occur in nature saharan et al 2014 there are huge methods to prepare them synthetically and they exhibit different particle sizes and morphologies fe3o4 is a widely used magnetic particle with exclusive characteristics because of the presence of two cations fe2 and fe3 in its crystal structure in recent years a number of studies have shown interest in the utilization of magnetic bio adsorbents to improve the deteriorating quality of water magnetic material is a fruitful adsorbent for the elimination of impurities present in water the unique properties and application of magnetic materials are widely researched due to their various functions and properties various chemicals or plant mediated methods are used to synthesize iron oxide this method is applied to remove uranium vi from the aqueous sample the magnetic particles mediated by plants have special importance because they do not need any specific equipment or harmful chemicals therefore it is not harmful to the environment numerous methods have been reported for plant mediation the adsorbent was modified as a magnetic material and was not previously reported hence it is an innovative technique for the synthesis of fe3o4 magnetic particles and is used for the exclusion of uranium vi from aquatic path in this study magnetic material is synthesized from tree bark of phyllanthus emblica amla the bark of phyllanthus emblica amla has phytochemicals gallic acid furosin corilagain carbohydrates and amino acids polyphenolic groups present

for the sequestration of heavy metal contaminated water green synthesis is vital as a result of the synthesized fe3o4 adsorbent is safe to be consumed by human beings because the materials used are derived from biological sources such as plant extract on the other hand plant extracts can serve as both reducing and stabilizing agents in the synthesizing process fe3o4 this strategy is not only straightforward but also cost effective to put it another way the green method is an environmentally sustainable method of synthesizing magnetic particles adsorbent that is not harmful to the environment or human health the aim of this research is to outline new routes for synthesis of these magnetic particles fe3o4 using plant resources as a result there is an increasing need to produce nontoxic environmental products some of the advantages a harmful materials are not used making this a clean and environmentally safe process b additional laboratory conditions such as high pressure

diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid 99 0 was purchased from loba chemie pvt ltd india anhydrous ferric chloride fecl3 99 0 was purchased from molychem 2 2 adsorbates uranium solutions 1 g l were prepared by taking a fixed quantity of uranyl nitrate and dissolving it in distilled water the meal ion concentrations were made by the dilution process 2 3 adsorbent tree bark of phyllanthus emblica commonly known as amla was collected from the local forest of chhattisgarh india the tree bark of phyllanthus emblica was cut into tiny pieces and rinsed number of times with water to remove the dirt and other unwanted particles terrestrial tree bark was dried at 40 c for 48 h then the sample was powdered and sieved 300 μm further in this connection it was stored in an airtight bottle for the adsorption process 2 4 preparation of magnetic bio adsorbent the chemical precipitation method kashyap et al 2019 was adopted for the magnetization of tree bark material of phyllanthus emblica briefly 25 gm bio adsorbent was suspended in 250 ml double distilled water for 1 h known amounts of ferric chloride 9 gm in 650 ml distilled water and ferrous sulfate 10 gm in 75 ml distilled water solutions were mixed together and kept for magnetic stirring at 60 70 c for 30 min further in this way the bio adsorbent was added to a mixed solution and was stirred slowly for 30 min now the ph increased to 10 11 by the dropwise addition of naoh 10 m into the suspension the particles iron oxide get precipitating when the ph rises the suspension was aged at room temperature for 24 h finally magnetic bio adsorbent was filtered and cleaned number of times with distilled water and then with ethanol until the ph reached 7 0 and dried overnight at 50 c oven magnetic sample was separated by using a permanent ndfeb magnet 2 5 adsorption studies to study the impact of operational parameters such as ph contact time initial metal ion concentration temperature and adsorbent dose on the adsorption of uranyl ions on a magnetic bio adsorbent sample of phyllanthus emblica examined by batch adsorption method followed by the arsenazo iii method then 0 3 g magnetic bio adsorbent was mixed with adsorbate solution 50 ml of u vi this was kept in a stopper polypropylene bottle with the help of a magnetic stirrer labquest mhs5p all these experiments were conducted at a constant speed with g value 6 73 the

panalytical 3 kw x pert powder laboratories from the nit raipur ftir bruker opus 7 5 18 analysis was performed on the ncnr pt r s u raipur 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of ph ph is a significant parameter for sorption of metal ions onto adsorbent it depends on the metal uptake which is associated with the metal chemistry in the solution as well as the surface functional group of the adsorbent material fig 1 a represents the impact of ph on the adsorption of uranyl ion onto a magnetic bio adsorbent which was conducted in the solution with ph range between 2 and 10 the removal efficiency increased from 46 to 85 6 by increasing the ph from 2 to 7 and then decreased sharply upon increasing the ph of the solution from 8 to 10 therefore the maximum removal efficiency is considered to be 85 6 at ph 7 it has been observed that the ph affects uranium and that binding sites appear on the surface of biomass so it has been reported as a gradual increase in uranium adsorption krestou et al 2003 the degree of protonation of the surface slowly decreased as the ph increased ph 8 10 and formed negatively charged species wang et al 2014 based on the results obtained ph 7 of the solution is suitable for adsorption of uranium vi by magnetically modified tree bark of phyllanthus emblica the precipitation of oh is hindered by fe 3 at the mentioned ph and fe 3 might alter the interaction of oh and reach higher removal wang et al 2018 the u vi species are influenced by the ph of the solution at ph 5 the dominant species is uo2 2 whereas in the ph range of 5 0 7 0 u vi hydrolysis complexes uo2oh and multinuclear hydroxide complexes uo2 3 oh 5 are the dominant species moreover at ph 7 0 carbonate uranyl ions uo2co3 uo2 co3 2 2 uo2 co3 3 4 are the dominant species when ph 7 the charge of u vi species positive to negative yu et al 2016a b 3 2 effect of initial metal ion concentration the difference of the removal efficiency with various initial metal ion concentrations 10 mg l to 200 mg l is presented in fig 1b the quantity of uranium vi adsorbed on the magnetic tree bark of phyllanthus emblica increased from 72 6 to 85 6 with increasing metal ion concentration from 10 mg l to 25 mg l however the removal efficiency gradually decreased up to 40 6 after increasing the metal ion concentration up to 200 mg l due to the saturation of the adsorption site of adsorbent material the adsorption experiments were conducted at 25 mg l 3 3 effect of contact time the contact time is a vital parameter for the adsorption phenomena it is carried out with a constant metal ion concentration 25 mg l fig 1c represents the adsorption of uranium vi onto magnetic adsorbent tree bark of phyllanthus emblica it was investigated from 10 to 70 min at ph 7 initially the percentage of removal efficiency increased from 44 8 to 85 6 with increasing time up to 40 min after it reaches maxima it shows a constant value for a certain period of time from 50 to 70 min 3 4 effect of adsorbent dose the influence of adsorbent dose is also one of the significant parameters for determining the quantitative uptake of metal ions the effect of the adsorption dose from 0 1 g to 0 5 g studied in the batch adsorption method is displayed in fig 1d the removal efficiency of uranium vi onto magnetic adsorbent enhanced from 54 to 85 6 upon increasing the dose of adsorbent from 0 1 g to 0 3 g with uranium vi solution 50 ml at ph 7 and fixed metal ion concentration 25 mg l for 40 min then the removal efficiency was gradually slowed down to 46 4 up to 0 5 g after it reached equilibrium in addition when the adsorbent dose was approximately 0 3 gm the maximum removal efficiency reached 85 6 this is because of the overlapping adsorption of ion sites kocaoba 2007 this means the overloading of particles of the adsorbent due to free ions remaining constant and the number of ions accumulating on the adsorbent this phenomenon reduces the removal efficiency of u vi due to insufficient surface area of adsorbent 3 5 effect of temperature temperature is the key part for the adsorption method of uranium vi on magnetic sample as an adsorbent metal ion uptake was performed at given temperature 303 k 313 k and 323 k with fixed metal ion concentrations 25 mg l the removal efficiency increased up to 40 min at all temperatures in addition the uranium vi removal efficiency slightly increased with increasing temperature as shown in fig 1e then it showed constant removal efficiency after reaching the maxima the experiment was conducted at 303 k the endothermic phenomena could be observed by the adsorption behaviour because temperature is the key part of the process 3 6 adsorption isotherm the equilibrium investigation is a decent technique for analysing the behaviour of adsorbent surface mainly isotherm models focus on the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent isotherms namely langmuir and freundlich isotherms are shown in table 1 the langmuir isotherm adopts homogenous and monolayer adsorption onto a surface but freundlich performs on heterogeneous surfaces patil et al 2016 equations 3 and 6 represented the linear equations of the langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms 3 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max by the use of slope and intercept the value of kl langmuir isotherm constants and q max maximum sorption capacity were calculated where qe represents the amount adsorbed mg g and ce represents the adsorbate concentration in solution mg l both at equilibrium is the langmuir adsorption constant l mg and q max is the maximum sorption capacity for monolayer formation on the adsorbent hereby the langmuir isotherm characterises regarding a dimensionless constant denoted as separation factor rl kaur et al 2003 written as 4 r l 1 1 k l

such as change of free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs are explained by fluctuation of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant the sorption amount by magnetic biosorption lies in 303 k 313 k and 323 k this was calculated with the help of equation 9 thermodynamic parameter yu et al 2016a b 9 l n k d δ s r δ h r t here distribution coefficient kd represents the δh δs and t are enthalpy entropy

positive so possible explanations for entropy the process is irreversible and favours the stability of sorption with increased randomness δg indicates a negative value which confirms that the spontaneous behaviour and biosorption process is feasible adeogun et al 2019 3 9 adsorption mechanism of uranyl ion on magnetically modified tree bark 3 9 1 xrd analysis the xrd spectrum was used to recognize the crystallographic structure phase transparency and greatest prominent peak in the xrd profile of the modified tree bark magnetic of phyllanthus emblica amla in fig 5 diffraction peaks expose the good crystallinity of fe3o4 situated at 2θ in the range between 10 90 there is no signal detected for hematite fe2o3 during the magnetization process iron sulfate was used which confirms the deposition of fe3o4 xrd can be used to determine the crystallographic structure of the material and the crystalline size by the following equation the average particle size of magnetic particle in xrd peak is 45 1 nm 11 d k λ β c o s θ where d denotes the average crystalline size λ reveals wavelength of the x ray used and k represent the scherrer constant approximately 0 9 β represent the fwhm intensity in angular line and θ is denoted as a braggs angle in degrees 3 9 2 eds analysis the eds spectrum of the magnetic bio adsorbent clearly reveals the changes in the peak before and after adsorption of uranyl ions as shown in fig 4 a c there are differences in the peaks of na cl and ca before and after adsorption of uranyl ions this gives information regarding the adsorption of uranyl ion zhang et al 2016 moreover the concentration of uranyl ion increased from 0 to 4 04 weight 3 9 3 sem analysis for the study of size distribution and morphological structure of the magnetic sample adsorbent scanning electron microscopy sem was used on a scale of 2 μm as displayed in fig 4b d before adsorption the surface of the magnetic bio adsorbent was cavity and then filled by deposition of metal ions onto magnetic particles of iron oxide the before and after adsorption of the sem image of the magnetic sample clearly reflects the nature of adsorption there is a heterogeneous rough and shiny appearance before adsorption which is different after adsorption due to brightened surfaces with spherical or roughly round shapes simamora et al 2018 the particle is able to form bonds with another particle which is often called agglomeration 3 9 4 ftir analysis ftir analysis of natural and modified magnetic particles before and after bio adsorption of tree bark phyllanthus emblica was performed to predict the different functional groups present and adsorbed on the surface of the magnetic particles in fig 6 there is one broad peak observed at 3256 76 which is slightly shifted at 3346 20 and 3232 91 due to the strong broad oh stretching of free hydroxyl phenol two weak peaks were observed at 2929 74 in natural samples which were displaced after adsorption of uranium vi at 2883 96 due to medium ch stretching alkynes one sharp signal clearly defines the shift of 1606 17 displaced at position 1612 94 to 1615 98 nh bending due to the presence of a primary amine which indicates that it may be due to the absorption of uranium vi on magnetic particles because amla contains good quantities of ca p fe carotene vitamin b complex protein na and carbohydrates another sharp peak appeared at 1367 93 before adsorption and the bands that moved in the range of 1409 47 after adsorptions are assigned to asymmetric and symmetric stretching vibrations of the carboxylic group of phyllanthus emblica assigned by the addition of various functional groups containing oxygen alves et al 2019 jawad et al 2019 one medium peak occurred at 1367 93 in the natural sample which is slightly shifted after adsorption in the range of 1373 84 due to oh bending phenol another peak at 1314 14 1314 93 and 1315 92 indicated the adsorption of uranyl ions caused by n o stretching of aromatic amines because the adsorption peak clearly shows the difference before and after adsorption of uranium vi on the magnetic adsorbent another sharp peak appears at 775 14 778 84 778 92 due to the c cl stretching alkyl halide the small peaks appeared in the ranges of 654 61 647 72 and 698 80 accordingly the adsorption peak approx 600 cm 1 indicated in the magnetic sample could be credited to the properties of the peak of fe3o4 adeogun et al 2019 which clearly reflects the appearance of fe3o4 4 mechanism magnetic adsorbent comprises fe oh groups on the magnetic surface these groups also deprotonate when ph increases or protonate further when ph is low as a result changing the ph of the solution influences surface charging as well as the attraction or repulsion of metal ions u vi on the magnetic surface carboxylic acid and alcohols on the adsorbent loose protons as the ph increases making the surface more negatively charged if the negative charge density at the surface increases more metal ions u vi are attracted and bound carboxylic acids are the most acidic and they are the first to lose protons metal ions may be mildly or doubly chelated by the present functional group phenol with the release of protons into solution the main interaction in the high ph range is metal ligand chelation by oxygen a possible mechanism has been shown to metal u vi on magnetite fe3o4 portion of magnetic adsorbent is presented in fig 7 where surface of fe oh or fe o sites actively bind metal ions the result might reveal the adsorption behavior of metal ion u vi onto adsorbent was carried out chemical precipitation process and surface complex formation comparing the sem eds spectra fig 4 of synthesized adsorbent in the loading and unloading of u vi it was observed that after loading of the metal ions u vi onto adsorbent surface clearly represented changes in their surface morphology in this study the presence of amine 1615 98 cm 1 carboxylic group 1409 47 cm 1 and hydroxyl phenol 1373 84 cm 1 in ftir spectra fig 6 this groups were mainly responsible for the adsorption of u vi the xrd spectrum was used to recognize the crystallographic structure phase transparency and greatest prominent peak in the xrd profile of the modified tree bark magnetic of phyllanthus emblica amla fig 5 5 conclusion modified magnetic material was successfully synthesized from tree bark of phyllanthus emblica which was taken as a bio adsorbent for the exclusion of uranyl ion from aqueous environments by developing novel magnetic particles all parameters showed satisfactory removal efficiency of uranyl ions at optimized condition ph 7 with 85 6 exclusion of uranium in 40 min of contact time the adsorption study indicates that the pseudo second order model r2

phyllanthus emblica exclusion uranyl ion 1 introduction uranium is a radioactive element mostly used as fuel in nuclear industries wang et al 2014 uranium is a hazardous element that exists in various oxidation states if it is disposed without proper treatment in environment it may cause health problem for the living beings liangshu et al 2013 it is the common radionuclide involved in nuclear power production uranium vi is highly toxic and carcinogenic in nature due to the establishment of a sensitive radionuclide detection separation or sequestration method it is a significant challenge that is yet to be overcome various methods are involved to eliminate uranium vi from liquid effluents such as volume reduction chemical physical and biological reverse osmosis ion exchange precipitation and adsorption processes agricultural material is a significant adsorbent in the effluent treatment process many researchers supported the use of eco friendly and low cost bio adsorbents such as agricultural byproducts and microbial bio mass mohamed a 2013 in the present study a magnetic bio adsorbent consisting of terrestrial tree bark phyllanthus emblica was chosen the magnetic bio adsorbent material has the best removal capacities amanda et al 2009 magnetic particles have high efficiency for the exclusion of toxic heavy metals present in water as well as in aqueous environments rahnama et al 2014 the adsorption phenomenon is a quite adequate and economically viable approach that is widely used for the remediation of pollutants for example toxic metals pb2 cd2 present in aquatic media sharma et al 2017 magnetic bio adsorption can be adopted as a reliable method for the elimination of metal ion uranium vi from aquatic path magnetic bio sorbents have been of great interest in research in recent years magnetic sorption is an important technique for effective exclusion of organic and inorganic pollutants heavy metals tree barks are the most abundant natural bio adsorbents in the world it is usually available following forestry operations as well as industrial processes the bark of the tree is very useful in adsorbing the heavy metals present in water waste barks are widely available and have no economic value sen et al 2015 hence in the present investigation as an affordable adsorbent tree bark of amla indian gooseberry phyllanthus emblica was taken for the exclusion of uranyl ions from water phyllanthus emblica is commonly named amla or indian gooseberry composite magnetic particles are an effective adsorbent for the exclusion of pollutants present in water in recent years magnetically modified materials have been investigated due to their potential application in various fields such as biology and the environment since iron is more reactive it comes in various oxidation states because of this it coordinates with other elements the modified magnetic material consists of iron oxide magnetite fe3o4 hematite α fe2o3 and maghemite ƴ fe2o3 are presumably the common oxide forms in which iron oxide magnetic particles occur in nature saharan et al 2014 there are huge methods to prepare them synthetically and they exhibit different particle sizes and morphologies fe3o4 is a widely used magnetic particle with exclusive characteristics because of the presence of two cations fe2 and fe3 in its crystal structure in recent years a number of studies have shown interest in the utilization of magnetic bio adsorbents to improve the deteriorating quality of water magnetic material is a fruitful adsorbent for the elimination of impurities present in water the unique properties and application of magnetic materials are widely researched due to their various functions and properties various chemicals or plant mediated methods are used to synthesize iron oxide this method is applied to remove uranium vi from the aqueous sample the magnetic particles mediated by plants have special importance because they do not need any specific equipment or harmful chemicals therefore it is not harmful to the environment numerous methods have been reported for plant mediation the adsorbent was modified as a magnetic material and was not previously reported hence it is an innovative technique for the synthesis of fe3o4 magnetic particles and is used for the exclusion of uranium vi from aquatic path in this study magnetic material is synthesized from tree bark of phyllanthus emblica amla the bark of phyllanthus emblica amla has phytochemicals gallic acid furosin corilagain carbohydrates and amino acids polyphenolic groups present in gallic acid are responsible to reduce of different metal ions the study of the work is to prove and gather data for theoretical use of magnetic adsorbent for elimination of u vi from aqueous solution this study utilizes results from various conditions on the u vi removal was investigated in batch adsorption study the main aim of this work is to evaluate the ability of magnetic adsorbent for the sequestration of heavy metal contaminated water green synthesis is vital as a result of the synthesized fe3o4 adsorbent is safe to be consumed by human beings because the materials used are derived from biological sources such as plant extract on the other hand plant extracts can serve as both reducing and stabilizing agents in the synthesizing process fe3o4 this strategy is not only straightforward but also cost effective to put it another way the green method is an environmentally sustainable method of synthesizing magnetic particles adsorbent that is not harmful to the environment or human health the aim of this research is to outline new routes for synthesis of these magnetic particles fe3o4 using plant resources as a result there is an increasing need to produce nontoxic environmental products some of the advantages a harmful materials are not used making this a clean and environmentally safe process b additional laboratory conditions such as high pressure

and arsenazo iii a92775 purchased from sigma aldrich usa tartaric acid 99 5 and iron ii sulfate feso4 7h2o hepta hydrate crystal purified 99 0 were obtained from merck india dtpe diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid 99 0 was purchased from loba chemie pvt ltd india anhydrous ferric chloride fecl3 99 0 was purchased from molychem 2 2 adsorbates uranium solutions 1 g l were prepared by taking a fixed quantity of uranyl nitrate and dissolving it in distilled water the meal ion concentrations were made by the dilution process 2 3 adsorbent tree bark of phyllanthus emblica commonly known as amla was collected from the local forest of chhattisgarh india the tree bark of phyllanthus emblica was cut into tiny pieces and rinsed number of times with water to remove the dirt and other unwanted particles terrestrial tree bark was dried at 40 c for 48 h then the sample was powdered and sieved 300 μm further in this connection it was stored in an airtight bottle for the adsorption process 2 4 preparation of magnetic bio adsorbent the chemical precipitation method kashyap et al 2019 was adopted for the magnetization of tree bark material of phyllanthus emblica briefly 25 gm bio adsorbent was suspended in 250 ml double distilled water for 1 h known amounts of ferric chloride 9 gm in 650 ml distilled water and ferrous sulfate 10 gm in 75 ml distilled water solutions were mixed together and kept for magnetic stirring at 60 70 c for 30 min further in this way the bio adsorbent was added to a mixed solution and was stirred slowly for 30 min now the ph increased to 10 11 by the dropwise addition of naoh 10 m into the suspension the particles iron oxide get precipitating when the ph rises the suspension was aged at room temperature for 24 h finally magnetic bio adsorbent was filtered and cleaned number of times with distilled water and then with ethanol until the ph reached 7 0 and dried overnight at 50 c oven magnetic sample was separated by using a permanent ndfeb magnet 2 5 adsorption studies to study the impact of operational parameters such as ph contact time initial metal ion concentration temperature and adsorbent dose on the adsorption of uranyl ions on a magnetic bio adsorbent sample of phyllanthus emblica examined by batch adsorption method followed by the arsenazo iii method then 0 3 g magnetic bio adsorbent was mixed with adsorbate solution 50 ml of u vi this was kept in a stopper polypropylene bottle with the help of a magnetic stirrer labquest mhs5p all these experiments were conducted at a constant speed with g value 6 73 the

panalytical 3 kw x pert powder laboratories from the nit raipur ftir bruker opus 7 5 18 analysis was performed on the ncnr pt r s u raipur 3 result and discussion 3 1 effect of ph ph is a significant parameter for sorption of metal ions onto adsorbent it depends on the metal uptake which is associated with the metal chemistry in the solution as well as the surface functional group of the adsorbent material fig 1 a represents the impact of ph on the adsorption of uranyl ion onto a magnetic bio adsorbent which was conducted in the solution with ph range between 2 and 10 the removal efficiency increased from 46 to 85 6 by increasing the ph from 2 to 7 and then decreased sharply upon increasing the ph of the solution from 8 to 10 therefore the maximum removal efficiency is considered to be 85 6 at ph 7 it has been observed that the ph affects uranium and that binding sites appear on the surface of biomass so it has been reported as a gradual increase in uranium adsorption krestou et al 2003 the degree of protonation of the surface slowly decreased as the ph increased ph 8 10 and formed negatively charged species wang et al 2014 based on the results obtained ph 7 of the solution is suitable for adsorption of uranium vi by magnetically modified tree bark of phyllanthus emblica the precipitation of oh is hindered by fe 3 at the mentioned ph and fe 3 might alter the interaction of oh and reach higher removal wang et al 2018 the u vi species are influenced by the ph of the solution at ph 5 the dominant species is uo2 2 whereas in the ph range of 5 0 7 0 u vi hydrolysis complexes uo2oh and multinuclear hydroxide complexes uo2 3 oh 5 are the dominant species moreover at ph 7 0 carbonate uranyl ions uo2co3 uo2 co3 2 2 uo2 co3 3 4 are the dominant species when ph 7 the charge of u vi species positive to negative yu et al 2016a b 3 2 effect of initial metal ion concentration the difference of the removal efficiency with various initial metal ion concentrations 10 mg l to 200 mg l is presented in fig 1b the quantity of uranium vi adsorbed on the magnetic tree bark of phyllanthus emblica increased from 72 6 to 85 6 with increasing metal ion concentration from 10 mg l to 25 mg l however the removal efficiency gradually decreased up to 40 6 after increasing the metal ion concentration up to 200 mg l due to the saturation of the adsorption site of adsorbent material the adsorption experiments were conducted at 25 mg l 3 3 effect of contact time the contact time is a vital parameter for the adsorption phenomena it is carried out with a constant metal ion concentration 25 mg l fig 1c represents the adsorption of uranium vi onto magnetic adsorbent tree bark of phyllanthus emblica it was investigated from 10 to 70 min at ph 7 initially the percentage of removal efficiency increased from 44 8 to 85 6 with increasing time up to 40 min after it reaches maxima it shows a constant value for a certain period of time from 50 to 70 min 3 4 effect of adsorbent dose the influence of adsorbent dose is also one of the significant parameters for determining the quantitative uptake of metal ions the effect of the adsorption dose from 0 1 g to 0 5 g studied in the batch adsorption method is displayed in fig 1d the removal efficiency of uranium vi onto magnetic adsorbent enhanced from 54 to 85 6 upon increasing the dose of adsorbent from 0 1 g to 0 3 g with uranium vi solution 50 ml at ph 7 and fixed metal ion concentration 25 mg l for 40 min then the removal efficiency was gradually slowed down to 46 4 up to 0 5 g after it reached equilibrium in addition when the adsorbent dose was approximately 0 3 gm the maximum removal efficiency reached 85 6 this is because of the overlapping adsorption of ion sites kocaoba 2007 this means the overloading of particles of the adsorbent due to free ions remaining constant and the number of ions accumulating on the adsorbent this phenomenon reduces the removal efficiency of u vi due to insufficient surface area of adsorbent 3 5 effect of temperature temperature is the key part for the adsorption method of uranium vi on magnetic sample as an adsorbent metal ion uptake was performed at given temperature 303 k 313 k and 323 k with fixed metal ion concentrations 25 mg l the removal efficiency increased up to 40 min at all temperatures in addition the uranium vi removal efficiency slightly increased with increasing temperature as shown in fig 1e then it showed constant removal efficiency after reaching the maxima the experiment was conducted at 303 k the endothermic phenomena could be observed by the adsorption behaviour because temperature is the key part of the process 3 6 adsorption isotherm the equilibrium investigation is a decent technique for analysing the behaviour of adsorbent surface mainly isotherm models focus on the interaction between adsorbate and adsorbent isotherms namely langmuir and freundlich isotherms are shown in table 1 the langmuir isotherm adopts homogenous and monolayer adsorption onto a surface but freundlich performs on heterogeneous surfaces patil et al 2016 equations 3 and 6 represented the linear equations of the langmuir and freundlich adsorption isotherms 3 c e q e 1 k l q max c e q max by the use of slope and intercept the value of kl langmuir isotherm constants and q max maximum sorption capacity were calculated where qe represents the amount adsorbed mg g and ce represents the adsorbate concentration in solution mg l both at equilibrium is the langmuir adsorption constant l mg and q max is the maximum sorption capacity for monolayer formation on the adsorbent hereby the langmuir isotherm characterises regarding a dimensionless constant denoted as separation factor rl kaur et al 2003 written as 4 r l 1 1 k l c 0 the adsorption process is favourable when 0 r 1 and irreversible when rl 0 however when rl 1 the isotherm is in unfavourable condition the freundlich isotherm nonlinear model is denoted as 5 q e k f c e 1 n where kf freundlich isotherm constant mg g mg l n adsorption tendency the linear equation claudio et al 2010 for the freundlich isotherm is as follows 6 log q e log k f 1 n l o g c e with the help of intercept and slope the value of kf and n are calculated as shown in fig 2 the langmuir adsorption isotherm model shows the best fitting due to the higher correlation coefficient r2 0 963 compared to the freundlich isotherm model r2 0 8264 table 4 represents the comparison of reported maximum adsorption capacities with other reported value 3 7 adsorption kinetics the adsorption kinetics of u vi ions onto magnetically modified tree bark phyllanthus emblica were confirmed using the pseudo second order model the adsorption kinetics of uranium vi by magnetic bio adsorbent were analysed at different temperatures 303 k 313 k and 323 k with a fixed initial metal ion concentration 25 mg l the first pseudo order equation is as follows 7 log q e q t log q e k 1 2 303 t where qe and qt mg g adsorption capacity of u vi ions at equilibrium and t time k1 first order constant min 1 fig 3 represents that the values of qe and k1 can be calculated from the intercept and slope equation for second pseudo order is as follows 8 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 is the pseudo second order constant g mg min 1 the values of qe and k2 determined by the slope and intercept diwan et al 2020 are shown in fig 3 the data are shown in table 2 here the pseudo second order model highlights the best fitting due to the higher correlation coefficient r2 0 9988 compared to the pseudo first order kinetics r2 0 9942 3 8 adsorption thermodynamic thermodynamic studies give reliable knowledge about the structural changes of adsorbents after adsorption guo et al 2015 thermodynamic parameters such as change of free energy δg enthalpy δh and entropy δs are explained by fluctuation of the thermodynamic equilibrium constant the sorption amount by magnetic biosorption lies in 303 k 313 k and 323 k this was calculated with the help of equation 9 thermodynamic parameter yu et al 2016a b 9 l n k d δ s r δ h r t here distribution coefficient kd represents the δh δs and t are enthalpy entropy and temperature kelvin respectively and r is gas constant δg gibbs free energy was obtained from equation 10 10 δ g δ h t δ s for the sorption of uranyl ions on magnetic biosorption the value of the thermodynamic parameter is shown in table 3 the enthalpy change δh indicates a positive value which means that the adsorption phenomenon is endothermic furthermore in this way the entropy change δs is positive so possible explanations for entropy the process is irreversible and favours the stability of sorption with increased randomness δg indicates a negative value which confirms that the spontaneous behaviour and biosorption process is feasible adeogun et al 2019 3 9 adsorption mechanism of uranyl ion on magnetically modified tree bark 3 9 1 xrd analysis the xrd spectrum was used to

3346 20 and 3232 91 due to the strong broad oh stretching of free hydroxyl phenol two weak peaks were observed at 2929 74 in natural samples which were displaced after adsorption of uranium vi at 2883 96 due to medium ch stretching alkynes one sharp signal clearly defines the shift of 1606 17 displaced at position 1612 94 to 1615 98 nh bending due to the presence of a primary amine which indicates that it may be due to the absorption of uranium vi on magnetic particles because amla contains good quantities of ca p fe carotene vitamin b complex protein na and carbohydrates another sharp peak

aromatic amines because the adsorption peak clearly shows the difference before and after adsorption of uranium vi on the magnetic adsorbent another sharp peak appears at 775 14 778 84 778 92 due to the c cl stretching alkyl halide the small peaks appeared in the ranges of 654 61 647 72 and 698 80 accordingly the adsorption peak approx 600 cm 1 indicated in the magnetic sample could be credited

transparency and greatest prominent peak in the xrd profile of the modified tree bark magnetic of phyllanthus emblica amla fig 5 5 conclusion modified magnetic material was successfully synthesized from tree bark of phyllanthus emblica which was taken as a bio adsorbent for the exclusion of uranyl ion from aqueous environments by developing novel magnetic particles all parameters showed satisfactory removal efficiency of uranyl ions at optimized condition ph 7 with 85 6 exclusion of uranium in 40 min of contact time the adsorption study indicates that the pseudo second order model r2 0 9988 gives the best information about kinetic uptake qualities the adsorption outcome at equilibrium is designated by the langmuir model for the prediction of the progression of adsorption with r2 0

11914,the effect of future climate change on groundwater resources was assessed using a modelling approach for a coastal area in vietnam in this study the distributed hydrological model panta rhei was coupled with the finite element subsurface flow system model feflow to predict the future variation of groundwater resources the assessment of the seasonal variability of climate conditions on the variation of groundwater recharge and groundwater levels gwls in different aquifers was analysed for the historical 1986 2005 present 2013 2014 and future 2046 2065 period the domain groundwater model covers approximately 50 km2 the groundwater model was calibrated and validated using hourly measured groundwater levels at 11 monitoring wells within the study area the necessary information on geological formations hydrogeological parameters and groundwater abstraction rate were implemented in the groundwater model set up one representative concentration pathway rcp8 5 is considered for projecting future conditions of groundwater resources the results of this study showed that future rainfall was projected to decrease both in wet and dry seasons groundwater recharge was projected to decrease significantly in the dry season 10 9 compared to the wet season 2 6 as a result groundwater levels were also projected to decline in future stronger declining trends were detected for deeper groundwater especially in the dry season with declines of 6 7 20 2 m the model results also showed that the gwls are largely influenced by the natural recharge through precipitation in the study area these findings may help decision makers and stakeholders for devising sustainable groundwater management strategies in coastal area keywords feflow model groundwater recharge groundwater levels climate change 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of fresh water for agricultural industrial and domestic purposes global climate change has become an increasingly emerging issue influencing water quantity and quality around the world according to the projections from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc global warming and alterations in frequency and amount of precipitation are being changed considerably from year 2000 2100 le treut et al 2007 mearns et al 2007 these changes are expected to affect the hydrological cycle altering surface water levels and groundwater recharge to aquifers with various other associated impacts on natural ecosystems and human activities changes in surface hydrologic cycle components affected by climate change consist of evapotranspiration patterns surface runoff and stream flow bates et al 2008 such changes to surface components of the global hydrologic cycle will likely cause changes in the subsurface hydrologic cycle within the soil vadose zone and aquifers of the world van dijck et al 2006 precipitation and temperature are the two important factors when considering climate change because they directly affect groundwater recharge rates and mechanisms green et al 2011 ghazavi et al 2019 neukum and azzam 2012 batalha et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2007 aguilera and murillo 2009 however the effects of climate change may also increase decrease or not change groundwater recharge in aquifers during seasonal periods or the whole periods of time ng et al 2010 for example dettinger and earman 2007 concluded that it is unknown whether the overall recharge will increase decrease or stay the same at any scale in the western united states while many studies have shown a predicted decrease in recharge rates under future climate neukum and azzam 2012 shrestha et al 2016 ghazavi et al 2019 other studies have shown an increase in recharge rates jyrkama and sykes 2007 woldeamlak et al 2007 indicated that small changes in precipitation may lead to large changes in recharge in some semiarid and regions sandstrom 1995 showed that a 15 reduction in precipitation with no change in temperature resulted in a 40 50 reduction in recharge in coastal areas groundwater resources are not only influenced by climate change but also salt intrusion from sea water level that could lead to a loss in fresh groundwater resources this phenomena of salt water intrusion as a threat to fresh groundwater resources has been studied since recent years voss and souza 1987 ferguson et al 2012 lemieux et al 2015 several approaches have been used to assess the potential impact of climate change on groundwater systems based on the assessment of change in groundwater recharge mutual interaction between surface water and groundwater and gwls among these approaches numerical models is often used as an effective tool to predict groundwater behaviour under various climate change scenarios hosseinizadeh et al 2019 zamanirad et al 2018 lemieux et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016 el kadi et al 2014 oude et al 2010 webb et al 2011 chang et al 2011 for instance hosseinizadeh et al 2019 used modflow model mcdonald et al 1988 to investigate the effects of climate change on groundwater system of the dezful plain in iran under 15 general circulation models in a semi arid region from 2020 to 2044 their results highlighted that climate change can have a significant effect on groundwater resources in the region in this study the feflow diersch 1979 model was used to investigate the effects of climate change on groundwater flow under rcp8 5 scenario feflow is a numerical model which is one of the powerful tools for assessing the quantity and quality of groundwater the advantage of the finite element approach is the flexible meshing allowing for complex geological settings and fits hydrogeological features such as fault lines or rivers as well as tunnels and wells to date the feflow model has been widely used to predict groundwater systems over different hydrogeological regions vrzel et al 2019 pham et al 2019 hu et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 kupfersberger et al 2017 for example vrzel et al 2019 have assessed the sensitivity of groundwater surface water interactions to climate change in an alluvial aquifer located in the ljubljansko polje slovenia they indicated that there will be higher levels of local precipitation during 2036 2065 the projected river discharge will be larger in the future compared to 2000 2014 and it is unlikely that the ljubljansko polje will suffer from water scarcity thivai area and its vicinity a coastal area situated in the southeast of vietnam was chosen as a study area for several reasons a some previous studies focused only on analysing current status of groundwater resources based on short term and discontinuous measurement of monthly gwls in dongnai river basin covering this study area le v h 2008 dang d p 2008 baye e 2011 b the intense socio economical activities c this area is already being threatened by a relative high seawater level monre 2012 therefore protection and sustainable management of the groundwater resources responding to climate change in this area is virtual necessary aiming at enhancing the effectiveness of groundwater use for the current and future time the aim of this study are to i assess the potential effect of climate change on seasonal variation of groundwater recharge and groundwater levels using a coupled panta rhei feflow model for complex porous aquifers of the thivai area and ii evaluate the mutual interaction between surface water and groundwater in this study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study are the study area covering approximately 500 km2 is located in the dongnai ba ria vung tau province and ho chi minh city fig 1 the thivai river has a length of 37 km from the baky weir to the sea and its water level is influenced by semi diurnal tidal regime the area is affected by tropical monsoon climate with a characteristic rainy season from may to october and dry season from november to april the mean annual rainfall is 1800 mm whereof 80 fall in rainy season the mean temperature of the study area is about 28 c land use in this area is mainly industrial and agricultural land the industrial zones are located along the thivai river occupying about 10 of the total study area the agricultural land distributed all over the thivai catchment includes permanent crops 42 rice 5 annual plants 6 7 and mangrove forest 7 the other land 29 3 is used for residential areas and public constructions the soil in the study area are dominated by acidic soil type arenic acrisoil 23 4 ferric acrisoil 9 4 gleyic acrisol 8 3 and plintic acrisol 8 1 other important soil types are rhodic ferrasols 14 7 and thionic fluvisols 10 9 2 2 geology in this area the sedimentation regime and the sea level transgressions and regressions have caused large variations in aquifers consisting of holocene qh upper pleistocene qp3 lower and middle pleistocene qp2 3 and pliocen n2 2 fig 2 the qh aquifer occurs at the surface of almost the whole coastline area and consists of clayed silt fine sand and organic matters the boreholes installed in this aquifer mainly shallow boreholes with the depths from several meters to 16 m the qp3 is distributed widely throughout the whole area this aquifer can be divided into two parts the top part is an aquitard layer consisting of silt clay or silt clay the lower part is an aquifer including fine to coarse sand having a thickness from 2 to 17 m similar to the qp3 the qp2 3 can be divided into two parts the top part is an aquitard layer consisting of clay or silty clay the lower part is a confined aquifer consisting of fine to coarse sand having the average thickness from 4 to 15 m the lowest aquifer is n2 2 a confined aquifer consisting of fine to coarse sand having the average thickness from 2 to 34 m 2 3 groundwater level measurement based on the available monitoring wells being managed by the department of natural resources of ba ria vung tau province donre we utilized 11 wells for measurement of groundwater levels within the study area these monitoring wells have been drilled into different aquifers including qh qp3 qp2 3 and n2 2 aquifer table 1 the monitoring campaigns of the groundwater levels were carried out from april 2013 to april 2014 by the institute for water management gmbh braunschweig germany to measure groundwater levels a continuous monitoring system with 11 automatic water level measuring devices were installed in march 2013 in observation wells all over the study area measurements are made in a 15 min intervals for all monitoring wells the measured data have been downloaded every 2 months and were then analysed and processed to eliminate the error data during the monitoring periods the amplitude variation and magnitude of the groundwater levels at different monitoring wells are presented in fig 5 and fig 7 2 4 methodology 2 4 1 climate change scenario the assessment of the likely impact of climate change on groundwater systems is based on the future projection of climate change at the basin scale using clime models which come in different forms ranging from simple climate model to comprehensive three dimensional general circulation model or global climate models gcms gcms are the most sophisticated tools available for prediction of the current global climate and future climate scenario projections their formulation usually takes into account the behaviour and interaction of flow systems in the biosphere hydrosphere cryosphere atmosphere and geosphere in the climate system because gcms do not accurately predict climatic variables such as precipitation and temperature at local scale downscaling method will addresses the disparity between coarse spatial scales of gcms and observations from local meteorological stations wilby and wigley 1997 hewitson and crane 2006 downscaling techniques are grouped into two main types a dynamic climate modelling which involves nesting a higher resolution regional climate model rcm within a coarser resolution gcms and b empirical statistical downscaling which combines existing and past empirical knowledge to address the disparity between coarse spatial scales of gcms and point meteorological observations within the framework of the joint research project environmental and water protection technologies of coastal zones in vietnam ewatec coast future climate scenario is provided by the institute for meteorology and climate research karlsruhe institute of technology karlsruhe germany subproject 2 time periods were defined for a historical period from 1986 to 2005 and a future period from 2046 to 2065 schubert et al 2017 for these periods subproject 2 provided simulated meteorological time series boundary conditions for various meteorological parameters from the hcpv high resolution climate projections for vietnam project the basis is the emission scenario rcp8 5 which is included as a boundary condition in the global climate models in the hcpv project temperature and precipitation fields of the regional climate model ccam conformal cubic atmospheric model were used there were six implementations of ccam each for 1986 2005 and 2046 2065 which were driven by six different global circulation models meteorological time series were in the form of raster data with a spatial resolution of 10 10 km2 and a temporal resolution of 3 h provided in order to generate a consistent dataset a bias correction of the simulated meteorological time series based on the historical measured meteorological station data was carried out as part of the data preparation by subproject 2 a detailed description of the bias correction method was described by schubert et al 2017 results from their study indicated that on the basis of the rcp8 5 scenario a temperature increase of up to 2 c is projected for the period 2046 2065 and precipitation is projected to decrease in the north of thivai area furthermore it was found that extreme rates of precipitation amounts do not increase in this scenario but rather their annual variation 2 4 2 description of numerical models a coupled panta rhei feflow model was developed to assess the likely impact of future climate change on groundwater system of the study area panta rhei model simulates the hydrological processes under the different climate conditions while feflow model simulates the groundwater flow system of the study area the simulation models were performed for the historical 1986 2005 present 2013 2014 and future 2046 2065 period 2 4 2 1 hydrological modelling the panta rhei model has been developed by the department of hydrology water management and water protection leichtweiss institute for hydraulic engineering and water resources university of braunschweig in corporation with the institut für wassermanagement ifw gmbh braunschweig germany lwi hywag and ifw 2012 it is a deterministic semi distributed physically based hydrological model for long term or single event simulations it has been successfully employed for scientific questions hölscher et al 2012 and in numerous national and international projects meon et al 2014 wurpts et al 2014 furthermore panta rhei is applied in the operational flood forecast of the federal state lower saxony germany meyer et al 2013 the temporal discretisation is adaptive and in many applications an hourly time step is used the spatial differentiation is divided into three levels hydrologic response units hrus subcatchments and gauged catchments a modified penman monteith method penman 1948 monteith 1965 is used to estimate the evapotranspiration snow accumulation and melting as snow water equivalent is calculated by energy balance approaches förster et al 2014 soil types were parameterised by texture information which are derived from soil maps boess et al 2004 kreye and meon 2016 panta rhei provides a physically based soil model kreye et al 2010 2012 kreye 2015 the soil model dyvesom dynamic vegetation soil model accounts for root growths and vegetational feedback on soil properties by using the growing season index jolly et al 2005 this parameterisation was successfully validated by comparing its course of year with phenological observation data of the german weather service and satellite based measurements in particular the normalised differenced vegetation index ndvi see förster et al 2012 simulated variables of dyvesom like soil water content or groundwater recharge were successfully validated by different products of satellite based soil water measurements and by groundwater level measurements details of the parameterisation of dyvesom are given in kreye and meon 2016 the calculation of runoff concentration is based on four linear storages with individual storage constants surface runoff fast and slow interflow and base flow at the hru level the processes of runoff formation are calculated these include snow accumulation and melting evapotranspiration interception infiltration percolation and groundwater recharge the standard method in panta rhei for describing the processes of runoff formation based on the modification of the scs curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 which was developed to simulate surface runoff from daily rainfall events in the curve number method the curve number varies non linearly with the moisture content of the soil recharge enters the aquifers is calculated based on darcy s law recharge in an aquifer system can be calculated if both the head gradients and hydraulic conductivities are known darcy s law is used to calculated recharge entering aquifers according to the following equation 1 q k θ d h d z k θ d d z h z k θ d h d z 1 where q is specific recharge rate m a k θ is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity m s h is the total head m h is the metric potential head m and z is the horizontal distance between the two points where hydraulic head is measured m and θ is water content at present the model is used for a wide range of tasks including water balance simulation and optimization of reservoir cascade operation for climate change impact studies meon and gocht 2012 groundwater recharge schöniger et al 2019a b for this study we focused on analysis of the seasonal groundwater recharge variation for different simulation periods using panta rhei model which were used as a boundary condition to the feflow model 2 4 2 2 groundwater modelling feflow version 6 1 was developed to simulate groundwater flow mass transport and heat transfer in porous media and fractured media the model uses finite element analysis to solve the groundwater flow equation of both saturated and unsaturated conditions as well as mass and heat transport in this model the mesh consists of a network of nodes that form the vertices of triangular elements in multiple layered models a number of slices with identical node locations are stacked onto one another the feflow model is composed of three parts consisting of 1 the designation of finite element mesh 2 3d designation of slices and layers and 3 problem editor to specify the parameters needed for simulation 2 4 2 2 1 model mesh generation and 3d geometry the mesh developed with the feflow package was generated using the automatic triangle option this feature offers the ability to define the local variation of mesh density by allowing for the refinement of the mesh around specified point and line features an initial mesh density of 3050 elements was used in the generate automatically option to generate the mesh the regional mesh was then refined in the pumping area using the mesh geometry editor to consider the highly varying hydrological properties of these areas the resultant mesh used in the modelling is presented in fig 3 and comprises 3598 elements and 1888 nodes based on the available data of the hydrogeological cross sections and stratigraphy the model have been developed as three dimensions and comprise 08 slices and 07 layers fig 3 layer numbers of 1 3 5 and 7 represent the aquifer with high hydraulic conductivity the rest of layers including 2 4 and 6 are aquitard layers which the vertical hydraulic conductivity is from low to very low the elevations for the first layer slice 1 in the area model was developed using the stratigraphic information from available drilling information and digital elevation model dem the elevations were applied to the model using the kriging data regionalisation 2 4 2 2 2 boundaries of the model and their conditions to represent the system relationship with the surrounding area a set of appropriate boundary conditions bc are applied to the model to define how the site specific model interacts with entire flow system the western boundary representing the thivai river was assigned as river boundary the conceptual model assumes that the dominant mechanism for discharge of groundwater from the system is through the river bed and via spring flow to the rivers and that the river and groundwater are in dynamic connection based on this assumption the discharge to the rivers has been implemented using the transfer bc diersch 2008 time series of the thivai river s water levels were assigned in individual note of the model fig 3 the southern border of the model domain is contiguous to the coastline therefore the data of tidal levels were used as constant hydraulic head bc dirichlet type this bc specifies a time varying value for the primary variable at a node i e hydraulic head for flow the tidal data were recorded automatically with 10 min intervals and assigned in eight slices of the model domain fig 3 pumping bores for industrial domestic and agricultural use were implemented using well bcs the well bc describes the injection or withdrawal of water at a single node in m3 d 1 pumping rates were applied as a variable pumping rate using power functions to define the transient pumping schedule for each bore in total there are 21 wells within the model domain which extract groundwater from 413 to 51575 m3 d 1 le v h 2008 however pumping duration and pumping rate have not been recorded so far therefore the pumping rate ranging from 2000 to 2500 m3 d 1 was assumed as input data for wells bcs in this study fig 3 groundwater recharge derived from panta rhei model at the subbasin levels was assigned to the corresponding polygon of the first layer of the model domain the values of groundwater recharge vary in time and space and are dependent upon the changes in climate data topography land use and soil properties this is consistent with the real condition and also increase in the accuracy of simulation results 2 4 2 2 3 groundwater model calibration and validation calibration is a process by which parameters are adjusted until model predictions fit observations so that the model can be accepted as a good representation of the physical system of interest for this study the groundwater levels of 11 observation wells were used as initial condition for executing steady state simulation which was carried out to describe three dimensional flow field over the entire model domain the feflow model was then calibrated to transient state from april 2013 april 2014 due to the availability of the input data and observed groundwater levels based on the distribution of the monitoring wells within the study area the well named nb1a vt2a nb2a nb3b vt6 and vt7a were chosen for the model calibration period and the wells including nb1b nb4 vt4 qt7a and dn30 were chosen for the model validation period fig 1 during the model calibration main parameters controlling the dynamics of groundwater flow system were adjusted and assigned at different zones of each layer these parameters include hydraulic conductivity drain fillable porosity specific storage transfer rates and the pumping rate of wells due to the lack of investigated hydrogeological data these values were derived from mekong delta project uppenberg et al 1997 the values of hydraulic conductivity drainage porosity storage coefficient and in out transfer rate assigned to the model ranged from 8 to 41 m d 1 0 001 0 02 0 00001 0 0001 and 200 700 d 1 respectively to assess the deviation between observed and simulated results some statistical parameters consisting of mean absolute error mae and root mean square rms willmott 1982 were used in this study 3 results in the following sections the groundwater behaviour and its effects by climate change in a coastal area are presented the variation of climate data was also analysed for the past present and future period 3 1 spatial distribution of current recharge to the study area current groundwater recharge was estimated at the subbasin levels using the panta rhei model for the current climatic conditions 2013 2014 the spatial distribution of the average annual recharge at different subbasins is showed in fig 4 the results showed that the mean annual recharge rate ranges from zero to a maximum of about 1066 mm y 1 the mean annual recharge was estimated to be 550 mm y 1 which is about 29 of the annual precipitation the results also indicated that recharge rate is strongly influenced by the combination of topography and soil textures at different subbasins small recharge rate values occurs in the north western areas due to high slope and fined texture soils while high recharge rate was concentrated in the areas located along the thivai river and coastline where sandy soils and low slopes are the main factors resulting in an increase in percolation of these areas in addition recharge varies substantially depending upon the geological environment kotchoni et al 2019 and differences in recharge between sites can be largely explained by variability in hydrogeological conditions including various depths to the potentiometric surface thomas et al 2016 3 2 groundwater model calibration and validation 3 2 1 groundwater model calibration in order to assess the development of the groundwater table with time the computed hydraulic heads have been compared to the measurements at all 06 monitoring points over the calibration period from april 2013 april 2014 fig 5 the results showed reasonable agreement between simulated and measured gwls groundwater table rises during the rainy season and gradually drop until the end of the dry season in general the highest groundwater levels are taken place in the beginning of october while the lowest groundwater levels can be found at the end of april fig 5 looking the variation of the well nb2a nb3b and vt6 the heads are slightly underestimated during the period from july august 2013 this is probably due to the local storm events since storm events occurred with high local variation the amount of rainfall infiltration during the storm is not reflected by the model overall the model simulated relatively well for both the timing and magnitude of the groundwater levels this is confirmed by the statistical values of mae and rms ranged from 0 1 to 0 57 and from 0 15 to 0 65 respectively the spatial distribution of groundwater depth at the end of april 30 2014 is shown in fig 6 the elevations of groundwater table were represented by different colors that the darker colour suggests lower groundwater elevations within the domain the simulated results showed that the higher elevations of groundwater table concentrate in the north eastern boundary of the model while lower elevations occur in the western and the southern boundary in addition contour lines of groundwater table elevations ranged from 0 to 38 5 m indicate that the groundwater table slopes downward to the coastline southern boundary of the model domain in general 3 2 2 groundwater model validation the comparisons of simulated and measured gwls at the points of nb1b nb4 vt4 qt7a and dn30 are given in fig 7 the respective values of mae and rms ranged from 0 2 to 0 83 and from 0 3 to 0 81 reveal that the feflow model performed reasonably in simulating groundwater flow in the study area in general considering the variation of gwls at the point dn30 which is close to the thivai river fig 7 the magnitude and amplitude of simulated values are relatively agreement with the measured values in addition the fluctuation of the gwls is strongly influenced by the water levels of the thivai river a similar behaviour could be found in the case of vt7a where groundwater variation is significantly impacted by sea water levels fig 5 looking the variation of gwls at all of the monitoring points except the points of dn30 and vt7a it could be realized that the water level variation of the thivai river are not influenced groundwater behavior in different aquifers in general figs 5 and 7 in other words there is no or little interaction between surface water and groundwater in these regions within the study area the main source of water that recharges to groundwater in the thivai area is attributed to be rainfall 3 3 projected future precipitation and evapotranspiration under rcp8 5 scenario fig 8 compared the simulated average monthly precipitation and evapotranspiration for the historical period and the future period of the study area respectively the projected mean monthly precipitation during long term 2046 2065 fluctuates over the months in rcp8 5 scenario and is slightly lower than that in the historical period especially during the months of september and october the total average annual rainfall in the future and historical period is 1882 1 mm and 1887 5 mm respectively fig 9 rainfall regime in the thivai area has distinct wet may to october and dry november to april seasons seasonal changes in rainfall are projected to be different for dry and wet seasons under rcp8 5 scenario the simulated results showed that the total annual rainfall in the wet season is much higher than that in the dry season fig 9 the respective change in the total mean rainfall in the wet and dry season between the future and the historical period is estimated to be 3 9 and 1 5 fig 11 regarding the projected evapotranspiration under rcp8 5 simulated monthly values in the future period is always higher than those in the historical period the highest evaporation was occurred in the months from may august reaching about 85 mm month 1 fig 8 the difference in evaporation between the future and the historical period is estimated to be about 11 the increase in evaporation in the future is also consistent with the simulation results for the pcr8 5 scenario when the temperature is predicted to increase by about 2 c 3 4 impact of climate change on groundwater availability climate change has resulted alteration in water balance components in the thivai area such as evapotranspiration and precipitation the following sub section discusses how groundwater recharge and gwls are projected to be altered under future climatic conditions 3 4 1 impacts on groundwater recharge the calibrated panta rhei model was used to predict future groundwater recharge for the period 2046 2065 under rcp8 5 scenario the median annual recharge for the pcr 8 5 scenario was projected to decrease by about 5 9 relative to historical value at the study area fig 10 mean total recharge is projected under pcr 8 5 for the wet and dry season are 527 1 mm y 1 and 44 3 mm y 1 respectively fig 10 the simulated results indicated that most of the groundwater recharge takes places during the rainy season accounting for about 95 of the total annual recharge while only 5 results from the dry season change in recharge between historical and future period was projected to be higher in dry season 10 9 than that of wet season 2 6 fig 11 this is due to the intensively increase in evaporation combined with decrease in precipitation in dry season under rcp8 5 scenario in conclusion climate change will result gradual decrease in groundwater recharge in thivai area over the coming decades with more decrease over the dry season this finding is consistent with the study by shrestha et al 2016 that showed a decrease in groundwater recharge in short medium and long terms under rcp8 5 scenario for the mekong delta vietnam 3 4 2 impact on groundwater levels seasonal variation of gwls in different aquifers was simulated for both the historical and future period fig 12 future gwls for the period 2046 2065 were projected using the fully calibrated groundwater model assuming that groundwater abstraction for the future periods would remain same amount as during 2013 2014 future recharge inputs however were changed as estimated by panta rhei the model predicted a general decline in gwls from historical period in all the aquifers under the rcp 8 5 scenario the amplitude of the seasonal variation of gwls decreased with increasing borehole depth from substantial seasonal variation in the holocene qh and upper pleistocen qp3 aquifers fig 12 a b to little or no seasonal variation in the miocene n2 2 aquifer fig 12c similar patterns of seasonal fluctuations between gwls in the qh qp3 and qp2 3 aquifers and future precipitation fig 12 a b c suggest that these aquifers are strongly influenced by percolation during rainstorms the simulated results for future trends of gwls across the thivai area indicated that the gwls in all aquifers showed various magnitudes of decreasing trends from 0 75 to 20 2 m corresponding to 0 05 0 3 m year 1 compared to those of the historical period figs 12 and 13 the decline of the future gwls occurring in the dry season is much higher than that in the wet season for all aquifers especially in the qp3 qp 2 3 and n2 2 aquifers this is attributed to the extraction of groundwater from deep aquifers and high evaporation during the dry season largest decline was predicted in the n2 2 aquifer by about 20 2 m and the least decline of around 1 25 m was projected in the qh aquifer by the 2050s under rcp8 5 scenario fig 13 4 discussion the decreasing magnitude of seasonal variation from shallow to deep groundwater fig 12 suggests that the aquifers act as low pass filters during the transformation of input signals e g recharge or river water levels into output signals e g groundwater water levels the role of aquifers as a low pass filter in the frequency domain has also been reported in other studies e g gasse 2000 duvert et al 2015 regarding shallow aquifers similar patterns of seasonal fluctuations between gwls and precipitation fig 12 suggest that gwls in shallow aquifers across the thivai area are strongly affected by precipitation several studies have been made to investigate the effects on gwls variations due to precipitation jan et al 2007 venetis et al 1971 butterworth et al 1999 ferdowsian et al 2001 for instance butterworth et al 1999 evaluated the influence of rainfall intensity on groundwater level they concluded that larger perturbations in groundwater level may arise from the response of a shallow aquifer to variations in rainfall it was also found that long term trend in seasonal gwls is an apparent indicator for reflecting the effect of cycles in rainfall for deep groundwater low permeable aquicludes appear to limit the recharge to the deeper aquifer miocene aquifer in the study area the low variation of gwls in the miocene aquifer fig 12 d corroborates this finding the potential recharge of the deeper aquifers e g miocene is partly originated from vertical infiltration through upper aquifers and mainly from the lateral flow within the aquifers from upstream areas the simulated results indicated that deep aquifers have a significant reduction in gwls especially during the dry season the lesser changes in gwls in the shallow aquifer e g holocene however are a result of the interplay between the good connectivity to recharge from precipitation and the comparatively low abstraction from this shallow aquifer another reason for this is that the use of shallow groundwater as a source of drinking water or for irrigation in coastal areas is limited due to saline intrusion smajgl et al 2015 our research suggests that the current groundwater extraction exceeded the aquifer recharge capacities in the study area due to the need for socio economic and industrial development groundwater extraction is forecasted to continue increasing in the future danh and khai 2015 therefore more severe declines in gwls will accelerate saline intrusion into aquifers pollute groundwater and thus threaten sustainable development across the region minderhoud et al 2017 in this study we used the seasonal recharge and gwls as indicators for assessment of groundwater storage variability of the thivai area the simulated results showed a moderate to good accordance with the measurements however the performance of the feflow model has general limitation due to the following reasons i the knowledge of the aquifer system is still limited information regarding the stratigraphy and lithology is not adequate especially for the southern model domain ii hydrogeological property information about the vertical and horzonal variations of hydraulic conductivity drain porosity specific storage and in out transfer rate between the thivai river s bed and aquifers are missing therefore estimations of these parameters were mainly based on the relevant documents obtained from other catchments with similar conditions regarding groundwater abstration rate and volume the data was estimated based on the surveys of industrial zones and residential areas therefore rough value estimation was assumed to the model these limitations could result in uncertainty in the modeled results in addition an assumption of land use the number of groundwater wells volume of groundwater abstration used as input data for the models are remained constant for the past present and future period this assumtion is not unrealistic since i the industrial and agricultural land and groundwater extraction will be significantly changed due to the impact of the increase in manufacturing sectors in the future and ii the increase in groundwater well density these assumptions do not reflect the actual changes in groundwater head in the future period using precipitation and temperature projected from the regional climate model ccam resulted in uncertainty in simulated results of groundwater recharge and gwls due to several uncertainties as described above predicting the effects of the potential climate change on groundwater system in the thivai area should be considered as trends and order of magnitudes rather than exact predictions 5 conclusions this paper discusses how the climate changes alter the spatial and temporal dynamics of the groundwater system of coastal aquifers the variations of groundwater behavior in the thivai river catchment and its vicinity were analysed and assessed for the past 1986 2005 current 2013 2014 and future 2046 2065 period using the coupling of the hydrological panta rhei model with groundwater feflow model input data including climate data land use soil properties topography stratigraphy and hydrogeological properties were taken into acoint into the model setup the calibration and validation of groundwater model is based on the observation points with high resolution of groundwater data for a one year period from april 2013 april 2014 during the calibration the domain has been separated in zones with different aquifer s properties such as hydraulic conductivity porosity specific storage in gerneral feflow was performed sucessfully in simulating groundwater flow in complex porous aquifers the simulated results showed that the average annual recharge was estimated to be about 29 of the annual precipitation recharge amounts are projected under rcp8 5 to decrease by 2 6 and 10 9 in the wet and dry seasons compared to the historical period 1986 2005 the results also indicated that in general gwls in this study area are mostly affected by recharge through rainfall the interaction between surface water and groundwater only occurs in some regions close to the thivai river and coastline the future gwls in the 2050s were projected to decrease significantly in deep aquifers ranging from 2 25 m to 20 2 m in our ongoing research further investigations of the aquifer properties and pumping rate will be updated the combination of future climate change land use change and groundwater exploitation scenarios should be taken into account in the study to more fully assess their impacts on groundwater system of the

11914,the effect of future climate change on groundwater resources was assessed using a modelling approach for a coastal area in vietnam in this study the distributed hydrological model panta rhei was coupled with the finite element subsurface flow system model feflow to predict the future variation of groundwater resources the assessment of the seasonal variability of climate conditions on the variation of groundwater recharge and groundwater levels gwls in different aquifers was analysed for the historical 1986 2005 present 2013 2014 and future 2046 2065 period the domain groundwater model covers approximately 50 km2 the groundwater model was calibrated and validated using hourly measured groundwater levels at 11 monitoring wells within the study area the necessary information on geological formations hydrogeological parameters and groundwater abstraction rate were implemented in the groundwater model set up one representative concentration pathway rcp8 5 is considered for projecting future conditions of groundwater resources the results of this study showed that future rainfall was projected to decrease both in wet and dry seasons groundwater recharge was projected to decrease significantly in the dry season 10 9 compared to the wet season 2 6 as a result groundwater levels were also projected to decline in future stronger declining trends were detected for deeper groundwater especially in the dry season with declines of 6 7 20 2 m the model results also showed that the gwls are largely influenced by the natural recharge through precipitation in the study area these findings may help decision makers and stakeholders for devising sustainable groundwater management strategies in coastal area keywords feflow model groundwater recharge groundwater levels climate change 1 introduction groundwater is the primary source of fresh water for agricultural industrial and domestic purposes global climate change has become an increasingly emerging issue influencing water quantity and quality around the world according to the projections from the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc global warming and alterations in frequency and amount of precipitation are being changed considerably from year 2000 2100 le treut et al 2007 mearns et al 2007 these changes are expected to affect the hydrological cycle altering surface water levels and groundwater recharge to aquifers with various other associated impacts on natural ecosystems and human activities changes in surface hydrologic cycle components affected by climate change consist of evapotranspiration patterns surface runoff and stream flow bates et al 2008 such changes to surface components of the global hydrologic cycle will likely cause changes in the subsurface hydrologic cycle within the soil vadose zone and aquifers of the world van dijck et al 2006 precipitation and temperature are the two important factors when considering climate change because they directly affect groundwater recharge rates and mechanisms green et al 2011 ghazavi et al 2019 neukum and azzam 2012 batalha et al 2018 kundzewicz et al 2007 aguilera and murillo 2009 however the effects of climate change may also increase decrease or not change groundwater recharge in aquifers during seasonal periods or the whole periods of time ng et al 2010 for example dettinger and earman 2007 concluded that it is unknown whether the overall recharge will increase decrease or stay the same at any scale in the western united states while many studies have shown a predicted decrease in recharge rates under future climate neukum and azzam 2012 shrestha et al 2016 ghazavi et al 2019 other studies have shown an increase in recharge rates jyrkama and sykes 2007 woldeamlak et al 2007 indicated that small changes in precipitation may lead to large changes in recharge in some semiarid and regions sandstrom 1995 showed that a 15 reduction in precipitation with no change in temperature resulted in a 40 50 reduction in recharge in coastal areas groundwater resources are not only influenced by climate change but also salt intrusion from sea water level that could lead to a loss in fresh groundwater resources this phenomena of salt water intrusion as a threat to fresh groundwater resources has been studied since recent years voss and souza 1987 ferguson et al 2012 lemieux et al 2015 several approaches have been used to assess the potential impact of climate change on groundwater systems based on the assessment of change in groundwater recharge mutual interaction between surface water and groundwater and gwls among these approaches numerical models is often used as an effective tool to predict groundwater behaviour under various climate change scenarios hosseinizadeh et al 2019 zamanirad et al 2018 lemieux et al 2015 shrestha et al 2016 el kadi et al 2014 oude et al 2010 webb et al 2011 chang et al 2011 for instance hosseinizadeh et al 2019 used modflow model mcdonald et al 1988 to investigate the effects of climate change on groundwater system of the dezful plain in iran under 15 general circulation models in a semi arid region from 2020 to 2044 their results highlighted that climate change can have a significant effect on groundwater resources in the region in this study the feflow diersch 1979 model was used to investigate the effects of climate change on groundwater flow under rcp8 5 scenario feflow is a numerical model which is one of the powerful tools for assessing the quantity and quality of groundwater the advantage of the finite element approach is the flexible meshing allowing for complex geological settings and fits hydrogeological features such as fault lines or rivers as well as tunnels and wells to date the feflow model has been widely used to predict groundwater systems over different hydrogeological regions vrzel et al 2019 pham et al 2019 hu et al 2020 zheng et al 2018 kupfersberger et al 2017 for example vrzel et al 2019 have assessed the sensitivity of groundwater surface water interactions to climate change in an alluvial aquifer located in the ljubljansko polje slovenia they indicated that there will be higher levels of local precipitation during 2036 2065 the projected river discharge will be larger in the future compared to 2000 2014 and it is unlikely that the ljubljansko polje will suffer from water scarcity thivai area and its vicinity a coastal area situated in the southeast of vietnam was chosen as a study area for several reasons a some previous studies focused only on analysing current status of groundwater resources based on short term and discontinuous measurement of monthly gwls in dongnai river basin covering this study area le v h 2008 dang d p 2008 baye e 2011 b the intense socio economical activities c this area is already being threatened by a relative high seawater level monre 2012 therefore protection and sustainable management of the groundwater resources responding to climate change in this area is virtual necessary aiming at enhancing the effectiveness of groundwater use for the current and future time the aim of this study are to i assess the potential effect of climate change on seasonal variation of groundwater recharge and groundwater levels using a coupled panta rhei feflow model for complex porous aquifers of the thivai area and ii evaluate the mutual interaction between surface water and groundwater in this study area 2 materials and methods 2 1 study are the study area covering approximately 500 km2 is located in the dongnai ba ria vung tau province and ho chi minh city fig 1 the thivai river has a length of 37 km from the baky weir to the sea and its water level is influenced by semi diurnal tidal regime the area is affected by tropical monsoon climate with a characteristic rainy season from may to october and dry season from november to april the mean annual rainfall is 1800 mm whereof 80 fall in rainy season the mean temperature of the study area is about 28 c land use in this area is mainly industrial and agricultural land the industrial zones are located along the thivai river occupying about 10 of the total study area the agricultural land distributed all over the thivai catchment includes permanent crops 42 rice 5 annual plants 6 7 and mangrove forest 7 the other land 29 3 is used for residential areas and public constructions the soil in the study area are dominated by acidic soil type arenic acrisoil 23 4 ferric acrisoil 9 4 gleyic acrisol 8 3 and plintic acrisol 8 1 other important soil types are rhodic ferrasols 14 7 and thionic fluvisols 10 9 2 2 geology in this area the sedimentation regime and the sea level transgressions and regressions have caused large variations in aquifers consisting of holocene qh upper pleistocene qp3 lower and middle pleistocene qp2 3 and pliocen n2 2 fig 2 the qh aquifer occurs at the surface of almost the whole coastline area and consists of clayed silt fine sand and organic matters the boreholes installed in this aquifer mainly shallow boreholes with the depths from several meters to 16 m the qp3 is distributed widely throughout the whole area this aquifer can be divided into two parts the top part is an aquitard layer consisting of silt clay or silt clay the lower part is an aquifer including fine to coarse sand having a thickness from 2 to 17 m similar to the qp3 the qp2 3 can be divided into two parts the top part is an aquitard layer consisting of clay or silty clay the lower part is a confined aquifer consisting of fine to coarse sand having the average thickness from 4 to 15 m the lowest aquifer is n2 2 a confined aquifer consisting of fine to coarse sand having the average thickness from 2 to 34 m 2 3 groundwater level measurement based on the available monitoring wells being managed by the department of natural resources of ba ria vung tau province donre we utilized 11 wells for measurement of groundwater levels within the study area these monitoring wells have been drilled into different aquifers including qh qp3 qp2 3 and n2 2 aquifer table 1 the monitoring campaigns of the groundwater levels were carried out from april 2013 to april 2014 by the institute for water management gmbh braunschweig germany to measure groundwater levels a continuous monitoring system with 11 automatic water level measuring devices were installed in march 2013 in observation wells all over the study area measurements are made in a 15 min intervals for all monitoring wells the measured data have been downloaded every 2 months and were then analysed and processed to eliminate the error data during the monitoring periods the amplitude variation and magnitude of the groundwater levels at different monitoring wells are presented in fig 5 and fig 7 2 4 methodology 2 4 1 climate change scenario the assessment of the likely impact of climate change on groundwater systems is based on the future projection of climate change at the basin scale using clime models which come in different forms ranging from simple climate model to comprehensive three dimensional general circulation model or global climate models gcms gcms are the most sophisticated tools available for prediction of the current global climate and future climate scenario projections their formulation usually takes into account the behaviour and interaction of flow systems in the biosphere hydrosphere cryosphere atmosphere and geosphere in the climate system because gcms do not accurately predict climatic variables such as precipitation and temperature at local scale downscaling method will addresses the disparity between coarse spatial scales of gcms and observations from local meteorological stations wilby and wigley 1997 hewitson and crane 2006 downscaling techniques are grouped into two main types a dynamic climate modelling which involves nesting a higher resolution regional climate model rcm within a coarser resolution gcms and b empirical statistical downscaling which combines existing and past empirical knowledge to address the disparity between coarse spatial scales of gcms and point meteorological observations within the framework of the joint research project environmental and water protection technologies of coastal zones in vietnam ewatec coast future climate scenario is provided by the institute for meteorology and climate research karlsruhe institute of technology karlsruhe germany subproject 2 time periods were defined for a historical period from 1986 to 2005 and a future period from 2046 to 2065 schubert et al 2017 for these periods subproject 2 provided simulated meteorological time series boundary conditions for various meteorological parameters from the hcpv high resolution climate projections for vietnam project the basis is the emission scenario rcp8 5 which is included as a boundary condition in the global climate models in the hcpv project temperature and precipitation fields of the regional climate model ccam conformal cubic atmospheric model were used there were six implementations of ccam each for 1986 2005 and 2046 2065 which were driven by six different global circulation models meteorological time series were in the form of raster data with a spatial resolution of 10 10 km2 and a temporal resolution of 3 h provided in order to generate a consistent dataset a bias correction of the simulated meteorological time series based on the historical measured meteorological station data was carried out as part of the data preparation by subproject 2 a detailed description of the bias correction method was described by schubert et al 2017 results from their study indicated that on the basis of the rcp8 5 scenario a temperature increase of up to 2 c is projected for the period 2046 2065 and precipitation is projected to decrease in the north of thivai area furthermore it was found that extreme rates of precipitation amounts do not increase in this scenario but rather their annual variation 2 4 2 description of numerical models a coupled panta rhei feflow model was developed to assess the likely impact of future climate change on groundwater system of the study area panta rhei model simulates the hydrological processes under the different climate conditions while feflow model simulates the groundwater flow system of the study area the simulation models were performed for the historical 1986 2005 present 2013 2014 and future 2046 2065 period 2 4 2 1 hydrological modelling the panta rhei model has been developed by the department of hydrology water management and water protection leichtweiss institute for hydraulic engineering and water resources university of braunschweig in corporation with the institut für wassermanagement ifw gmbh braunschweig germany lwi hywag and ifw 2012 it is a deterministic semi distributed physically based hydrological model for long term or single event simulations it has been successfully employed for scientific questions hölscher et al 2012 and in numerous national and international projects meon et al 2014 wurpts et al 2014 furthermore panta rhei is applied in the operational flood forecast of the federal state lower saxony germany meyer et al 2013 the temporal discretisation is adaptive and in many applications an hourly time step is used the spatial differentiation is divided into three levels hydrologic response units hrus subcatchments and gauged catchments a modified penman monteith method penman 1948 monteith 1965 is used to estimate the evapotranspiration snow accumulation and melting as snow water equivalent is calculated by energy balance approaches förster et al 2014 soil types were parameterised by texture information which are derived from soil maps boess et al 2004 kreye and meon 2016 panta rhei provides a physically based soil model kreye et al 2010 2012 kreye 2015 the soil model dyvesom dynamic vegetation soil model accounts for root growths and vegetational feedback on soil properties by using the growing season index jolly et al 2005 this parameterisation was successfully validated by comparing its course of year with phenological observation data of the german weather service and satellite based measurements in particular the normalised differenced vegetation index ndvi see förster et al 2012 simulated variables of dyvesom like soil water content or groundwater recharge were successfully validated by different products of satellite based soil water measurements and by groundwater level measurements details of the parameterisation of dyvesom are given in kreye and meon 2016 the calculation of runoff concentration is based on four linear storages with individual storage constants surface runoff fast and slow interflow and base flow at the hru level the processes of runoff formation are calculated these include snow accumulation and melting evapotranspiration interception infiltration percolation and groundwater recharge the standard method in panta rhei for describing the processes of runoff formation based on the modification of the scs curve number method usda soil conservation service 1972 which was developed to simulate surface runoff from daily rainfall events in the curve number method the curve number varies non linearly with the moisture content of the soil recharge enters the aquifers is calculated based on darcy s law recharge in an aquifer system can be calculated if both the head gradients and hydraulic conductivities are known darcy s law is used to calculated recharge entering aquifers according to the following equation 1 q k θ d h d z k θ d d z h z k θ d h d z 1 where q is specific recharge rate m a k θ is unsaturated hydraulic conductivity m s h is the total head m h is the metric potential head m and z is the horizontal distance between the two points where hydraulic head is measured m and θ is water content at present the model is used for a wide range of tasks including water balance simulation and optimization of reservoir cascade operation for climate change impact studies meon and gocht 2012 groundwater recharge schöniger et al 2019a b for this study we focused on analysis of the seasonal groundwater recharge variation for different simulation periods using panta rhei model which were used as a boundary condition to the feflow model 2 4 2 2 groundwater modelling feflow version 6 1 was developed to simulate groundwater flow mass transport and heat transfer in porous media and fractured media the model uses finite element analysis to solve the groundwater flow equation of both saturated and unsaturated conditions as well as mass and heat transport in this model the mesh consists of a network of nodes that form the vertices of triangular elements in multiple layered models a number of slices with identical node locations are stacked onto one another the feflow model is composed of three parts consisting of 1 the designation of finite element mesh 2 3d designation of slices and layers and 3 problem editor to specify the parameters needed for simulation 2 4 2 2 1 model mesh generation and 3d geometry the mesh developed with the feflow package was generated using the automatic triangle option this feature offers the ability to define the local variation of mesh density by allowing for the refinement of the mesh around specified point and line features an initial mesh density of 3050 elements was used in the generate automatically option to generate the mesh the regional mesh was then refined in the pumping area using the mesh geometry editor to consider the highly varying hydrological properties of these areas the resultant mesh used in the modelling is presented in fig 3 and comprises 3598 elements and 1888 nodes based on the available data of the hydrogeological cross sections and stratigraphy the model have been developed as three dimensions and comprise 08 slices and 07 layers fig 3 layer numbers of 1 3 5 and 7 represent the aquifer with high hydraulic conductivity the rest of layers including 2 4 and 6 are aquitard layers which the vertical hydraulic conductivity is from low to very low the elevations for the first layer slice 1 in the area model was developed using the stratigraphic information from available drilling information and digital elevation model dem the elevations were applied to the model using the kriging data regionalisation 2 4 2 2 2 boundaries of the model and their conditions to represent the system relationship with the surrounding area a set of appropriate boundary conditions bc are applied to the model to define how the site specific model interacts with entire flow system the western boundary representing the thivai river was assigned as river boundary the conceptual model assumes that the dominant mechanism for discharge of groundwater from the system is through the river bed and via spring flow to the rivers and that the river and groundwater are in dynamic connection based on this assumption the discharge to the rivers has been implemented using the transfer bc diersch 2008 time series of the thivai river s water levels were assigned in individual note of the model fig 3 the southern border of the model domain is contiguous to the coastline therefore the data of tidal levels were used as constant hydraulic head bc dirichlet type this bc specifies a time varying value for the primary variable at a node i e hydraulic head for flow the tidal data were recorded automatically with 10 min intervals and assigned in eight slices of the model domain fig 3 pumping bores for industrial domestic and agricultural use were implemented using well bcs the well bc describes the injection or withdrawal of water at a single node in m3 d 1 pumping rates were applied as a variable pumping rate using power functions to define the transient pumping schedule for each bore in total there are 21 wells within the model domain which extract groundwater from 413 to 51575 m3 d 1 le v h 2008 however pumping duration and pumping rate have not been recorded so far therefore the pumping rate ranging from 2000 to 2500 m3 d 1 was assumed as input data for wells bcs in this study fig 3 groundwater recharge derived from panta rhei model at the subbasin levels was assigned to the corresponding polygon of the first layer of the model domain the values of groundwater recharge vary in time and space and are dependent upon the changes in climate data topography land use and soil properties this is consistent with the real condition and also increase in the accuracy of simulation results 2 4 2 2 3 groundwater model calibration and validation calibration is a process by which parameters are adjusted until model predictions fit observations so that the model can be accepted as a good representation of the physical system of interest for this study the groundwater levels of 11 observation wells were used as initial condition for executing steady state simulation which was carried out to describe three dimensional flow field over the entire model domain the feflow model was then calibrated to transient state from april 2013 april 2014 due to the availability of the input data and observed groundwater levels based on the distribution of the monitoring wells within the study area the well named nb1a vt2a nb2a nb3b vt6 and vt7a were chosen for the model calibration period and the wells including nb1b nb4 vt4 qt7a and dn30 were chosen for the model validation period fig 1 during the model calibration main parameters controlling the dynamics of groundwater flow system were adjusted and assigned at different zones of each layer these parameters include hydraulic conductivity drain fillable porosity specific storage transfer rates and the pumping rate of wells due to the lack of investigated hydrogeological data these values were derived from mekong delta project uppenberg et al 1997 the values of hydraulic conductivity drainage porosity storage coefficient and in out transfer rate assigned to the model ranged from 8 to 41 m d 1 0 001 0 02 0 00001 0 0001 and 200 700 d 1 respectively to assess the deviation between observed and simulated results some statistical parameters consisting of mean absolute error mae and root mean square rms willmott 1982 were used in this study 3 results in the following sections the groundwater behaviour and its effects by climate change in a coastal area are presented the variation of climate data was also analysed for the past present and future period 3 1 spatial distribution of current recharge to the study area current groundwater recharge was estimated at the subbasin levels using the panta rhei model for the current climatic conditions 2013 2014 the spatial distribution of the average annual recharge at different subbasins is showed in fig 4 the results showed that the mean annual recharge rate ranges from zero to a maximum of about 1066 mm y 1 the mean annual recharge was estimated to be 550 mm y 1 which is about 29 of the annual precipitation the results also indicated that recharge rate is strongly influenced by the combination of topography and soil textures at different subbasins small recharge rate values occurs in the north western areas due to high slope and fined texture soils while high recharge rate was concentrated in the areas located along the thivai river and coastline where sandy soils and low slopes are the main factors resulting in an increase in percolation of these areas in addition recharge varies substantially depending upon the geological environment kotchoni et al 2019 and differences in recharge between sites can be largely explained by variability in hydrogeological conditions including various depths to the potentiometric surface thomas et al 2016 3 2 groundwater model calibration and validation 3 2 1 groundwater model calibration in order to assess the development of the groundwater table with time the computed hydraulic heads have been compared to the measurements at all 06 monitoring points over the calibration period from april 2013 april 2014 fig 5 the results showed reasonable agreement between simulated and measured gwls groundwater table rises during the rainy season and gradually drop until the end of the dry season in general the highest groundwater levels are taken place in the beginning of october while the lowest groundwater levels can be found at the end of april fig 5 looking the variation of the well nb2a nb3b and vt6 the heads are slightly underestimated during the period from july august 2013 this is probably due to the local storm events since storm events occurred with high local variation the amount of rainfall infiltration during the storm is not reflected by the model overall the model simulated relatively well for both the timing and magnitude of the groundwater levels this is confirmed by the statistical values of mae and rms ranged from 0 1 to 0 57 and from 0 15 to 0 65 respectively the spatial distribution of groundwater depth at the end of april 30 2014 is shown in fig 6 the elevations of groundwater table were represented by different colors that the darker colour suggests lower groundwater elevations within the domain the simulated results showed that the higher elevations of groundwater table concentrate in the north eastern boundary of the model while lower elevations occur in the western and the southern boundary in addition contour lines of groundwater table elevations ranged from 0 to 38 5 m indicate that the groundwater table slopes downward to the coastline southern boundary of the model domain in general 3 2 2 groundwater model validation the comparisons of simulated and measured gwls at the points of nb1b nb4 vt4 qt7a and dn30 are given in fig 7 the respective values of mae and rms ranged from 0 2 to 0 83 and from 0 3 to 0 81 reveal that the feflow model performed reasonably in simulating groundwater flow in the study area in general considering the variation of gwls at the point dn30 which is close to the thivai river fig 7 the magnitude and amplitude of simulated values are relatively agreement with the measured values in addition the fluctuation of the gwls is strongly influenced by the water levels of the thivai river a similar behaviour could be found in the case of vt7a where groundwater variation is significantly impacted by sea water levels fig 5 looking the variation of gwls at all of the monitoring points except the points of dn30 and vt7a it could be realized that the water level variation of the thivai river are not influenced groundwater behavior in different aquifers in general figs 5 and 7 in other words there is no or little interaction between surface water and groundwater in these regions within the study area the main source of water that recharges to groundwater in the thivai area is attributed to be rainfall 3 3 projected future precipitation and evapotranspiration under rcp8 5 scenario fig 8 compared the simulated average monthly precipitation and evapotranspiration for the historical period and the future period of the study area respectively the projected mean monthly precipitation during long term 2046 2065 fluctuates over the months in rcp8 5 scenario and is slightly lower than that in the historical period especially during the months of september and october the total average annual rainfall in the future and historical period is 1882 1 mm and 1887 5 mm respectively fig 9 rainfall regime in the thivai area has distinct wet may to october and dry november to april seasons seasonal changes in rainfall are projected to be different for dry and wet seasons under rcp8 5 scenario the simulated results showed that the total annual rainfall in the wet season is much higher than that in the dry season fig 9 the respective change in the total mean rainfall in the wet and dry season between the future and the historical period is estimated to be 3 9 and 1 5 fig 11 regarding the projected evapotranspiration under rcp8 5 simulated monthly values in the future period is always higher than those in the historical period the highest evaporation was occurred in the months from may august reaching about 85 mm month 1 fig 8 the difference in evaporation between the future and the historical period is estimated to be about 11 the increase in evaporation in the future is also consistent with the simulation results for the pcr8 5 scenario when the temperature is predicted to increase by about 2 c 3 4 impact of climate change on groundwater availability climate change has resulted alteration in water balance components in the thivai area such as evapotranspiration and precipitation the following sub section discusses how groundwater recharge and gwls are projected to be altered under future climatic conditions 3 4 1 impacts on groundwater recharge the calibrated panta rhei model was used to predict future groundwater recharge for the period 2046 2065 under rcp8 5 scenario the median annual recharge for the pcr 8 5 scenario was projected to decrease by about 5 9 relative to historical value at the study area fig 10 mean total recharge is projected under pcr 8 5 for the wet and dry season are 527 1 mm y 1 and 44 3 mm y 1 respectively fig 10 the simulated results indicated that most of the groundwater recharge takes places during the rainy season accounting for about 95 of the total annual recharge while only 5 results from the dry season change in recharge between historical and future period was projected to be higher in dry season 10 9 than that of wet season 2 6 fig 11 this is due to the intensively increase in evaporation combined with decrease in precipitation in dry season under rcp8 5 scenario in conclusion climate change will result gradual decrease in groundwater recharge in thivai area over the coming decades with more decrease over the dry season this finding is consistent with the study by shrestha et al 2016 that showed a decrease in groundwater recharge in short medium and long terms under rcp8 5 scenario for the mekong delta vietnam 3 4 2 impact on groundwater levels seasonal variation of gwls in different aquifers was simulated for both the historical and future period fig 12 future gwls for the period 2046 2065 were projected using the fully calibrated groundwater model assuming that groundwater abstraction for the future periods would remain same amount as during 2013 2014 future recharge inputs however were changed as estimated by panta rhei the model predicted a general decline in gwls from historical period in all the aquifers under the rcp 8 5 scenario the amplitude of the seasonal variation of gwls decreased with increasing borehole depth from substantial seasonal variation in the holocene qh and upper pleistocen qp3 aquifers fig 12 a b to little or no seasonal variation in the miocene n2 2 aquifer fig 12c similar patterns of seasonal fluctuations between gwls in the qh qp3 and qp2 3 aquifers and future precipitation fig 12 a b c suggest that these aquifers are strongly influenced by percolation during rainstorms the simulated results for future trends of gwls across the thivai area indicated that the gwls in all aquifers showed various magnitudes of decreasing trends from 0 75 to 20 2 m corresponding to 0 05 0 3 m year 1 compared to those of the historical period figs 12 and 13 the decline of the future gwls occurring in the dry season is much higher than that in the wet season for all aquifers especially in the qp3 qp 2 3 and n2 2 aquifers this is attributed to the extraction of groundwater from deep aquifers and high evaporation during the dry season largest decline was predicted in the n2 2 aquifer by about 20 2 m and the least decline of around 1 25 m was projected in the qh aquifer by the 2050s under rcp8 5 scenario fig 13 4 discussion the decreasing magnitude of seasonal variation from shallow to deep groundwater fig 12 suggests that the aquifers act as low pass filters during the transformation of input signals e g recharge or river water levels into output signals e g groundwater water levels the role of aquifers as a low pass filter in the frequency domain has also been reported in other studies e g gasse 2000 duvert et al 2015 regarding shallow aquifers similar patterns of seasonal fluctuations between gwls and precipitation fig 12 suggest that gwls in shallow aquifers across the thivai area are strongly affected by precipitation several studies have been made to investigate the effects on gwls variations due to precipitation jan et al 2007 venetis et al 1971 butterworth et al 1999 ferdowsian et al 2001 for instance butterworth et al 1999 evaluated the influence of rainfall intensity on groundwater level they concluded that larger perturbations in groundwater level may arise from the response of a shallow aquifer to variations in rainfall it was also found that long term trend in seasonal gwls is an apparent indicator for reflecting the effect of cycles in rainfall for deep groundwater low permeable aquicludes appear to limit the recharge to the deeper aquifer miocene aquifer in the study area the low variation of gwls in the miocene aquifer fig 12 d corroborates this finding the potential recharge of the deeper aquifers e g miocene is partly originated from vertical infiltration through upper aquifers and mainly from the lateral flow within the aquifers from upstream areas the simulated results indicated that deep aquifers have a significant reduction in gwls especially during the dry season the lesser changes in gwls in the shallow aquifer e g holocene however are a result of the interplay between the good connectivity to recharge from precipitation and the comparatively low abstraction from this shallow aquifer another reason for this is that the use of shallow groundwater as a source of drinking water or for irrigation in coastal areas is limited due to saline intrusion smajgl et al 2015 our research suggests that the current groundwater extraction exceeded the aquifer recharge capacities in the study area due to the need for socio economic and industrial development groundwater extraction is forecasted to continue increasing in the future danh and khai 2015 therefore more severe declines in gwls will accelerate saline intrusion into aquifers pollute groundwater and thus threaten sustainable development across the region minderhoud et al 2017 in this study we used the seasonal recharge and gwls as indicators for assessment of groundwater storage variability of the thivai area the simulated results showed a moderate to good accordance with the measurements however the performance of the feflow model has general limitation due to the following reasons i the knowledge of the aquifer system is still limited information regarding the stratigraphy and lithology is not adequate especially for the southern model domain ii hydrogeological property information about the vertical and horzonal variations of hydraulic conductivity drain porosity specific storage and in out transfer rate between the thivai river s bed and aquifers are missing therefore estimations of these parameters were mainly based on the relevant documents obtained from other catchments with similar conditions regarding groundwater abstration rate and volume the data was estimated based on the surveys of industrial zones and residential areas therefore rough value estimation was assumed to the model these limitations could result in uncertainty in the modeled results in addition an assumption of land use the number of groundwater wells volume of groundwater abstration used as input data for the models are remained constant for the past present and future period this assumtion is not unrealistic since i the industrial and agricultural land and groundwater extraction will be significantly changed due to the impact of the increase in manufacturing sectors in the future and ii the increase in groundwater well density these assumptions do not reflect the actual changes in groundwater head in the future period using precipitation and temperature projected from the regional climate model ccam resulted in uncertainty in simulated results of groundwater recharge and gwls due to several uncertainties as described above predicting the effects of the potential climate change on groundwater system in the thivai area should be considered as trends and order of magnitudes rather than exact predictions 5 conclusions this paper discusses how the climate changes alter the spatial and temporal dynamics of the groundwater system of coastal aquifers the variations of groundwater behavior in the thivai river catchment and its vicinity were analysed and assessed for the past 1986 2005 current 2013 2014 and future 2046 2065 period using the coupling of the hydrological panta rhei model with groundwater feflow model input data including climate data land use soil properties topography stratigraphy and hydrogeological properties were taken into acoint into the model setup the calibration and validation of groundwater model is based on the observation points with high resolution of groundwater data for a one year period from april 2013 april 2014 during the calibration the domain has been separated in zones with different aquifer s properties such as hydraulic conductivity porosity specific storage in gerneral feflow was performed sucessfully in simulating groundwater flow in complex porous aquifers the simulated results showed that the average annual recharge was estimated to be about 29 of the annual precipitation recharge amounts are projected under rcp8 5 to decrease by 2 6 and 10 9 in the wet and dry seasons compared to the historical period 1986 2005 the results also indicated that in general gwls in this study area are mostly affected by recharge through rainfall the interaction between surface water and groundwater only occurs in some regions close to the thivai river and coastline the future gwls in the 2050s were projected to decrease significantly in deep aquifers ranging from 2 25 m to 20 2 m in our ongoing research further investigations of the aquifer properties and pumping rate will be updated the combination of future climate change land use change and groundwater exploitation scenarios should be taken into account in the study to more fully assess their impacts on groundwater system of the
