19575,the presence of chemical pollutants in sources of drinking water is a key environmental problem threatening public health efficient removal of pollutants in drinking water treatment plants dwtps is needed as well as methods for assessment of the total impact of all present chemicals on water quality in the present study we have analyzed the bioactivity of water samples from source to tap including effects of various water treatments in a dwtp using a battery of cell based bioassays covering health relevant endpoints reporter gene assays were used to analyze receptor activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr estrogen receptor er androgen receptor ar peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha pparα and induction of oxidative stress by the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 nrf2 dna damage was determined by comet assay grab water samples were concentrated by hlb or env solid phase extraction and the water samples assayed at a relative enrichment factor of 50 the enrichment procedure did not induce any bioactivity no bioactivity was detected in milli q water or drinking water control samples induction of ahr er and nrf2 activities was revealed in source to tap water samples no cytotoxicity pparα or ar antagonist activity or dna damage were observed in any of the water samples a low ar agonist activity was detected in a few samples of surface water but not in the samples from the dwtp the treatment steps at the dwtp coagulation granulated activated carbon filtration uv disinfection and nh2cl dosing had little or no effect on the ahr nrf2 and er bioactivity however nanofiltration and passage through the distribution network drastically decreased ahr activity while the effect on nrf2 activity was more modest and no apparent effect was observed on er activity the present results suggest that bioassays are useful tools for evaluation of the efficiency of different treatment steps in dwtps in reducing toxic activities bioassays of ahr and nrf2 are useful for screening of effects of a broad range of chemicals in drinking water and er activity can be monitored with a high sensitivity keywords bioassay effect based assessment drinking water treatment estrogen receptor aryl hydrocarbon receptor nrf2 1 introduction contamination of drinking water with micropollutants is an environmental issue of great concern for human health van leeuwen 2000 schwarzenbach et al 2006 wee and aris 2017 due to the high daily consumption of drinking water 2 2 5 l in adults efsa 2010 the occurrence of a vast number of chemicals even at low concentrations may constitute a health risk target chemical analysis is used to screen for the presence of well known and emerging micropollutants in drinking water however such data do not consider unknown chemicals or give information on potential toxicity from the mixture of chemicals present in water the need of methods for assessment of the total impact by all chemicals on water quality has been recognized and effect based analysis using in vitro bioassays have been developed as powerful tools for water quality assessments murk et al 2002 bain et al 2014 escher et al 2014 di paolo et al 2016 välitalo et al 2016 2017 van der oost et al 2017a 2017b bioassays have been applied successfully to screen bioactivity of surface water and wastewater murk et al 2002 van der linden et al 2008 bain et al 2014 escher et al 2014 välitalo et al 2016 2017 recycled water leusch et al 2014 jia et al 2015 mehinto et al 2015 but only in a few cases to drinking water brand et al 2013 escher et al 2014 conley et al 2017 furthermore a reduced transcriptome approach has been applied to assess untargeted biological activity of water samples in human cells xia et al 2017 drinking water treatment plants dwtps should be designed to remove contaminants from water before they enter the distribution system however data on the fate of micropollutants in dwtp are limited and little is known about the efficiency of different treatments steps to remove micropollutants in drinking water glassmeyer et al 2017 by using cell based bioassays the efficiency to remove or reduce toxic activity by different steps in the dwtp can be assessed when using bioanalytical tools for drinking water a high enrichment of the water samples and a broad extraction of chemicals are needed solid phase extraction spe with sorbent materials extracting a wide range of micropollutants from large volumes of water is generally used to concentrate the water and enable detection of micropollutants and bioactivities for the in vitro bioassays it is important to select a set of relevant biological endpoints covering toxic activities of a broad range of chemicals escher et al 2014 tested ten different water samples in 103 in vitro assays covering induction of xenobiotic metabolism reactive and specific modes of action adaptive stress response pathways and system responses escher et al 2014 the most responsive health relevant endpoints were related to xenobiotic metabolism measured by effects on aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and pregnane x receptor pxr hormone mediated modes of action measured by effects on estrogen receptor er androgen receptor ar glucocorticoid receptor gr and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ppar genotoxicity measured by a battery of tests for example comet assay and oxidative stress measured by induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 nrf2 the aim of the present study was to monitor the bioactivity of water samples from source to tap including effects on bioactivity of various treatment steps in the dwtp in addition the effects of nanofiltration was tested in a pilot plant water samples were enriched by two different spe methods and tested by in vitro bioassays for cytotoxicity ahr pparα er and ar activity for oxidative stress response by nrf2 activity and for genotoxicity by comet assay 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection grab samples of water were collected in march 2015 at 10 sampling sites from the source in fyris river uppsala sweden to taps after the görväln dwtp which is serving a population of 600 000 the sampling sites were 1 upstream and 2 downstream of the waste water treatment plant wwtp kungsängsverket uppsala sweden 172 000 population equivalents which releases 20 mm3 per year of treated waste water into fyris river 3 in the ekoln basin of lake mälaren at 7 km from the wwtp where a dilution effect is expected due to the higher volume of the lake 4 in the görväln basin at another part of lake mälaren which is used as the raw water source of the görväln dwtp 5 at the intake of görväln dwtp at a depth of 22 m 6 after coagulation treatment consisting of al2 so4 3 coagulation

dosing 0 20 mg free chlorine l and from two taps in the water supply network 9 consumer tap i at 3 km from the dwtp and 10 consumer tap ii at 50 km from the dwtp physicochemical parameters were determined on the day of sampling in water from the intake and the outlet of the dwtp and for some parameters also after coagulation treatment the results are shown in supplementary information si table s1 water samples were also collected from a nanofiltration pilot plant nfpp within the dwtp using sand filtrated water i e after coagulation treatment from the dwtp which then passed the nanofiltration membrane hfw 1000 pentair with a molecular weight cut off of 1000 daltons and a pilot scale gac filter samples were collected at two occasions when the gac filter had been in operation for 5 months nfpp old gac and at one week after replacing the gac filter nfpp new gac the collected samples are described in table 1 control water samples included non concentrated and concentrated milli q and drinking water dw from the laboratory milli q non conc milli q conc dw non conc and dw conc as well as a spiked milli q water milli q spiked spiking was performed before concentration of the samples with a mixture of 242 chemicals commonly occurring as micropollutants in surface water and including pesticides drug and food related chemicals personal care products and perfluoroalkyl substances si table s2 each chemical at a concentration of 20 ng l water samples were collected in 12 l stainless steel containers sharpsville and were stored at 4 c until extraction which was conducted no later than one week after collection 2 2 sample preparation extraction procedures for each water sample except milli q and dw non conc were performed with two different solid phase extraction spe cartridges oasis hlb 20 cc 1 g waters usa and bond elut env 6 ml 1000 mg agilent usa the water samples were subdivided into two 5 l samples one to be extracted by hlb and one by env which were filtered through glass fiber filters whatman gf f 0 7 μm 142 mm into 5 l glass bottles spe cartridges were pre conditioned with 30 ml methanol and 20 ml milli q water water samples were added by vacuum manifold through a small tube at a speed of 1 drop sec 1 each sample was eluted three times with 10 ml methanol into glass tubes each eluate were reduced to less than 1 5 ml by an n evap 112 nitrogen evaporator system organomation associates inc the three eluates were pooled and reduced to approximately 0 2 ml and transferred to an lc ms glass vial after which samples were diluted with ethanol to 1 0 ml the water samples were thus enriched by a factor 5000 the spiking mixture milli q spiked was added to milli q water and extracted by spe in the same way as the grab water samples the concentrated water samples were stored at 20 c until analysis 2 3 bioassays the water samples and vehicle control were tested for ahr nrf2 pparα er activities and ar agonist and antagonist activities in reporter gene assays for cytotoxicity by cell viability assays mts and atp assay and for genotoxicity by comet assay the human hepatocellular carcinoma hepg2 cell line was used for the nrf2 ahr and pparα reporter gene assays and for the comet assay lundqvist et al 2016 hepg2 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of a dna element responsive to free nrf2 ligand activated ahr or ligand activated pparα respectively two stably transfected cell lines were used for the er and ar reporter gene assays the human breast carcinoma cell line vm7luc4e2 and the chinese hamster ovary cell line ar ecoscreen respectively er and ar activities were analyzed according to oecd guidelines oecd 2012 oecd 2016 cytotoxicity was tested in all cell lines a detailed description of the bioanalytical methods is provided in supplementary information si 2 when incubated with the cells the water samples enriched and non concentrated were diluted 100 fold with cell medium to get a final concentration of 1 ethanol and a relative enrichment factor ref of 50 for the enriched samples and 0 01 for the non concentrated samples the enrichment and dilution of the samples constitute the ref calculated as described by escher et al 2014 r e f e n r i c h m e n t f a c t o r s p e d i l u t i o n f a c t o r b i o a s s a y the

diluted as vehicle control 1 ethanol was used for normalization of bioactivities selected water samples were tested for ahr activity in dilutions to investigate concentration response relationships at refs ranging from 0 8 to 50 positive controls were analyzed in parallel with the water samples 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzodioxin tcdd for ahr wy14643 for pparα sulforaphane sfn for nrf2 17β estradiol e2 for er dihydrotestosterone dht for ar agonist activity and hydroxyflutamide ohf for ar antagonist activity the positive controls were analyzed in 5 12 concentrations to obtain a standard curve in the comet assay 2 mm catechol was used as a positive control 2 4 data evaluation bioactivities of water samples and positive controls were normalized to plate vehicle controls set to 1 standard curves for positive controls were obtained by fitting data x values were log transformed to a four parameter sigmoidal curve fit with the bottom and top limit constrained to 1 and the maximum observed response of the positive control respectively the four parameter curve fit follows the equation y bottom top bottom 1 10ˆ logec50 x hill slope from the four parameter curve fit ec50 and hill slope values were derived in graphpad prism results from the comet assay were expressed as percentage of dna in the tail calculated from the average median tail intensities ti and used as an indicator of dna damage results on ahr activities in diluted water samples and results from the comet assay were analyzed by kruskal wallis followed by dunn s post hoc test the significance level was set at p 0 05 data on ahr activity in diluted water samples were normalized to the maximum observed response of tcdd linear regression was performed on the concentration response data and the estimated slope and y axis intercept from the regression were used to determine ec5 and ec10 values as previously described by escher et al 2014 statistical analysis and graphical presentation was performed using graphpad prism 5 02 3 results and discussion 3 1 cut off values and control samples standard curves for positive controls standard curves for positive controls are shown in si fig 2 and the estimated ec50 and hill slope values are presented in table 2 setting cut off values for bioactivity cut off levels for classification of samples as positive in the bioassays were based on the limit of detection lod calculated for ahr nrf2 pparα er and ar agonist activity as 1 plus 3 times the standard deviation sd of the normalized vehicle control values from all cell plates within the experiment table 2 for ar antagonist activity the lod was calculated as 1 minus 3 times the sd for er and ar activities lod based cut offs were approximately equivalent to the cut offs suggested in the oecd guidelines oecd 2012 2016 where cut off for the er activity is defined as 20 of e2 maximum response for the ar agonist activity as 10 of dht maximum response and for ar antagonist activity as 30 reduction of the 500 pm dht control table 2 in assays for which no guideline exists and if the lod was below 1 5 the cut off was set to 1 5 and if the lod was between 1 5 and 2 the cut off was set at 2 the cut off values for er ar agonist and ar antagonist activities were set to 1 5 1 5 and 0 7 respectively which were above the lods and close to the cut offs suggested in the oecd guidelines the cut off for cytotoxicity was set at 80 of cell viability compared to the vehicle control control water samples no bioactivity was detected in the non spiked control water samples there were no differences in bioactivity between non concentrated and concentrated milli q and dw samples figs 1 and 2 demonstrating that the procedure for sample enrichment did not induce any bioactivity in the water samples the milli q spiked sample did not induce ahr nrf2 pparα or er activity whereas increased responses were observed in both the ar agonist and antagonist activity assays fig 2 the increased activity in the ar assay may be explained by the presence of drugs with androgenic activity in the spiking mixture e g nandrolone si table s2 furthermore the ar reporter assay can also be activated by the glucocorticoid receptor gr oecd 2016 and the increased activity in the milli q spiked sample could be induced by synthetic glucocorticoids in the spiking mixture e g budesonide by inhibiting the ar with ohf we demonstrated that the activation of ar by the milli q spiked sample was partly decreased suggesting that the ar activation was mediated through both ar and gr pathways si fig s5 3 2 bioactivity in source to tap and nanofiltration pilot plant samples cell viability the cell viability was not affected below the threshold of 80 compared to the vehicle control in any of the water samples at ref 50 in any of the cell lines si fig s1 thus the concentrated water samples were considered as non cytotoxic ahr activity ahr activity was increased 2 3 fold compared to vehicle control in the wwtp upstream sample and further increased in the wwtp downstream samples to 4 6 fold fig 1 the ahr activity remained at the same level in the samples from the two lake basins and after the various treatment steps in the dwtp however ahr activity was drastically decreased to levels at or below the cut off in the water samples from consumer taps as well as in the water samples from nfpp initially by the nanofiltration membrane and then further reduced by the old gac filter to control level concentration response of ahr activity most of the samples showed increased ahr activity to estimate the 5 and 10 effect concentrations ec5 and ec10 three env extracted samples exhibiting high and borderline activity in the ahr reporter gene assay were selected for further activity analysis and the samples were tested in serial dilutions in the ahr reporter gene assay statistically significant increased activity was demonstrated at ref 25 for wwtp downstream ref 12 5 for dwtp outlet and at ref 50 for nfpp nanofiltration permeate si fig s3 fold change values for the water samples were normalized to the maximum response of the positive control tcdd and modelled to a linear regression model table 3 si fig s3 based on slopes and y axis intercept ec5 and ec10 were calculated and expressed as ref table 3 the ec5 and ec10 refs ranged from 23 to 38 and from 46 to 74 respectively demonstrating a low ahr activity compared with results from other studies thus escher et al 2014 determined ahr activity in drinking water by caflux bioassay and reported an ec10 ref of 8 6 nrf2 activity in the nrf2 reporter gene assay most samples exhibited activities above the cut off of 1 5 fold fig 1 the response ranged from approximately 1 5 to 2 5 fold induction similar to ahr there was no effect of the various dwtp treatments on the nrf2 activity apart from the nanofiltration membrane and pilot filter with old gac which slightly reduced the activity however in contrast to ahr activity the nrf2 activity was not consistently reduced in the consumer tap water samples er activity the highest er activity was observed in the wwtp downstream sample which was approximately 2 5 fold higher than the vehicle control fig 2 the er activity decreased in the samples further downstream the wwtp and remained around the cut off value of 1 5 fold in the lake and dwtp samples thus the er activity was not influenced by the different treatments in the dwtp the distribution system or by the nanofiltration membrane ar and pparα activity two samples exhibited borderline ar agonist activity in the env extracts upstream the wwtp and lake ekoln none of the samples showed any pparα or ar antagonist activities figs 1 and 2 comet assay no effects were detected in any of the water samples in the comet assay si fig s4 the positive control 2 mm catechol caused a statistically significant increase in tail intensity 7 7 0 6 compared to the control 2 7 0 2 3 3 effect of extraction method on bioactivity for the enrichment of water samples two types of prepackaged solid phase extraction cartridges were used oasis hlb made of two monomers hydrophilic n vinylpyrrolidone and lipophilic divinylbenzene and bond elut env made of modified styrene divinylbenzene these two spe sorbents were chosen since they are both suitable for polar to semi polar organic pollutants and env is supposed to cover more polar chemicals than hlb no consistent difference in bioactivity was observed due to extraction method either in the control water samples or in the test water samples the pparα activity seemed to be higher in the samples extracted by env although the standard deviation was high and no activities above the cut off level were observed the lack of difference in bioactivity between non concentrated and concentrated control water samples demonstrates that none of the two extraction methods contaminates the samples with anything causing bioactivity thus there was no false positive bioactivity due to the enrichment procedure however false negative results or an underestimation of activities in the bioassays cannot be excluded due to limited recovery of chemicals during the extraction procedure baranowska and kowalski 2012 compared recovery efficiencies for 13 drugs in distilled water and tap water extracted by hlb env and nexus baranowska and kowalski 2012 there was no major difference between hlb and env and the recoveries varied between 80 and 107 for 11 of the drugs similarly our results indicate that the extraction efficiency of bioactivity is similar for hlb and env in our water samples although the activity may have been underestimated by both the extraction methods due to incomplete recovery of chemicals in the extraction procedure 3 4 effects of drinking water treatment there was no removal of bioactivity from the inlet to the outlet in the dwtp thus the coagulation treatment the gac filtration uv disinfection and nh2cl dosing did not decrease the activity of ahr nrf2 or er in contrast the activity of ahr was interestingly decreased in the consumer tap water by the nanofiltration membrane and by the old gac filter nanofiltration is used to treat surface water mainly for removal of natural organic matter and as a microbiological barrier lidén et al 2016 to our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate the efficiency of nanofiltration and the drinking water distribution system to reduce the ahr activity in drinking water the decrease in bioactivity in consumer tap water may be explained by removal of ahr activating contaminants from the water by attachment of the chemicals to the pipe surface material or biofilm szabo and minamyer 2014 or as a result of biotransformation of chemicals by microbial communities inhabiting the biofilm of pipe surface carpenter and helbling 2017 likewise the more efficient removal of ahr activity by the nfpp old gac filter than by the new gac filter may be due to biotransformation of chemicals in the microbial biofilm built up on the old gac particles in contrast to our results macova et al 2011 did not detect any ahr activity above the vehicle control in the inlet or outlet water from a dwtp macova et al 2011 escher et al 2014 reported similar or higher ahr activities in the outlet water treated by coagulation chlorination and chloramination compared to the inlet river water similarly they reported 2 3 fold higher nrf2 activities in outlet compared to inlet drinking water escher et al 2012 they suggested that the increased bioactivity of ahr and nrf2 may be due to formation of chlorinated disinfectant byproducts which was further supported by data from neale et al 2012 who demonstrated induced nrf2 activities after chlorination in a dwtp neale et al 2012 mutagenic compounds may be produced by chlorination or other oxidative treatment of raw water depending on the raw water quality and the degree of chlorination oxidation ceretti et al 2016 potential mutagenicity was tested by ames test umuc and sos chromotest by escher et al 2014 who reported no activity in some of the assays and higher activities in the outlet water than the inlet of a dwtp in other assays žegura et al 2009 detected mutagenic effects by ames test in one of 6 samples of non concentrated tap water žegura et al 2009 inlet and outlet extracts of wastewater from a sewage treatment plant in central india showed statistically significant dna damage by comet assay at concentrations of 0 125 and 0 062 corresponding to refs of 1 25 and 0 62 while no dna damage was detected from drinking water samples with the same refs shrivastava et al 2017 in our study we did not observe any increased activities due to the dwtp treatment of ahr or nrf2 activities or dna damage in the comet assay at the tested ref of 50 the absence of effects in our study may be due to the quality of the raw water and a low degree of chloramination and uv disinfection preventing the formation of oxidative products our results did not demonstrate any apparent effect on er activity from the dwtp treatments in the study by escher et al 2014 er activity in water samples from the outlet of a dwtp had lower or similar activity than from the inlet lower incidence of er activity in treated than source drinking water samples were reported from 25 us dwtps with 3 of the treated and 16 of the source samples showing estrogenic activity conley et al 2017 efficient removal of added estrogens to drinking water was demonstrated at pilot scale by combined treatment with uv and h2o2 while treatment with uv solely only partially removed estrone cédat et al 2016 3 5 bioactivity in drinking water presence of micropollutants all water samples were non cytotoxic at the highest concentration ref 50 and the determinations of toxic activities in the bioassays were performed on samples at that concentration ahr and nrf2 activities were detected in all the samples from surface water and the dwtp ahr activity indicates presence of contaminants which have an impact on the metabolism of chemicals many persistent organic pollutants and drugs have the capacity to activate ahr such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons many drugs pesticides as well as chemicals of natural origin denison and nagy 2003 stejskalova et al 2011 nrf2 activity indicates presence of chemicals of various structures inducing oxidative stress which is a common toxicity pathway for many chemicals kobayashi et al 2009 martin et al 2010 thus the increased ahr and nrf2 activities in the water samples could be due to a variety of different chemicals both of natural and anthropogenic origin the physicochemical characteristics of the water si table s1 were within normal ranges in our study er activity at or above the cut off value was detected in almost all water samples with the highest activity found in the sample downstream the wwtp the er activity in dwtp outlet and consumer tap samples was at the cut off level corresponding to 0 039 ng estradiol equivalents l e2eq l in the grab water sample before extraction it can be suggested that natural estrogens and the synthetic 17α ethinylestradiol are responsible for the main er activity in the water samples due to their much higher potency compared to other estrogenic compounds such as genistein and bisphenol a which may be present in the water gutendorf and westendorf 2001 compared the ed50 values of er activity between 17β estradiol e2 estrone e1 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 genistein and bisphenol a and reported approximate relative potencies of 1 0 01 1 25 0 0001 and 0 00002 respectively gutendorf and westendorf 2001 conley et al 2017 demonstrated that e1 was the main contributor to the estrogenic activity in source water samples from 25 us dwtps they analyzed estrogens in the source water samples by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and reported detectable concentrations of e1 0 13 0 29 ng l in 4 of the 25 samples while concentrations of e2 e3 and ee2 were not detectable the determined e1 levels in three of the source water samples were estimated to account for 65 98 of the estrogenic activity as determined by reporter gene assay no detectable concentrations of estrogens were found in the treated water while three of the samples displayed estrogenic activity ranging from 0 037 to 0 078 ng e2eq l in a study by brand et al 2013 outlet water from two of three dwtp had detectable er activity 0 022 and 0 032 ng e2eq l brand et al 2013 maggioni et al 2013 reported low estrogenic activity in drinking water from 35 italian cities with a maximum activity corresponding to 0 014 ng e2eq l maggioni et al 2013 the spiking mixture of 242 compounds si table s2 added to a milli q sample before sample extraction did not induce any activity except in the ar reporter gene assay suggesting that none of these compounds contributed to the ahr nrf2 and er activities at the added concentrations of 20 ng l these findings are in line with previous investigations in which very little of the observed bioactivity could be explained by a number of target chemicals escher et al 2013 neale et al 2015 identification of chemicals responsible for detected toxic activities in the bioassays is a future challenge which is the objective of effect directed analysis brack et al 2016 2017 busch et al 2016 3 6 bioassays as a screening tool in assessment of drinking water quality there has been a rapid development of bioanalytical tools to monitor water quality so far bioassays have mainly been used for assessment of effects of environmental pollutants in waste water and surface water assessment of drinking water by bioassays is challenging as the concentrations of contaminants are generally low thus sensitive bioassays are needed as well as a high enrichment of the water samples with the used sample enrichment the bioassays were sensitive enough to detect ahr nrf2 and er activities in the drinking water and to assess efficiency of various treatments of drinking water to remove bioactivity apart from the cytotoxicity and comet assay all bioassays used in the present study were reporter gene assays of which ahr nrf2 and pparα activities were analyzed using transiently transfected hepg2 cells and with co transfection of renilla plasmid to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency most other studies using bioassays have been performed in stably transfected cell lines van der linden et al 2008 brand et al 2013 escher et al 2014 jia et al 2015 mehinto et al 2015 conley et al 2017 välitalo et al 2017 as in the present study in the reporter gene assays of er and ar activity one advantage of using transient transfection is that different cell lines can be used for transfection of the plasmids for example to study effects of metabolism and transport proteins all reporter gene assays used in the present study were sensitive and robust which was demonstrated by the consistent results in the standard curves of the positive controls however the pparα reporter gene assay had a low sensitivity due to a large standard deviation which resulted in a high lod of the bioactivity the sensitivity of in vitro bioassays for er activity is higher than in the chemical analysis of estrogens conley et al 2017 detected estrogens by chemical analysis in 5 of 25 source waters from us dwtps and in none of the treated water samples whereas estrogenic activity was detected by a reporter gene assay in t47d kbluc cells in 16 of the source samples and 3 of the treated välitalo et al 2016 reported limits of quantification loqs by chemical analysis lc ms ms for e1 e2 e3 and ee2 of 1 5 4 3 and 10 ng l respectively while in our study the cut off value for er activity corresponded to 0 039 ng e2eq l the selection of bioassays should be based on common toxicity pathways and specific sensitive toxic mechanisms such as disturbance of the endocrine system escher et al 2014 proposed ahr and pxr activities as parameters of induction of xenobiotic metabolism and estrogenic antiandrogenic and glucocorticoid receptor activities as the most relevant and responsive to water samples in concordance with our results no pparα or ar agonist activity were reported in inlet or outlet water of a dwtp in the study by escher et al 2014 4 conclusions activities of ahr nrf2 and er were detected in water samples from source to tap enriched by a factor of 50 in contrast to other studies showing increased activities of ahr and nrf2 in dwtp outlet compared to inlet water our findings suggest that the dwtp treatment steps had little or no effect on the ahr nrf2 and er bioactivity the absence of increased activities in ahr and nrf2 activities in the dwtp in our study may be due to the quality of the raw water and a low degree of chloramination and uv treatment preventing the formation of oxidative products however nanofiltration and passage through the distribution network drastically decreased ahr activity suggested to be due to interaction of the inducing chemicals with the pipe surface material or biofilm while the effects on nrf2 activity were more modest and no apparent effects were observed on er activity from the present results it can be suggested that bioassays are useful tools for evaluation of the effects on toxic activity of treatment of drinking water bioassays of ahr and nrf2 are useful for screening of effects of a broad range of chemicals in drinking water and er activity can be monitored with a high sensitivity by bioassays including additional bioassays covering other health relevant endpoints as well as transcriptomic profiles to assess broader bioactivity responses would be valuable for assessment of drinking water quality it is known from previous studies that the toxic activities in water are only to a minor degree associated with the presence of analyzed chemicals but rather due to unknown compounds thus the health risk from micropollutants in drinking water may be underestimated if only based on analyzed chemicals the potential health risk from the unknown chemicals in drinking water inducing toxicity in in vitro bioassays needs to be further investigated acknowledgements the authors would like to thank lena norgren for performing the comet assay

19575,the presence of chemical pollutants in sources of drinking water is a key environmental problem threatening public health efficient removal of pollutants in drinking water treatment plants dwtps is needed as well as methods for assessment of the total impact of all present chemicals on water quality in the present study we have analyzed the bioactivity of water samples from source to tap including effects of various water treatments in a dwtp using a battery of cell based bioassays covering health relevant endpoints reporter gene assays were used to analyze receptor activity of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr estrogen receptor er androgen receptor ar peroxisome proliferator activated receptor alpha pparα and induction of oxidative stress by the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 nrf2 dna damage was determined by comet assay grab water samples were concentrated by hlb or env solid phase extraction and the water samples assayed at a relative enrichment factor of 50 the enrichment procedure did not induce any bioactivity no bioactivity was detected in milli q water or drinking water control samples induction of ahr er and nrf2 activities was revealed in source to tap water samples no cytotoxicity pparα or ar antagonist activity or dna damage were observed in any of the water samples a low ar agonist activity was detected in a few samples of surface water but not in the samples from the dwtp the treatment steps at the dwtp coagulation granulated activated carbon filtration uv disinfection and nh2cl dosing had little or no effect on the ahr nrf2 and er bioactivity however nanofiltration and passage through the distribution network drastically decreased ahr activity while the effect on nrf2 activity was more modest and no apparent effect was observed on er activity the present results suggest that bioassays are useful tools for evaluation of the efficiency of different treatment steps in dwtps in reducing toxic activities bioassays of ahr and nrf2 are useful for screening of effects of a broad range of chemicals in drinking water and er activity can be monitored with a high sensitivity keywords bioassay effect based assessment drinking water treatment estrogen receptor aryl hydrocarbon receptor nrf2 1 introduction contamination of drinking water with micropollutants is an environmental issue of great concern for human health van leeuwen 2000 schwarzenbach et al 2006 wee and aris 2017 due to the high daily consumption of drinking water 2 2 5 l in adults efsa 2010 the occurrence of a vast number of chemicals even at low concentrations may constitute a health risk target chemical analysis is used to screen for the presence of well known and emerging micropollutants in drinking water however such data do not consider unknown chemicals or give information on potential toxicity from the mixture of chemicals present in water the need of methods for assessment of the total impact by all chemicals on water quality has been recognized and effect based analysis using in vitro bioassays have been developed as powerful tools for water quality assessments murk et al 2002 bain et al 2014 escher et al 2014 di paolo et al

2014 conley et al 2017 furthermore a reduced transcriptome approach has been applied to assess untargeted biological activity of water samples in human cells xia et al 2017 drinking water treatment plants dwtps should be designed to remove contaminants from water before they enter the distribution system however data on the fate of micropollutants in dwtp are limited and little is known about the efficiency of different treatments steps to remove micropollutants in drinking water glassmeyer et al 2017 by using cell based bioassays the efficiency to remove or reduce toxic activity by different steps in the dwtp can be assessed when using bioanalytical tools for drinking water a high enrichment of the water samples and a broad extraction of chemicals are needed solid phase extraction spe with sorbent materials extracting a wide range of micropollutants from large volumes of water is generally used to concentrate the water and enable detection of micropollutants and bioactivities for the in vitro bioassays it is important to select a set of relevant biological endpoints covering toxic activities of a broad range of chemicals escher et al 2014 tested ten different water samples in 103 in vitro assays covering induction of xenobiotic metabolism reactive and specific modes of action adaptive stress response pathways and system responses escher et al 2014 the most responsive health relevant endpoints were related to xenobiotic metabolism measured by effects on aryl hydrocarbon receptor ahr and pregnane x receptor pxr hormone mediated modes of action measured by effects on estrogen receptor er androgen receptor ar glucocorticoid receptor gr and peroxisome proliferator activated receptor ppar genotoxicity measured by a battery of tests for example comet assay and oxidative stress measured by induction of the nuclear factor erythroid 2 related factor 2 nrf2 the aim of the present study was to monitor the bioactivity of water samples from source to tap including effects on bioactivity of various treatment steps in the dwtp in addition the effects of nanofiltration was tested in a pilot plant water samples were enriched by two different spe methods and tested by in vitro bioassays for cytotoxicity ahr pparα er and ar activity for oxidative stress response by nrf2 activity and for genotoxicity by comet assay 2 materials and methods 2 1 sample collection grab samples of water were collected in march 2015 at 10 sampling sites from the source in fyris river uppsala sweden to taps after the görväln dwtp which is serving a population of 600 000

waste water into fyris river 3 in the ekoln basin of lake mälaren at 7 km from the wwtp where a dilution effect is expected due to the higher volume of the lake 4 in the görväln basin at another part

extraction spe cartridges oasis hlb 20 cc 1 g waters usa and bond elut env 6 ml 1000 mg agilent usa the water samples were subdivided into two 5 l samples one to be extracted by hlb and one by env which were filtered through glass fiber filters whatman gf f 0 7 μm 142 mm into 5 l glass bottles spe cartridges were pre conditioned with 30 ml methanol and 20 ml milli q water water samples were added by vacuum manifold through a small tube at a speed of 1 drop sec 1 each sample was eluted three times with 10 ml methanol into glass tubes each eluate were reduced to less than 1 5 ml by an n evap 112 nitrogen evaporator system organomation associates inc the three eluates were pooled and reduced to approximately 0 2 ml and transferred to an lc ms glass vial after which samples were diluted with ethanol to 1 0 ml the water samples were thus enriched by a factor 5000 the spiking mixture milli q spiked was added to milli q water and extracted by spe in the same way as the grab water samples the concentrated water samples were stored at 20 c until analysis 2 3 bioassays the water samples and vehicle control were tested for ahr nrf2 pparα er activities and ar agonist and antagonist activities in reporter gene assays for cytotoxicity by cell viability assays mts and atp assay and for genotoxicity by comet assay the human hepatocellular carcinoma hepg2 cell line was used for the nrf2 ahr and pparα reporter gene assays and for the comet assay lundqvist et al 2016 hepg2 cells were transiently transfected with a luciferase reporter plasmid under the control of a dna element responsive to free nrf2 ligand activated ahr or ligand activated pparα respectively two stably transfected cell lines were used for the er and ar reporter gene assays the human breast carcinoma cell line vm7luc4e2 and the chinese hamster ovary cell line ar ecoscreen respectively er and ar activities were analyzed according to oecd guidelines oecd 2012 oecd 2016 cytotoxicity was tested in all cell lines a detailed description of the bioanalytical methods is provided in supplementary information si 2 when incubated with the cells the water samples enriched and non concentrated were diluted 100 fold with cell medium to get a final concentration of 1 ethanol and a relative enrichment factor ref of 50 for the enriched samples and 0 01 for the non concentrated samples the enrichment and dilution of the samples constitute the ref calculated as described by escher et al 2014 r e f e n r i c h m e n t f a c t o r s p e d i l u t i o n f a c t o r b i o a s s a y the

diluted as vehicle control 1 ethanol was used for normalization of bioactivities selected water samples were tested for ahr activity in dilutions to investigate concentration response relationships at refs ranging from 0 8 to 50 positive controls were analyzed in parallel with the water samples 2 3 7 8 tetrachlorodibenzodioxin tcdd for ahr wy14643 for pparα sulforaphane sfn for nrf2 17β estradiol e2 for er dihydrotestosterone dht for ar agonist activity and hydroxyflutamide ohf for ar antagonist activity the positive controls were analyzed in 5 12 concentrations to obtain a standard curve in the comet assay 2 mm catechol was used as a positive control 2 4 data evaluation bioactivities of water samples and positive controls were normalized to plate vehicle controls set to 1 standard curves for positive controls were obtained by fitting data x values were log transformed to a four parameter sigmoidal curve fit with the bottom and top limit constrained to 1 and the maximum observed response of the positive control respectively the four parameter curve fit follows the equation y bottom top bottom 1 10ˆ logec50 x hill slope from the four parameter curve fit ec50 and hill slope values were derived in graphpad prism results from the comet assay were expressed as percentage of dna in the tail calculated from the average median tail intensities ti and used as an indicator of dna damage results on ahr activities in diluted water samples and results from the comet assay were analyzed by kruskal wallis followed by dunn s post hoc test the significance level was set at p 0 05 data on ahr activity in diluted water samples were normalized to the maximum observed response of tcdd linear regression was performed on the concentration response data and the estimated slope and y axis intercept from the regression were used to determine ec5 and ec10 values as previously described by escher et al 2014 statistical analysis and graphical presentation was performed using graphpad prism 5 02 3 results and discussion 3 1 cut off values and control samples standard curves for positive controls standard curves for positive controls are shown in si fig 2 and the estimated ec50 and hill slope values are presented in table 2 setting cut off values for bioactivity cut off levels for classification of samples as positive in the bioassays were based on the limit of detection lod calculated for ahr nrf2 pparα er and ar agonist activity as 1 plus 3 times the standard deviation sd of the normalized vehicle control values from all cell plates within the experiment table 2 for ar antagonist activity the lod was calculated as 1 minus 3 times the sd for er and ar activities lod based cut offs were approximately equivalent to the cut offs suggested in the oecd guidelines oecd 2012 2016 where cut off for the er activity is defined as 20 of e2 maximum response for the ar agonist activity as 10 of dht maximum response and for ar antagonist activity as 30 reduction of the 500 pm dht control table 2 in assays for which no guideline exists and if the lod was below 1 5 the cut off was set to 1 5 and if the lod was between 1 5 and 2 the cut off was set at 2 the cut off values for er ar agonist and ar antagonist activities were set to 1 5 1 5 and 0 7 respectively which were above the lods and close to the cut offs suggested in the oecd guidelines the cut off for cytotoxicity was set at 80 of cell viability compared to the vehicle control control water samples no bioactivity was detected in the non spiked control water samples there were no differences in bioactivity between non concentrated and concentrated milli q and dw samples figs 1 and 2 demonstrating that the procedure for sample enrichment did not induce any bioactivity in the water samples the milli q spiked sample did not induce ahr nrf2 pparα or er activity whereas increased responses were observed in both the ar agonist and antagonist activity assays fig 2 the increased activity in the ar assay may be explained by the presence of drugs with androgenic activity in the spiking mixture e g nandrolone si table s2 furthermore the ar reporter assay can also be activated by the glucocorticoid receptor gr oecd 2016 and the increased activity in the milli q spiked sample could be induced by synthetic glucocorticoids in the spiking mixture e g budesonide by inhibiting the ar with ohf we demonstrated that the activation of ar by the milli q spiked sample was partly decreased suggesting that the ar activation was mediated through both ar and gr pathways si fig s5 3 2 bioactivity in source to tap and nanofiltration pilot plant samples cell viability the cell viability was not affected below the threshold of 80 compared to the vehicle control in any of the water samples at ref 50 in any of the cell lines si fig s1 thus the concentrated water samples were considered as non cytotoxic ahr activity ahr activity was increased 2 3 fold compared to vehicle control in the wwtp upstream sample and further increased in the wwtp downstream samples to 4 6 fold fig 1 the ahr activity remained at the same level in the samples from the two lake basins and after the various treatment steps in the dwtp however ahr activity was drastically decreased to levels at or below the cut off in the water samples from consumer taps as well as in the water samples from nfpp initially by the nanofiltration membrane and then further reduced by the old gac filter to control level concentration response of ahr activity most of the samples showed increased ahr activity to estimate the 5 and 10 effect concentrations ec5 and ec10 three env extracted samples exhibiting high and borderline activity in the ahr reporter gene assay were selected for further activity analysis and the samples were tested in serial dilutions in the ahr reporter gene assay statistically significant increased activity was demonstrated at ref 25 for wwtp downstream ref 12 5 for dwtp outlet and at ref 50 for nfpp nanofiltration permeate si fig s3 fold change values for the water samples were normalized to the maximum response of the positive control tcdd and modelled to a linear regression model table 3 si fig s3 based on slopes and y axis intercept ec5 and ec10 were calculated and expressed as ref table 3 the ec5 and ec10 refs ranged from 23 to 38 and from 46 to 74 respectively demonstrating a low ahr activity compared with results from other studies thus escher et al 2014 determined ahr activity in drinking water by caflux bioassay and reported an ec10 ref of 8 6 nrf2 activity in the nrf2 reporter gene assay most samples exhibited activities above the cut off of 1 5 fold fig 1 the response ranged from approximately 1 5 to 2 5 fold induction similar to ahr there was no effect of the various dwtp treatments on the nrf2 activity apart from the nanofiltration membrane and pilot filter with old gac which slightly reduced the activity however in contrast to ahr activity the nrf2 activity was not consistently reduced in the consumer tap water samples er activity the highest er activity was observed in the wwtp downstream sample which was approximately 2 5 fold higher than the vehicle control fig 2 the er activity decreased in the samples further downstream the wwtp and remained around the cut off value of 1 5 fold in the lake and dwtp samples thus the er activity was not influenced by the different treatments in the dwtp the distribution system or by the nanofiltration membrane ar and pparα activity two samples exhibited borderline ar agonist activity in the env extracts upstream the wwtp and lake ekoln none of the samples showed any pparα or ar antagonist activities figs 1 and 2 comet assay no effects were detected in any of the water samples in the comet assay si fig s4 the positive control 2 mm catechol caused a statistically significant increase in tail intensity 7 7 0 6 compared to the control 2 7 0 2 3 3 effect of extraction method on bioactivity for the enrichment of water samples two types of prepackaged solid phase extraction cartridges were used oasis hlb made of two monomers hydrophilic n vinylpyrrolidone and lipophilic divinylbenzene and bond elut env made of modified styrene divinylbenzene these two spe sorbents were chosen since they are both suitable for polar to semi polar organic pollutants and env is supposed to cover more polar chemicals than hlb no consistent difference in bioactivity was observed due to extraction method either in the control water samples or in the test water samples the pparα activity seemed to be higher in the samples extracted by env although the standard deviation was high and no activities above the cut off level were observed the lack of difference in bioactivity between non concentrated and concentrated control water samples demonstrates that none of the two extraction methods contaminates the samples with anything causing bioactivity thus there was no false positive bioactivity due to the enrichment procedure however false negative results or an underestimation of activities in the bioassays cannot be excluded due to limited recovery of chemicals during the extraction procedure baranowska and kowalski 2012 compared recovery efficiencies for 13 drugs in distilled water and tap water extracted by hlb env and nexus baranowska and kowalski 2012 there was no major difference between hlb and env and the recoveries varied between 80 and 107 for 11 of the drugs similarly our results indicate that the extraction efficiency of bioactivity is similar for hlb and env in our water samples although the activity may have been underestimated by both the extraction methods due to incomplete recovery of chemicals in the extraction procedure 3 4 effects of drinking water treatment there was no removal of bioactivity from the inlet to the outlet in the dwtp thus the coagulation treatment the gac filtration uv disinfection and nh2cl dosing did not decrease the activity of ahr nrf2 or er in contrast the activity of ahr was interestingly decreased in the consumer tap water by the nanofiltration membrane and by the old gac filter nanofiltration is used to treat surface water mainly for removal of natural organic matter and as a microbiological barrier lidén et al 2016 to our knowledge this is the first study to demonstrate the efficiency of nanofiltration and the drinking water distribution system to reduce the ahr activity in drinking water the decrease in bioactivity in consumer tap water may be explained by removal of ahr activating contaminants from the water by attachment of the chemicals to the pipe surface material or biofilm szabo and minamyer 2014 or as a result of biotransformation of chemicals by microbial communities inhabiting the biofilm of pipe surface carpenter and helbling 2017 likewise the more efficient removal of ahr activity by the nfpp old gac filter than by the new gac filter may be due to biotransformation of chemicals in the microbial biofilm built up on the old gac particles in contrast to our results macova et al 2011 did not detect any ahr activity above the vehicle control in the inlet or outlet water from a dwtp macova et al 2011 escher et al 2014 reported similar or higher ahr activities in the outlet water treated by coagulation chlorination and chloramination compared to the inlet river water similarly they reported 2 3 fold higher nrf2 activities in outlet compared to inlet drinking water escher et al 2012 they suggested that the increased bioactivity of ahr and nrf2 may be due to formation of chlorinated disinfectant byproducts which was further supported by data from neale et al 2012 who demonstrated induced nrf2 activities after chlorination in a dwtp neale et al 2012 mutagenic compounds may be produced by chlorination or other oxidative treatment of raw water depending on the raw water quality and the degree of chlorination oxidation ceretti et al 2016 potential mutagenicity was tested by ames test umuc and sos chromotest by escher et al 2014 who reported no activity in some of the assays and higher activities in the outlet water than the inlet of a dwtp in other assays žegura et al 2009 detected mutagenic effects by ames test in one of 6 samples of non concentrated tap water žegura et al 2009 inlet and outlet extracts of wastewater from a sewage treatment plant in central india showed statistically significant dna damage by comet assay at concentrations of 0 125 and 0 062 corresponding to refs of 1 25 and 0 62 while no dna damage was detected from drinking water samples with the same refs shrivastava et al 2017 in our study we did not observe any increased activities due to the dwtp treatment of ahr or nrf2 activities or dna damage in the comet assay at the tested ref of 50 the absence of effects in our study may be due to the quality of the raw water and a low degree of chloramination and uv disinfection preventing the formation of oxidative products our results did not demonstrate any apparent effect on er activity from the dwtp treatments in the study by escher et al 2014 er activity in water samples from the outlet of a dwtp had lower or similar activity than from the inlet lower incidence of er activity in treated than source drinking water samples were reported from 25 us dwtps with 3 of the treated and 16 of the source samples showing estrogenic activity conley et al 2017 efficient removal of added estrogens to drinking water was demonstrated at pilot scale by combined treatment with uv and h2o2 while treatment with uv solely only partially removed estrone cédat et al 2016 3 5 bioactivity in drinking water presence of micropollutants all water samples were non cytotoxic at the highest concentration ref 50 and the determinations of toxic activities in the bioassays were performed on samples at that concentration ahr and nrf2 activities were detected in all the samples from surface water and the dwtp ahr activity indicates presence of contaminants which have an impact on the metabolism of chemicals many persistent organic pollutants and drugs have the capacity to activate ahr such as halogenated aromatic hydrocarbons polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons many drugs pesticides as well as chemicals of natural origin denison and nagy 2003 stejskalova et al 2011 nrf2 activity indicates presence of chemicals of various structures inducing oxidative stress which is a common toxicity pathway for many chemicals kobayashi et al 2009 martin et al 2010 thus the increased ahr and nrf2 activities in the water samples could be due to a variety of different chemicals both of natural and anthropogenic origin the physicochemical characteristics of the water si table s1 were within normal ranges in our study er activity at or above the cut off value was detected in almost all water samples with the highest activity found in the sample downstream the wwtp the er activity in dwtp outlet and consumer tap samples was at the cut off level corresponding to 0 039 ng estradiol equivalents l e2eq l in the grab water sample before extraction it can be suggested that natural estrogens and the synthetic 17α ethinylestradiol are responsible for the main er activity in the water samples due to their much higher potency compared to other estrogenic compounds such as genistein and bisphenol a which may be present in the water gutendorf and westendorf 2001 compared the ed50 values of er activity between 17β estradiol e2 estrone e1 17α ethinylestradiol ee2 genistein and bisphenol a and reported approximate relative potencies of 1 0 01 1 25 0 0001 and 0 00002 respectively gutendorf and westendorf 2001 conley et al 2017 demonstrated that e1 was the main contributor to the estrogenic activity in source water samples from 25 us dwtps they analyzed estrogens in the source water samples by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry and reported detectable concentrations of e1 0 13 0 29 ng l in 4 of the 25 samples while concentrations of e2 e3 and ee2 were not detectable the determined e1 levels in three of the source water samples were estimated to account for 65 98 of the estrogenic activity as determined by reporter gene assay no detectable concentrations of estrogens were found in the treated water while three of the samples displayed estrogenic activity ranging from 0 037 to 0 078 ng e2eq l in a study by brand et al 2013 outlet water from two of three dwtp had detectable er activity 0 022 and 0 032 ng e2eq l brand et al 2013 maggioni et al 2013 reported low estrogenic activity in drinking water from 35 italian cities with a maximum activity corresponding to 0 014 ng e2eq l maggioni et al 2013 the spiking mixture of 242 compounds si table s2 added to a milli q sample before sample extraction did not induce any activity except in the ar reporter gene assay suggesting that none of these compounds contributed to the ahr nrf2 and er activities at the added concentrations of 20 ng l these findings are in line with previous investigations in which very little of the observed bioactivity could be explained by a number of target chemicals escher et al 2013 neale et al 2015 identification of chemicals responsible for detected toxic activities in the bioassays is a future challenge which is the objective of effect directed analysis brack et al 2016 2017 busch et al 2016 3 6 bioassays as a screening tool in assessment of drinking water quality there has been a rapid development of bioanalytical tools to monitor water quality so far bioassays have mainly been used for assessment of effects of environmental pollutants in waste water and surface water assessment of drinking water by bioassays is challenging as the concentrations of contaminants are generally low thus sensitive bioassays are needed as well as a high enrichment of the water samples with the used sample enrichment the bioassays were sensitive enough to detect ahr nrf2 and er activities in the drinking water and to assess efficiency of various treatments of drinking water to remove bioactivity apart from the cytotoxicity and comet assay all bioassays used in the present study were reporter gene assays of which ahr nrf2 and pparα activities were analyzed using transiently transfected hepg2 cells and with co transfection of renilla plasmid to normalize for differences in transfection efficiency most other studies using bioassays have been performed in stably transfected cell lines van der linden et al 2008 brand et al 2013 escher et al 2014 jia et al 2015 mehinto et al 2015 conley et al 2017 välitalo et al 2017 as in the present study in the reporter gene assays of er and ar activity one advantage of using transient transfection is that different cell lines can be used for transfection of the plasmids for example to study effects of metabolism and transport proteins all reporter gene assays used in the present study were sensitive and robust which was demonstrated by the consistent results in the standard curves of the positive controls however the pparα reporter gene assay had a low sensitivity due to a large standard deviation which resulted in a high lod of the bioactivity the sensitivity of in vitro bioassays for er activity is higher than in the chemical analysis of estrogens conley et al 2017 detected estrogens by chemical analysis in 5 of 25 source waters from us dwtps and in none of the treated water samples whereas estrogenic activity was detected by a reporter gene assay in t47d kbluc cells in 16 of the source samples and 3 of the treated välitalo et al 2016 reported limits of quantification loqs by chemical analysis lc ms ms for e1 e2 e3 and ee2 of 1 5 4 3 and 10 ng l respectively while in our study the cut off value for er activity corresponded to 0 039 ng e2eq l the selection of bioassays should be based on common toxicity pathways and specific sensitive toxic mechanisms such as disturbance of the endocrine system escher et al 2014 proposed ahr and pxr activities as parameters of induction of xenobiotic metabolism and estrogenic antiandrogenic and glucocorticoid receptor activities as the most relevant and responsive to water samples in concordance with our results no pparα or ar agonist activity were reported in inlet or outlet water of a dwtp in the study by escher et al 2014 4 conclusions activities of ahr nrf2 and er were detected in water samples from source to tap enriched by a factor of 50 in contrast to other studies showing increased activities of ahr and nrf2 in dwtp outlet compared to inlet water our findings suggest that the dwtp treatment steps had little or no effect on the ahr nrf2 and er bioactivity the absence of increased activities in ahr and nrf2 activities in the dwtp in our study may be due to the quality of the raw water and a low degree of chloramination and uv treatment preventing the formation of oxidative products however nanofiltration and passage through the distribution network drastically decreased ahr activity suggested to be due to interaction of the inducing chemicals with the pipe surface material or biofilm while the effects on nrf2 activity were more modest and no apparent effects were observed on er activity from the present results it can be suggested that bioassays are useful tools for evaluation of the effects on toxic activity of treatment of drinking water bioassays of ahr and nrf2 are useful for screening of effects of a broad range of chemicals in drinking water and er activity can be monitored with a high sensitivity by bioassays including additional bioassays covering other health relevant endpoints as well as transcriptomic profiles to assess broader bioactivity responses would be valuable for assessment of drinking water quality it is known from previous studies that the toxic activities in water are only to a minor degree associated with the presence of analyzed chemicals but rather due to unknown compounds thus the health risk from micropollutants in drinking water may be underestimated if only based on analyzed chemicals the potential health risk from the unknown chemicals in drinking water inducing toxicity in in vitro bioassays needs to be further investigated acknowledgements the authors would like to thank lena norgren for performing the comet assay

19576,both nanoparticulate nzno and ntio2 and organic chemical ultraviolet uv filters are active ingredients in sunscreen and protect against skin cancer but limited research exists on the environmental effects of sunscreen release into aquatic systems to examine the trade offs of incorporating nanoparticles nps into sunscreens over the past two decades we targeted endpoints sensitive to the potential risks of different uv filters solar reactive oxygen production in water and disruption of zebrafish embryo development first we developed methodology to extract nanoparticles from sunscreens with organic solvents zebrafish embryos exposed to parts per million nps used in sunscreens displayed limited toxicological effects nzno particles appeared to be slightly more toxic than ntio2 at the highest concentrations in contrast seven organic uv filters did not affect zebrafish embryogenesis at or near aqueous solubility second to simulate potent photo initiated reactions upon release into water we examined methylene blue mb degradation under uv light ntio2 from sunscreen caused 10 times faster mb loss than nzno and approached the photocatalytic degradation rate of a commercial ntio2 photocatalysts p25 organic uv filters did not cause measurable mb degradation finally we estimated that between 1 and 10 ppm of sunscreen nps in surface waters could produce similar steady state hydroxyl radical concentrations as naturally occurring fluvic acids under sunlight irradiation incorporation of nps into sunscreen may increase environmental concentrations of reactive oxygen albeit to a limited extent which can influence transformation of dissolved substances and potentially affect ecosystem processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords sunscreen nanotechnology

1936 cokkinides et al 2006 robinson et al 1997 organic chemical ultraviolet uv filters and micron scale metal oxide particles were used exclusively as the active ingredients in sunscreen during the 20th century urbach 2001 nano scale metal oxide particles such as titanium dioxide ntio2 and zinc oxide nzno absorb uv light but scatter relatively little visible light and therefore the advent of nanotechnology provided materials that retained the uv filtering capability of micro scale metal oxide particles and organic uv filters but are transparent to the human eye and do not degrade in the presence of uv light because of their low cost desirable textural properties non greasy and comparable uv filtering capability metal oxide nanoparticles have become widely used active ingredients in commercial sunscreens during the past two decades the increased incorporation into cosmetics e g sunscreen moisturizers lip balm etc of both organic and inorganic sunscreens has led to higher levels of human exposure and environmental loading balmer et al 2005 gondikas et al 2014 poiger et al 2004 venkatesan et al 2018 potential adverse environmental effects of these exposures must be balanced against benefits of human skin cancer prevention two pathways of environmental release exist for uv filters 1 recreational bathing resulting in acute exposure to aquatic species and 2 wastewater discharges resulting in chronic exposure the source of uv filters in wastewater is bathing e g shower or bath water or for organic uv filters partitioning through the dermis up to 9 of the applied dose hayden et al 2005 treffel and gabard 1996 and into the blood and eventual excretion in urine as the parent compound and metabolites up to 2 of applied dose hayden et al 1997 release through these pathways has resulted in detection of organic chemicals used as uv filters in treated wastewater and recreational waters at concentrations up to 65 4 and 0 2 nm respectively balmer et al 2005 kupper et al 2006 poiger et al 2004 more than 20 organic uv filters have been approved by the european union and us food and drug administration fda for use in sunscreen formulations and have undergone extensive testing regarding their mammalian toxicity european comission 2009 food and drug administration 2016a the estrogenic effects of organic uv filters both on animals rainbow trout japanese medaka and on human cells coronado et al 2008 schlumpf et al 2001 has been studied but no significant effects were observed until the applied dose was orders of magnitude greater several μm than would be expected in the environment several nm balmer et al 2005 poiger et al 2004 or in cases of chronic exposure schlumpf et al 2008 these studies suggest that the human and environmental risks of organic uv filter use are likely low except in the case of waters heavily impacted by wastewater chronic ecological exposure or recreation high dose acute exposure ntio2 and nzno are also approved for use as uv filters by the fda nano scale formulations are not regulated separately from their micron sized counterparts because the fda does not consider these ingredients to be new from a regulatory perspective rather a shift in size distribution of an already approved ingredient food and drug administration 2016a additionally nano scale tio2 and nzno have not shown the potential to pass the epidermis of healthy skins and thus human effects are limited to the stratum corneum no live cells and thus no potential for toxicity gulson et al 2010 sadrieh et al 2010 based on available data both inorganic and organic uv filters are relatively safe from a human endpoint perspective and congruent with the fda responsibility of assuring cosmetics and dietary supplements are safe and properly labeled food and drug administration 2016b but few studies directly investigated the aquatic environmental effects of sunscreen release nano scale metal oxide uv filters are difficult to directly measure in natural waters but several experimental and modeling studies have estimated that the maximum environmental concentrations would be in the low 10s of μg l david holbrook et al 2013 gondikas et al 2014 johnson et al 2011 mueller and nowack 2008 nano scale metal oxides especially those commonly used as uv filters nzno and ntio2 are semiconductor photocatalysts and produce reactive oxygen species ros in water including superoxide and hydroxyl radicals when exposed to uv light manufacturers are thought to have circumvented this potentially hazardous property by coating the particles with al oh 3 and or polydimethylsiloxane but auffan et al 2010 suggests the coating may dissolve over time however efforts towards determining the environmental effects of nano scale metal oxide sunscreen use has been almost solely focused on ntio2 uv filters that were purchased from chemical suppliers rather than nps extracted from sunscreens themselves and may poorly represent nps used in commercially available sunscreen formulations auffan et al 2010 foltête et al 2011 fouqueray et al 2012 labille et al 2010 in general few assessments exist with the capability to directly compare nano vs chemical alternatives furthermore legacy fugacity based fate and transport models are not directly applicable to nps but current efforts include developing models specific to nps bouchard et al 2017 garner et al 2017 gottschalk et al 2013 liu and cohen 2014 meesters et al 2014 praetorius et al 2012 westerhoff and nowack 2013 therefore researchers have called for targeted experiments and inclusion of new physiochemical property measurements that are specific to the hazardous properties of nps considering the intended use and potential release hjorth et al 2016 the goal of this study was to consider two endpoints after sunscreen release scenarios to assess the ecological trade offs of replacing organic uv filters with nano scale metal oxides we studied seven organic uv filters avobenzone ecamsule iscotrizinol octocrylene octyl methoxycinnamate octyl salicylate and oxybenzone approved for use in either the european union iscotrizinol and ecamsule or the european union and the us for inorganic metal oxides a method was developed to extract the metal oxide particles from complex sunscreen matrices five different sunscreens and re suspend them in water and we compared their physical chemical properties to known ingredients commercially available for use in sunscreen products we then used two endpoints to inform environmental implications in our study 1 degradation of methylene blue mb to estimate ros production during exposure to uv light and 2 zebrafish embryo development the zebrafish embryo exposure experiment was used to determine acute developmental effects in an aquatic species that has a high potential for exposure finally data was utilized to assess the potential trade offs in risk of each class of uv filter 2 materials and methods 2 1 sunscreens and reagents seven neat organic sunscreen active ingredients i e oxybenzone avobenzone octyl salicylate octyl methoxycinnamate octocrylene iscotrizinol and ecamsule were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa at 98 purity five sunscreens labeled as containing inorganic metal oxides were purchased from local supermarkets in arizona usa in 2014 the purchased sunscreens were labeled as containing either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide and a description of the labels is shown in table 1 aeroxide tio2 p25 and p90 powders were obtained from evonik industries essen germany two nano scale zinc based uv filters intended for commercial use in sunscreen products one without a coating and one described by the vendor as having a hydrophobic coating z cote and z cote hp1 were purchased directly from the vendor tkbtrading oakland ca usa and used in control experiments as they were not incorporated into a complex sunscreen matrix reagent details can be found in the si 2 2 sample preparation our extraction method was based on previous research that used organic solvents and centrifugation to separate the sunscreen matrix from the metal oxide particulate matter barker and branch 2008 dunford et al 1997 lewicka et al 2011 rampaul et al 2007 we explored several strategies to separate nps from sunscreens and our goal was to produce a method that was robust insensitive to sunscreen brand required as few extraction steps as possible to minimize changes in particle chemistry and had the capacity for extraction to be visually confirmed during the process initial attempts to separate np sunscreen matrix explored multiple solvents of varying polarity dichloromethane dcm acetonitrile methanol and isopropanol we believed that the matrix contained mostly non polar compounds that would be soluble in non polar organic solvents after attempting to disperse and separate particles via centrifugation from the matrix we visually found that dcm provided the best separation see results the final extraction method follows approximately 5 g of sunscreen was placed in a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 20 ml dcm the solution was vortexed sonicated in a water bath for 5 min and shaken vigorously until the solution appeared homogeneous the solution was then centrifuged at 5000 rcf for 5 min the two supernatant layers oil emulsion and dcm layers were decanted leaving a solid white pellet the white pellet was suspended in 20 ml of dcm vortexed sonicated again to re disperse the pellet and then centrifuged we repeated this process a total of three times to remove organic constituents and oils while retaining the particulate matter salts and any surfactants contained in the sunscreen we then used the same centrifugation and decantation method but substituted milli q water as the solvent to remove salts and surfactants this rinsing process was also repeated three times the pellet was then washed one final time with 20 ml of dcm to remove any residual water and we removed the residual solvent using a vacuum pump line attached to a one holed stopper that fit the centrifuge tube the vacuum was then released and the sample was capped and stored in room air additional sample preparation techniques including transmission electron microscopy tem and quantification of metal in the extracted aqueous matrix are contained in the si 2 3 particle characterization of extracted nanoparticles analysis by single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry spicp ms was performed on non digested samples using a thermo scientific x series ii waltham ma in time resolved data acquisition mode with a dwell time of 10 ms following methodologies described elsewhere pace et al 2011 and with details in the si in brief extracted nanoparticles were placed in polypropylene sample tubes in either milli q or ph 6 buffer and the tubes were placed in a sonicating bath for 15 min the samples were then immediately pumped into the instrument and the spectra for 49ti and 66zn were recorded we used three times the standard deviation of the spectra to delineate particle pulses from background dissolved metal tem philips cm200 fei hilsboro or usa with energy dispersive x ray analysis edx was used to measure particle size and elemental composition mean particle diameter was measured with imagej software x ray fluorescence xrf niton xl3t goldd thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa spicp ms x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro mrd panalytical inc netherlands and dynamic light scattering dls zetapals brookhaven instruments corp holtsville new york usa were also used to measure particle size metal oxide composition and crystalline structure the refractive index for dls measurements was set to 2 00 for samples containing nzno and 2 63 for samples containing ntio2 xrd data was collected using a high resolution x ray diffractometer with cu ka radiation 45 kv 40 ma using a step scan mode diffractograms were collected in a 2θ range of 10 90 at a rate of 2 min with a resolution of 0 025 2 4 uv photo reactivity assay we measured reaction kinetics between np or organic uv filters and a probe compound mb in the presence of uv b light 280 315 nm similar to published approaches lee et al 2011 the uv exposure apparatus was a 25w uvp transilluminator upland ca producing 302 nm light a 96 well plate reader was used to measure oxidation of mb at 650 nm nanoparticles extracted from sunscreens or organic uv filters were diluted into 96 well plates containing 10 mg l mb and milli q water or phosphate buffer mb photodegradation or sorption to the plate wells was negligible when mb was placed in the wells in the absence of nanoparticles and exposed to uv light mb sorption to the particles was also negligible during dark exposure experiments inorganic uv filters nanoparticle extracts were tested at multiple concentrations across multiple time points to obtain second order rate constants organic uv filters were tested at visible aqueous saturation plots of mb vs exposure duration were fit with an exponential function and r2 were typically greater than 0 9 if the exposure experiment resulted in a r2 of less than 0 9 the experiment was repeated this occurred only with p25 and p90 where the time resolution was too low in the initial experiment and the dye oxidation plateaued after less than three measurements 2 5 zebrafish assays tropical 5d wild type adult zebrafish embryos were housed at oregon state university sinnhuber aquatic research laboratory organic uv filters and nanoparticle extracts were shipped to oregon state university and stored at 3 c zebrafish assays were conducted within one month upon receipt of the samples embryos were dechorionated at 4 h post fertilization hpf and transferred into individual wells of a 96 well plate with 100 μl of prepared nanoparticle solution nanoparticle solutions were diluted with their respective suspension media either 0 1m ph 6 phosphate buffer or milli q water to achieve the desired concentration in the well zebrafish were also exposed to the clean buffer solution of milli q water embryos were statically exposed at 28 c for 120 hpf to six concentrations 1 3 log change of organic uv filters and nanoparticle extracts in replicates of 32 animals exposure plates were sealed to prevent evaporation and wrapped with aluminum foil to guard against potential photo oxidation at 24 and 120 hpf 22 morphological endpoints were assessed according to truong et al 2011 a global control was computed per experiment day and used to determine statistical significance control animal development combined with previous experience of the authors demonstrated that the wells have enough head space such that the animals do not experience hypoxia during the experiment some morphological endpoints evaluated included mortality developmental progression and yolk sac edema an additional two endpoints any effect except mortality and any effect were calculated based on aggregate data from the 22 assayed endpoints the criteria for statistical significance for these two endpoints is not automatically satisfied if a single of the other 20 endpoints is satisfied i e statistically significant deviation from control samples for any effect and any effect except mortality does not necessarily mean statistically significant effects were observed in any of the other 22 individual endpoints the zebrafish acquisition and analysis program zaap a custom program designed to inventory acquire and manage zebrafish data was used to collect developmental endpoints as either present or absent i e binary responses were recorded an internal quality assurance quality control qa qc plate consisting of 32 control animals and 32 animals exposed to 0 2 μm ziram was also run each day to check for response consistency in the animals from different hatches in the qa qc plate negative controls must exhibit less than 20 cumulative mortality and morbidity and positive ziram controls must display a notochord effect in at least 80 of the exposed animals statistical significance was computed as described in truong et al 2014 and reif et al 2016 further details are provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction and characterization of uv filters in sunscreens we based our initial methods to extract nanoparticles from sunscreens on prior research that used centrifugation methods with solvents of varying polarity e g chloroform acetone isopropanol methanol and hexane lewicka et al 2011 rampaul et al 2007 dcm was determined to be the most practical solvent to achieve the key criterion of phase separation after homogenization with solvent followed by centrifugation when the sunscreen was homogenized in methanol it was difficult to visually distinguish a pellet because the white matrix emulsion components did not separate from the solvent phase polymers oils etc and obscured the pellet isopropanol and acetonitrile had relatively transparent solvent phases but the extracted material was visually more voluminous than a pellet of agglomerated metal oxide would be expected to appear after centrifugation the extracted material likely included surfactants that are insoluble in isopropanol or acetonitrile it may have been possible to later wash these surfactants out with water however dcm provided a density gradient separation with much of the sunscreen emulsion constituents contained in a distinct white colored layer above a transparent dcm layer figure si 1 dcm is also the most volatile of the solvents tested and solvent removal was straightforward with the aid of a vacuum pump heating the extracted pellets not used in subsequent experiments in air in a 550 c furnace for 24 h resulted in less than 2 6 mass loss organic matter for all dcm extracted samples thus the extracted pellets were nearly entirely inorganic material while all solvents tested may have resulted in similar extracted products after multiple washings with organic solvent followed by water we preferred to use dcm because we could visually observe the pellet the pellet was composed of inorganic material based on thermal gravimetric measurements and because dcm is highly volatile allowing us to rapidly remove the solvent via a vacuum pump after separation from the sunscreen matrix we characterized the extracted material initially we used tem to determine extracted particle sizes representative images are shown in fig 1 and particle sizing results are shown in table 1 sunscreens a and b were mostly rod shaped particles while sunscreen e contained irregular or spherical particles sunscreen c contained mostly amorphous particles and sunscreen d contained rod shaped zn particles and amorphous ti particles both z cote formulations contained amorphous zn particles but particles in the hp1 formulation were slightly more rod shaped than the uncoated formulation by tem the as purchased sunscreens contained a significant amount of organic carbon and these shapes were nearly absent in the particles extracted with dcm figure si 2 indicating the extraction method removed the sunscreen matrix leaving the metal oxide np for sunscreens a c and e we also compared the particles size distribution of the extracted particles to the particles retained in the oil emulsion phase figure si 1 particle length and width distributions between the extracted particles and those that were not extracted for sunscreen a were not statistically different the diameter of the extracted particles in sunscreen e was also not significantly different from the oil emulsion phase but the amorphous particles extracted from sunscreen c were slightly greater in size than those retained in the emulsion layer one way anova with tukey s hsd p 0 05 table 1 this may indicate that we selected for slightly larger particles during centrifugation in this specific sunscreen or that the particles aggregated differently between samples during drying of the tem grid nonetheless the extracted particles from sunscreen c were still relatively small mean diameter 136 nm and relevant to environmental exposure studies we analyzed the particles by spicp ms after dispersion of the particles into milli q water and found that the measured ti particle size distributions appear as folded normal distributions figure si 3 which indicated that a significant fraction of the particles were smaller than the minimum size detection limit of spicp ms i e smaller than 80 nm lee et al 2014 this is not surprising because the mean particle sizes found by tem was 60 nm we did not attempt to measure zn nanoparticles because the particles sizes in the extracts and the size detection limit for zn by spicp ms are similar furthermore the zn nps were clearly rod shaped fig 1 and spicp ms calculations determine equivalent np size using an assumption of spherical particles edx analysis in each of the extracted samples showed that nearly all sunscreens contained either ti or zn particles and the material matched well with the metal oxide on the label of the sunscreen in one spectrum with extended counting time of sunscreen e si and al were observed which has previously been attributed to an organic and inorganic coating auffan et al 2010 si and al were not observed in other sunscreen samples but most edx spectra were recorded with reduced counting time an example of one representative sunscreen and an edx spot analysis is shown in figure si 4 confirmation of the expected metal oxides was conducted using xrd and the peaks also matched well with the labeled metal oxide either nzno or ntio2 the peak positions and relative intensities for ntio2 and nzno were referenced from the icdd database zno 01 070 8072 tio2 anatase 01 070 6826 tio2 rutile 01 072 4814 the ntio2 crystallinity in sunscreens d and e was anatase and rutile respectively figure si 5 z cote and z cote hp1 contained peaks consistent with zno when the extracted particles were dispersed in water for aqueous experiments we found that some particles were readily dispersible extracted particles from sunscreens c and e and z cote p25 and p90 other nps particles extracted from sunscreens a b and d and z cote hp1 exhibited hydrophobic characteristics poor dispersion in water after vortexing and sonication and instantaneous association with the walls of the polypropylene tube and at the air water interface the meniscus of the aqueous phase was also inverted convex indicating either a reduction in the surface affinity repulsion to the polypropylene coated with the nps or less likely greater affinity between the aqueous phase and the remaining suspended nps notably the label of sunscreens b and c described them as containing z cote and the z cote hp1 formulation is sold as a hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane pdms coated formulation of z cote nzno particles others have also reported finding pdms and al oh 3 coatings on nanoparticles used in sunscreen formulations auffan et al 2010 xrf confirmed that the as received powder z cote hp1 particles contained approximately 0 2 si detection limit 0 02 similar to the 2 found by auffan et al on another sunscreen formulation in this study si in the uncoated z cote formulation was below the xrf detection limit we believe that a hydrophobic coating potentially pdms was responsible for the hydrophobic characteristics of the particles extracted from sunscreens a b d and z cote hp1 we expect little or no pdms dissolution during extraction from the sunscreen because of the short contact periods with dcm although dcm may have caused some pdms swelling during extraction swelling was likely reversed during solvent removal lee et al 2003 we assume that the three commercial sunscreens that exhibited strong hydrophobicity were likely to have similar coatings other researchers were able to alter the hydrophobic pdms coating on commercial nanoparticles in minutes by suspending them in ph 5 buffer solutions the change in hydrophobicity was attributed to degradation of the si o si backbone and or desorption of the polymer from the np surface auffan et al 2010 our goal was not to completely remove the coating but to stabilize the nps in an environmentally relevant matrix while minimizing artificial changes to the materials and coatings we placed the pellets of hydrophobic material into 0 1m ph 6 phosphate buffer and sonicated 0 1m was selected as the buffer concentration to maintain sufficient buffering capacity in further experiments where the solutions are dilute e g zebrafish exposures the nps were significantly more stable in solution at this ph although some settling occurred over 24 h the solutions were still opaque while the nanoparticles were relatively stable in solution at ph 6 we did not observe the same hydrophobicity change as the previous researchers after we washed out the ph 6 buffer and dispersed the particles in milli q water even after 1 month of storage thus we elected to conduct aqueous studies at ph 6 for these sunscreens we also selected for the most environmentally relevant particles by decanting a particle suspension after 24 h of settling in ph 6 buffer overall our findings of particle shape and size distribution are similar to previous findings zn particles were typically rod shaped and ti particles were smaller either rod shaped with slightly sharper edges previously described as needle shaped lewicka et al 2011 or small spheres the image of sunscreen d in fig 1 contained both zn and ti and provides an excellent example of this dichotomy 3 2 characterization of organic uv filters organic uv filters are generally small compounds and those studied here have molecular weight between 228 and 766 da the low aqueous solubility of the organic uv filters that afford them their water resistant properties also results in high octanol water partition coefficients log kow ranging from 3 6 to 12 4 chemicalize org 2016 physical chemical characteristics of the organic uv filters contained in tables si 1 logd values were calculated for each organic sunscreen for ph 8 and values ranging from 0 7 to 12 indicating lipophilicity partitioning to fats and likely bioaccumulation bioconcentration factors bcf calculated using episuite us epa 2016 for each compound ranged from 3 to 16 120 l kg notably iscotrizinol and ecamsule had the lowest potential for bioaccumulation 3 l kg but are not approved for use in the us although these are only predicted bcfs several studies corroborate this evidence with environmental measurements bachelot et al 2012 buser et al 2006 tsui et al 2017 bioaccumulation of some nanoparticles has been reported hou et al 2013 lópez serrano et al 2014 but bcf values appear to be lower for nps than many of the organic uv filter chemicals therefore although it was not the goal of our experiments to determine chronic exposure trade offs because there is already a significant effort in the literature aimed at this goal it is notable that replacement of organic uv filters with nps may reduce the potential ecological effects associated with chronic exposure and bioaccumulation of organic uv filters 3 3 zebrafish developmental effects zebrafish were exposed to nanoparticles extracted from sunscreens and to organic uv filters and our goal was to compare the tradeoffs of substituting nps for organic chemicals to a potential environmental exposure endpoint i e zebrafish embryos the organic uv filters did not impact animal development over 5 days even when tested at aqueous saturation suggesting that estrogenic effects reported by others may be limited to specific susceptible species or repeated exposure coronado et al 2008 three of the particle extracts sunscreens a b and d and z cote all which contain nzno resulted in statistically significant effects to the embryo development at the relatively high concentrations tested fig 2 raw data contained in tables si 2 both the particles from sunscreen b and d caused statistically significant mortality because we only observed effects in animals exposed to zn particles these deviations from normal development may be due to zn dissolution from the particle i e zn ion induced toxicity rather than nzno particles bohme et al 2017 reed et al 2012 other samples were not tested at such elevated concentrations because the resulting particle extracts were not concentrated enough to allow for such high doses i e lack of stable suspension during 24 h quiescent period but also because exposures greater than 1 mg l are not likely to be environmentally relevant overall the concentrations dosed are considerably higher than would be expected in the environment thus these nanoparticles are expected to have little or no impacts on zebrafish 3 4 photocatalytic properties of inorganic and organic uv filters nzno and ntio2 can be photocatalysts which causes concern that the inorganic uv filters used in sunscreens may produce ros on skin or in the environment when exposed to sunlight to investigate this we exposed the nanoparticles extracted from sunscreen to 302 nm light 25w in the presence of a sacrificial mb dye for p25 increasing np dose and uv irradiation time led to greater mb oxidation pseudo first order rate constants from each np dose experiment were obtained figure si 6 and used to determine pseudo second order rate constants l mg 1 s 1 as illustrated in fig 3 full data set in tables si 3 p25 had slightly faster mb removal than p90 despite the smaller particle size of p90 neither p25 nor p90 are used in sunscreens but were analyzed to benchmark sunscreen np reactivity two of five sunscreens nps did not measurably oxidize mb three of the extracted particle suspensions oxidized mb with rate constants from 4 0 10 7 to 6 6 10 5 l mg 1 s 1 notably the highest rate constants were obtained for sunscreens that contained tio2 the highest rate constant was obtained from sunscreen d which contained both nzno and ntio2 fig 3 rate constant function of measured ti the ntio2 was anatase in crystallinity which is more photoactive than rutile luttrell et al 2014 commercial photocatalysts p25 and p90 had rate constants greater than the sunscreen particles from 1 3 10 4 to 3 0 10 4 l mg 1 s 1 and the presence of the ph buffer did not appear to extensively change the rate constant the ph 6 buffered condition was selected to ensure uv exposure experiments conducted with buffered nanoparticle extracts were comparable to unbuffered samples and to use the same conditions as the bioassays for sunscreen e mb was degraded in the ph 6 buffer but not in milli q water 5 deviation from control the acidic buffer may have removed a coating on the particle that inhibited photocatalytic activity although the particles extracted from commercial sunscreens were less reactive than commercial photocatalysts the most reactive particles were predictably anatase phase tio2 the uncoated material z cote had low photoactivity and the pdms coated z cote hp1 was not photoactive in this assay which suggests that the coating ceases oxidative species production during uv light exposure particles extracted from sunscreens that contained only zinc were either not measurably photoactive or had low photoactivity the particles extracted from sunscreen d were exceptionally hydrophobic requiring an acidic buffer for dispersion which has been shown to partially desorb or shorten the si o si backbone of the pdms coating auffan et al 2010 because of the hydrophobicity we believe the particles retained their coating and yet the particles oxidized mb when exposed to uv light therefore the ntio2 contained in sunscreen d produced ros capable of oxidizing mb in the presence of uv light despite the presence of a coating or the coating is altered or removed during extraction and storage in a way that does not affect their hydrophobicity but allows for excited electrons to pass freely the light source used in our experiments produced 4 3 8 mw cm2 of uv irradiance at the illuminator surface which is approximately 2 3 times the solar uv irradiance at ground level 2 6 mw cm2 american society for testing and materials 2016 gilmore et al 1994 hasinoff et al 2001 tan et al 2014 nps or organic sunscreens in the environment will be exposed to solar irradiance attenuated by the atmosphere included in the above value plus dissolved organic compounds and particles suspended in the water column our experiments show the likely trends in reactivity based upon np source material but the mb oxidation in our experiments is likely to be greater than would be expected in the environment none of the organic uv filters reacted with mb in the presence of uv light 5 deviation from control even up to aqueous saturation thus incorporating ntio2 may be cause for concern if excited electrons are not properly captured by a coating or if the coating is susceptible to degradation 3 5 environmental implications of sunscreen use two environmental impacts could occur in aquatic systems first our experiments and others have shown limited toxicity to zebrafish algae daphnia and other organisms in the presence of ntio2 and nzno aruoja et al 2009 baun et al 2008 rampaul et al 2007 reed et al 2012 second the photocatalytic potential of nps used in sunscreens is highly variable which may cause environmental exposure to ros and this is ignored in normal toxicity testing using the apparent rate constants fig 3 for mb loss during irradiation of nanoscale metal oxides contained in sunscreens sunscn we can estimate the steady state hydroxyl radical ho concentration following similar approaches developed by page et al and dong et al for photosensitized oxidation of pollutants by natural organic matter nom dong et al 2015 page et al 2011 the observed experimental reaction includes both ho production and mb reactions 1 s u n s c n m b h v h o k a p p 4 0 10 7 to 3 0 10 4 mgsunscn l 1 s 1 which yields 2 d m b d t k a p p s u n s c n m b the second order rate constant for ho with mb is known from pulse radiolysis experiments kishore et al 1989 3 m b h o p r o d u c t s k h o m b 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 which yields 4 d m b d t k h o mb h o mb equations 2 and 4 must be equivalent and can be solved to yield the ho concentration at any time 5 h o s s k a p p s u n s c n k h o mb fig 4 shows predictions of steady state ho production from our experiments at 1 mg l nanoparticle concentration between 0 01 and 10 fm of ho ss could form the highest ho ss would occur from p90 with sunscreen extracted nanoparticles exhibiting orders of magnitude lower ho ss levels for comparison page et al 2010 reported ho ss on the order of 0 5 5 fm during 365 nm irradiation of fulvic acids in the presence of 10 μm of a probe molecule because of their ability to form and quench ho radicals thus at least in comparing these two experiments sunscreen metals would need to be present between 1 and 10 mg l to be as reactive as radical species formed from photo excited fulvic acids these concentrations are higher than the 10 100 μg l tio2 present in wastewater effluents and what has been reported in waters used heavily for recreation gondikas et al 2014 kiser et al 2009 in contrast p25 concentrations of 0 02 0 2 mg l could produce as much ho as the fulvic acids although these concentrations are not likely in wastewater effluents furthermore it is unlikely that sunlight capable of exciting ntio2 or nzno 380 nm would penetrate deeply into natural waters because the photons are absorbed by dissolved organic matter and the uv output of the lamp used to model k app is 2 3 times more energetic than solar irradiance however in spill or other unique scenarios with high releases of sunscreens and their respective metal oxides or low dissolved organic matter concentrations the presence or accumulation of sunscreens could result in low level production of ho because the materials are catalysts they would likely continue to produce these radicals over long periods of time finally nano scale metal oxides are used in conjunction with organic uv filters rather than the sole uv filter and so any environmental effects of nano scale metal oxide releases from sunscreens are additive to the effects of organic uv filters 4 conclusions nano scale tio2 and zno have been incorporated into sunscreens over the past two decades because they have favorable uv filtering and tactile profiles and are invisible to the human eye however ntio2 and nzno can be semiconductor photocatalysts we examined the ecological implications of np release from sunscreens and found the following metal oxides in sunscreens matched well with the labeled metal oxide active ingredient either nzno or ntio2 and were extractable from the organic matrix using solvent washing and centrifugation some nps contained in sunscreens were hydrophobic likely a result of a polymer coating containing silica reduced ph stabilized the nps the organic uv filters studied here were not developmentally toxic to zebrafish even up to aqueous saturation zinc particles were more toxic to zebrafish embryogenesis than titanium although the concentrations at which this occurred were higher than would be expected in the environment organic uv filters have the potential to bioaccumulate which is the subject of multiple other studies and was not the focus of this research ntio2 and nzno extracted from sunscreens measurably degrade mb when exposed to uv light but we estimate the ros produced under normal release scenarios from wastewater or recreational bathing is lower than that produced by naturally occurring organic matter overall we find that the incorporation of np into sunscreens has limited ecological risk to the endpoints we selected however considering that np are typically used in sunscreens alongside organic uv filters the risks associated with np albeit small are additive to that of organic uv filters should np completely replace organic uv filters concerns of zinc dissolution and environmental ros production may begin to replace concerns of bioaccumulation and estrogenic activity of organic uv filters following the rise in np concentrations and fall of organic uv filter concentrations in the environment

19576,both nanoparticulate nzno and ntio2 and organic chemical ultraviolet uv filters are active ingredients in sunscreen and protect against skin cancer but limited research exists on the environmental effects of sunscreen release into aquatic systems to examine the trade offs of incorporating nanoparticles nps into sunscreens over the past two decades we targeted endpoints sensitive to the potential risks of different uv filters solar reactive oxygen production in water and disruption of zebrafish embryo development first we developed methodology to extract nanoparticles from sunscreens with organic solvents zebrafish embryos exposed to parts per million nps used in sunscreens displayed limited toxicological effects nzno particles appeared to be slightly more toxic than ntio2 at the highest concentrations in contrast seven organic uv filters did not affect zebrafish embryogenesis at or near aqueous solubility second to simulate potent photo initiated reactions upon release into water we examined methylene blue mb degradation under uv light ntio2 from sunscreen caused 10 times faster mb loss than nzno and approached the photocatalytic degradation rate of a commercial ntio2 photocatalysts p25 organic uv filters did not cause measurable mb degradation finally we estimated that between 1 and 10 ppm of sunscreen nps in surface waters could produce similar steady state hydroxyl radical concentrations as naturally occurring fluvic acids under sunlight irradiation incorporation of nps into sunscreen may increase environmental concentrations of reactive oxygen albeit to a limited extent which can influence transformation of dissolved substances and potentially affect ecosystem processes graphical abstract image 1 keywords sunscreen nanotechnology cosmetics zebrafish ecotoxicity aquatic 1 introduction sunscreen use prevents skin cancer and has been increasing since its introduction to the commercial market by eugene schuéller and l oréal in 1936 cokkinides et al 2006 robinson et al 1997 organic chemical ultraviolet uv filters and micron scale metal oxide particles were used exclusively as the active ingredients in sunscreen during the 20th century urbach 2001 nano scale metal oxide particles such as titanium dioxide ntio2 and zinc oxide nzno absorb uv light but scatter relatively little visible light and therefore the advent of nanotechnology provided materials that retained the uv filtering capability of micro scale metal oxide particles and organic uv filters but are transparent to the human eye and do not degrade in the presence of uv light because of their low cost desirable textural properties non greasy and comparable uv filtering capability metal oxide nanoparticles have become widely used active ingredients in commercial sunscreens during the past two decades the increased incorporation into cosmetics e g sunscreen moisturizers lip balm etc of both organic and inorganic sunscreens has led to higher levels of human exposure and environmental loading balmer et al 2005 gondikas et al 2014 poiger et al 2004 venkatesan et al 2018 potential adverse environmental effects of these exposures must be balanced against benefits of human skin cancer prevention two pathways of environmental release exist for uv filters 1 recreational bathing resulting in acute exposure to aquatic species and 2 wastewater discharges resulting in chronic exposure the source of uv filters in wastewater is bathing e g shower or bath water or for organic uv filters partitioning through the dermis up to 9 of the applied dose hayden et al 2005 treffel and gabard 1996 and into the blood and eventual excretion in urine as the parent compound and metabolites up to 2 of applied dose hayden et al 1997 release through these pathways has resulted in detection of organic chemicals used as uv filters in treated wastewater and recreational waters at concentrations up to 65 4 and 0 2 nm respectively balmer et al 2005 kupper et al 2006 poiger et al 2004 more than 20 organic uv filters have been approved by the european union and us food and drug administration fda for use in sunscreen formulations and have undergone extensive testing regarding their mammalian toxicity european comission 2009 food and drug administration 2016a the estrogenic effects of organic uv filters both on animals rainbow trout japanese medaka and on human cells coronado et al 2008 schlumpf et al 2001 has been studied but no significant effects were observed until the applied dose was orders of magnitude greater several μm than would be expected in the environment several nm balmer et al 2005 poiger et al 2004 or in cases of chronic exposure schlumpf et al 2008 these studies suggest that the human and environmental risks of organic uv filter use are likely low except in the case of waters heavily impacted by wastewater chronic ecological exposure or recreation high dose acute exposure ntio2 and nzno are also approved for use as uv filters by the fda nano scale formulations are not regulated separately from their micron sized counterparts because the fda does not consider these ingredients to be new from a regulatory perspective rather a shift in size distribution of an already approved ingredient food and drug administration 2016a additionally nano scale tio2 and nzno have not shown the potential to pass the epidermis of healthy skins and thus human effects are limited to the stratum corneum no live cells and thus no potential for toxicity gulson et al 2010 sadrieh et al 2010 based on available data both inorganic and organic uv filters are relatively safe from a human endpoint perspective and congruent with the fda responsibility of assuring cosmetics and dietary supplements are safe and properly labeled food and drug administration 2016b but few studies directly investigated the aquatic environmental effects of sunscreen release nano scale metal oxide uv filters are difficult to directly measure in natural waters but several experimental and modeling studies have estimated that the maximum environmental concentrations would be in the low 10s of μg l david holbrook et al 2013 gondikas et al 2014 johnson et al 2011 mueller and nowack 2008 nano scale metal oxides especially those commonly used as uv filters nzno and ntio2 are semiconductor photocatalysts and produce reactive oxygen species ros in water including superoxide and hydroxyl radicals when exposed to uv light manufacturers are thought to have circumvented this potentially hazardous property by coating the particles with al oh 3 and or polydimethylsiloxane but auffan et al 2010 suggests the coating may dissolve over time however efforts towards determining the environmental effects of nano scale metal oxide sunscreen use has been almost solely focused on ntio2 uv filters that were purchased from chemical suppliers rather than nps extracted from sunscreens themselves and may poorly represent nps used in commercially available sunscreen formulations auffan et al 2010 foltête et al 2011 fouqueray et al 2012 labille et al 2010 in general few assessments exist with the capability to directly compare nano vs chemical alternatives furthermore legacy fugacity based fate and transport models are not directly applicable to nps but current efforts include developing models specific to nps bouchard et al 2017 garner et al 2017 gottschalk et al 2013 liu and cohen 2014 meesters et al 2014 praetorius et al 2012 westerhoff and nowack 2013 therefore researchers have called for targeted experiments and inclusion of new physiochemical property measurements that are specific to the hazardous properties of nps considering the intended use and potential release hjorth et al 2016 the goal of this study was to consider two endpoints after sunscreen release scenarios to assess the ecological trade offs of replacing organic uv filters with nano scale metal oxides we studied seven organic uv filters avobenzone ecamsule iscotrizinol octocrylene octyl methoxycinnamate octyl salicylate and oxybenzone approved for use in either the european union iscotrizinol and ecamsule or the european union and the us for inorganic metal oxides a method was developed to extract the metal oxide particles from complex sunscreen matrices five different sunscreens and re suspend them in water and we compared their physical chemical properties to known ingredients commercially available for use in sunscreen products we then used two endpoints to inform environmental implications in our study 1 degradation of methylene blue mb to estimate ros production during exposure to uv light and 2 zebrafish embryo development the zebrafish embryo exposure experiment was used to determine acute developmental effects in an aquatic species that has a high potential for exposure finally data was utilized to assess the potential trade offs in risk of each class of uv filter 2 materials and methods 2 1 sunscreens and reagents seven neat organic sunscreen active ingredients i e oxybenzone avobenzone octyl salicylate octyl methoxycinnamate octocrylene iscotrizinol and ecamsule were purchased from sigma aldrich st louis mo usa at 98 purity five sunscreens labeled as containing inorganic metal oxides were purchased from local supermarkets in arizona usa in 2014 the purchased sunscreens were labeled as containing either zinc oxide or titanium dioxide and a description of the labels is shown in table 1 aeroxide tio2 p25 and p90 powders were obtained from evonik industries essen germany two nano scale zinc based uv filters intended for commercial use in sunscreen products one without a coating and one described by the vendor as having a hydrophobic coating z cote and z cote hp1 were purchased directly from the vendor tkbtrading oakland ca usa and used in control experiments as they were not incorporated into a complex sunscreen matrix reagent details can be found in the si 2 2 sample preparation our extraction method was based on previous research that used organic solvents and centrifugation to separate the sunscreen matrix from the metal oxide particulate matter barker and branch 2008 dunford et al 1997 lewicka et al 2011 rampaul et al 2007 we explored several strategies to separate nps from sunscreens and our goal was to produce a method that was robust insensitive to sunscreen brand required as few extraction steps as possible to minimize changes in particle chemistry and had the capacity for extraction to be visually confirmed during the process initial attempts to separate np sunscreen matrix explored multiple solvents of varying polarity dichloromethane dcm acetonitrile methanol and isopropanol we believed that the matrix contained mostly non polar compounds that would be soluble in non polar organic solvents after attempting to disperse and separate particles via centrifugation from the matrix we visually found that dcm provided the best separation see results the final extraction method follows approximately 5 g of sunscreen was placed in a 50 ml centrifuge tube with 20 ml dcm the solution was vortexed sonicated in a water bath for 5 min and shaken vigorously until the solution appeared homogeneous the solution was then centrifuged at 5000 rcf for 5 min the two supernatant layers oil emulsion and dcm layers were decanted leaving a solid white pellet the white pellet was suspended in 20 ml of dcm vortexed sonicated again to re disperse the pellet and then centrifuged we repeated this process a total of three times to remove organic constituents and oils while retaining the particulate matter salts and any surfactants contained in the sunscreen we then used the same centrifugation and decantation method but substituted milli q water as the solvent to remove salts and surfactants this rinsing process was also repeated three times the pellet was then washed one final time with 20 ml of dcm to remove any residual water and we removed the residual solvent using a vacuum pump line attached to a one holed stopper that fit the centrifuge tube the vacuum was then released and the sample was capped and stored in room air additional sample preparation techniques including transmission electron microscopy tem and quantification of metal in the extracted aqueous matrix are contained in the si 2 3 particle characterization of extracted nanoparticles analysis by single particle inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry spicp ms was performed on non digested samples using a thermo scientific x series ii waltham ma in time resolved data acquisition mode with a dwell time of 10 ms following methodologies described elsewhere pace et al 2011 and with details in the si in brief extracted nanoparticles were placed in polypropylene sample tubes in either milli q or ph 6 buffer and the tubes were placed in a sonicating bath for 15 min the samples were then immediately pumped into the instrument and the spectra for 49ti and 66zn were recorded we used three times the standard deviation of the spectra to delineate particle pulses from background dissolved metal tem philips cm200 fei hilsboro or usa with energy dispersive x ray analysis edx was used to measure particle size and elemental composition mean particle diameter was measured with imagej software x ray fluorescence xrf niton xl3t goldd thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa spicp ms x ray diffraction xrd x pert pro mrd panalytical inc netherlands and dynamic light scattering dls zetapals brookhaven instruments corp holtsville new york usa were also used to measure particle size metal oxide composition and crystalline structure the refractive index for dls measurements was set to 2 00 for samples containing nzno and 2 63 for samples containing ntio2 xrd data was collected using a high resolution x ray diffractometer with cu ka radiation 45 kv 40 ma using a step scan mode diffractograms were collected in a 2θ range of 10 90 at a rate of 2 min with a resolution of 0 025 2 4 uv photo reactivity assay we measured reaction kinetics between np or organic uv filters and a probe compound mb in the presence of uv b light 280 315 nm similar to published approaches lee et al 2011 the uv exposure apparatus was a 25w uvp transilluminator upland ca producing 302 nm light a 96 well plate reader was used to measure oxidation of mb at 650 nm nanoparticles extracted from sunscreens or organic uv filters were diluted into 96 well plates containing 10 mg l mb and milli q water or phosphate buffer mb photodegradation or sorption to the plate wells was negligible when mb was placed in the wells in the absence of nanoparticles and exposed to uv light mb sorption to the particles was also negligible during dark exposure experiments inorganic uv filters nanoparticle extracts were tested at multiple concentrations across multiple time points to obtain second order rate constants organic uv filters were tested at visible aqueous saturation plots of mb vs exposure duration were fit with an exponential function and r2 were typically greater than 0 9 if the exposure experiment resulted in a r2 of less than 0 9 the experiment was repeated this occurred only with p25 and p90 where the time resolution was too low in the initial experiment and the dye oxidation plateaued after less than three measurements 2 5 zebrafish assays tropical 5d wild type adult zebrafish embryos were housed at oregon state university sinnhuber aquatic research laboratory organic uv filters and nanoparticle extracts were shipped to oregon state university and stored at 3 c zebrafish assays were conducted within one month upon receipt of the samples embryos were dechorionated at 4 h post fertilization hpf and transferred into individual wells of a 96 well plate with 100 μl of prepared nanoparticle solution nanoparticle solutions were diluted with their respective suspension media either 0 1m ph 6 phosphate buffer or milli q water to achieve the desired concentration in the well zebrafish were also exposed to the clean buffer solution of milli q water embryos were statically exposed at 28 c for 120 hpf to six concentrations 1 3 log change of organic uv filters and nanoparticle extracts in replicates of 32 animals exposure plates were sealed to prevent evaporation and wrapped with aluminum foil to guard against potential photo oxidation at 24 and 120 hpf 22 morphological endpoints were assessed according to truong et al 2011 a global control was computed per experiment day and used to determine statistical significance control animal development combined with previous experience of the authors demonstrated that the wells have enough head space such that the animals do not experience hypoxia during the experiment some morphological endpoints evaluated included mortality developmental progression and yolk sac edema an additional two endpoints any effect except mortality and any effect were calculated based on aggregate data from the 22 assayed endpoints the criteria for statistical significance for these two endpoints is not automatically satisfied if a single of the other 20 endpoints is satisfied i e statistically significant deviation from control samples for any effect and any effect except mortality does not necessarily mean statistically significant effects were observed in any of the other 22 individual endpoints the zebrafish acquisition and analysis program zaap a custom program designed to inventory acquire and manage zebrafish data was used to collect developmental endpoints as either present or absent i e binary responses were recorded an internal quality assurance quality control qa qc plate consisting of 32 control animals and 32 animals exposed to 0 2 μm ziram was also run each day to check for response consistency in the animals from different hatches in the qa qc plate negative controls must exhibit less than 20 cumulative mortality and morbidity and positive ziram controls must display a notochord effect in at least 80 of the exposed animals statistical significance was computed as described in truong et al 2014 and reif et al 2016 further details are provided in the si 3 results and discussion 3 1 extraction and characterization of uv filters in sunscreens we based our initial methods to extract nanoparticles from sunscreens on prior research that used centrifugation methods with solvents of varying polarity e g chloroform acetone isopropanol methanol and hexane lewicka et al 2011 rampaul et al 2007 dcm was determined to be the most practical solvent to achieve the key criterion of phase separation after homogenization with solvent followed by centrifugation when the sunscreen was homogenized in methanol it was difficult to visually distinguish a pellet because the white matrix emulsion components did not separate from the solvent phase polymers oils etc and obscured the pellet isopropanol and acetonitrile had relatively transparent solvent phases but the extracted material was visually more voluminous than a pellet of agglomerated metal oxide would be expected to appear after centrifugation the extracted material likely included surfactants that are insoluble in isopropanol or acetonitrile it may have been possible to later wash these surfactants out with water however dcm provided a density gradient separation with much of the sunscreen emulsion constituents contained in a distinct white colored layer above a transparent dcm layer figure si 1 dcm is also the most volatile of the solvents tested and solvent removal was straightforward with the aid of a vacuum pump heating the extracted pellets not used in subsequent experiments in air in a 550 c furnace for 24 h resulted in less than 2 6 mass loss organic matter for all dcm extracted samples thus the extracted pellets were nearly entirely inorganic material while all solvents tested may have resulted in similar extracted products after multiple washings with organic solvent followed by water we preferred to use dcm because we could visually observe the pellet the pellet was composed of inorganic material based on thermal gravimetric measurements and because dcm is highly volatile allowing us to rapidly remove the solvent via a vacuum pump after separation from the sunscreen matrix we characterized the extracted material initially we used tem to determine extracted particle sizes representative images are shown in fig 1 and particle sizing results are shown in table 1 sunscreens a and b were mostly rod shaped particles while sunscreen e contained irregular or spherical particles sunscreen c contained mostly amorphous particles and sunscreen d contained rod shaped zn particles and amorphous ti particles both z cote formulations contained amorphous zn particles but particles in the hp1 formulation were slightly more rod shaped than the uncoated formulation by tem the as purchased sunscreens contained a significant amount of organic carbon and these shapes were nearly absent in the particles extracted with dcm figure si 2 indicating the extraction method removed the sunscreen matrix leaving the metal oxide np for sunscreens a c and e we also compared the particles size distribution of the extracted particles to the particles retained in the oil emulsion phase figure si 1 particle length and width distributions between the extracted particles and those that were not extracted for sunscreen a were not statistically different the diameter of the extracted particles in sunscreen e was also not significantly different from the oil emulsion phase but the amorphous particles extracted from sunscreen c were slightly greater in size than those retained in the emulsion layer one way anova with tukey s hsd p 0 05 table 1 this may indicate that we selected for slightly larger particles during centrifugation in this specific sunscreen or that the particles aggregated differently between samples during drying of the tem grid nonetheless the extracted particles from sunscreen c were still relatively small mean diameter 136 nm and relevant to environmental exposure studies we analyzed the particles by spicp ms after dispersion of the particles into milli q water and found that the measured ti particle size distributions appear as folded normal distributions figure si 3 which indicated that a significant fraction of the particles were smaller than the minimum size detection limit of spicp ms i e smaller than 80 nm lee et al 2014 this is not surprising because the mean particle sizes found by tem was 60 nm we did not attempt to measure zn nanoparticles because the particles sizes in the extracts and the size detection limit for zn by spicp ms are similar furthermore the zn nps were clearly rod shaped fig 1 and spicp ms calculations determine equivalent np size using an assumption of spherical particles edx analysis in each of the extracted samples showed that nearly all sunscreens contained either ti or zn particles and the material matched well with the metal oxide on the label of the sunscreen in one spectrum with extended counting time of sunscreen e si and al were observed which has previously been attributed to an organic and inorganic coating auffan et al 2010 si and al were not observed in other sunscreen samples but most edx spectra were recorded with reduced counting time an example of one representative sunscreen and an edx spot analysis is shown in figure si 4 confirmation of the expected metal oxides was conducted using xrd and the peaks also matched well with the labeled metal oxide either nzno or ntio2 the peak positions and relative intensities for ntio2 and nzno were referenced from the icdd database zno 01 070 8072 tio2 anatase 01 070 6826 tio2 rutile 01 072 4814 the ntio2 crystallinity in sunscreens d and e was anatase and rutile respectively figure si 5 z cote and z cote hp1 contained peaks consistent with zno when the extracted particles were dispersed in water for aqueous experiments we found that some particles were readily dispersible extracted particles from sunscreens c and e and z cote p25 and p90 other nps particles extracted from sunscreens a b and d and z cote hp1 exhibited hydrophobic characteristics poor dispersion in water after vortexing and sonication and instantaneous association with the walls of the polypropylene tube and at the air water interface the meniscus of the aqueous phase was also inverted convex indicating either a reduction in the surface affinity repulsion to the polypropylene coated with the nps or less likely greater affinity between the aqueous phase and the remaining suspended nps notably the label of sunscreens b and c described them as containing z cote and the z cote hp1 formulation is sold as a hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane pdms coated formulation of z cote nzno particles others have also reported finding pdms and al oh 3 coatings on nanoparticles used in sunscreen formulations auffan et al 2010 xrf confirmed that the as received powder z cote hp1 particles contained approximately 0 2 si detection limit 0 02 similar to the 2 found by auffan et al on another sunscreen formulation in this study si in the uncoated z cote formulation was below the xrf detection limit we believe that a hydrophobic coating potentially pdms was responsible for the hydrophobic characteristics of the particles extracted from sunscreens a b d and z cote hp1 we expect little or no pdms dissolution during extraction from the sunscreen because of the short contact periods with dcm although dcm may have caused some pdms swelling during extraction swelling was likely reversed during solvent removal lee et al 2003 we assume that the three commercial sunscreens that exhibited strong hydrophobicity were likely to have similar coatings other researchers were able to alter the hydrophobic pdms coating on commercial nanoparticles in minutes by suspending them in ph 5 buffer solutions the change in hydrophobicity was attributed to degradation of the si o si backbone and or desorption of the polymer from the np surface auffan et al 2010 our goal was not to completely remove the coating but to stabilize the nps in an environmentally relevant matrix while minimizing artificial changes to the materials and coatings we placed the pellets of hydrophobic material into 0 1m ph 6 phosphate buffer and sonicated 0 1m was selected as the buffer concentration to maintain sufficient buffering capacity in further experiments where the solutions are dilute e g zebrafish exposures the nps were significantly more stable in solution at this ph although some settling occurred over 24 h the solutions were still opaque while the nanoparticles were relatively stable in solution at ph 6 we did not observe the same hydrophobicity change as the previous researchers after we washed out the ph 6 buffer and dispersed the particles in milli q water even after 1 month of storage thus we elected to conduct aqueous studies at ph 6 for these sunscreens we also selected for the most environmentally relevant particles by decanting a particle suspension after 24 h of settling in ph 6 buffer overall our findings of particle shape and size distribution are similar to previous findings zn particles were typically rod shaped and ti particles were smaller either rod shaped with slightly sharper edges previously described as needle shaped lewicka et al 2011 or small spheres the image of sunscreen d in fig 1 contained both zn and ti and provides an excellent example of this dichotomy 3 2 characterization of organic uv filters organic uv filters are generally small compounds and those studied here have molecular weight between 228 and 766 da the low aqueous solubility of the organic uv filters that afford them their water resistant properties also results in high octanol water partition coefficients log kow ranging from 3 6 to 12 4 chemicalize org 2016 physical chemical characteristics of the organic uv filters contained in tables si 1 logd values were calculated for each organic sunscreen for ph 8 and values ranging from 0 7 to 12 indicating lipophilicity partitioning to fats and likely bioaccumulation bioconcentration factors bcf calculated using episuite us epa 2016 for each compound ranged from 3 to 16 120 l kg notably iscotrizinol and ecamsule had the lowest potential for bioaccumulation 3 l kg but are not approved for use in the us although these are only predicted bcfs several studies corroborate this evidence with environmental measurements bachelot et al 2012 buser et al 2006 tsui et al 2017 bioaccumulation of some nanoparticles has been reported hou et al 2013 lópez serrano et al 2014 but bcf values appear to be lower for nps than many of the organic uv filter chemicals therefore although it was not the goal of our experiments to determine chronic exposure trade offs because there is already a significant effort in the literature aimed at this goal it is notable that replacement of organic uv filters with nps may reduce the potential ecological effects associated with chronic exposure and bioaccumulation of organic uv filters 3 3 zebrafish developmental effects zebrafish were exposed to nanoparticles extracted from sunscreens and to organic uv filters and our goal was to compare the tradeoffs of substituting nps for organic chemicals to a potential environmental exposure endpoint i e zebrafish embryos the organic uv filters did not impact animal development over 5 days even when tested at aqueous saturation suggesting that estrogenic effects reported by others may be limited to specific susceptible species or repeated exposure coronado et al 2008 three of the particle extracts sunscreens a b and d and z cote all which contain nzno resulted in statistically significant effects to the embryo development at the relatively high concentrations tested fig 2 raw data contained in tables si 2 both the particles from sunscreen b and d caused statistically significant mortality because we only observed effects in animals exposed to zn particles these deviations from normal development may be due to zn dissolution from the particle i e zn ion induced toxicity rather than nzno particles bohme et al 2017 reed et al 2012 other samples were not tested at such elevated concentrations because the resulting particle extracts were not concentrated enough to allow for such high doses i e lack of stable suspension during 24 h quiescent period but also because exposures greater than 1 mg l are not likely to be environmentally relevant overall the concentrations dosed are considerably higher than would be expected in the environment thus these nanoparticles are expected to have little or no impacts on zebrafish 3 4 photocatalytic properties of inorganic and organic uv filters nzno and ntio2 can be photocatalysts which causes concern that the inorganic uv filters used in sunscreens may produce ros on skin or in the environment when exposed to sunlight to investigate this we exposed the nanoparticles extracted from sunscreen to 302 nm light 25w in the presence of a sacrificial mb dye for p25 increasing np dose and uv irradiation time led to greater mb oxidation pseudo first order rate constants from each np dose experiment were obtained figure si 6 and used to determine pseudo second order rate constants l mg 1 s 1 as illustrated in fig 3 full data set in tables si 3 p25 had slightly faster mb removal than p90 despite the smaller particle size of p90 neither p25 nor p90 are used in sunscreens but were analyzed to benchmark sunscreen np reactivity two of five sunscreens nps did not measurably oxidize mb three of the extracted particle suspensions oxidized mb with rate constants from 4 0 10 7 to 6 6 10 5 l mg 1 s 1 notably the highest rate constants were obtained for sunscreens that contained tio2 the highest rate constant was obtained from sunscreen d which contained both nzno and ntio2 fig 3 rate constant function of measured ti the ntio2 was anatase in crystallinity which is more photoactive than rutile luttrell et al 2014 commercial photocatalysts p25 and p90 had rate constants greater than the sunscreen particles from 1 3 10 4 to 3 0 10 4 l mg 1 s 1 and the presence of the ph buffer did not appear to extensively change the rate constant the ph 6 buffered condition was selected to ensure uv exposure experiments conducted with buffered nanoparticle extracts were comparable to unbuffered samples and to use the same conditions as the bioassays for sunscreen e mb was degraded in the ph 6 buffer but not in milli q water 5 deviation from control the acidic buffer may have removed a coating on the particle that inhibited photocatalytic activity although the particles extracted from commercial sunscreens were less reactive than commercial photocatalysts the most reactive particles were predictably anatase phase tio2 the uncoated material z cote had low photoactivity and the pdms coated z cote hp1 was not photoactive in this assay which suggests that the coating ceases oxidative species production during uv light exposure particles extracted from sunscreens that contained only zinc were either not measurably photoactive or had low photoactivity the particles extracted from sunscreen d were exceptionally hydrophobic requiring an acidic buffer for dispersion which has been shown to partially desorb or shorten the si o si backbone of the pdms coating auffan et al 2010 because of the hydrophobicity we believe the particles retained their coating and yet the particles oxidized mb when exposed to uv light therefore the ntio2 contained in sunscreen d produced ros capable of oxidizing mb in the presence of uv light despite the presence of a coating or the coating is altered or removed during extraction and storage in a way that does not affect their hydrophobicity but allows for excited electrons to pass freely the light source used in our experiments produced 4 3 8 mw cm2 of uv irradiance at the illuminator surface which is approximately 2 3 times the solar uv irradiance at ground level 2 6 mw cm2 american society for testing and materials 2016 gilmore et al 1994 hasinoff et al 2001 tan et al 2014 nps or organic sunscreens in the environment will be exposed to solar irradiance attenuated by the atmosphere included in the above value plus dissolved organic compounds and particles suspended in the water column our experiments show the likely trends in reactivity based upon np source material but the mb oxidation in our experiments is likely to be greater than would be expected in the environment none of the organic uv filters reacted with mb in the presence of uv light 5 deviation from control even up to aqueous saturation thus incorporating ntio2 may be cause for concern if excited electrons are not properly captured by a coating or if the coating is susceptible to degradation 3 5 environmental implications of sunscreen use two environmental impacts could occur in aquatic systems first our experiments and others have shown limited toxicity to zebrafish algae daphnia and other organisms in the presence of ntio2 and nzno aruoja et al 2009 baun et al 2008 rampaul et al 2007 reed et al 2012 second the photocatalytic potential of nps used in sunscreens is highly variable which may cause environmental exposure to ros and this is ignored in normal toxicity testing using the apparent rate constants fig 3 for mb loss during irradiation of nanoscale metal oxides contained in sunscreens sunscn we can estimate the steady state hydroxyl radical ho concentration following similar approaches developed by page et al and dong et al for photosensitized oxidation of pollutants by natural organic matter nom dong et al 2015 page et al 2011 the observed experimental reaction includes both ho production and mb reactions 1 s u n s c n m b h v h o k a p p 4 0 10 7 to 3 0 10 4 mgsunscn l 1 s 1 which yields 2 d m b d t k a p p s u n s c n m b the second order rate constant for ho with mb is known from pulse radiolysis experiments kishore et al 1989 3 m b h o p r o d u c t s k h o m b 1 2 10 10 m 1 s 1 which yields 4 d m b d t k h o mb h o mb equations 2 and 4 must be equivalent and can be solved to yield the ho concentration at any time 5 h o s s k a p p s u n s c n k h o mb fig 4 shows predictions of steady state ho production from our experiments at 1 mg l nanoparticle concentration between 0 01 and 10 fm of ho ss could form the highest ho ss would occur from p90 with sunscreen extracted nanoparticles exhibiting orders of magnitude lower ho ss levels for comparison page et al 2010 reported ho ss on the order of 0 5 5 fm during 365 nm irradiation of fulvic acids in the presence of 10 μm of a probe molecule because of their ability to form and quench ho radicals thus at least in comparing these two experiments sunscreen metals would need to be present between 1 and 10 mg l to be as reactive as radical species formed from photo excited fulvic acids these concentrations are higher than the 10 100 μg l tio2 present in wastewater effluents and what has been reported in waters used heavily for recreation gondikas et al 2014 kiser et al 2009 in contrast p25 concentrations of 0 02 0 2 mg l could produce as much ho as the fulvic acids although these concentrations are not likely in wastewater effluents furthermore it is unlikely that sunlight capable of exciting ntio2 or nzno 380 nm would penetrate deeply into natural waters because the photons are absorbed by dissolved organic matter and the uv output of the lamp used to model k app is 2 3 times more energetic than solar irradiance however in spill or other unique scenarios with high releases of sunscreens and their respective metal oxides or low dissolved organic matter concentrations the presence or accumulation of sunscreens could result in low level production of ho because the materials are catalysts they would likely continue to produce these radicals over long periods of time finally nano scale metal oxides are used in conjunction with organic uv filters rather than the sole uv filter and so any environmental effects of nano scale metal oxide releases from sunscreens are additive to the effects of organic uv filters 4 conclusions nano scale tio2 and zno have been incorporated into sunscreens over the past two decades because they have favorable uv filtering and tactile profiles and are invisible to the human eye however ntio2 and nzno can be semiconductor photocatalysts we examined the ecological implications of np release from sunscreens and found the following metal oxides in sunscreens matched well with the labeled metal oxide active ingredient either nzno or ntio2 and were extractable from the organic matrix using solvent washing and centrifugation some nps contained in sunscreens were hydrophobic likely a result of a polymer coating containing silica reduced ph stabilized the nps the organic uv filters studied here were not developmentally toxic to zebrafish even up to aqueous saturation zinc particles were more toxic to zebrafish embryogenesis than titanium although the concentrations at which this occurred were higher than would be expected in the environment organic uv filters have the potential to bioaccumulate which is the subject of multiple other studies and was not the focus of this research ntio2 and nzno extracted from sunscreens measurably degrade mb when exposed to uv light but we estimate the ros produced under normal release scenarios from wastewater or recreational bathing is lower than that produced by naturally occurring organic matter overall we find that the incorporation of np into sunscreens has limited ecological risk to the endpoints we selected however considering that np are typically used in sunscreens alongside organic uv filters the risks associated with np albeit small are additive to that of organic uv filters should np completely replace organic uv filters concerns of zinc dissolution and environmental ros production may begin to replace concerns of bioaccumulation and estrogenic activity of organic uv filters following the rise in np concentrations and fall of organic uv filter concentrations in the environment

19577,the integration of adsorbents with ultrafiltration uf membranes is a promising method for alleviating membrane fouling and reducing land use however adsorbents typically are only injected into the membrane tank once resulting in a single dynamic protection layer and low removal efficiency over long term operation in addition the granular adsorbents used can cause membrane surface damage to overcome these disadvantages we injected inexpensive and loose aluminum al based flocs directly into a membrane tank with bottom aeration in the presence of humic acid ha or raw water taken from the miyun reservoir beijing china results showed that the flocs were well suspended in the membrane tank and multiple dynamic floc protection layers were formed sandwich like on the membrane surface with multiple batch injections higher frequency floc injections resulted in better floc utilization efficiency and less severe membrane fouling with continuous injection acid solutions demonstrated better performance in removing ha molecules especially those with small molecular weight and in alleviating membrane fouling compared with the use of high aeration rate or polyacrylamide injection this was attributed to the small particle size large specific surface area and high zeta potential of the flocs additionally excellent uf membrane performance was exhibited by reservoir water with continuous injection and acid solution based on the outstanding uf membrane performance this innovative integrated filtration with loose al based flocs has great application potential for water treatment

advanced separation technology have been widely used in drinking water and wastewater treatment huang et al 2009 tang et al 2017 the installed capacities of low pressure membrane systems have grown exponentially in the last few decades furukawa 2008 however membrane fouling is inevitable due to the accumulation of pollutants in membrane pores and the formation of dense cake layers of most concern fouling can increase the energy costs of membrane filtration due to the development of large hydraulic resistance and high transmembrane pressure tmp kimura et al 2004 as a result the sustainability of membranes in water treatment is limited most studies have demonstrated that pore constriction pore blockage and cake layer formation are the main fouling mechanisms of membranes huang et al 2008 2009 cai et al 2013 polyakov and zydney 2013 tang et al 2017 membrane flux can dramatically decrease at the beginning of the filtration process because many foulant aggregates are deposited on the membrane surface or in membrane pores leading to pore constriction and blockage the faster the reduction in membrane flux the more likely the occurrence of pore constriction and blockage is ho and zydney 2000 conversely when cake layer formation is the main fouling mechanism membrane flux decline is relatively slow wintgens et al 2003 wang and tarabara 2008 wu et al 2011 to effectively alleviate membrane fouling different pretreatment technologies including pre adsorption direct filtration and integrated filtration have shown considerable potential in pollutant removal kim et al 2010 gao et al 2011 feng et al 2015 yu et al 2015 traditional pre adsorption technology has shown moderately good performance in water treatment plants dong et al 2007 masmoudi et al 2016 however many small molecular weight mw substances remain after sedimentation resulting in severe membrane fouling by pore constriction and dense cake layer formation yu et al 2015 in addition this technology requires a relatively large land area during actual operation to overcome these shortcomings direct filtration in which the sedimentation tank has been removed has been researched and applied in water treatment plants xiao et al 2013 shang et al 2015 yu et al 2015 however although only a loose cake layer is formed and membrane fouling is alleviated compared with the pre adsorption process the sludge production rate is high resulting in considerable sludge discharge and rapid microbial growth in the membrane tanks baker 2012 to overcome these issues the emerging technique of integrated filtration has become a new area of focus ajmani et al 2012 cai et al 2013 ma et al 2015 in integrated filtration adsorbents are pre deposited onto the membrane surface or pre injected into the membrane tank to form a loose dynamic protection layer resulting in excellent membrane performance kim et al 2008 2010 ajmani et al 2012 ma et al 2013 however adsorbents are pre deposited or injected only once resulting in the formation of a single dynamic layer with low floc utilization efficiency as a result the removal efficiency of pollutants is gradually reduced over time and a dense cake layer is formed on the protective layer by pollutants leading to severe membrane fouling ma et al 2015 in addition most currently investigated granular adsorbents including heated iron oxide particles zhang et al 2003 carbon nanotubes ajmani et al 2012 powdered activated carbon cai et al 2013 and nanoscale zerovalent iron ma et al 2015 are either expensive or easily cause membrane surface damage after long term operation thus for practical operation it is necessary to explore new adsorbents and methods to further improve the performance of the integrated membrane process aluminum al and iron fe salts are widely used as coagulants and demonstrate high pollutant removal efficiencies their excellent performance is due to the stronger adsorption abilities of flocs compared with pre made adsorbents especially for organic matter kimura et al 2005 amjad et al 2015 ang et al 2015 he et al 2015 yu et al 2016 compared with fe based salts less corrosion occurs in the presence of al based salts zhao and zhang 2011 herein to overcome the disadvantages and improve application of integrated filtration in actual operation inexpensive and loose flocs formed by hydrolysis of al based salts were directly injected into a membrane tank in the presence of a hollow fiber uf membrane to fully utilize the adsorbents and improve membrane performance the flocs were suspended in the membrane tank by bottom aeration humic substances hs commonly exist in natural waters and can range from a few mg l to a few hundred mg l c wall and choppin 2003 however the presence of hs can cause environmental and health problems such as providing food for undesirable bacteria in water bai and zhang 2001 hs can also bind with heavy metals or biocides yielding high concentrations of these substances and enhancing their transport in water schmitt et al 2003 and can react with chlorine during water treatment to form disinfection by products such as trihalomethane wang et al 2015 furthermore hs can compete with low mw synthetic organic chemicals and inorganic pollutants reducing their adsorption rates and equilibrium capacities klausen et al 2003 and can act as a major foulant causing serious micro ultrafiltration membrane fouling due to its large mw distribution yuan and zydney 2000 herein to test the integrated floc and uf membrane process the membrane performance and removal efficiency of hs were investigated in addition to fully understand the characteristics of the dynamic protection layer the factors responsible for membrane fouling such as injection dosage and frequency aeration rate and solution ph were investigated moreover to clarify the practicability of the integrated floc and uf membrane process raw water taken from the miyun reservoir n 40 29 e 116 49 the main drinking water resource for beijing was also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemical reagents used including alcl3 6h2o hcl naoh and polyacrylamide were of analytical grade and were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china deionized di millipore milli q usa water was used in the experiments humic acid sodium salt ha sigma aldrich usa a hs representative was dissolved in tap water beijing china at a concentration of 20 mg l all chemical stock solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c table 1 shows the specific characteristics of the feed water with ha and the specific properties of the source water from miyun reservoir 2 2 floc preparation for floc preparation alcl3 6h2o was dissolved in 400 ml of tap water beijing each time with the solution ph adjusted to 7 5 using 1 m naoh to prevent high al concentrations in the effluent after filtration the prepared flocs were washed with di water three times before injecting almost 60 of al species are solid hydrolysis products mainly al oh 3 at ph 7 5 zhao et al 2009 with the main characteristics shown in table s1 thus the concentration of the al based flocs calculated as al same below was 60 of the concentration of the al based coagulants 2 3 filtration progress a schematic diagram of the membrane process is shown in fig s1 the membrane tank had an inner diameter of 64 mm and a height of 800 mm a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membrane motimo china was used with a mw cutoff mwco of 100 kda the effluent from the submerged membrane module was withdrawn using a peristaltic pump 20 l m 2 h 1 the filtration cycle was 30 min followed by 1 min of backwashing 40 l m 2 h 1 a water level gauge was used to control the water level and a ceramic aeration device diameter 40 mm was placed at the bottom to ensure that the flocs were well suspended in the membrane tank all flocs were prepared just before injection to maintain activity chen et al 2015 and were directly injected into the membrane tank once every 8 4 or 2 d by syringe or by continuous injection with a peristaltic pump the tmp was monitored by pressure sensors the hydraulic retention time was maintained at 2 2 h and the accumulated sludge was not released during filtration to prevent the formation of biopolymer by the development of microorganisms the system was operated for 11 d due to residual chlorine table 1 tap water was used to wash away the cake layer on the membrane surface after 8 d of operation samples were always taken before the next injection except under the continuous injection treatment all experiments were carried out in duplicate 2 4 characteristics of flocs in the membrane tank during filtration floc samples were taken from below the surface of the suspension in the absence of ha with a hollow glass tube floc images were captured using an optical microscope equipped with a ccd camera ge 5 aigo china the specific surface areas of the flocs were analyzed by the brunauer emmett teller method bet asap2020hd88 usa the zeta potentials of the flocs before and after adsorption were measured by a nano particle sizing and zeta potential analyzer beckman coulter ltd usa 2 5 other analytical measurements the ph was measured by a ph meter orion usa uf membranes with different mwco were used to grade ha molecules and the uf fraction method was used to investigate the corresponding removal efficiencies for different mw distributions aiken 1984 lin et al 1999 the mw distributions were determined by gel permeation chromatography gpc agilent technologies usa and removal efficiency was calculated by the difference in peak areas ma et al 2015 additionally images of the layered membrane surface were obtained using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7401f jeol ltd japan 3 results 3 1 effect of floc dosage and injection frequency on tmp development to determine the membrane performance of the integrated process tmp development induced by ha with without flocs was investigated fig 1 results showed considerable membrane fouling caused by ha alone and tmp significantly increased to 50 7 kpa on day 8 after careful washing with tap water the corresponding tmp immediately decreased to 10 1 kpa indicating that cake layer formation by ha was the main fouling mechanism compared with the tmp caused by ha alone membrane fouling was alleviated with one time floc injection with higher floc doses also resulting in less severe membrane fouling the tmp values were 33 1 27 3 and 23 2 kpa in the presence of 6 5 13 0 and 26 0 mm flocs respectively on day 8 fig 1a after careful washing with tap water the corresponding tmp dramatically decreased to 6 8 5 2 and 4 9 kpa respectively to further clarify membrane performance tmp development with multiple batch injections was investigated in the presence of 13 0 and 26 0 mm flocs fig 1b and c for 13 0 mm flocs the tmp was gradually reduced with injections once every 8 13 mm time 4 6 5 mm time and 2 3 25 mm time d with corresponding tmp values of 27 3 20 8 and 15 7 kpa respectively on day 8 however the tmp increased to 18 6 kpa by day 8 under continuous injection conditions 0 05 l h same below for 26 0 mm flocs membrane fouling gradually declined with increasing injection frequency the corresponding tmp values were 23 2 18 3 and 15 1 kpa on day 8 following injections once every 8 26 mm time 4 13 mm time and 2 6 5 mm time d respectively when continuous injections were used membrane fouling was further alleviated and the tmp was only 10 1 kpa on day 8 as seen from fig 1b and c the tmp dramatically decreased after careful washing with tap water on day 8 which also showed that cake layer formation was the primary fouling mechanism 3 2 effect of injection frequency on ha removal efficiency the uf membrane performed better in the presence of 26 0 mm flocs than 13 0 mm flocs thus 26 0 mm flocs same below were further investigated with batch injections fig 2 fig 2a shows that the concentration of ha in the effluent was reduced with the floc injections however the removal efficiency of ha slightly increased after 8 d of operation with one time injection the removal efficiency of ha by the membrane alone was 29 2 but the efficiency only increased to 38 3 in the presence of 26 0 mm flocs on day 8 for the one time injection mode due to the removal of ha molecules the peak value of ha mw distribution in the effluent declined from 11294 2 da to 9973 7 da fig 2b shows that the removal efficiency of ha was gradually reduced over time with one time injection the corresponding removal efficiency of ha was 83 1 2 3 on day 2 declining to 38 3 3 1 on day 8 with increasing injection frequency the removal efficiency of ha increased over time especially by day 8 the removal efficiency of ha was 38 3 3 1 with one time injection but this increased to 69 2 2 2 on day 8 under continuous injection in addition the variation in the removal efficiency of ha molecules became smaller with increasing injection frequency the variation reached 44 8 3 1 between day 2 and day 8 with one time injection but decreased to 4 1 1 9 between day 2 and day 8 under continuous injection furthermore the total removal efficiency of ha increased with increasing injection frequency from 62 2 2 3 with one time injection to 70 3 2 8 with continuous injection fig s2 due to the high removal efficiency of ha molecules the peak value of the ha mw distribution significantly decreased from 9973 7 da under one time injection treatment to 7819 1 da under continuous injection treatment after 8 d fig 2a due to the large variation in the mw of ha the corresponding removal efficiencies were further investigated fig 2c for comparison the results for permeate samples from a pristine pvdf uf membrane are also presented as seen from fig 2c the removal efficiency of large ha molecules 30 kda by the membrane alone was 43 1 2 2 whereas those for the medium 3 30 kda and small 3 kda ha molecules were 37 3 1 6 and 6 4 1 8 respectively on day 4 with similar results occurring on day 8 when the flocs were injected in batches the removal efficiencies of the different mw ha molecules were higher on day 8 than on day 4 with increasing injection frequency the removal efficiency of ha also increased especially for the smaller molecules on day 4 and day 8 the removal efficiencies of the small mw ha molecules 3 kda were 19 7 2 6 and 22 9 1 6 respectively with injections every 4 d but increased to 52 9 4 5 and 54 3 3 2 respectively under continuous injection treatment in comparison with the large 30 kda and medium 3 30 kda mw ha molecules the removal efficiency of the small mw ha molecules 3 kda was much lower which was largely influenced by injection frequency and running time 3 3 effect of aeration rate and polyacrylamide on uf membrane performance due to its better uf membrane performance sections 3 1 and 3 2 continuous injection was further investigated as aeration rate plays an important role in floc characteristics including particle size and membrane attachment ability ma et al 2017 uf membrane performance was tested with different aeration rates fig 3 results showed that tmp development slowed with increasing aeration rate and was 10 1 8 8 and 5 8 kpa under 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 l min respectively fig 3a however the removal efficiency and peak value variation were influenced little under different aeration rates fig 3b as reported previously ma et al 2017 in comparison to the aeration rate polyacrylamide has the potential to enhance the adsorption ability of flocs aguilar et al 2005 to strengthen the removal efficiency of the multiple layers and reduce membrane fouling anionic polyacrylamide apam was used due to the positively charged al based flocs 1 4 0 3 mv and negatively charged uf membrane at ph 7 5 childress and elimelech 1996 however severe uf membrane fouling occurred as a function of time fig 3c tmp significantly increased with increasing apam dosage from 10 1 kpa to 35 7 kpa 0 1 mg l and 76 3 kpa 1 mg l on day 8 fig 3d shows that the removal efficiency of ha was also influenced little in the presence of apam the removal efficiency of ha only increased from 70 8 without apam to 76 5 1 mg l apam and the peak value of ha declined from 7819 1 da without apam to 7565 8 da 1 mg l apam in addition owing to the limited influence of the aeration rate and apam injection on ha removal the corresponding removal efficiencies of different mw ha were similar to those with continuous injection data not shown 3 4 effect of ph on tmp development and ha removal efficiency due to the variation in particle size and fractal dimension solution ph also plays an important role in determining floc characteristics feng et al 2015 fig 4 shows the uf membrane performance under different ph conditions as seen from fig 4a the tmp increased much more slowly at ph 6 than at ph 9 over time after 8 d of operation the tmp increased to 7 1 10 1 and 16 3 kpa at ph 6 ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively after washing with tap water the tmp dramatically decreased indicating that cake layer formation was the primary fouling mechanism the corresponding removal efficiencies of ha were 92 9 70 8 and 59 7 at ph 6 ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively along with the removal efficiency of ha the peak value of ha in the effluent varied ranging from 11294 2 da to 5660 5 da fig 4b in comparison to the use of high aeration rate and apam injection the removal efficiency of different mw ha molecules significantly increased with lower solution ph especially at ph 6 this showed that large 30 kda and medium 3 30 kda mw ha molecules were almost totally removed and the removal efficiency of small 3 kda mw ha molecules was higher than 90 3 5 uf membrane performance with raw water to test the practicability of the integrated uf membrane process raw water taken from miyun reservoir was used table 1 based on the excellent uf membrane performance presented in section 3 4 al based flocs were also continuously injected into the membrane tank at a ph of 6 and aeration rate of 0 1 l min as seen from fig 5 a severe uf membrane fouling occurred without pretreatment and the tmp gradually increased to 15 1 kpa on day 8 however with the continuous injection of flocs tmp development was dramatically reduced and only increased to 4 7 kpa by day 8 after washing the tmp significantly decreased indicating that cake layer formation was the main fouling mechanism owing to the existence of doc table 1 the corresponding removal efficiency and mw variation were further investigated as seen from fig 5b two peak values at 10023 1 da and 5972 4 da were observed due to the complexity of the raw water compared to the mw distribution of ha 50 kda fig 2a the raw water mw distribution was smaller 20 kda as shown in fig 5b both large 10 kda and small mw organic matter 10 kda were largely removed with rates of 83 5 and 51 4 with the removal of organic matter the large peak gradually declined from 10023 1 da to 8129 1 da though the small peak remained the same before and after filtration 5972 4 da 4 discussion due to the large mw distribution of ha molecules cake layer formation was found to be the primary fouling mechanism during uf membrane filtration fig 1a the specific particle size distribution of ha was measured fig 6 a showing two peak values at 14 1 nm volume 22 2 at 141 8 nm volume 9 1 due to the characteristics of ha ma et al 2014 the average membrane pore size provided by the manufacturer was 25 nm thus because of large ha molecule interference the chance of pore constriction blockage was relatively low and severe membrane fouling was much more likely caused by dense cake layer formation yuan and zydney 2000 the tmp significantly increased to 50 7 kpa on day 8 but immediately decreased to 10 1 kpa after the membrane was washed with tap water when flocs were injected into the membrane tank only once most ha molecules were easily adsorbed or rejected by the flocs the more flocs were injected the more ha molecules were removed as shown in fig 6b the average particle size of the al based flocs at ph 7 5 was 161 7 18 6 μm much larger than the membrane pore diameter and the specific surface area was 251 7 9 1 m2 g as a result membrane fouling caused by the loose flocs alone was negligible after 8 d of operation data not shown the zeta potentials also showed that the ha molecules were easily adsorbed by the al based flocs the zeta potential of the al based flocs was 1 4 0 3 mv at ph 7 5 whereas the corresponding zeta potential of the ha molecules was 29 2 3 7 mv therefore a loose cake layer was gradually formed by the flocs after adsorbing ha leading to the alleviation of membrane fouling especially under large floc doses fig 1a the tmp was 50 7 kpa on day 8 in the absence of flocs but decreased to 33 1 27 3 and 23 2 kpa in the presence of 6 5 13 0 and 26 0 mm flocs respectively when flocs were injected in batches their utilization efficiency increased due to the multiple floc layers formed the higher the frequency of the floc injections the greater the number of dynamic layers that were formed fig 7 shows the morphology of the cake layer in the membrane tank on day 8 under an injection frequency of 4 and 2 d 26 0 mm flocs a floc protection layer was formed with a sandwich like structure the average thickness of the floc cake layer was 1 77 0 14 mm under 4 d injection frequency whereas the average thickness was reduced to 0 71 0 06 mm under 2 d injection frequency although the thickness was smaller under higher injection frequency more layers were formed leading to higher ha removal efficiency and slower tmp development figs 1 and 2 because of the particle size distribution of the ha molecules the corresponding removal efficiency of the uf membrane alone was only 29 2 when the flocs were injected once although a protection layer was formed on the membrane surface most inner flocs could not be used thus the removal efficiency of ha only increased to 38 3 on day 8 in the presence of 26 0 mm flocs the higher the injection frequency of the flocs the greater the number of protection layers formed and the higher the utilization efficiency of the flocs as a result continuous injection showed much better performance and the variation in ha removal efficiency was much smaller with higher total removal efficiency fig s2 in addition the peak value was further reduced from 11294 2 da to 7819 1 da under continuous injection after 8 d fig 2a it should be noted however that once the concentration of ha molecules entering the membrane tank exceeded the maximum adsorption ability with continuous injection fewer ha molecules were removed and more serious membrane fouling occurred fig 1b and c for the removal of different mw ha molecules large 30 kda and medium 3 30 kda mw ha molecules were relatively easily removed rejected by the uf membrane alone due to their large particle size although different mw ha molecules could be largely removed in the beginning when flocs were directly injected many flocs in the inner layer could not be used as a result the removal efficiency of different mw ha molecules was reduced over time increasing the injection frequency of flocs resulted in an increase in the number of floc layers and the floc utilization efficiency thus the removal efficiency of different mw ha molecules on day 8 was higher than that on day 4 fig 2c due to rejection by the dynamic floc layer the removal efficiency of the small mw ha molecules 3 kda by day 8 significantly increased from 22 9 1 6 with an injection once every 4 d to 54 3 3 2 under continuous injection treatment as a result of the multiple protection layers the removal efficiency of the small mw ha molecules 3 kda increased especially under continuous injection for the aeration rate a thinner cake layer was gradually induced with higher aeration rates leading to smaller cake resistance and slower tmp development when the aeration rate increased from 0 1 l min to 0 5 l min the average floc size decreased from 161 7 18 6 μm to 132 8 11 7 μm however the removal efficiency of ha was almost the same indicating the full utilization efficiency of the flocs a potential reason for this is the strong electrostatic attraction between al based flocs and ha molecules whereas the zeta potentials of flocs and ha molecules varied little under different aeration rates the zeta potential of the al based flocs was 1 4 0 3 mv at ph 7 5 whereas the corresponding zeta potential of the ha molecules was 29 2 3 7 mv thus the removal efficiency of ha was influenced little by the aeration rate for apam although electrostatic repulsion and attraction occurred between apam and the negatively charged uf membrane surface and positively charged al based flocs respectively membrane fouling was more severe compared to that without flocs the potential reason was that apam easily adhered to the uf membrane surface during filtration blocking covering membrane pores to some extent fig s3 as a result the higher the concentration of apam the more severe the membrane fouling was in addition the removal efficiency of ha increased little due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged apam and ha molecules at ph 7 5 solution ph also played an important role in the floc characteristics fig 4 shows that the integrated uf membrane process performed excellently at ph 6 which could be ascribed to the following reasons firstly the floc particle size was 118 2 15 6 μm at ph 6 which increased to 161 7 18 6 μm and 191 7 26 1 μm at ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively however smaller floc particle size results in a larger specific surface area here the specific surface area of the al based flocs at ph 6 was 278 8 17 6 m2 g which decreased to 251 7 9 1 m2 g and 206 5 11 2 m2 g at ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively secondly the zeta potential of the al based flocs was 6 8 0 6 mv at ph 6 but 1 4 0 3 mv and 2 9 0 9 mv at ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively as a result a thinner cake layer and higher removal efficiency of ha was induced at ph 6 resulting in less severe membrane fouling and higher ha removal even of small mw ha molecules for raw water membrane fouling was also gradually induced as a function of time fig 5a however due to the lower doc concentration of raw water compared to that of 20 mg l ha table 1 less severe uf membrane fouling was induced figs 1a and 5a when flocs were continuously injected at ph 6 with 0 1 l min aeration a loose cake layer was induced and tmp development became extremely slow similar to the removal of ha molecules although large mw organic matter was preferentially removed during filtration the removal efficiency of small mw organic matter was also high 51 4 fig 5b in view of the above observations the presence of multiple dynamic floc layers played an important role in removing organic matter and alleviating membrane fouling when flocs were not injected limited organic matter passed through the membrane pores and subsequently organic matter formed a dense cake layer on the membrane surface resulting in serious membrane fouling when flocs were injected most organic matters were adsorbed or rejected the larger the injection frequency the higher the utilization efficiency of the flocs and the higher the removal efficiency of organic matter continuous injection showed much better performance when the input organic matter did not exceed the maximum adsorption ability of the flocs additionally solution ph played a much more important role in alleviating membrane fouling under continuous injection than that of aeration rate or polyacrylamide the specific schematic diagram regarding the alleviation of membrane fouling is illustrated in fig 8 further study will be conducted on the development of microorganisms and in situ chemical cleaning with acid with the existence of flocs after long term operation 5 conclusions the integrated membrane process is a promising method for alleviating membrane fouling and reducing land use however several problems exist with the granular adsorbents used and with the formation of a single dynamic protection layer on the membrane surface due to one time pre deposition or injection to overcome these problems inexpensive and loose al based flocs were injected into a membrane tank with batch injections and continuous bottom aeration to improve membrane performance results showed that the flocs were well dispersed in the membrane tank and largely adsorbed the ha molecules leading to less severe membrane fouling in comparison with one time injection a sandwich like floc cake layer was formed on the membrane surface with batch injections especially under continuous injection the flocs were not only fully utilized in the membrane tank but loose cake layers were gradually formed with continuous injection in addition the removal efficiency of small mw ha molecules 3 kda steadily increased with increasing injection frequency in comparison to aeration rate and polyacrylamide solution ph showed better efficacy at removing small mw ha molecules and alleviating membrane fouling moreover subsequent raw water experiments confirmed the practicability of the integrated uf membrane under continuous injection with acid solution ph based on the excellent membrane performance this innovative integrated filtration method with loose multiple layers shows great

19577,the integration of adsorbents with ultrafiltration uf membranes is a promising method for alleviating membrane fouling and reducing land use however adsorbents typically are only injected into the membrane tank once resulting in a single dynamic protection layer and low removal efficiency over long term operation in addition the granular adsorbents used can cause membrane surface damage to overcome these disadvantages we injected inexpensive and loose aluminum al based flocs directly into a membrane tank with bottom aeration in the presence of humic acid ha or raw water taken from the miyun reservoir beijing china results showed that the flocs were well suspended in the membrane tank and multiple dynamic floc protection layers were formed sandwich like on the membrane surface with multiple batch injections higher frequency floc injections resulted in better floc utilization efficiency and less severe membrane fouling with continuous injection acid solutions demonstrated better performance in removing ha molecules especially those with small molecular weight and in alleviating membrane fouling compared with the use of high aeration rate or polyacrylamide injection this was attributed to the small particle size large specific surface area and high zeta potential of the flocs additionally excellent uf membrane performance was exhibited by reservoir water with continuous injection and acid solution based on the outstanding uf membrane performance this innovative integrated filtration with loose al based flocs has great application potential for water treatment

kim et al 2010 gao et al 2011 feng et al 2015 yu et al 2015 traditional pre adsorption technology has shown moderately good performance in water treatment plants dong et al 2007 masmoudi et al 2016 however many small molecular weight mw substances remain after sedimentation resulting in severe membrane fouling by pore constriction and dense cake layer formation yu et al 2015 in addition this technology requires a relatively large land area during actual operation to overcome these shortcomings direct filtration in which the sedimentation tank has been removed has been researched and applied in water treatment plants xiao et al 2013 shang et al 2015 yu et al 2015 however although only a loose cake layer is formed and membrane fouling is alleviated compared with the pre adsorption process the sludge production rate is high resulting in considerable sludge discharge and rapid microbial growth in the membrane tanks baker 2012 to overcome these issues the emerging technique of integrated filtration has become a new area of focus ajmani et al 2012 cai et al 2013 ma et al 2015 in integrated filtration adsorbents are pre deposited onto the membrane surface or pre injected into the membrane tank to form a loose dynamic protection layer resulting in excellent membrane performance kim et al 2008 2010 ajmani et al 2012 ma et al 2013 however adsorbents are pre deposited or injected only once resulting in the formation of a single dynamic layer with low floc utilization efficiency as a result the removal efficiency of pollutants is gradually reduced over time and a dense cake layer is formed on the protective layer by pollutants leading to severe membrane fouling ma et al 2015 in addition most currently investigated granular adsorbents including heated iron oxide particles zhang et al 2003 carbon nanotubes ajmani et al 2012 powdered activated carbon cai et al 2013 and nanoscale zerovalent iron ma et al 2015 are either expensive or easily cause membrane surface damage after long term operation thus for practical operation it is necessary to explore new adsorbents and methods to further improve the performance of the integrated membrane process aluminum al and iron fe salts are widely used as coagulants and demonstrate high pollutant removal efficiencies their excellent performance is due to the stronger adsorption abilities of flocs compared with pre made adsorbents especially for organic matter kimura et al 2005 amjad et al 2015 ang et al 2015 he et al 2015 yu et al 2016 compared with fe based salts less corrosion occurs in the presence of al based salts zhao and zhang 2011 herein to overcome the disadvantages and improve application of integrated filtration in actual operation inexpensive and loose flocs formed by hydrolysis of al based salts were directly injected into a membrane tank in the presence of a hollow fiber uf membrane to fully utilize the adsorbents and improve membrane performance the flocs were suspended in the membrane tank by bottom aeration humic substances hs commonly exist in natural waters and can range from a few mg l to a few hundred mg l c wall and choppin 2003 however the presence of hs can cause environmental and health problems such as providing food for undesirable bacteria in water bai and zhang 2001 hs can also bind with heavy metals or biocides yielding high concentrations of these substances and enhancing their transport in water schmitt et al 2003 and can react with chlorine during water treatment to form disinfection by products such as trihalomethane wang et al 2015 furthermore hs can compete with low mw synthetic organic chemicals and inorganic pollutants reducing their adsorption rates and equilibrium capacities klausen et al 2003 and can act as a major foulant causing serious micro ultrafiltration membrane fouling due to its large mw distribution yuan and zydney 2000 herein to test the integrated floc and uf membrane process the membrane performance and removal efficiency of hs were investigated in addition to fully understand the characteristics of the dynamic protection layer the factors responsible for membrane fouling such as injection dosage and frequency aeration rate and solution ph were investigated moreover to clarify the practicability of the integrated floc and uf membrane process raw water taken from the miyun reservoir n 40 29 e 116 49 the main drinking water resource for beijing was also investigated 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials all chemical reagents used including alcl3 6h2o hcl naoh and polyacrylamide were of analytical grade and were obtained from sinopharm chemical reagent co ltd china deionized di millipore milli q usa water was used in the experiments humic acid sodium salt ha sigma aldrich usa a hs representative was dissolved in tap water beijing china at a concentration of 20 mg l all chemical stock solutions were stored in the dark at 4 c table 1 shows the specific characteristics of the feed water with ha and the specific properties of the source water from miyun reservoir 2 2 floc preparation for floc preparation alcl3 6h2o was dissolved in 400 ml of tap water beijing each time with the solution ph adjusted to 7 5 using 1 m naoh to prevent high al concentrations in the effluent after filtration the prepared flocs were washed with di water three times before injecting almost 60 of al species are solid hydrolysis products mainly al oh 3 at ph 7 5 zhao et al 2009 with the main characteristics shown in table s1 thus the concentration of the al based flocs calculated as al same below was 60 of the concentration of the al based coagulants 2 3 filtration progress a schematic diagram of the membrane process is shown in fig s1 the membrane tank had an inner diameter of 64 mm and a height of 800 mm a polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf hollow fiber membrane motimo china was used with a mw cutoff mwco of 100 kda the effluent from the submerged membrane module was withdrawn using a peristaltic pump 20 l m 2 h 1 the filtration cycle was 30 min followed by 1 min of backwashing 40 l m 2 h 1 a water level gauge was used to control the water level and a ceramic aeration device diameter 40 mm was placed at the bottom to ensure that the flocs were well suspended in the membrane tank all flocs were prepared just before injection to maintain activity chen et al 2015 and were directly injected into the membrane tank once every 8 4 or 2 d by syringe or by continuous injection with a peristaltic pump the tmp was monitored by pressure sensors the hydraulic retention time was maintained at 2 2 h and the accumulated sludge was not released during filtration to prevent the formation of biopolymer by the development of microorganisms the system was operated for 11 d due to residual chlorine table 1 tap water was used to wash away the cake layer on the membrane surface after 8 d of operation samples were always taken before the next injection except under the continuous injection treatment all experiments were carried out in duplicate 2 4 characteristics of flocs in the membrane tank during filtration floc samples were taken from below the surface of the suspension in the absence of ha with a hollow glass tube floc images were captured using an optical microscope equipped with a ccd camera ge 5 aigo china the specific surface areas of the flocs were analyzed by the brunauer emmett teller method bet asap2020hd88 usa the zeta potentials of the flocs before and after adsorption were measured by a nano particle sizing and zeta potential analyzer beckman coulter ltd usa 2 5 other analytical measurements the ph was measured by a ph meter orion usa uf membranes with different mwco were used to grade ha molecules and the uf fraction method was used to investigate the corresponding removal efficiencies for different mw distributions aiken 1984 lin et al 1999 the mw distributions were determined by gel permeation chromatography gpc agilent technologies usa and removal efficiency was calculated by the difference in peak areas ma et al 2015 additionally images of the layered membrane surface were obtained using scanning electron microscopy sem jsm 7401f jeol ltd japan 3 results 3 1 effect of floc dosage and injection frequency on tmp development to determine the membrane performance of the integrated process tmp development induced by ha with without flocs was investigated fig 1 results showed considerable membrane fouling caused by ha alone and tmp significantly increased to 50 7 kpa on day 8 after careful washing with tap water the corresponding tmp immediately decreased to 10 1 kpa indicating that cake layer formation by ha was the main fouling mechanism compared with the tmp caused by ha alone membrane fouling was alleviated with one time floc injection with higher floc doses also resulting in less severe membrane fouling the tmp values were 33 1 27 3 and 23 2 kpa in the presence of 6 5 13 0 and 26 0 mm flocs respectively on day 8 fig 1a after careful washing with tap water the corresponding tmp dramatically decreased to 6 8 5 2 and 4 9 kpa respectively to further clarify membrane performance tmp development with multiple batch injections was investigated in the presence of 13 0 and 26 0 mm flocs fig 1b and c for 13 0 mm flocs the tmp was gradually reduced with injections once every 8 13 mm time 4 6 5 mm time and 2 3 25 mm time d with corresponding tmp values of 27 3 20 8 and 15 7 kpa respectively on day 8 however the tmp increased to 18 6 kpa by day 8 under continuous injection conditions 0 05 l h same below for 26 0 mm flocs membrane fouling gradually declined with increasing injection frequency the corresponding tmp values were 23 2 18 3 and 15 1 kpa on day 8 following injections once every 8 26 mm time 4 13 mm time and 2 6 5 mm time d respectively when continuous injections were used membrane fouling was further alleviated and the tmp was only 10 1 kpa on day 8 as seen from fig 1b and c the tmp dramatically decreased after careful washing with tap water on day 8 which also showed that cake layer formation was the primary fouling mechanism 3 2 effect of injection frequency on ha removal efficiency the uf membrane performed better in the presence of 26 0 mm flocs than 13 0 mm flocs thus 26 0 mm flocs same below were further investigated with batch injections fig 2 fig 2a shows that the concentration of ha in the effluent was reduced with the floc injections however the removal efficiency of ha slightly increased after 8 d of operation with one time injection the removal efficiency of ha by the membrane alone was 29 2 but the efficiency only increased to 38 3 in the presence of 26 0 mm flocs on day 8 for the one time injection mode due to the removal of ha molecules the peak value of ha mw distribution in the effluent declined from 11294 2 da to 9973 7 da fig 2b shows that the removal efficiency of ha was gradually reduced over time with one time injection the corresponding removal efficiency of ha was 83 1 2 3 on day 2 declining to 38 3 3 1 on day 8 with increasing injection frequency the removal efficiency of ha increased over time especially by day 8 the removal efficiency of ha was 38 3 3 1 with one time injection but this increased to 69 2 2 2 on day 8 under continuous injection in addition the variation in the removal efficiency of ha molecules became smaller with increasing injection frequency the variation reached 44 8 3 1 between day 2 and day 8 with one time injection but decreased to 4 1 1 9 between day 2 and day 8 under continuous injection furthermore the total removal efficiency of ha increased with increasing injection frequency from 62 2 2 3 with one time injection to 70 3 2 8 with continuous injection fig s2 due to the high removal efficiency of ha molecules the peak value of the ha mw distribution significantly decreased from 9973 7 da under one time injection treatment to 7819 1 da under continuous injection treatment after 8 d fig 2a due to the large variation in the mw of ha the corresponding removal efficiencies were further investigated fig 2c for comparison the results for permeate samples from a pristine pvdf uf membrane are also presented as seen from fig 2c the removal efficiency of large ha molecules 30 kda by the membrane alone was 43 1 2 2 whereas those for the medium 3 30 kda and small 3 kda ha molecules were 37 3 1 6 and 6 4 1 8 respectively on day 4 with similar results occurring on day 8 when the flocs were injected in batches the removal efficiencies of the different mw ha molecules were higher on day 8 than on day 4 with increasing injection frequency the removal efficiency of ha also increased especially for the smaller molecules on day 4 and day 8 the removal efficiencies of the small mw ha molecules 3 kda were 19 7 2 6 and 22 9 1 6 respectively with injections every 4 d but increased to 52 9 4 5 and 54 3 3 2 respectively under continuous injection treatment in comparison with the large 30 kda and medium 3 30 kda mw ha molecules the removal efficiency of the small mw ha molecules 3 kda was much lower which was largely influenced by injection frequency and running time 3 3 effect of aeration rate and polyacrylamide on uf membrane performance due to its better uf membrane performance sections 3 1 and 3 2 continuous injection was further investigated as aeration rate plays an important role in floc characteristics including particle size and membrane attachment ability ma et al 2017 uf membrane performance was tested with different aeration rates fig 3 results showed that tmp development slowed with increasing aeration rate and was 10 1 8 8 and 5 8 kpa under 0 1 0 3 and 0 5 l min respectively fig 3a however the removal efficiency and peak value variation were influenced little under different aeration rates fig 3b as reported previously ma et al 2017 in comparison to the aeration rate polyacrylamide has the potential to enhance the adsorption ability of flocs aguilar et al 2005 to strengthen the removal efficiency of the multiple layers and reduce membrane fouling anionic polyacrylamide apam was used due to the positively charged al based flocs 1 4 0 3 mv and negatively charged uf membrane at ph 7 5 childress and elimelech 1996 however severe uf membrane fouling occurred as a function of time fig 3c tmp significantly increased with increasing apam dosage from 10 1 kpa to 35 7 kpa 0 1 mg l and 76 3 kpa 1 mg l on day 8 fig 3d shows that the removal efficiency of ha was also influenced little in the presence of apam the removal efficiency of ha only increased from 70 8 without apam to 76 5 1 mg l apam and the peak value of ha declined from 7819 1 da without apam to 7565 8 da 1 mg l apam in addition owing to the limited influence of the aeration rate and apam injection on ha removal the corresponding removal efficiencies of different mw ha were similar to those with continuous injection data not shown 3 4 effect of ph on tmp development and ha removal efficiency due to the variation in particle size and fractal dimension solution ph also plays an important role in determining floc characteristics feng et al 2015 fig 4 shows the uf membrane performance under different ph conditions as seen from fig 4a the tmp increased much more slowly at ph 6 than at ph 9 over time after 8 d of operation the tmp increased to 7 1 10 1 and 16 3 kpa at ph 6 ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively after washing with tap water the tmp dramatically decreased indicating that cake layer formation was the primary fouling mechanism the corresponding removal efficiencies of ha were 92 9 70 8 and 59 7 at ph 6 ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively along with the removal efficiency of ha the peak value of ha in the effluent varied ranging from 11294 2 da to 5660 5 da fig 4b in comparison to the use of high aeration rate and apam injection the removal efficiency of different mw ha molecules significantly increased with lower solution ph especially at ph 6 this showed that large 30 kda and medium 3 30 kda mw ha molecules were almost totally removed and the removal efficiency of small 3 kda mw ha molecules was higher than 90 3 5 uf membrane performance with raw water to test the practicability of the integrated uf membrane process raw water taken from miyun reservoir was used table 1 based on the excellent uf membrane performance presented in section 3 4 al based flocs were also continuously injected into the membrane tank at a ph of 6 and aeration rate of 0 1 l min as seen from fig 5 a severe uf membrane fouling occurred without pretreatment and the tmp gradually increased to 15 1 kpa on day 8 however with the continuous injection of flocs tmp development was dramatically reduced and only increased to 4 7 kpa by day 8 after washing the tmp significantly decreased indicating that cake layer formation was the main fouling mechanism owing to the existence of doc table 1 the corresponding removal efficiency and mw variation were further investigated as seen from fig 5b two peak values at 10023 1 da and 5972 4 da were observed due to the complexity of the raw water compared to the mw distribution of ha 50 kda fig 2a the raw water mw distribution was smaller 20 kda as shown in fig 5b both large 10 kda and small mw organic matter 10 kda were largely removed with rates of 83 5 and 51 4 with the removal of organic matter the large peak gradually declined from 10023 1 da to 8129 1 da though the small peak remained the same before and after filtration 5972 4 da 4 discussion due to the large mw distribution of ha molecules cake layer formation was found to be the primary fouling mechanism during uf membrane filtration fig 1a the specific particle size distribution of ha was measured fig 6 a showing two peak values at 14 1 nm volume 22 2 at 141 8 nm volume 9 1 due to the characteristics of ha ma et al 2014 the average membrane pore size provided by the manufacturer was 25 nm thus because of large ha molecule interference the chance of pore constriction blockage was relatively low and severe membrane fouling was much more likely caused by dense cake layer formation yuan and zydney 2000 the tmp significantly increased to 50 7 kpa on day 8 but immediately decreased to 10 1 kpa after the membrane was washed with tap water when flocs were injected into the membrane tank only once most ha molecules were easily adsorbed or rejected by the flocs the more flocs were injected the more ha molecules were removed as shown in fig 6b the average particle size of the al based flocs at ph 7 5 was 161 7 18 6 μm much larger than the membrane pore diameter and the specific surface area was 251 7 9 1 m2 g as a result membrane fouling caused by the loose flocs alone was negligible after 8 d of operation data not shown the zeta potentials also showed that the ha molecules were easily adsorbed by the al based flocs the zeta potential of the al based flocs was 1 4 0 3 mv at ph 7 5 whereas the corresponding zeta potential of the ha molecules was 29 2 3 7 mv therefore a loose cake layer was gradually formed by the flocs after adsorbing ha leading to the alleviation of membrane fouling especially under large floc doses fig 1a the tmp was 50 7 kpa on day 8 in the absence of flocs but decreased to 33 1 27 3 and 23 2 kpa in the presence of 6 5 13 0 and 26 0 mm flocs respectively when flocs were injected in batches their utilization efficiency increased due to the multiple floc layers formed the higher the frequency of the floc injections the greater the number of dynamic layers that were formed fig 7 shows the morphology of the cake layer in the membrane tank on day 8 under an injection frequency of 4 and 2 d 26 0 mm flocs a floc protection layer was formed with a sandwich like structure the average thickness of the floc cake layer was 1 77 0 14 mm under 4 d injection frequency whereas the average thickness was reduced to 0 71 0 06 mm under 2 d injection frequency although the thickness was smaller under higher injection frequency more layers were formed leading to higher ha removal efficiency and slower tmp development figs 1 and 2 because of the particle size distribution of the ha molecules the corresponding removal efficiency of the uf membrane alone was only 29 2 when the flocs were injected once although a protection layer was formed on the membrane surface most inner flocs could not be used thus the removal efficiency of ha only increased to 38 3 on day 8 in the presence of 26 0 mm flocs the higher the injection frequency of the flocs the greater the number of protection layers formed and the higher the utilization efficiency of the flocs as a result continuous injection showed much better performance and the variation in ha removal efficiency was much smaller with higher total removal efficiency fig s2 in addition the peak value was further reduced from 11294 2 da to 7819 1 da under continuous injection after 8 d fig 2a it should be noted however that once the concentration of ha molecules entering the membrane tank exceeded the maximum adsorption ability with continuous injection fewer ha molecules were removed and more serious membrane fouling occurred fig 1b and c for the removal of different mw ha molecules large 30 kda and medium 3 30 kda mw ha molecules were relatively easily removed rejected by the uf membrane alone due to their large particle size although different mw ha molecules could be largely removed in the beginning when flocs were directly injected many flocs in the inner layer could not be used as a result the removal efficiency of different mw ha molecules was reduced over time increasing the injection frequency of flocs resulted in an increase in the number of floc layers and the floc utilization efficiency thus the removal efficiency of different mw ha molecules on day 8 was higher than that on day 4 fig 2c due to rejection by the dynamic floc layer the removal efficiency of the small mw ha molecules 3 kda by day 8 significantly increased from 22 9 1 6 with an injection once every 4 d to 54 3 3 2 under continuous injection treatment as a result of the multiple protection layers the removal efficiency of the small mw ha molecules 3 kda increased especially under continuous injection for the aeration rate a thinner cake layer was gradually induced with higher aeration rates leading to smaller cake resistance and slower tmp development when the aeration rate increased from 0 1 l min to 0 5 l min the average floc size decreased from 161 7 18 6 μm to 132 8 11 7 μm however the removal efficiency of ha was almost the same indicating the full utilization efficiency of the flocs a potential reason for this is the strong electrostatic attraction between al based flocs and ha molecules whereas the zeta potentials of flocs and ha molecules varied little under different aeration rates the zeta potential of the al based flocs was 1 4 0 3 mv at ph 7 5 whereas the corresponding zeta potential of the ha molecules was 29 2 3 7 mv thus the removal efficiency of ha was influenced little by the aeration rate for apam although electrostatic repulsion and attraction occurred between apam and the negatively charged uf membrane surface and positively charged al based flocs respectively membrane fouling was more severe compared to that without flocs the potential reason was that apam easily adhered to the uf membrane surface during filtration blocking covering membrane pores to some extent fig s3 as a result the higher the concentration of apam the more severe the membrane fouling was in addition the removal efficiency of ha increased little due to the electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged apam and ha molecules at ph 7 5 solution ph also played an important role in the floc characteristics fig 4 shows that the integrated uf membrane process performed excellently at ph 6 which could be ascribed to the following reasons firstly the floc particle size was 118 2 15 6 μm at ph 6 which increased to 161 7 18 6 μm and 191 7 26 1 μm at ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively however smaller floc particle size results in a larger specific surface area here the specific surface area of the al based flocs at ph 6 was 278 8 17 6 m2 g which decreased to 251 7 9 1 m2 g and 206 5 11 2 m2 g at ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively secondly the zeta potential of the al based flocs was 6 8 0 6 mv at ph 6 but 1 4 0 3 mv and 2 9 0 9 mv at ph 7 5 and ph 9 respectively as a result a thinner cake layer and higher removal efficiency of ha was induced at ph 6 resulting in less severe membrane fouling and higher ha removal even of small mw ha molecules for raw water membrane fouling was also gradually induced as a function of time fig 5a however due to the lower doc concentration of raw water compared to that of 20 mg l ha table 1 less severe uf membrane fouling was induced figs 1a and 5a when flocs were continuously injected at ph 6 with 0 1 l min aeration a loose cake layer was induced and tmp development became extremely slow similar to the removal of ha molecules although large mw organic matter was preferentially removed during filtration the removal efficiency of small mw organic matter was also high 51 4 fig 5b in view of the above observations the presence of multiple dynamic floc layers played an important role in removing organic matter and alleviating membrane fouling when flocs were not injected limited organic matter passed through the membrane pores and subsequently organic matter formed a dense cake layer on the membrane surface resulting in serious membrane fouling when flocs were injected most organic matters were adsorbed or rejected the larger the injection frequency the higher the utilization efficiency of the flocs and the higher the removal efficiency of organic matter continuous injection showed much better performance when the input organic matter did not exceed the maximum adsorption ability of the flocs additionally solution ph played a much more important role in alleviating membrane fouling under continuous injection than that of aeration rate or polyacrylamide the specific schematic diagram regarding the alleviation of membrane fouling is illustrated in fig 8 further study will be conducted on the development of microorganisms and in situ chemical cleaning with acid with the existence of flocs after long term operation 5 conclusions the integrated membrane process is a promising method for alleviating membrane fouling and reducing land use however several problems exist with the granular adsorbents used and with the formation of a single dynamic protection layer on the membrane surface due to one time pre deposition or injection to overcome these problems inexpensive and loose al based flocs were injected into a membrane tank with batch injections and continuous bottom aeration to improve membrane performance results showed that the flocs were well dispersed in the membrane tank and largely adsorbed the ha molecules leading to less severe membrane fouling in comparison with one time injection a sandwich like floc cake layer was formed on the membrane surface with batch injections especially under continuous injection the flocs were not only fully utilized in the membrane tank but loose cake layers were gradually formed with continuous injection in addition the removal efficiency of small mw ha molecules 3 kda steadily increased with increasing injection frequency in comparison to aeration rate and polyacrylamide solution ph showed better efficacy at removing small mw ha molecules and alleviating membrane fouling moreover subsequent raw water experiments confirmed the practicability of the integrated uf membrane under continuous injection with acid solution ph based on the excellent membrane performance this innovative integrated filtration method with loose multiple layers shows great

19578,electrolysis combined with biochar bc was used in a constructed wetland to intensify nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal from wastewater simultaneously a pilot study was conducted using an electrolysis integrated bc amended horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland e bhfcw the research results showed that both electrolysis and bc substrate played important roles in the intensified constructed wetland the electrolysis combined bc substrate greatly enhanced the removal rates of nitrate 49 54 and p 74 25 when the e bhfcw operated under the lower current density of 0 02 ma cm2 and an electrolysis time of 24 h improved n removal was accomplished with the electrochemical denitrification of iron cathodes the autotrophic denitrification bacteria appeared to remove nitrate which was adsorbed on the bc substrate because hydrogen gas was produced by cathodes in the e bhfcw less nitrate was taken directly by wetland plants and microbes the in situ formation of ferric ions from a sacrificial iron anode causing p chemical sedimentation and physical adsorption improved p removal bc modified by iron ions from an iron anode to adsorb the nitrate and p was a good material to improve effluent water quality it can also serve as a favorable microbial carrier to bio transform nitrate to n gas this is because there were abundant and diverse bacterial communities in the biofilm on the bc substrate in the e bhfcw thus electrolysis integrated with bc in a constructed wetland is a novel feasible and effective technique for enhancing wastewater n and p removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrolysis biochar iron electrode nitrate removal phosphorus removal 1 introduction in recent decades eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems has been pervasive and known to cause an intensification of primary production fueled by excess nitrogen n and phosphorus p causing ecosystem degradation xu et al 2016 in developing countries approximately 75 of domestic wastewater has been estimated to enter the environment without treatment kurniadie 2011 compounding the problem algae can produce toxins that have paralytic diarrheic and neurotoxic effects with negative impacts on animals humans and aquatic species furthermore researchers have established that too much n and p are the leading cause of impaired water systems hitzfeld et al 2000 n and p reductions are thus essential for the recovery of aquatic ecosystems wolf et al 2017 jin et al 2010 xu et al 2017 constructed wetlands cws are mainly used for nutrients and organic matters retention in domestic and municipal sewage storm water and agricultural runoff they have many advantages such as low investment and energy cost easy operation and maintenance and high treatment efficiency huang et al 2000 li et al 2017a b wang et al 2018 recently cws have been broadly used for n and p wastewater treatment the mechanisms of n removal during wastewater treatment in cws include nh3 volatilization nitrification denitrification n fixation plant and microbial uptake mineralization nitrate reduction to ammonium anaerobic ammonia oxidation fragmentation sorption desorption burial leaching and so on vymazal 2007 the p removal in cws includes adsorption precipitation plant and microbial uptake fragmentation leaching mineralization sedimentation burial and so on the major p removal processes are sorption precipitation plant uptake and peat soil accretion liolios et al 2015 di luca et al 2017 however the limited ability of substrate adsorption and inhibitive effect of microbes and plants in low temperature present serious obstacles keeping cws from removing n and p efficiently ying et al 2010 to improve the removal of p in cws different materials have been used as an amendment to enhance and enable long term p removal for example zeolite dolomite gravel sand limestone and apatite alunite red mud fly ash and slag have all been used in cws to enhance p removal vohla et al 2011 however their sustainable performances have not been achieved biochar bc is a solid carbonaceous residue produced under oxygen free or oxygen limited conditions at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 c saifullah et al 2018 it is an environmental sorbent that can reduce n and p leaching from soils and can adsorb nh4 hollister et al 2013 no3 kameyama et al 2012 and po4 3 from aqueous solution yao et al 2011 bc can also remove biochemical oxygen demand bod5 suspended solids metals and coliforms in wetland microcosms bian et al 2013 de rozari et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 moreover bc has been proposed as a climate change mitigation tool because it is expected to sequester carbon for centuries and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from soils while maintaining soil productivity brassard et

anode oxidation cathode deoxidation electro coagulation and electro floating researchers have successfully used aluminum and iron electrodes to remove p from wastewater through electro coagulation dian et al 2013 this technology is an alternative to the conventional method of coagulation lacasa et al 2011 recently researchers have focused on the electrochemical reduction of nitrate with different cathodes such as cu fe ti and cu zn this attention is due to highly successful treatment efficiency because of the small area occupied by the installation and relatively low cost li et al 2010 malinovic et al 2015 the electrochemical method combined with bio filter and cws have been used to enhance n and p albeit with by products which affect effluent water quality ju et al 2014 gao et

operation all the testing procedures were according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater by the ministry of environmental protection mep of china 2002 3 results and discussions 3 1 improving nitrogen removal in e bhfcw in order to investigate the n removal ability of the e bhfcw the dynamics of influent and effluent total nitrogen tn concentrations and tn removal rate were measured the e bhfcw showed greater tn removal efficiency compared to the control bhfcw over the duration of the experiment as seen in fig 2 a and fig 3 the influent tn concentration was 18 54 0 50 mg l and the nominal hrt was 24 h during the entire experimental process in both cws in phase i and ii of the experiment there was a slight difference in the tn removal rate between cws but in phase iii iv and v of the experiment the tn removals were significantly greater p 0 05 in the e bhfcw than that in the bhfcw in the e bhfcw the effluent tn concentration was relatively lower i e 8 42 0 20 mg l in phase i when the current density was 0 08 ma cm2 and electrolytic time was 6 h d the mean tn removal rate was 58 67 in phase i the average effluent tn concentration was reduced to 7 60 0 53 mg l in phase ii which had a current density of 0 08 ma cm2 and electrolytic time of 4 h d the mean tn removal rate was 58 78 the effluent tn concentration was reduced to 6 54 0 67 mg l in phase iii even if the current density was lowered to 0 02 ma cm2 the tn removal rate was as high as 64 31 the tn removal abilities were stabilized in phase iv and phase v with the respective removal rates of 41 24 and 46 20 in the e bhfcw as in the bhfcw the removal rates were only 24 93 in phase iv and 24 09 in phase v the removal load rate was 39 50 9 74 mg n m2 d during phase v in the e bhfcw this was higher than that in the bhfcw which was 20 58 3 99 mg n m2 d table 3 thus the electrolysis played a vital role in tn removal in the e bhfcw adding electrolysis improved tn removal in the e bhfcw no3 n removal performed better in the e bhfcw than that in the bhfcw under the same hrt figs 2b and 4 the removal rates were 67 16 in phase iii 43 03 in phase iv and 49 54 in phase v in the e bhfcw the removal load rates were 53 06 14 41 57 97 17 41 51 11 12 07 32 96 4 43 and 37 51 6 97 mg no3 n m2 d in corresponding phase table 3 as control the no3 n removal rates were reduced in phase iii from 53 06 to 25 87 in phase iv and 18 39 in phase v in the bhfcw if the bc adsorption ability was reduced similarly the removal load rates decreased from 40 44 17 33 mg no3 n m2 d in phase iii to 19 88 5 42 mg no3 n m2 d in phase iv and 13 96 2 87 mg no3 n m2 d in phase v this illustrated that the electrolysis played a vital role for no3 n removal in the e bhfcw with added bc no3 n removal ability decreased in phases iv and v the no3 n removal rate was greater in the e bhfcw than that in the bhfcw in the electrolysis process iron plates are used as cathodes which can promote electrochemical denitrification and hydrogen autotrophic denitrification bacteria to intensify nitrate removal li et al 2010 2017b bc can adsorb iron ions produced by the sacrificial iron anode which can promote the bc s ability to adsorb no3 n bc coated with iron ions can increase its no3 n adsorption capacity shang et al 2017 for example when bc produced from wheat straw is coated with iron fecl3 it can significantly increase its no3 n adsorption capacity adsorption experiments show that optimal modified bc can be utilized to remove nitrate and phosphate from wastewater li et al 2016 thus electrolysis combined with bc in cw is a suitable method of increasing n removal from wastewater effluent nh3 n concentrations and removal rates in the e bhfcw are shown in figs 2d and 5 the hrt was 24 h and influent nh3 n concentration was 2 mg l during the entire experiment in phases i and ii with the current density of 0 08 ma cm2 the mean effluent nh3 n concentration was 0 83 0 30 mg l and the mean nh3 n removal rate was 57 87 in the e bhfcw the mean effluent nh3 n concentration was higher than that in the bhfcw 0 30 0 07 mg l the mean effluent concentration of no2 n was about 1 68 0 12 mg l in the e bhfcw during phase i and phase ii fig 2c however when the current density was reduced from 0 08 ma cm2 to 0 02 ma cm2 the electrolysis time per day was extended from 6 h to 24 h the concentration of no2 n and nh3 n were minimal in the e bhfcw in phase iii iv and v and the mean nh3 n removal rate was as high as 92 46 during phase iii iv and v fig 5 simultaneously the no2 n concentrations also decreased from 1 88 0 20 mg l in phase ii to 1 02 0 22 mg l in phase iii and 0 49 0 37 mg l in phase iv fig 2c the no2 n removal rate was 45 5 and 51 6 in phase iii and iv respectively the nh3 n removal load rate was 8 67 0 91 mg nh3 n m2 d in phase v in the e bhfcw table 3 in a previous study we learned that at the cathode the no3 n is mainly reduced to nh3 n no2 n and n2 which is electrochemically inactive birdja et al 2014 nh3 n and no2 n in general are the main unfavorable reduction products and their generation limits applications of the electrochemical process for denitrification li et al 2010 the nh3 n no2 n and iron ion were thus defined as by products in this electrolysis process the results showed that the lower current density significantly reduced the generation of by products during the electrolysis process besides lower current density the bc substrate and plant root also functioned to remove minimal by products during the entire experiment the electrolysis current density was regulated with consideration for the removal of n and the negative effect of minimal by products produced by electrolysis thus the electrolysis current density and electrolysis time could influence the nh3 n removal ability of the e bhfcw the electrochemical reaction adsorption of bc uptake by plants and microbial transformation were the main functions in the removal processes of tn no3 n and nh3 n in the e bhfcw in additions the evapotranspiration of the constructed wetlands may also have had a certain role in the removal of nh3 n the goal was to yield a greater n removal rate and simultaneously decrease by products of electrolysis twelve hours of electrolysis at a current density of 0 02 ma cm2 in the e bhfcw during phase iv yielded a greater n removal rate the cws intensified by electrolysis and added bc substrate have a better ability to remove n in the long term the electrolysis process can directly remove no3 n by iron cathodes through electro denitrification and indirectly remove by cathodes which can improve its removal ability by producing hydrogen gas for hydrogen oxidizing bacteria in the substrate in addition the anode electrode area which can produce ferrous iron led to a more reductive environment which is favorable for denitrification microbes to remove no3 n bc is an adsorbent for no3 n and nh3 n removal especially for the removal of no2 n and nh3 n produced by electrolysis process at the same time bc is a favorable microbial carrier which can remove no3 n no2 n and nh3 n through microbial transformation the wetland plant root zone is an active region for microbial growth because oxygen and organic matters are secreted by the wetland plant they can promote the biological nitrification and denitrification processes to remove no2 n and nh3 n in addition to the direct uptake of no3 n and nh3 n as microbial nutrient salts 3 2 improving phosphorus removal in e bhfcw p was another nutrient removed from wastewater by cws the dynamics of effluent po4 3 p concentration and its removal rate were investigated in the e bhfcw fig 6 the influent po4 3 p concentration was maintained at 0 5 mg l during the entire experiment the effluent po4 3 p concentration decreased gradually from 0 17 mg l in phase i to about 0 02 mg l in phase ii in the e bhfcw with the current density of 0 08 ma cm2 the removal rate increased from 65 98 in phase i to 96 73 in phase ii when the current density was reduced from 0 08 ma cm2 to 0 02 ma cm2 the removal rate decreased slightly from 72 28 in phase iii to 66 12 in phase iv thus the electrolysis was the main factor which affected the po4 3 p removal if the electrolysis time increased from 12 h to 24 h the po4 3 p removal rate increased from 66 12 in phase iv to 74 25 in phase v under current density of 0 02 ma cm2 as a control the effluent po4 3 p concentration slightly decreased from 0 35 mg l in phase i to approximately 0 33 mg l in phase ii in the bhfcw at the end its removal rate was stabilized at about 26 96 in phase v when the adsorption ability of bc declined thus desorption of p from the bc was indicated during phases iii and iv when effluent po4 3 p concentration exceeded the influent fig 6 and table 3 from the aforementioned results we conclude that electrolysis combined with the bhfcw can greatly enhance the po4 3 p removal efficiency the removal load rate was 1 81 0 20 mg po4 3 p m2 d in phase v in the e bhfcw which was higher than that in the bhfcw 0 65 0 17 mg po4 3 p m2 d the results obtained in this study are in agreement with previous studies that iron as a sacrificial anode can greatly enhance the po4 3 p removal zheng et al 2009 moreover bc as an adsorption substrate could remove po4 3 p for only a very short time bc added as an adsorption substrate is not a long term resolution for improving the po4 3 p removal in cws because the iron electrode was used as a sacrificial anode when the ferrous ions were produced in the anode area then the oxygen gas was produced by plant roots near the anode area the ferrous ions would be rapidly transferred to ferric ions which have a better removal ability of po4 3 p thus the effluent ferrous ion and ferric ion concentrations were also measured in the e bhfcw throughout the entire experiment its average effluent concentration ranged from 6 15 0 26 mg l in phase i to 13 45 1 00 mg l in phase ii if the current density was 0 08 ma cm2 as the current density was reduced to 0 02 ma cm2 the iron ion concentration decreased from 1 04 0 05 mg l in phase iii to 0 22 0 07 mg l in phase iv and 0 13 0 04 mg l in phase v respectively fig 7 notably the ferric ion concentration was much higher than ferrous ion since ferrous ions were easily oxidized to ferric ions in the e bhfcw during the experimental process besides considering the removal rate of po4 3 p and the by products of the iron ion the higher electrolysis current density affected the growth of wetland plants the plant roots secrete oxygen to form root plaque on its surface and an efficient oxidized sphere on the root sediment interface to prevent toxic reductive matters entering the plants this helped it to adapt to the environment when the iron ion was relatively higher koch and nearing 2016 after the experiment the height of cyperus alternifolius was a little shorter in the e bhfcw than that in the bhfcw but the fresh weight and dry weight of the plants were heavier than that growing in the bhfcw table s1 thus the optimal electrolysis conditions were the electrolysis current density of 0 02 ma cm2 and the electrolysis time of 12 h as in phase iv in the e bhfcw from the previous results we conclude that the ferrous irons produced by electro dissolution during electrolysis have a positive effect on p removal at the same time there was a higher residual iron ion concentration in the effluent gao et al 2017 in the e bhfcw bc was used as a substrate to reduce the effluent iron ion concentration greatly while bc was modified by the iron ion in situ bc coated with the iron ion had an enhanced ability to remove p to sum up these findings indicate that the e bhfcw had a larger capability to remove p from wastewater than the bhfcw 3 3 the main water qualities in e bhfcw electrolysis combined with cws could effectively remove n and p from wastewater however water qualities would be reduced if there was too much iron ion in the effluent thus bc was added as a substrate in cws to adsorb excess iron and improve water quality the main effluent water ph do orp temperature and color throughout the entire experiment are shown in table 2 in the e bhfcw the ph values were about 9 62 0 63 in phase i 7 89 0 51 in phase ii 8 04 0 79 in phase iii 8 74 0 16 in phase iv and 8 75 0 16 in phase v or different in phases with the different electrolysis conditions respectively for the bhfcw the effluent ph also increased from 8 64 0 26 in phase i to 9 62 0 63 in phase ii and stabilized in phase iv 8 74 0 16 and v 8 75 0 16 these results were in accordance with recent research indicating that bc as a soil amendment could elevate the ph gamage et al 2016 furthermore the high ph could promote the microbial nitrification process to remove nh3 n effectively the ferrous ion produced by an iron anode would affect the aqueous do and orp value the effluent mean do concentration of the e bhfcw was about 1 73 mg l which was lower than that of the bhfcw i e 3 82 mg l the lower do environment was conducive to denitrification especially in the region near the iron anode at the same time the wetland plant roots could secrete molecular oxygen to raise the do concentration that would promote ferrous ion transformation to ferric ion which had a strong combining power to po4 3 p that would increase the p removal ability in the e bhfcw similarly the effluent orp value of the e bhfcw was lower than that of the bhfcw the electrolysis current density and electrolysis time were the main factors that affected the effluent orp the orp was 28 60 157 32 mv in phase i if the electrolysis current density was 0 08 ma cm2 as the current density decreased to 0 02 ma cm2 the effluent ferrous ion concentration was also lowered meanwhile the orp value increased from 247 60 139 mv in phase ii to 33 4 162 84 mv in phase iii in phase v the effluent orp value increased to 35 00 23 67 mv in e bhfcw thus the lower current density was a benefit for increasing effluent orp of the e bhfcw because the lower ferric ion content produced from the iron anode could decrease the depleting of do at the same time the effluent color of the e bhfcw also decreased in phase iii phase iv and phase v because the iron ions decreased under the lower current density from the changes of effluent ph and color we infer that bc was a beneficial material for decreasing color due to its adsorption of iron ions it also increased the ph because of its adsorption ability and vesicular structure thus the effluent water quality was heightened under the lower electrolysis current density in the e bhfcw the electrolysis process had a more complex influence on n and p removal the lowest concentrations of n and p in the e bhfcw outflow were observed during phase iv under a current density of 0 02 ma cm2 and an electrolysis time of 12 h 3 4 the composition and diversity of bacterial communities bc pores served as a habitat and refuge to soil microorganisms such as bacteria ranging in size from 0 3 to 3 mm fungi 2 80 mm and protozoa 7 30 mm the pores protected them from predatory soil microarthropods gul et al 2015 in this paper we mainly analyzed the bacterial characteristic of bc s biofilm through the analysis of 16s rdna gene sequences to understand the biological mechanism in the e bhfcw the bacterial communities in the e bhfcw and the bhfcw were summarized in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively twenty three bacterial phyla were represented in the e bhfcw of which proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most predominant accounting for 54 6 20 6 and 15 2 of the total bacterial sequences respectively fig 8b twenty four bacterial phyla appeared in the bhfcw fig 8a proteobacteria and actinobacteria were the most abundant accounting for 60 2 and 10 40 respectively it is well known that a large proportion of bacteria involved in nitrification and denitrification belongs to proteobacteria from former research the hydrogenotrophic denitrifier community is mainly dominated by proteobacteria li et al 2016 the denitrifying bacteria in the actinobacteria phylum increases when bc is added to soil wu et al 2016 the main bacterial genera in the biofilm of the substrate in the e bhfcw and the bhfcw are shown in fig 9 where a significant microbial diversity in the biofilm on bc was observed the main genera were arthrobacter chryseobacterium brevundimonas sphingomonas and curvibacter accounting for 11 92 11 31 6 08 5 21 and 2 77 in the e bhfcw respectively unlike the prominent relative abundance of genus diversity in biofilm on bc in the e bhfcw the genera of brevundimonas arthrobacter aridibacter thermomonas and bacillus were dominant in the biofilm on bc of the bhfcw accounting for 8 78 3 86 2 50 2 47 and 2 41 respectively from the aforementioned results we learned that electrolysis combined with the bhfcw can greatly enhance the percentage of arthrobacter which is reported to be a genus of strictly aerobic gram positive bacteria phylum actinobacteria which commonly presented in the soil environment in the e bhfcw the denitrifying bacterium was pseudomonas with a relative abundance of 2 26 whereas in the bhfcw the nitrifying bacterium was nitrospirae with its relative abundance of 0 47 the denitrifying bacteria were bacillus and pseudomonas which accounted for 2 41 and 1 46 from recent research we learned that bc as a soil amendment can increase crop yield improve soil quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions especially n2o emissions harter et al 2014 from the above results we can infer that electrolysis can greatly affect the composition and diversity of bacterial communities the bacterial diversity decreased but the percentage of autotrophic denitrifying genera increased in the e bhfcw because hydrogen gas was produced by cathodes in the e bhfcw future research on the functional marker genes of n cycling in the bc substrate are needed to improve the understanding of the microbial n removal mechanisms in the e bhfcw 4 conclusions the e bhfcw has greater capacity for removal of tn no3 n and po4 3 p than the bhfcw furthermore there is less no2 n nh3 n and fe accumulation when bc is used as a substrate to adsorb the by products of the electrolysis process additionally bc can also be modified by iron ions from cathodes in situ and greatly adsorb no3 n and po4 3 p from wastewater the combination of iron anode and iron cathodes gives a good performance for simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removals from polluted water no3 n can be removed through electrochemical denitrification by iron cathode and adsorption by modified bc substrate hydrogen gas produced by iron cathodes can be used by hydrogen autotrophic denitrification bacteria to remove no3 n iron as a sacrificial anode used in the e bhfcw has a better effect on po4 3 p removal this effect is attributed to the ferric iron coagulant that formed in situ through the electro dissolution of the iron anode bc substrate can adsorb the redundant iron ions which can reduce the color of effluent water and heighten effluent water qualities a significant microbial diversity in the biofilm of the bc substrate was also observed it is dominated by proteobacteria and actinobacteria phylum bacteria the diverse bacterial community composition on the substrate can improve the performance of the e bhfcw and make it an attractive technology for wastewater treatment with lower current density and higher efficiency

19578,electrolysis combined with biochar bc was used in a constructed wetland to intensify nitrogen n and phosphorus p removal from wastewater simultaneously a pilot study was conducted using an electrolysis integrated bc amended horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetland e bhfcw the research results showed that both electrolysis and bc substrate played important roles in the intensified constructed wetland the electrolysis combined bc substrate greatly enhanced the removal rates of nitrate 49 54 and p 74 25 when the e bhfcw operated under the lower current density of 0 02 ma cm2 and an electrolysis time of 24 h improved n removal was accomplished with the electrochemical denitrification of iron cathodes the autotrophic denitrification bacteria appeared to remove nitrate which was adsorbed on the bc substrate because hydrogen gas was produced by cathodes in the e bhfcw less nitrate was taken directly by wetland plants and microbes the in situ formation of ferric ions from a sacrificial iron anode causing p chemical sedimentation and physical adsorption improved p removal bc modified by iron ions from an iron anode to adsorb the nitrate and p was a good material to improve effluent water quality it can also serve as a favorable microbial carrier to bio transform nitrate to n gas this is because there were abundant and diverse bacterial communities in the biofilm on the bc substrate in the e bhfcw thus electrolysis integrated with bc in a constructed wetland is a novel feasible and effective technique for enhancing wastewater n and p removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords electrolysis biochar iron electrode nitrate removal phosphorus removal 1 introduction in recent decades eutrophication in aquatic ecosystems has been pervasive and known to cause an intensification of primary production fueled by excess nitrogen n and phosphorus p causing ecosystem degradation xu et al 2016 in developing countries approximately 75 of domestic wastewater has been estimated to enter the environment without treatment kurniadie 2011 compounding the problem algae can produce toxins that have paralytic diarrheic and neurotoxic effects with negative impacts on animals humans and aquatic species furthermore researchers have established that too much n and p are the leading cause of impaired water systems hitzfeld et al 2000 n and p reductions are thus essential for the recovery of aquatic ecosystems wolf et al 2017 jin et al 2010 xu et al 2017 constructed wetlands cws are mainly used for nutrients and organic matters retention in domestic and municipal sewage storm water and agricultural runoff they have many advantages such as low investment and energy cost easy operation and maintenance and high treatment efficiency huang et al 2000 li et al 2017a b wang et al 2018 recently cws have been broadly used for n and p wastewater treatment the mechanisms of n removal during wastewater treatment in cws include nh3 volatilization nitrification denitrification n fixation plant and microbial uptake mineralization nitrate reduction to ammonium anaerobic ammonia oxidation fragmentation sorption desorption burial leaching and so on vymazal 2007 the p removal in cws includes adsorption precipitation plant and microbial uptake fragmentation leaching mineralization sedimentation burial and so on the major p removal processes are sorption precipitation plant uptake and peat soil accretion liolios et al 2015 di luca et al 2017 however the limited ability of substrate adsorption and inhibitive effect of microbes and plants in low temperature present serious obstacles keeping cws from removing n and p efficiently ying et al 2010 to improve the removal of p in cws different materials have been used as an amendment to enhance and enable long term p removal for example zeolite dolomite gravel sand limestone and apatite alunite red mud fly ash and slag have all been used in cws to enhance p removal vohla et al 2011 however their sustainable performances have not been achieved biochar bc is a solid carbonaceous residue produced under oxygen free or oxygen limited conditions at temperatures ranging from 300 to 1000 c saifullah et al 2018 it is an environmental sorbent that can reduce n and p leaching from soils and can adsorb nh4 hollister et al 2013 no3 kameyama et al 2012 and po4 3 from aqueous solution yao et al 2011 bc can also remove biochemical oxygen demand bod5 suspended solids metals and coliforms in wetland microcosms bian et al 2013 de rozari et al 2015 zhang et al 2013 moreover bc has been proposed as a climate change mitigation tool because it is expected to sequester carbon for centuries and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from soils while maintaining soil productivity brassard et al 2016 if bc is modified with fe3 mg2 and so on its n and p adsorption capacities increase greatly li et al 2016 electrochemical method has been successfully used for wastewater treatment it includes anode oxidation cathode deoxidation electro coagulation and electro floating researchers have successfully used aluminum and iron electrodes to remove p from wastewater through electro coagulation dian et al 2013 this technology is an alternative to the conventional method of coagulation lacasa et al 2011 recently researchers have focused on the electrochemical reduction of nitrate with different cathodes such as cu fe ti and cu zn this attention is due to highly successful treatment efficiency because of the small area occupied by the installation and relatively low cost li et al 2010 malinovic et al 2015 the electrochemical method combined with bio filter and cws have been used to enhance n and p albeit with by products which affect effluent water quality ju et al 2014 gao et

wastewater for more than 15 days to initiate the development of plants and biofilm in the e bhfcw and the control bhfcw 2 3 microbiological analysis the bacterial community was analyzed by dna based molecular techniques lamontagne et al 2002 in the biofilm on bc of the e bhfcw and the control bhfcw about 250 g bc was taken from both cws when the experiment ended the bc samples were put in

concentrations were measured with ultraviolet and visible v1800 spectrophotometers shimadzu japan cod was measured with the potassium dichromate method according to its standard calibration and operation all the testing procedures were according to standard methods for the examination of water and wastewater by the ministry of environmental protection mep of china 2002 3 results and discussions 3 1 improving nitrogen removal in e bhfcw in order to investigate the n removal ability of the e bhfcw the dynamics of influent and effluent total nitrogen tn concentrations and tn removal rate were measured the e bhfcw showed greater tn removal efficiency compared to the control bhfcw over the duration of the experiment as seen in fig 2 a and fig 3 the influent tn concentration was 18 54 0 50 mg l and the nominal hrt was 24 h during the entire experimental process in both cws in phase i and ii of the experiment there was a slight difference in the tn removal rate between cws but in phase iii iv and v of the experiment the tn removals were significantly greater p 0 05 in the e bhfcw than that in the bhfcw in the e bhfcw the effluent tn concentration was relatively lower i e 8 42 0 20 mg l in phase i when the current density was 0 08 ma cm2 and electrolytic time was 6 h d the mean tn removal rate was 58 67 in phase i the average effluent tn concentration was reduced to 7 60 0 53 mg l in phase ii which had a current density of 0 08 ma cm2 and electrolytic time of 4 h d the mean tn removal rate was 58 78 the effluent tn concentration was reduced to 6 54 0 67 mg l in phase iii even if the current density was lowered to 0 02 ma cm2 the tn removal rate was as high as 64 31 the tn removal abilities were stabilized in phase iv and phase v with the respective removal rates of 41 24 and 46 20 in the e bhfcw as in the bhfcw the removal rates were only 24 93 in phase iv and 24 09 in phase v the removal load rate was 39 50 9 74 mg n m2 d during phase v in the e bhfcw this was higher than that in the bhfcw which was 20 58 3 99 mg n m2 d table 3 thus the electrolysis played a vital role in tn removal in the e bhfcw adding electrolysis improved tn removal in the e bhfcw no3 n removal performed better in the e bhfcw than that in the bhfcw under the same hrt figs 2b and 4 the removal rates were 67 16 in phase iii 43 03 in phase iv and 49 54 in phase v in the e bhfcw the removal load rates were 53 06 14 41 57 97 17 41 51 11 12 07 32 96 4 43 and 37 51 6 97 mg no3 n m2 d in corresponding phase table 3 as control the no3 n removal rates were reduced in phase iii from 53 06 to 25 87 in phase iv and 18 39 in phase v in the bhfcw if the bc adsorption ability was reduced similarly the removal load rates decreased from 40 44 17 33 mg no3 n m2 d in phase iii to 19 88 5 42 mg no3 n m2 d in phase iv and 13 96 2 87 mg no3 n m2 d in phase v this illustrated that the electrolysis played a vital role for no3 n removal in the e bhfcw with added bc no3 n removal ability decreased in phases iv and v the no3 n removal rate was greater in the e bhfcw than that in the bhfcw in the electrolysis process iron plates are used as cathodes which can promote electrochemical denitrification and hydrogen autotrophic denitrification bacteria to intensify nitrate removal li et al 2010 2017b bc can adsorb iron ions produced by the sacrificial iron anode which can promote the bc s ability to adsorb no3 n bc coated with iron ions can increase its no3 n adsorption capacity shang et al 2017 for example when bc produced from wheat straw is coated with iron fecl3 it can significantly increase its no3 n adsorption capacity adsorption experiments show that optimal modified bc can be utilized to remove nitrate and phosphate from wastewater li et al 2016 thus electrolysis combined with bc in cw is a suitable method of increasing n removal from wastewater effluent nh3 n concentrations and removal rates in the e bhfcw are shown in figs 2d and 5 the hrt was 24 h and influent nh3 n concentration was 2 mg l during the entire experiment in phases i and ii with the current density of 0 08 ma cm2 the mean effluent nh3 n concentration was 0 83 0 30 mg l and the mean nh3 n removal rate was 57 87 in the e bhfcw the mean effluent nh3 n concentration was higher than that in the bhfcw 0 30 0 07 mg l the mean effluent concentration of no2 n was about 1 68 0 12 mg l in the e bhfcw during phase i and phase ii fig 2c however when the current density was reduced from 0 08 ma cm2 to 0 02 ma cm2 the electrolysis time per day was extended from 6 h to 24 h the concentration of no2 n and nh3 n were minimal in the e bhfcw in phase iii iv and v and the mean nh3 n removal rate was as high as 92 46 during phase iii iv and v fig 5 simultaneously the no2 n concentrations also decreased from 1 88 0 20 mg l in phase ii to 1 02 0 22 mg l in phase iii and 0 49 0 37 mg l in phase iv fig 2c the no2 n removal rate was 45 5 and 51 6 in phase iii and iv respectively the nh3 n removal load rate was 8 67 0 91 mg nh3 n m2 d in phase v in the e bhfcw table 3 in a previous study we learned that at the cathode the no3 n is mainly reduced to nh3 n no2 n and n2 which is electrochemically inactive birdja et al 2014 nh3 n and no2 n in general are the main unfavorable reduction products and their generation limits applications of the electrochemical process for denitrification li et al 2010 the nh3 n no2 n and iron ion were thus defined as by products in this electrolysis process the results showed that the lower current density significantly reduced the generation of by products during the electrolysis process besides lower current density the bc substrate and plant root also functioned to remove minimal by products during the entire experiment the electrolysis current density was regulated with consideration for the removal of n and the negative effect of minimal by products produced by electrolysis thus the electrolysis current density and electrolysis time could influence the nh3 n removal ability of the e bhfcw the electrochemical reaction adsorption of bc uptake by plants and microbial transformation were the main functions in the removal processes of tn no3 n and nh3 n in the e bhfcw in additions the evapotranspiration of the constructed wetlands may also have had a certain role in the removal of nh3 n the goal was to yield a greater n removal rate and simultaneously decrease by products of electrolysis twelve hours of electrolysis at a current density of 0 02 ma cm2 in the e bhfcw during phase iv yielded a greater n removal rate the cws intensified by electrolysis and added bc substrate have a better ability to remove n in the long term the electrolysis process can directly remove no3 n by iron cathodes through electro denitrification and indirectly remove by cathodes which can improve its removal ability by producing hydrogen gas for hydrogen oxidizing bacteria in the substrate in addition the anode electrode area which can produce ferrous iron led to a more reductive environment which is favorable for denitrification microbes to remove no3 n bc is an adsorbent for no3 n and nh3 n removal especially for the removal of no2 n and nh3 n produced by electrolysis process at the same time bc is a favorable microbial carrier which can remove no3 n no2 n and nh3 n through microbial transformation the wetland plant root zone is an active region for microbial growth because oxygen and organic matters are secreted by the wetland plant they can promote the biological nitrification and denitrification processes to remove no2 n and nh3 n in addition to the direct uptake of no3 n and nh3 n as microbial nutrient salts 3 2 improving phosphorus removal in e bhfcw p was another nutrient removed from wastewater by cws the dynamics of effluent po4 3 p concentration and its removal rate were investigated in the e bhfcw fig 6 the influent po4 3 p concentration was maintained at 0 5 mg l during the entire experiment the effluent po4 3 p concentration decreased gradually from 0 17 mg l in phase i to about 0 02 mg l in phase ii in the e bhfcw with the current density of 0 08 ma cm2 the removal rate increased from 65 98 in phase i to 96 73 in phase ii when the current density was reduced from 0 08 ma cm2 to 0 02 ma cm2 the removal rate decreased slightly from 72 28 in phase iii to 66 12 in phase iv thus the electrolysis was the main factor which affected the po4 3 p removal if the electrolysis time increased from 12 h to 24 h the po4 3 p removal rate increased from 66 12 in phase iv to 74 25 in phase v under current density of 0 02 ma cm2 as a control the effluent po4 3 p concentration slightly decreased from 0 35 mg l in phase i to approximately 0 33 mg l in phase ii in the bhfcw at the end its removal rate was stabilized at about 26 96 in phase v when the adsorption ability of bc declined thus desorption of p from the bc was indicated during phases iii and iv when effluent po4 3 p concentration exceeded the influent fig 6 and table 3 from the aforementioned results we conclude that electrolysis combined with the bhfcw can greatly enhance the po4 3 p removal efficiency the removal load rate was 1 81 0 20 mg po4 3 p m2 d in phase v in the e bhfcw which was higher than that in the bhfcw 0 65 0 17 mg po4 3 p m2 d the results obtained in this study are in agreement with previous studies that iron as a sacrificial anode can greatly enhance the po4 3 p removal zheng et al 2009 moreover bc as an adsorption substrate could remove po4 3 p for only a very short time bc added as an adsorption substrate is not a long term resolution for improving the po4 3 p removal in cws because the iron electrode was used as a sacrificial anode when the ferrous ions were produced in the anode area then the oxygen gas was produced by plant roots near the anode area the ferrous ions would be rapidly transferred to ferric ions which have a better removal ability of po4 3 p thus the effluent ferrous ion and ferric ion concentrations were also measured in the e bhfcw throughout the entire experiment its average effluent concentration ranged from 6 15 0 26 mg l in phase i to 13 45 1 00 mg l in phase ii if the current density was 0 08 ma cm2 as the current density was reduced to 0 02 ma cm2 the iron ion concentration decreased from 1 04 0 05 mg l in phase iii to 0 22 0 07 mg l in phase iv and 0 13 0 04 mg l in phase v respectively fig 7 notably the ferric ion concentration was much higher than ferrous ion since ferrous ions were easily oxidized to ferric ions in the e bhfcw during the experimental process besides considering the removal rate of po4 3 p and the by products of the iron ion the higher electrolysis current density affected the growth of wetland plants the plant roots secrete oxygen to form root plaque on its surface and an efficient oxidized sphere on the root sediment interface to prevent toxic reductive matters entering the plants this helped it to adapt to the environment when the iron ion was relatively higher koch and nearing 2016 after the experiment the height of cyperus alternifolius was a little shorter in the e bhfcw than that in the bhfcw but the fresh weight and dry weight of the plants were heavier than that growing in the bhfcw table s1 thus the optimal electrolysis conditions were the electrolysis current density of 0 02 ma cm2 and the electrolysis time of 12 h as in phase iv in the e bhfcw from the previous results we conclude that the ferrous irons produced by electro dissolution during electrolysis have a positive effect on p removal at the same time there was a higher residual iron ion concentration in the effluent gao et al 2017 in the e bhfcw bc was used as a substrate to reduce the effluent iron ion concentration greatly while bc was modified by the iron ion in situ bc coated with the iron ion had an enhanced ability to remove p to sum up these findings indicate that the e bhfcw had a larger capability to remove p from wastewater than the bhfcw 3 3 the main water qualities in e bhfcw electrolysis combined with cws could effectively remove n and p from wastewater however water qualities would be reduced if there was too much iron ion in the effluent thus bc was added as a substrate in cws to adsorb excess iron and improve water quality the main effluent water ph do orp temperature and color throughout the entire experiment are shown in table 2 in the e bhfcw the ph values were about 9 62 0 63 in phase i 7 89 0 51 in phase ii 8 04 0 79 in phase iii 8 74 0 16 in phase iv and 8 75 0 16 in phase v or different in phases with the different electrolysis conditions respectively for the bhfcw the effluent ph also increased from 8 64 0 26 in phase i to 9 62 0 63 in phase ii and stabilized in phase iv 8 74 0 16 and v 8 75 0 16 these results were in accordance with recent research indicating that bc as a soil amendment could elevate the ph gamage et al 2016 furthermore the high ph could promote the microbial nitrification process to remove nh3 n effectively the ferrous ion produced by an iron anode would affect the aqueous do and orp value the effluent mean do concentration of the e bhfcw was about 1 73 mg l which was lower than that of the bhfcw i e 3 82 mg l the lower do environment was conducive to denitrification especially in the region near the iron anode at the same time the wetland plant roots could secrete molecular oxygen to raise the do concentration that would promote ferrous ion transformation to ferric ion which had a strong combining power to po4 3 p that would increase the p removal ability in the e bhfcw similarly the effluent orp value of the e bhfcw was lower than that of the bhfcw the electrolysis current density and electrolysis time were the main factors that affected the effluent orp the orp was 28 60 157 32 mv in phase i if the electrolysis current density was 0 08 ma cm2 as the current density decreased to 0 02 ma cm2 the effluent ferrous ion concentration was also lowered meanwhile the orp value increased from 247 60 139 mv in phase ii to 33 4 162 84 mv in phase iii in phase v the effluent orp value increased to 35 00 23 67 mv in e bhfcw thus the lower current density was a benefit for increasing effluent orp of the e bhfcw because the lower ferric ion content produced from the iron anode could decrease the depleting of do at the same time the effluent color of the e bhfcw also decreased in phase iii phase iv and phase v because the iron ions decreased under the lower current density from the changes of effluent ph and color we infer that bc was a beneficial material for decreasing color due to its adsorption of iron ions it also increased the ph because of its adsorption ability and vesicular structure thus the effluent water quality was heightened under the lower electrolysis current density in the e bhfcw the electrolysis process had a more complex influence on n and p removal the lowest concentrations of n and p in the e bhfcw outflow were observed during phase iv under a current density of 0 02 ma cm2 and an electrolysis time of 12 h 3 4 the composition and diversity of bacterial communities bc pores served as a habitat and refuge to soil microorganisms such as bacteria ranging in size from 0 3 to 3 mm fungi 2 80 mm and protozoa 7 30 mm the pores protected them from predatory soil microarthropods gul et al 2015 in this paper we mainly analyzed the bacterial characteristic of bc s biofilm through the analysis of 16s rdna gene sequences to understand the biological mechanism in the e bhfcw the bacterial communities in the e bhfcw and the bhfcw were summarized in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively twenty three bacterial phyla were represented in the e bhfcw of which proteobacteria actinobacteria and bacteroidetes were the most predominant accounting for 54 6 20 6 and 15 2 of the total bacterial sequences respectively fig 8b twenty four bacterial phyla appeared in the bhfcw fig 8a proteobacteria and actinobacteria were the most abundant accounting for 60 2 and 10 40 respectively it is well known that a large proportion of bacteria involved in nitrification and denitrification belongs to proteobacteria from former research the hydrogenotrophic denitrifier community is mainly dominated by proteobacteria li et al 2016 the denitrifying bacteria in the actinobacteria phylum increases when bc is added to soil wu et al 2016 the main bacterial genera in the biofilm of the substrate in the e bhfcw and the bhfcw are shown in fig 9 where a significant microbial diversity in the biofilm on bc was observed the main genera were arthrobacter chryseobacterium brevundimonas sphingomonas and curvibacter accounting for 11 92 11 31 6 08 5 21 and 2 77 in the e bhfcw respectively unlike the prominent relative abundance of genus diversity in biofilm on bc in the e bhfcw the genera of brevundimonas arthrobacter aridibacter thermomonas and bacillus were dominant in the biofilm on bc of the bhfcw accounting for 8 78 3 86 2 50 2 47 and 2 41 respectively from the aforementioned results we learned that electrolysis combined with the bhfcw can greatly enhance the percentage of arthrobacter which is reported to be a genus of strictly aerobic gram positive bacteria phylum actinobacteria which commonly presented in the soil environment in the e bhfcw the denitrifying bacterium was pseudomonas with a relative abundance of 2 26 whereas in the bhfcw the nitrifying bacterium was nitrospirae with its relative abundance of 0 47 the denitrifying bacteria were bacillus and pseudomonas which accounted for 2 41 and 1 46 from recent research we learned that bc as a soil amendment can increase crop yield improve soil quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions especially n2o emissions harter et al 2014 from the above results we can infer that electrolysis can greatly affect the composition and diversity of bacterial communities the bacterial diversity decreased but the percentage of autotrophic denitrifying genera increased in the e bhfcw because hydrogen gas was produced by cathodes in the e bhfcw future research on the functional marker genes of n cycling in the bc substrate are needed to improve the understanding of the microbial n removal mechanisms in the e bhfcw 4 conclusions the e bhfcw has greater capacity for removal of tn no3 n and po4 3 p than the bhfcw furthermore there is less no2 n nh3 n and fe accumulation when bc is used as a substrate to adsorb the by products of the electrolysis process additionally bc can also be modified by iron ions from cathodes in situ and greatly adsorb no3 n and po4 3 p from wastewater the combination of iron anode and iron cathodes gives a good performance for simultaneous nitrogen and phosphorus removals from polluted water no3 n can be removed through electrochemical denitrification by iron cathode and adsorption by modified bc substrate hydrogen gas produced by iron cathodes can be used by hydrogen autotrophic denitrification bacteria to remove no3 n iron as a sacrificial anode used in the e bhfcw has a better effect on po4 3 p removal this effect is attributed to the ferric iron coagulant that formed in situ through the electro dissolution of the iron anode bc substrate can adsorb the redundant iron ions which can reduce the color of effluent water and heighten effluent water qualities a significant microbial diversity in the biofilm of the bc substrate was also observed it is dominated by proteobacteria and actinobacteria phylum bacteria the diverse bacterial community composition on the substrate can improve the performance of the e bhfcw and make it an attractive technology for wastewater treatment with lower current density and higher efficiency

19579,the formation and transportation processes of non point source nps pollution varied among the studied watersheds in the northeastern china so we hypothesized that the driving force behind nps pollution followed the spatial scale effect with a watershed outlet sedimentary flux analysis and a distributed nps pollution loading model we investigated the temporal dynamics of nps and the differences in driving forces sediment core samples were collected from two adjacent watersheds the smaller abujiao watershed and the larger naoli watershed the natural climatic conditions long term variations in the distribution of land use soil properties and tillage practices were the same in the two watersheds the vertical distributions of total nitrogen total phosphorus zn and as at 1 cm intervals in the section showed clear differences between the watersheds there were higher concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the larger watershed but the heavy metals were more concentrated in the smaller watershed lead 210 210pb analyses and the constant rate of supply model provided a dated sedimentary flux which was correlated with the corresponding yearly loading of nps total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the two watersheds the total phosphorus showed a stable relationship in both watersheds with an r2 value that ranged from 0 503 to 0 682 a rose figure comparison also demonstrated that the pollutant flux in the sediment was very different in the two watersheds which had similar territorial conditions and different hydrological patterns redundancy analysis further indicated that expanding paddy areas had a large impact on the sedimentary flux of nitrogen and phosphorus in the smaller watershed but precipitation had a direct impact on nps loading in the larger watershed we concluded that the spatial scale effect affected the nps pollution via the transport processes in the waterway which was mainly influenced by branch length and drainage density keywords sedimentary history diffuse pollution spatial scale effect heavy metal modeling watershed comparison 1 introduction watershed terrestrial non point source nps pollution and transportation in the aquatic system are the main threats to water quality cho et al 2016 perakis and hedin 2002 nps pollution is affected by diverse factors which may include land use type and distribution rainfall patterns agricultural tillage practices and hydrological response features azzellino et al 2006 ouyang et al 2010 the individual or combined impacts of these factors on nps pollution dynamics have been studied in many watersheds bois et al 2013 however the driving forces of these factors are not same or stable across different sizes and types of watersheds furthermore the interactions of these factors can vary temporally within the same watershed kelsey et al 2008 liu et al 2015 therefore it is interesting to distinguish the interactions of these diverse factors and their influence on nps pollution in watersheds with different spatial scales vitro et al 2017 the integrated application of the watershed nps pollution model and chronological sedimentary patterns is an innovative method that can provide the direct evidence for this hypothesis many watersheds in the world suffer from nps pollution especially in watersheds where pollution from industrial or municipal point sources have been well managed culbertson et al 2016 in rural watersheds agricultural nps runoff predominates including significant runoff of nutrients microbes and pesticides where as in urban watersheds petroleum hydrocarbons trace metals pesticides microbes and nutrients generally predominate which is the most challenging issue for watershed water quality around the world wilson and xenopoulos 2009 the contribution of agricultural nps pollution to watershed water pollution varies from 40 to 60 in china and there has been a similar situation in the u s in recent decades dubrovsky et al 2010 ouyang et al 2017a the booming pressure caused by increases in nps pollution increases the standard of related regulations and prompts improvements in the research level in this field as a result there has been widespread implementation of best management practices bmps to prevent loading giri et al 2012 effective watershed pollution control requires the identification of nps pollution processes and procedures or methods to control such pollution to a practical extent furthermore diverse principles and methods have been developed and applied for nps pollution source identification process control and risk assessment wei et al 2016 many distributed hydrological models have been developed to describe nps pollution these models can assess the influence of interactions between potential factors that control nps pollution loading and performances of selected bmps in watersheds of varying scales gebremariam et al 2014 ouyang et al 2013 the soil and water assessment tool swat is an effective hydrological model that has been used for evaluating the interaction of different types of nps pollution factors with nitrogen or phosphorus dynamics under an extensive range of environmental conditions for watersheds sommerlot et al 2016 woznicki et al 2016 this model system contributes to the understanding the complicated natural impacts and or anthropogenic activities on the formation and transportation of nps pollution hydrological processes of the swat model can simulate evapotranspiration et lateral flow surface run off percolation and watercourse transmission losses kim et al 2017 as a result soil erosion and nutrient pollution transport for watersheds can be simulated when territorial and hydrological patterns are considered furl et al 2015 nasta et al 2017 nps loading of sediment at a watershed outlet can record pollution transportation dynamics which is also the fingerprint for the watershed pollution process wilkinson et al 2014 quantification of sediment flux can characterize the water pollution transport processes temporal patterns and the main driving forces jiao et al 2014 teshager et al 2017 estimates of sediment age deposition rates and

distributions of pollution flux and influential factor identification over different time scales using multiple radioactive isotopes caillet et al 2001 hancock et al 2014 therefore understanding long term nps pollution dynamics and responses to human disturbances and or natural characteristics of the watershed are very valuable for optimizing watershed water pollution control planning management and policy particularly in watersheds with expanding agricultural and urban development atkinson et al 2009 ercan and goodall 2016 given this foundation the goal of this study is to distinguish the interactions between different impact factors of nps pollution using modeling and sedimentary methods we investigated watersheds of two scales the specific objectives of this study were as follows 1 to explicitly identify the vertical distribution of the fluxes of four pollutants between two watersheds with different spatial scales 2 to quantify the correlation differences of watershed nps pollution loads with the dated flux of tn and tp in sediment with the same temporal patterns and 3 to compare the different driving forces and spatial scale effects on nps pollution loading and sediment flux between watersheds with rose figures and rda analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas to test our hypothesis two adjacent watersheds in an agricultural development area in the heilongjiang province northeast china were selected as a study area fig 1 the regional climate is a continental monsoon climate in a cold temperate zone the annual average rainfall is 583 18 mm and the rainfall is concentrated in may through september ouyang et al 2012 the smaller watershed the abujiao abj watershed has a drainage area of 141 5 km2 the elevation of the watershed decreases from west to east the larger naoli nl watershed is located in southern part of china these two adjacent agricultural watersheds have the same natural climatic conditions tillage practices population density and agricultural development 2 2 sediment core collection and analysis sediment cores were collected from the estuary of the abujiao c1 and naoli watersheds c2 in july 2015 fig 1 sediment cores were collected with a columnar sampler pvc tube 7 5 cm in diameter and were then sliced into disks at a vertical interval of 1 cm samples were transferred to polyethylene bags and were freeze dried slightly crushed passed through a 0 147 mm sieve and stored in sealed bags due to sedimentary features the c1 core produced 24 slices and the c2 core produced 30 slices ouyang et al 2017b to highlight the pollution sedimentary dynamics the concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp zn and as were analyzed for each slice tn was measured using the semi micro kjeldahl method and tp was analyzed using the naoh melting mo and sb colorimetry method the two heavy metals were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes with the detection limit of 0 06 mg kg iris intrepid ii xsp thermo electron usa lintern et al 2016 the dry sediment samples were digested with hno3 hf hclo4 mixture the standard reference material gbw 07402 was used simultaneously for analytical quality assessment and the obtained average recoveries ranging from 96 34 to 101 47 jiao et al 2014 2 3 sediment core dating method to determine temporal trends of sedimentary processes lead 210 210pb was used for sediment flux dating townsend and seen 2012 210pbtot and 226ra activity were determined to calculate the activity of 210pbex 210pbex 210pbtot 226ra samples were stored in a sealed container for a month for stabilization before measurement a low background hpge high purity germanium γ spectrometer was used for measurements 210pbtot activity was determined using a 46 5 kev γ ray and 226ra activity in equilibrium with the 210pbsu activity which was determined using 95 2 kev and 351 9 kev γ rays the constant rate of supply crs model assumes that the fallout of 210pb from the atmosphere to the water is constant whereas sediment accumulation rate varies with climate or anthropogenic changes appleby and oldfield 1978 1983 according to the crs model sediment ages at depth can be calculated as follows t m t 0 1 λ ln a a m where tm is the sediment age of the mass at depth m t 0 is the year when the sediment was sampled λ represents the decay constant of 210pb 0 03114 y 1 a is the total cumulative 210pbex of the sediment core bq m 2 and am is the cumulative 210pbex below depth m bq m 2 2 4 watershed nps nitrogen and phosphorus loading simulation by swat the widely applied swat soil and water assessment tool was used to determine long term terrestrial nps pollution loading the swat can simulate the spatial temporal patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus loading and can predict the environmental impacts of land use and or climate change the swat needs a database of topography land use five terms soil properties weather conditions 1954 2016 and agricultural management soil property data were downloaded from the national soil properties database supplementary fig 1 using landsat series images from six years 1979 1992 2000 2005 2010 and 2014 the land use variation during intensive reclamation was demonstrated table 1 daily weather data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and hours of sunshine were obtained from sixteen local weather points ouyang et al 2016 the tillage practices for the two watersheds were set to be the same the population density in this area increased 5 3 over 22 years which caused the increase of urban area although its percentage was pretty small it was also set in the swat model using the same model parameters can highlight the impacts of other factors and can decrease modeling uncertainties so the swat validation process was conducted in the nl watershed and was then applied to the simulations in the two watersheds a sensitivity analysis was conducted with swat cup ouyang et al 2014 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens and coefficients of determination r2 were used as performance measurements which was 0 698 and 0 797 for streamflow 0 731 and 0 854 for sand concentration during the validation period 1995 2008 respectively detailed descriptions of the calibration and validation methods are listed in a previous paper ouyang et al 2017a b with the validated model the swat provided the yearly averaged value for nps tn and tp loading t ha in the nl watershed from 1976 to 2015 and from 1972 to 2015 in the smaller abj watershed 2 5 watershed characteristics analysis land use was the direct trigger for nps pollution which also varied significantly during agricultural development the land use patterns for the two watersheds from 1979 to 2014 were analyzed the areas and percentages of paddy upland forest pasture water urban and wetland areas in five terms were calculated watershed hydrological patterns were characterized by the drainage density and river meander coefficient the drainage density reflects the distribution of water systems in watershed which is closely related to the watershed area the drainage density is sensitive to watershed erosion patterns and transport processes babault et al 2012 and the sedimentary record viaplana muzas et al 2015 the drainage density was calculated as follows λ l a where l is the sum of the lengths of the main stream and branches and a is the total area of the watershed the river meander coefficient at difference scales represents the watershed transport and drainage characteristics which characterizes the transport capability of the river dietrich and smith 1984 when the value is greater than 1 3 the river is regarded as a curved river otherwise it is a straight river the river meander coefficient was calculated as follows k a l l where l is the actual length of the river and l is the straight line length of the river 2 6 data analysis with the watershed temporal spatial land use distributions and hydrological patterns the natural characteristics were first compared the differences in vertical distributions of tn tp zn and as concentrations in sediments were assessed using the f test the correlation between tn and tp according to the flux in the dated sediment with the modeled yearly averaged value was also calculated the statistical analysis was conducted with origin software originlab corporation to compare the difference between the two watersheds the temporal concentrations of nps pollution loading tn and tp the concentrations of pollutants tn tp zn and as in sediment and the percentages of three kinds of main land use were displayed in a wind rose figure gustavo et al 2010 these three kinds of land use were the dominant factors for nps pollution loading the area of the entire rose figure was the integrated dynamics of the nine parameters which presented the differences in general pollution loading and driving forces the line in the clockwise size of each arrow represents the temporal pattern of the pollutant concentration to clearly express the differences the distributions of the two watersheds were overlain on the figure to quantify the nps pollution dynamics and driving force differences of the two watersheds the land use changes natural condition index and temporal patterns in pollutant flux were imported into a redundancy analysis rda angeler et al 2008 this method permitted the determination of the relative importance of the long term nps pollution dynamics and sedimentary processes with respect to land use changes and natural conditions as dependent variables this method was used to investigate the variation in indicators on a particular sorting axis the coordinates of the samples were linear combinations of the environmental factors in the sorting chart in this study six metrics about nps loading and sediment vertical distribution were selected as variable responses including the flux of tn tp zn and as in the sediment and nps pollution modeling loads tnload tpload the area percentage of paddy fields paddy and upland areas upland precipitation prec and runoff runoff were set as explanatory variables due to the chronology characteristics of the sediment each layer of the sediment was used to explore the effects of environmental factors in a temporal aspect to highlight the different driving forces for the nps pollution loading and sedimentary processes the rdas for the two watersheds were compared 3 results 3 1 comparison of natural characteristics of the watersheds with the same source and interpretation procedure the land use patterns from 1979 to 2014 were analyzed table 1 the total area of the nl watershed was 22 050 km2 which was much larger than the 142 9 km2 area of the abj watershed however the seven types of land use had same trends over three decades of agricultural development in both watersheds the paddy upland forest and wetland were the dominant types of land use in two watershed and the most obvious expanded area was for paddy land and the percentage of upland areas maintained a stable level consequently the percentage of wetlands in the two watersheds decreased and the urban area increased the land use composition analysis over the three decades demonstrated that the land use change dynamics of two watersheds were similar the correlation coefficient r2 value of wetlands and paddy percentage variation was more than 0 73 and the r2 value of expanding of upland was 0 85 the first three watershed hydrological indicators showed a bigger difference due to the large difference in their total area table 2 the distribution of water systems in the abj watershed is more complicated and the drainage density was much higher however the meander coefficient demonstrated that both watersheds hosted curved rivers although the urban area in both watersheds increased the local population density was still low as the agricultural area 3 2 comparison of the vertical distribution of pollutants in sediment cores with each slice of sediment core differences in the vertical distributions of four pollutants in the two watersheds were compared fig 2 in the estuary of the abj watershed c1 the concentration of tn ranged from 0 31 to 0 83 g kg and the average value was 0 45 g kg however the tn value in the estuary of the rl watershed c2 ranged from 0 30 to 2 10 g kg and the average value was 1 34 g kg for the distribution of the tp the value in the rl watershed was also larger than that in the abj watershed concentration between the two watersheds was much smaller the concentration of tp in the abj watershed ranged from 0 37 to 0 93 g kg and the average value was 0 56 g kg in the nl watershed the concentration of tp ranged from 0 46 to 1 34 g kg and the average value was 0 83 g kg the f test a 0 05 indicated that both tn and tp were significantly different in the two watersheds however the vertical deceasing trends of tn and tp for each watershed shared a similar pattern the concentrations of two types of heavy metals had different vertical distributions than the nutrients and abj watershed had higher trace metal concentrations the concentration of zn ranged from 125 25 mg kg to 285 32 mg kg in the abj watershed with an average value of 190 24 mg kg however the concentration of zn ranged from 68 85 mg kg to 99 15 mg kg in nl watershed with an average value of 78 12 mg kg the concentration of as in the abj watershed ranged from 22 67 mg kg to 53 43 mg kg and the average value was 33 66 mg kg in the other watershed the concentration of as ranged from 1 78 mg kg to 4 90 mg kg with an average value of 3 11 mg kg the f test a 0 05 indicated that there was also a significant difference in both zn and as in the two watersheds the concentrations of zn and as in the abj watershed fluctuated more frequently than in the nl watershed 3 3 comparison of temporal trends in nps pollution loading and fluxes from sediment cores after the activity of 210pb was measured for each interval a chronological framework for the sediment cores was established using the constant rate of supply crs model the sedimentation flux of tn and tp revealed pollution history in the watershed which was multiplied by the contaminant concentration and the mass deposition rate of crs from 1970 to 2015 with the swat model the average annual non point source tn and tp loading in the same period were simulated which showed similar patterns in both watersheds the correlation of pollutant flux in sediment and the simulated loads in the two watersheds were calculated fig 3 the general trends in tn flux in the two watersheds was not similar which was presented by an increasing trend in the abj watershed with a minimum value of 1 27 g m2 in 1972 there was a slight increase and a maximum value of 4 09 g m2 a was reached in 2010 the fluctuations in tn flux in the nl watershed were more obvious the maximum tn flux was 8 96 g m2 a in 2013 and there was an abrupt minimum of 1 51 g m2 a in 2005 the bottom layer also presented a much larger value in the nl watershed the correlations of simulated tn loading and sedimentary flux in the same temporal range showed that there was little correlation in the nl watershed however the correlation in the abj watershed was significant p 0 05 and the r2 value was 0 561 the general vertical trends in tp fluxes in the two watersheds since the 1970s were similar the maximum value of tp flux in the abj watershed was 4 62 g m2 a in 2013 and the minimum was 1 52 g m2 a in 1972 the tp flux in the nl watershed maintained an increasing trend and the maximum value was 6 76 g m2 a in 2010 the correlation of tp flux with simulated loading in the two watersheds were strong the r2 values p 0 05 in the abj and nl watersheds were 0 682 and 0 503 respectively compared to tp the tn in two watersheds exhibited a larger flux range due to its mobility characteristics the tn and tp both exhibited larger variances in the nl watershed than the abj watershed the correlations of tn and tp in the abj watershed were both more significant than in the nl watershed the smaller drainage density was likely the reason for these findings given similar meander coefficients and nps pollution loading conditions the higher drainage density in the abj watershed generated stronger transport impact on the nps pollution which has more chance to accumulated in the sediments 3 4 diving force difference analysis between watersheds with the rose figure the simulated yearly nps pollution loading of tn and tp the flux of four pollutants in each layer the yearly precipitation and runoff in the simulated period and the temporal patterns of land use in the two watersheds were compared fig 4 the figure illustrated that the influence of sedimentary processes on the pollutants were clearly different between the watersheds but the differences in precipitation territorial loading and land use conditions were subtle zn and as showed a larger flux in the abj watershed but the tn and tp had a larger flux in the nl watershed the correlation coefficients for zn and as fluxes with the simulated tn loading in the nl watershed were 0 585 and 0 736 respectively regarding the tp loading in the nl watershed the r2 values for zn and as were 0 508 and 0 813 respectively their correlation in the abj watershed was much poorer where the highest correlation coefficient value was 0 308 between sediment as flux with simulated tn loading these differences demonstrated that pollutant transport and sedimentary processes were different the reason for these findings was likely that the low drainage density and smaller meandering rate occurred in the nl watershed deposition in the estuary reflected nps pollution from the whole watershed according to the lower sedimentation flux for heavy metals in th nl watershed there was an obvious relationship to the longer pollutant transport process period in the larger watershed for similar nps pollution loading the larger difference in sedimentary flux demonstrated the impact of hydrological patterns the different interactions of environmental factors nps pollution loading and the temporal spatial variation of pollutants in sediment in the two watersheds were compared with redundancy analysis rda fig 5 based on the rda sequencing charts of the abj and nl watersheds it was concluded that interactions of the pollutant indices with the driving force factors in the two watersheds presented some differences based on the length of the arrows the area of paddy fields was the main controlling factor for nps pollution in the abj watershed precipitation and surface runoff were the critical factors in the nl watershed under similar distributions the correlation between tn and tp fluxes in sediments with an expanding paddy area was clear in the abj watershed similar correlations were not as strong in the nl watershed the simulated watershed tn and tp loading in the two watersheds showed close relationships with the flux of as in sediment which indicated that it can be an indicator for watershed nps pollution dynamics the influence of paddy field area on the temporal nps pollution dynamics was the most significant factor which caused the nps discharged from agriculture and accumulated in the sediments the rda highlighted the close interactions between nps pollution and the territorial factors and distinguished the difference in the sedimentary flux and the hydrological pattern due to the impacts of the spatial scale effect 4 discussion 4 1 difference in driving forces on nps pollution of two scales of watershed the previous observations have demonstrated that there are diverse factors that are related to nps pollution loading and sedimentary flux dynamics in a watershed thiere and schulz 2004 unfortunately most of the factors often co exist or interact simultaneously within the watershed which makes it difficult to establish the importance of each factor individually interlandi and crockett 2003 ferreira et al 2017 considering the large percentage of agricultural area and tillage practices a significant portion of the nps pollution load originates from the long term use of fertilizer in the watershed s agricultural system the climatic patterns and varying farmlands in the two watersheds are very similar but the vertical distributions of tn and tp in sediment from the watersheds are not the same fig 2 this finding indicates that the tn and tp do not share transport mechanisms due to their physic chemical properties difference with the correlation of dated sediment fluxes and temporal patterns the tp shows a better performance in the two watersheds as the stable format but the correlation of tn is different between the two watersheds the distribution of the rose figure showed significant differences between the two watersheds especially in their temporal patterns fig 4 the distributions of land use precipitation and surface runoff are similar in the rose figure and do not have a spatial scale effect on the nps loading in the watersheds the rda analysis also indicates that the expansion of farmland is the primary cause for the temporal change in nps pollution dynamics fig 5 with rapid agricultural development the function of rapidly increasing paddy areas is the same in the two watersheds which is more strongly related to the tn and tp flux at the watershed outlet on the other hand the precipitation has a more direct impact on the simulated watershed tn and tp loadings which is clear in both watersheds however the pollutant flux of sediment is not same in the watersheds under with similar territorial nps loading the tillage practices during agricultural development shows similar zn and as loading on farmland ouyang et al 2016 but there are different concentrations at the sedimentary outlet sedimentation in the watershed outlet is basically dominated by suspension settling conditions and is a concentration of upper stream areas jiao et al 2014 which can indicate most parts of the total yield of nps pollution in the watershed the rose figure comparison and rda both indicate that the driving forces of sedimentary flux are different considering the spatial scale effect 4 2 implications from sediment for watershed nps pollution management the nps pollution has the priority mission for the watershed pollution control rowny and stewart 2012 based on the spatial geographical patterns and climatic conditions supplementary fig 2 the territorial nps pollution of two watersheds share a similar trend the temporal patterns of four pollutants in the vertical sediment flux reflect the history of nps pollution in the catchment area during agricultural development this pattern coincides well with the expected nps modeling data that considers temporal land use variations in the individual watersheds the heavy metals in the watershed are mainly enriched by phosphate fertilizer n guessan et al 2009 in addition to the tn and tp in the sediment the other two heavy metal indicators provide sounder data due to the stable conditions bryan and langston 1992 which increased during the agricultural development and suffered the same impacts in these watersheds cabrera et al 1999 sediment is an important sink of contaminants in a watershed sedláček et al 2017 which is supported by the correlation between tn tp fluxes with nps loading from land surface modeling fig 3 the clear correlations between the temporal sediment flux with simulated tn and tp loadings indicate that nps pollution is the main source for the outlet sediment in the two watersheds however the distinct temporal differences in sediment flux observed between the watersheds demonstrates that the nps transport dynamics in the river watercourse are sensitive to the watershed hydrological conditions the vertical flux of as and zn and their correlations with nps loading can help to distinguish element sources and sedimentary differences the highest enrichment of as in the smaller watershed tributaries can be related to the short distance between farmland and the watershed outlet heavy metals are more sensitive to the river processes than the tn and tp due to sorption with soil particles 4 3 spatial scale effect on watershed nps pollution and uncertainties analysis the spatial scale effect is a pertinent issue in natural science sivertun and prange 2003 which is best expressed by the integration of watershed outlet sediments and nps pollution modeling aguilera et al 2012 the temporal pattern analysis of tn and tp fluxes in sediment demonstrate the consequence of the complexity of river networks and transform processes of pollutants in watercourses with similar territorial conditions these differences are determined by the geomorphologic transport processes and the hydrologic patterns at different watershed scales gebremariam et al 2014 in addition to the impacts of the watershed area and river density the transport time differences of pollutants in the watercourse is another main reason for differences in sedimentary flux it has been demonstrated that the concentration of pollutant particles generally decreases in the flow direction randhir and tsvetkova 2011 these findings are consistent with our results as there was a higher concentration of as and zn in the short river in the abj watershed on the other hand the hydrological pattern in the larger watershed has a higher self cleaning capability than the smaller one the pollutants in the lower basin have the lowest concentration and more chance to transform which causes lower sedimentation fluxes in the larger watershed bissett et al 1999 wu et al 2014 to test the hypothesis in this study the sediment geochemical experiments and nps pollution modeling were used to show that uncertainties exist khadam and kaluarachchi 2006 to decrease these uncertainties the land use interpretation process sediment sampling measurement method and validated modeling parameters are all the same trask et al 2017 the urban area percentage increased intensively during the modeling period which is considered in the modeling of two watersheds but its independent impact on nps loading is not assessed in this agricultural watershed due to the small area the different formation and transport principle of nps pollution from agricultural and urban is the uncertainty factor manta et al 2002 the potential uncertainties of these factors may have the same impact on the results which may not decease the reliability of this study these conditions can highlight the impacts of other varying factors of the watershed and help to determine the validity of the hypothesis presented in this study based on the statistical analysis the impact of hydrological patterns on pollutant and sediment fluxes may be the main uncertainties in the study and therefore deserve future investigation 5 conclusions the transport fate and the influencing factors of nps pollution in a single watershed have been widely studied however the differences of long term driving factors and nps sedimentary fluxes at river outlets of different scales of watersheds has been poorly investigated to our knowledge this study is the first to apply the widely used swat model and sedimentary geochemical analyses to identify the spatial scale effects on the nps pollution dynamics in agricultural watersheds under the similar temporal patterns of land use the nps loading of two watersheds had similar loading levels except for the tn in the nl watershed correlations between the temporal nps loading and the temporal flux in the sediment were high this finding indicated watershed nps loading is significantly associated with precipitation land use and soil properties which were the similar in the two watersheds which did not present an obvious spatial scale effect the sediment geochemical analysis indicated that large differences existed in the vertical distributions of tn and tp between the watersheds the tn and tp had larger values in the larger nl watershed but the smaller abj watershed had larger values of zn and as the rose figure comparison of the two watersheds also demonstrated that there were large differences in pollutant fluxes in sediment between the watersheds with similar natural driving forces rda also indicated that the different interactions of the driving forces and supported the existence of a spatial scale effect with the considerations of watershed hydrological features and territorial nps loading it was concluded that the watershed spatial scale had a direct impact on the nps pollution transport and sedimentary process the larger watershed had a much longer branch length and longer transport period which affected watershed sedimentary processes with smaller fluxes of stable heavy metal indicators additional research is needed to assess the spatial transport patterns of nps pollution in the river watercourse specifically the declining trend in the flow direction and the different load at different water distances acknowledgments the research presented here benefited from financial support from

19579,the formation and transportation processes of non point source nps pollution varied among the studied watersheds in the northeastern china so we hypothesized that the driving force behind nps pollution followed the spatial scale effect with a watershed outlet sedimentary flux analysis and a distributed nps pollution loading model we investigated the temporal dynamics of nps and the differences in driving forces sediment core samples were collected from two adjacent watersheds the smaller abujiao watershed and the larger naoli watershed the natural climatic conditions long term variations in the distribution of land use soil properties and tillage practices were the same in the two watersheds the vertical distributions of total nitrogen total phosphorus zn and as at 1 cm intervals in the section showed clear differences between the watersheds there were higher concentrations of total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the larger watershed but the heavy metals were more concentrated in the smaller watershed lead 210 210pb analyses and the constant rate of supply model provided a dated sedimentary flux which was correlated with the corresponding yearly loading of nps total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the two watersheds the total phosphorus showed a stable relationship in both watersheds with an r2 value that ranged from 0 503 to 0 682 a rose figure comparison also demonstrated that the pollutant flux in the sediment was very different in the two watersheds which had similar territorial conditions and different hydrological patterns redundancy analysis further indicated that expanding paddy areas had a large impact on the sedimentary flux of nitrogen and phosphorus in the smaller watershed but precipitation had a direct impact on nps loading in the larger watershed we concluded that the spatial scale effect affected the nps pollution via the transport processes in the waterway which was mainly influenced by branch length and drainage density keywords sedimentary history diffuse pollution spatial scale effect heavy metal modeling watershed comparison 1 introduction watershed terrestrial non point source nps pollution and transportation in the aquatic system are the main threats to water quality cho et al 2016 perakis and hedin 2002 nps pollution is affected by diverse factors which may include land use type and distribution rainfall patterns agricultural tillage practices and hydrological response features azzellino et al 2006 ouyang et al 2010 the individual or combined impacts of these factors on nps pollution dynamics have been studied in many watersheds bois et al 2013 however the driving forces of these factors are not same or stable across different sizes and types of watersheds furthermore the interactions of these factors can vary temporally within the same watershed kelsey et al 2008 liu et al 2015 therefore it is interesting to distinguish the interactions of these diverse factors and their influence on nps pollution in watersheds with different spatial scales vitro et al 2017 the integrated application of the watershed nps pollution model and chronological sedimentary patterns is an innovative method that can provide the direct evidence for this hypothesis many watersheds in the world suffer from nps pollution especially in watersheds where pollution from industrial or municipal point sources have been well managed culbertson et al 2016 in rural watersheds agricultural nps runoff predominates including significant runoff of nutrients microbes and pesticides where as in urban watersheds petroleum hydrocarbons trace metals pesticides microbes and nutrients generally predominate which is the most challenging issue for watershed water quality around the world wilson and xenopoulos 2009 the contribution of agricultural nps pollution to watershed water pollution varies from 40 to 60 in china and there has been a similar situation in the u s in recent decades dubrovsky et al 2010 ouyang et al 2017a the booming pressure caused by increases in nps pollution increases the standard of related regulations and prompts improvements in the research level in this field as a result there has been widespread implementation of best management practices bmps to prevent loading giri et al 2012 effective watershed pollution control requires the identification of nps pollution processes and procedures or methods to control such pollution to a practical extent furthermore diverse principles and methods have been developed and applied for nps pollution source identification process control and risk assessment wei et al 2016 many distributed hydrological models have been developed to describe nps pollution these models can assess the influence of interactions between potential factors that control nps pollution loading and performances of selected bmps in watersheds of varying scales gebremariam et al 2014 ouyang et al 2013 the soil and water assessment tool swat is an effective hydrological model that has been used for evaluating the interaction of different types of nps pollution factors with nitrogen or phosphorus dynamics under an extensive range of environmental conditions for watersheds sommerlot et al 2016 woznicki et al 2016 this model system contributes to the understanding the complicated natural impacts and or anthropogenic activities on the formation and transportation of nps pollution hydrological processes of the swat model can simulate evapotranspiration et lateral flow surface run off percolation and watercourse transmission losses kim et al 2017 as a result soil erosion and nutrient pollution transport for watersheds can be simulated when territorial and hydrological patterns are considered furl et al 2015 nasta et al 2017 nps loading of sediment at a watershed outlet can record pollution transportation dynamics which is also the fingerprint for the watershed pollution process wilkinson et al 2014 quantification of sediment flux can characterize the water pollution transport processes temporal patterns and the main driving forces jiao et al 2014 teshager et al 2017 estimates of sediment age deposition rates and deposition flux are of great importance in revealing environmental change and quantifying the relationship between watershed erosion and deposition in the river course gevao et al 2016 modern sediment dating and calculations of deposition rate comprehensively reflect the deposition process and help determine the quantitative indicators of depositional history mabit et al 2014 210pb 137cs and other short half life radioisotopes radionuclide tracing and dating have become a significant means to study pollution depositional trends kirchner 2011 which also help to identify the vertical distributions of pollution flux and influential factor identification over different time scales using multiple radioactive isotopes caillet et al 2001 hancock et al 2014 therefore understanding long term nps pollution dynamics and responses to human disturbances and or natural characteristics of the watershed are very valuable for optimizing watershed water pollution control planning management and policy particularly in watersheds with expanding agricultural and urban development atkinson et al 2009 ercan and goodall 2016 given this foundation the goal of this study is to distinguish the interactions between different impact factors of nps pollution using modeling and sedimentary methods we investigated watersheds of two scales the specific objectives of this study were as follows 1 to explicitly identify the vertical distribution of the fluxes of four pollutants between two watersheds with different spatial scales 2 to quantify the correlation differences of watershed nps pollution loads with the dated flux of tn and tp in sediment with the same temporal patterns and 3 to compare the different driving forces and spatial scale effects on nps pollution loading and sediment flux between watersheds with rose figures and rda analyses 2 materials and methods 2 1 study areas to test our hypothesis two adjacent watersheds in an agricultural development area in the heilongjiang province northeast china were selected as a study area fig 1 the regional climate is a continental monsoon climate in a cold temperate zone the annual average rainfall is 583 18 mm and the rainfall is concentrated in may through september ouyang et al 2012 the smaller watershed the abujiao abj watershed has a drainage area of 141 5 km2 the elevation of the watershed decreases from west to east the larger naoli nl watershed is located in southern part of china these two adjacent agricultural watersheds have the same natural climatic conditions tillage practices population density and agricultural development 2 2 sediment core collection and analysis sediment cores were collected from the estuary of the abujiao c1 and naoli watersheds c2 in july 2015 fig 1 sediment cores were collected with a columnar sampler pvc tube 7 5 cm in diameter and were then sliced into disks at a vertical interval of 1 cm samples were transferred to polyethylene bags and were freeze dried slightly crushed passed through a 0 147 mm sieve and stored in sealed bags due to sedimentary features the c1 core produced 24 slices and the c2 core produced 30 slices ouyang et al 2017b to highlight the pollution sedimentary dynamics the concentrations of total nitrogen tn total phosphorus tp zn and as were analyzed for each slice tn was measured using the semi micro kjeldahl method and tp was analyzed using the naoh melting mo and sb colorimetry method the two heavy metals were measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy icp aes with the detection limit of 0 06 mg kg iris intrepid ii xsp thermo electron usa lintern et al 2016 the dry sediment samples were digested with hno3 hf hclo4 mixture the standard reference material gbw 07402 was used simultaneously for analytical quality assessment and the obtained average recoveries ranging from 96 34 to 101 47 jiao et al 2014 2 3 sediment core dating method to determine temporal trends of sedimentary processes lead 210 210pb was used for sediment flux dating townsend and seen 2012 210pbtot and 226ra activity were determined to calculate the activity of 210pbex 210pbex 210pbtot 226ra samples were stored in a sealed container for a month for stabilization before measurement a low background hpge high purity germanium γ spectrometer was used for measurements 210pbtot activity was determined using a 46 5 kev γ ray and 226ra activity in equilibrium with the 210pbsu activity which was determined using 95 2 kev and 351 9 kev γ rays the constant rate of supply crs model assumes that the fallout of 210pb from the atmosphere to the water is constant whereas sediment accumulation rate varies with climate or anthropogenic changes appleby and oldfield 1978 1983 according to the crs model sediment ages at depth can be calculated as follows t m t 0 1 λ ln a a m where tm is the sediment age of the mass at depth m t 0 is the year when the sediment was sampled λ represents the decay constant of 210pb 0 03114 y 1 a is the total cumulative 210pbex of the sediment core bq m 2 and am is the cumulative 210pbex below depth m bq m 2 2 4 watershed nps nitrogen and phosphorus loading simulation by swat the widely applied swat soil and water assessment tool was used to determine long term terrestrial nps pollution loading the swat can simulate the spatial temporal patterns of nitrogen and phosphorus loading and can predict the environmental impacts of land use and or climate change the swat needs a database of topography land use five terms soil properties weather conditions 1954 2016 and agricultural management soil property data were downloaded from the national soil properties database supplementary fig 1 using landsat series images from six years 1979 1992 2000 2005 2010 and 2014 the land use variation during intensive reclamation was demonstrated table 1 daily weather data including precipitation maximum and minimum temperatures relative humidity wind speed and hours of sunshine were obtained from sixteen local weather points ouyang et al 2016 the tillage practices for the two watersheds were set to be the same the population density in this area increased 5 3 over 22 years which caused the increase of urban area although its percentage was pretty small it was also set in the swat model using the same model parameters can highlight the impacts of other factors and can decrease modeling uncertainties so the swat validation process was conducted in the nl watershed and was then applied to the simulations in the two watersheds a sensitivity analysis was conducted with swat cup ouyang et al 2014 the nash sutcliffe efficiency coefficient ens and coefficients of determination r2 were used as performance measurements which was 0 698 and 0 797 for streamflow 0 731 and 0 854 for sand concentration during the validation period 1995 2008 respectively detailed descriptions of the calibration and validation methods are listed in a previous paper ouyang et al 2017a b with the validated model the swat provided the yearly averaged value for nps tn and tp loading t ha in the nl watershed from 1976 to 2015 and from 1972 to 2015 in the smaller abj watershed 2 5 watershed characteristics analysis land use was the direct trigger for nps pollution which also varied significantly during agricultural development the land use patterns for the two watersheds from 1979 to 2014 were analyzed the areas and percentages of paddy upland forest pasture water urban and wetland areas in five terms were calculated watershed hydrological patterns were characterized by the drainage density and river meander coefficient the drainage density reflects the distribution of water systems in watershed which is closely related to the watershed area the drainage density is sensitive to watershed erosion patterns and transport processes babault et al 2012 and the sedimentary record viaplana muzas et al 2015 the drainage density was calculated as follows λ l a where l is the sum of the lengths of the main stream and branches and a is the total area of the watershed the river meander coefficient at difference scales represents the watershed transport and drainage characteristics which characterizes the transport capability of the river dietrich and smith 1984 when the value is greater than 1 3 the river is regarded as a curved river otherwise it is a straight river the river meander coefficient was calculated as follows k a l l where l is the actual length of the river and l is the straight line length of the river 2 6 data analysis with the watershed temporal spatial land use distributions and hydrological patterns the natural characteristics were first compared the differences in vertical distributions of tn tp zn and as concentrations in sediments were assessed using the f test the correlation between tn and tp according to the flux in the dated sediment with the modeled yearly averaged value was also calculated the statistical analysis was conducted with origin software originlab corporation to compare the difference between the two watersheds the temporal concentrations of nps pollution loading tn and tp the concentrations of pollutants tn tp zn and as in sediment and the percentages of three kinds of main land use were displayed in a wind rose figure gustavo et al 2010 these three kinds of land use were the dominant factors for nps pollution loading the area of the entire rose figure was the integrated dynamics of the nine parameters which presented the differences in general pollution loading and driving forces the line in the clockwise size of each arrow represents the temporal pattern of the pollutant concentration to clearly express the differences the distributions of the two watersheds were overlain on the figure to quantify the nps pollution dynamics and driving force differences of the two watersheds the land use changes natural condition index and temporal patterns in pollutant flux were imported into a redundancy analysis rda angeler et al 2008 this method permitted the determination of the relative importance of the long term nps pollution dynamics and sedimentary processes with respect to land use changes and natural conditions as dependent variables this method was used to investigate the variation in indicators on a particular sorting axis the coordinates of the samples were linear combinations of the environmental factors in the sorting chart in this study six metrics about nps loading and sediment vertical distribution were selected as variable responses including the flux of tn tp zn and as in the sediment and nps pollution modeling loads tnload tpload the area percentage of paddy fields paddy and upland areas upland precipitation prec and runoff runoff were set as explanatory variables due to the chronology characteristics of the sediment each layer of the sediment was used to explore the effects of environmental factors in a temporal aspect to highlight the different driving forces for the nps pollution loading and sedimentary processes the rdas for the two watersheds were compared 3 results 3 1 comparison of natural characteristics of the watersheds with the same source and interpretation procedure the land use patterns from 1979 to 2014 were analyzed table 1 the total area of the nl watershed was 22 050 km2 which was much larger than the 142 9 km2 area of the abj watershed however the seven types of land use had same trends over three decades of agricultural development in both watersheds the paddy upland forest and wetland were the dominant types of land use in two watershed and the most obvious expanded area was for paddy land and the percentage of upland areas maintained a stable level consequently the percentage of wetlands in the two watersheds decreased and the urban area increased the land use composition analysis over the three decades demonstrated that the land use change dynamics of two watersheds were similar the correlation coefficient r2 value of wetlands and paddy percentage variation was more than 0 73 and the r2 value of expanding of upland was 0 85 the first three watershed hydrological indicators showed a bigger difference due to the large difference in their total area table 2 the distribution of water systems in the abj watershed is more complicated and the drainage density was much higher however the meander coefficient demonstrated that both watersheds hosted curved rivers although the urban area in both watersheds increased the local population density was still low as the agricultural area 3 2 comparison of the vertical distribution of pollutants in sediment cores with each slice of sediment core differences in the vertical distributions of four pollutants in the two watersheds were compared fig 2 in the estuary of the abj watershed c1 the concentration of tn ranged from 0 31 to 0 83 g kg and the average value was 0 45 g kg however the tn value in the estuary of the rl watershed c2 ranged from 0 30 to 2 10 g kg and the average value was 1 34 g kg for the distribution of the tp the value in the rl watershed was also larger than that in the abj watershed concentration between the two watersheds was much smaller the concentration of tp in the abj watershed ranged from 0 37 to 0 93 g kg and the average value was 0 56 g kg in the nl watershed the concentration of tp ranged from 0 46 to 1 34 g kg and the average value was 0 83 g kg the f test a 0 05 indicated that both tn and tp were significantly different in the two watersheds however the vertical deceasing trends of tn and tp for each watershed shared a similar pattern the concentrations of two types of heavy metals had different vertical distributions than the nutrients and abj watershed had higher trace metal concentrations the concentration of zn ranged from 125 25 mg kg to 285 32 mg kg in the abj watershed with an average value of 190 24 mg kg however the concentration of zn ranged from 68 85 mg kg to 99 15 mg kg in nl watershed with an average value of 78 12 mg kg the concentration of as in the abj watershed ranged from 22 67 mg kg to 53 43 mg kg and the average value was 33 66 mg kg in the other watershed the concentration of as ranged from 1 78 mg kg to 4 90 mg kg with an average value of 3 11 mg kg the f test a 0 05 indicated that there was also a significant difference in both zn and as in the two watersheds the concentrations of zn and as in the abj watershed fluctuated more frequently than in the nl watershed 3 3 comparison of temporal trends in nps pollution loading and fluxes from sediment cores after the activity of 210pb was measured for each interval a chronological framework for the sediment cores was established using the constant rate of supply crs model the sedimentation flux of tn and tp revealed pollution history in the watershed which was multiplied by the contaminant concentration and the mass deposition rate of crs from 1970 to 2015 with the swat model the average annual non point source tn and tp loading in the same period were simulated which showed similar patterns in both watersheds the correlation of pollutant flux in sediment and the simulated loads in the two watersheds were calculated fig 3 the general trends in tn flux in the two watersheds was not similar which was presented by an increasing trend in the abj watershed with a minimum value of 1 27 g m2 in 1972 there was a slight increase and a maximum value of 4 09 g m2 a was reached in 2010 the fluctuations in tn flux in the nl watershed were more obvious the maximum tn flux was 8 96 g m2 a in 2013 and there was an abrupt minimum of 1 51 g m2 a in 2005 the bottom layer also presented a much larger value in the nl watershed the correlations of simulated tn loading and sedimentary flux in the same temporal range showed that there was little correlation in the nl watershed however the correlation in the abj watershed was significant p 0 05 and the r2 value was 0 561 the general vertical trends in tp fluxes in the two watersheds since the 1970s were similar the maximum value of tp flux in the abj watershed was 4 62 g m2 a in 2013 and the minimum was 1 52 g m2 a in 1972 the tp flux in the nl watershed maintained an increasing trend and the maximum value was 6 76 g m2 a in 2010 the correlation of tp flux with simulated loading in the two watersheds were strong the r2 values p 0 05 in the abj and nl watersheds were 0 682 and 0 503 respectively compared to tp the tn in two watersheds exhibited a larger flux range due to its mobility characteristics the tn and tp both exhibited larger variances in the nl watershed than the abj watershed the correlations of tn and tp in the abj watershed were both more significant than in the nl watershed the smaller drainage density was likely the reason for these findings given similar meander coefficients and nps pollution loading conditions the higher drainage density in the abj watershed generated stronger transport impact on the nps pollution which has more chance to accumulated in the sediments 3 4 diving force difference analysis between watersheds with the rose figure the simulated yearly nps pollution loading of tn and tp the flux of four pollutants in each layer the yearly precipitation and runoff in the simulated period and the temporal patterns of land use in the two watersheds were compared fig 4 the figure illustrated that the influence of sedimentary processes on the pollutants were clearly different between the watersheds but the differences in precipitation territorial loading and land use conditions were subtle zn and as showed a larger flux in the abj watershed but the tn and tp had a larger flux in the nl watershed the correlation coefficients for zn and as fluxes with the simulated tn loading in the nl watershed were 0 585 and 0 736 respectively regarding the tp loading in the nl watershed the r2 values for zn and as were 0 508 and 0 813 respectively their correlation in the abj watershed was much poorer where the highest correlation coefficient value was 0 308 between sediment as flux with simulated tn loading these differences demonstrated that pollutant transport and sedimentary processes were different the reason for these findings was likely that the low drainage density and smaller meandering rate occurred in the nl watershed deposition in the estuary reflected nps pollution from the whole watershed according to the lower sedimentation flux for heavy metals in th nl watershed there was an obvious relationship to the longer pollutant transport process period in the larger watershed for similar nps pollution loading the larger difference in sedimentary flux demonstrated the impact of hydrological patterns the different interactions of environmental factors nps pollution loading and the temporal spatial variation of pollutants in sediment in the two watersheds were compared with redundancy analysis rda fig 5 based on the rda sequencing charts of the abj and nl watersheds it was concluded that interactions of the pollutant indices with the driving force factors in the two watersheds presented some differences based on the length of the arrows the area of paddy fields was the main controlling factor for nps pollution in the abj watershed precipitation and surface runoff were the critical factors in the nl watershed under similar distributions the correlation between tn and tp fluxes in sediments with an expanding paddy area was clear in the abj watershed similar correlations were not as strong in the nl watershed the simulated watershed tn and tp loading in the two watersheds showed close relationships with the flux of as in sediment which indicated that it can be an indicator for watershed nps pollution dynamics the influence of paddy field area on the temporal nps pollution dynamics was the most significant factor which caused the nps discharged from agriculture and accumulated in the sediments the rda highlighted the close interactions between nps pollution and the territorial factors and distinguished the difference in the sedimentary flux and the hydrological pattern due to the impacts of the spatial scale effect 4 discussion 4 1 difference in driving forces on nps pollution of two scales of watershed the previous observations have demonstrated that there are diverse factors that are related to nps pollution loading and sedimentary flux dynamics in a watershed thiere and schulz 2004 unfortunately most of the factors often co exist or interact simultaneously within the watershed which makes it difficult to establish the importance of each factor individually interlandi and crockett 2003 ferreira et al 2017 considering the large percentage of agricultural area and tillage practices a significant portion of the nps pollution load originates from the long term use of fertilizer in the watershed s agricultural system the climatic patterns and varying farmlands in the two watersheds are very similar but the vertical distributions of tn and tp in sediment from the watersheds are not the same fig 2 this finding indicates that the tn and tp do not share transport mechanisms due to their physic chemical properties difference with the correlation of dated sediment fluxes and temporal patterns the tp shows a better performance in the two watersheds as the stable format but the correlation of tn is different between the two watersheds the distribution of the rose figure showed significant differences between the two watersheds especially in their temporal patterns fig 4 the distributions of land use precipitation and surface runoff are similar in the rose figure and do not have a spatial scale effect on the nps loading in the watersheds the rda analysis also indicates that the expansion of farmland is the primary cause for the temporal change in nps pollution dynamics fig 5 with rapid agricultural development the function of rapidly increasing paddy areas is the same in the two watersheds which is more strongly related to the tn and tp flux at the watershed outlet on the other hand the precipitation has a more direct impact on the simulated watershed tn and tp loadings which is clear in both watersheds however the pollutant flux of sediment is not same in the watersheds under with similar territorial nps loading the tillage practices during agricultural development shows similar zn and as loading on farmland ouyang et al 2016 but there are different concentrations at the sedimentary outlet sedimentation in the watershed outlet is basically dominated by suspension settling conditions and is a concentration of upper stream areas jiao et al 2014 which can indicate most parts of the total yield of nps pollution in the watershed the rose figure comparison and rda both indicate that the driving forces of sedimentary flux are different considering the spatial scale effect 4 2 implications from sediment for watershed nps pollution management the nps pollution has the priority mission for the watershed pollution control rowny and stewart 2012 based on the spatial geographical patterns and climatic conditions supplementary fig 2 the territorial nps pollution of two watersheds share a similar trend the temporal patterns of four pollutants in the vertical sediment flux reflect the history of nps pollution in the catchment area during agricultural development this pattern coincides well with the expected nps modeling data that considers temporal land use variations in the individual watersheds the heavy metals in the watershed are mainly enriched by phosphate fertilizer n guessan et al 2009 in addition to the tn and tp in the sediment the other two heavy metal indicators provide sounder data due to the stable conditions bryan and langston 1992 which increased during the agricultural development and suffered the same impacts in these watersheds cabrera et al 1999 sediment is an important sink of contaminants in a watershed sedláček et al 2017 which is supported by the correlation between tn tp fluxes with nps loading from land surface modeling fig 3 the clear correlations between the temporal sediment flux with simulated tn and tp loadings indicate that nps pollution is the main source for the outlet sediment in the two watersheds however the distinct temporal differences in sediment flux observed between the watersheds demonstrates that the nps transport dynamics in the river watercourse are sensitive to the watershed hydrological conditions the vertical flux of as and zn and their correlations with nps loading can help to distinguish element sources and sedimentary differences the highest enrichment of as in the smaller watershed tributaries can be related to the short distance between farmland and the watershed outlet heavy metals are more sensitive to the river processes than the tn and tp due to sorption with soil particles 4 3 spatial scale effect on watershed nps pollution and uncertainties analysis the spatial scale effect is a pertinent issue in natural science sivertun and prange 2003 which is best expressed by the integration of watershed outlet sediments and nps pollution modeling aguilera et al 2012 the temporal pattern analysis of tn and tp fluxes in sediment demonstrate the consequence of the complexity of river networks and transform processes of pollutants in watercourses with similar territorial conditions these differences are determined by the geomorphologic transport processes and the hydrologic patterns at different watershed scales gebremariam et al 2014 in addition to the impacts of the watershed area and river density the transport time differences of pollutants in the watercourse is another main reason for differences in sedimentary flux it has been demonstrated that the concentration of pollutant particles generally decreases in the flow direction randhir and tsvetkova 2011 these findings are consistent with our results as there was a higher concentration of as and zn in the short river in the abj watershed on the other hand the hydrological pattern in the larger watershed has a higher self cleaning capability than the smaller one the pollutants in the lower basin have the lowest concentration and more chance to transform which causes lower sedimentation fluxes in the larger watershed bissett et al 1999 wu et al 2014 to test the hypothesis in this study the sediment geochemical experiments and nps pollution modeling were used to show that uncertainties exist khadam and kaluarachchi 2006 to decrease these uncertainties the land use interpretation process sediment sampling measurement method and validated modeling parameters are all the same trask et al 2017 the urban area percentage increased intensively during the modeling period which is considered in the modeling of two watersheds but its independent impact on nps loading is not assessed in this agricultural watershed due to the small area the different formation and transport principle of nps pollution from agricultural and urban is the uncertainty factor manta et al 2002 the potential uncertainties of these factors may have the same impact on the results which may not decease the reliability of this study these conditions can highlight the impacts of other varying factors of the watershed and help to determine the validity of the hypothesis presented in this study based on the statistical analysis the impact of hydrological patterns on pollutant and sediment fluxes may be the main uncertainties in the study and therefore deserve future investigation 5 conclusions the transport fate and the influencing factors of nps pollution in a single watershed have been widely studied however the differences of long term driving factors and nps sedimentary fluxes at river outlets of different scales of watersheds has been poorly investigated to our knowledge this study is the first to apply the widely used swat model and sedimentary geochemical analyses to identify the spatial scale effects on the nps pollution dynamics in agricultural watersheds under the similar temporal patterns of land use the nps loading of two watersheds had similar loading levels except for the tn in the nl watershed correlations between the temporal nps loading and the temporal flux in the sediment were high this finding indicated watershed nps loading is significantly associated with precipitation land use and soil properties which were the similar in the two watersheds which did not present an obvious spatial scale effect the sediment geochemical analysis indicated that large differences existed in the vertical distributions of tn and tp between the watersheds the tn and tp had larger values in the larger nl watershed but the smaller abj watershed had larger values of zn and as the rose figure comparison of the two watersheds also demonstrated that there were large differences in pollutant fluxes in sediment between the watersheds with similar natural driving forces rda also indicated that the different interactions of the driving forces and supported the existence of a spatial scale effect with the considerations of watershed hydrological features and territorial nps loading it was concluded that the watershed spatial scale had a direct impact on the nps pollution transport and sedimentary process the larger watershed had a much longer branch length and longer transport period which affected watershed sedimentary processes with smaller fluxes of stable heavy metal indicators additional research is needed to assess the spatial transport patterns of nps pollution in the river watercourse specifically the declining trend in the flow direction and the different load at different water distances acknowledgments the research presented here benefited from financial support from
