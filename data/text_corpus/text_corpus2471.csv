12355,an integrated geophysical investigation using very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em and electrical resistivity methods has been carried out for detection of groundwater bearing fracture zones in hard rock area of sangod block kota district rajasthan a total of seven vlf em profiles and three vertical electrical soundings have been carried out to identify the fracture zones to locate the possible borehole positions for meeting the demand of drinking and irrigation water supply in the area the interpretation of vlf em data is carried out qualitatively using fraser and karous hjelt filters and the interpretation of sounding data is done using ipi2win software the interpretation of vlf em data usually represents the appropriate fracture zones based on higher values of relative apparent current density that correspond to the subsurface fracture the results of the study showed the presence of fracture zones which are prominently oriented in the ne sw and nw se direction the results also showed that most of the fracture zones are located at a depth range of 10 30 m within the subsurface the vertical electrical sounding data are collected at suitable locations corresponding to subsurface fracture zones identified on basis of vlf data the interpretation of ves data also suggest subsurface fracture zone at these locations the vlf em and ves at suitable locations along the vlf profile suggest the existence of fracture zones in part of sangod block of kota district which indicate that the study area has good prospects for groundwater therefore on basis of this study the drilling of productive boreholes are recommended at sounding locations ves 3 along the vlf profile p2 at depth range of 10 20 m ves 1 along the vlf profile p5 at depth range of 10 40 m and ves 2 along the vlf profile p7 at depth range of 5 20 m graphical abstract fx1 keywords electrical resistivity vlf em fracture zone groundwater exploration ipi2win software schlumberger sounding 1 introduction groundwater is vital source of supply for drinking agricultural and industrial uses its exploitation has continued to remain an important issue due to its stark need though there are other sources of water streams rivers lakes and ponds but none is as hygienic as groundwater because groundwater has excellent natural microbiological and generally adequate chemical qualities for majority of its uses okafor and mamah 2012 the occurrence and movement of groundwater in an area are governed by several factors such as topography lithology geological structures depth of weathering extent of fracture secondary porosity soil drainage pattern landforms land use land cover climatic conditions and interrelationship between these factors selvam et al 2015 groundwater occurs in fracture zone in hard rock area and in pore spaces in alluvial area the mapping of fracture zone which is a break in crystalline basement rock due to tectonic forces or intrusion of magmatic bodies is important for civil engineering and hydrogeological applications the geological significance of fracture zones in hydrogeology is that it determines the competency of the underlying rocks the areas that are extensively fractured and where the fractures are deep are considered as weak zones and suitable zones for groundwater exploration and development alagbe et al 2013 geological formations capable of storing water are the main target of groundwater exploration kayode et al 2016 the location and orientation of fracture zones are important for exploration of groundwater modeling fluid flow and contaminant transport in fractured rocks surface geophysical methods are rapid and inexpensive aids to the drilling for determining the locations and orientation of fractured zones in bedrocks surface geophysical methods in conjunction with geologic hydrologic and borehole geophysical investigations can be used to optimize well location jansen and jurcek 1997 or as a stand alone method of fracture detection lewis and haeni 1987 lieblich et al 1991 haeni et al 1993 groundwater occurrence in the hard rock terrain can be very irregular due to abrupt discontinuity in lithology thickness and electrical properties of the overburden and weathered bed rock udaya laxmi and ramadass 2013 exploration of groundwater in hard rock terrain is very challenging and difficult task when the promising groundwater zones are associated with fractured and fissured media in this environment the groundwater potentiality depends mainly on the thickness of the weathered fractured layer overlying the basement mansour 2009 and the water yield depends on the size of fractures and their interconnectivity vlf em method has been applied successfully to map the resistivity contrast at boundaries of fractured zones having a high degree of connectivity parasnis 1973 and yields a higher depth of penetration in hard rock areas because of their high resistivity mcneill and labson 1991 vlf method is capable of delineating fractures in lateral direction effectively compared to the resistivity sounding sharma and baranwal 2005 and in characterizing aquifer structures in a complex environment ozegin et al 2012 the geo electrical resistivity method is generally considered to be the suitable and optimum method for ground water exploration among other geophysical methods this is based on the concept of determination of the subsurface which can yield useful information on the structure composition and content of buried formation mohamaden et al 2016 the vertical electrical sounding ves is itself a well established and recognized tool for groundwater exploration therefore the integrated vlf em and ves surveys can be used solely or together with supporting data from hydrogeology and borehole to optimize well location and fracture detection hubbard 2011 the study area sangod block of kota district rajasthan is a relatively dry and hard rock area with scarcity of water supply for drinking and small irrigation purposes especially in summers therefore in the present study an attempt is made to investigate the water bearing fracture zones in the area using integrated vlf and ves methods the most widely used geophysical methods to delineate the subsurface conductive zones at depth to locate the groundwater potential zones where boreholes could be drilled and to avoid the loss due to unproductive borehole drilling the study would provide suitable locations and depths of potential water bearing fracture zones for borehole drilling in the area for small irrigation and domestic supply purposes 2 description of study area 2 1 location the study area is part of hard rock and alluvial regions of sangod block kota district rajasthan india and is located to the south east of the kota district headquarter it is situated in between longitudes 76 5 50 e to 76 10 e and latitude 24 50 50 n to 24 55 n fig 1 the average annual rainfall in the area is about 752 mm the area lies under semi arid zones of india in this area vlf em and ves survey are conducted along the suitable profiles and points selected on the basis of earlier resistivity profiling survey conducted by groundwater department kota to locate groundwater bearing fracture zones in the area for drilling of boreholes to meet the demand of water supply of the area 2 2 hydrogeology and geology of the study area the study area sangod block is situated in south east of kota district of rajasthan india the climate of the district can be classified as semi arid type the summers are hot and dry and extend from march to mid of the june the winters are cold and extend from december to february the monsoon commences after summers and prevails till the end of september the period from september to november is called the post monsoon period chambal is the principal perennial river in the district and chambal along with its tributaries kalisindh parvan and parvati form the main drainage system in the district the major hydro geological units of kota district are alluvium shales limestones and sandstones shale also occurs as intercalations with sandstone and limestone the rock formations in kota district are mainly sedimentary in nature and belong to vindhyan super group which are overlain in most part of the district by the quaternary alluvium the study area of sangod block consists of shale limestone and sandstone of vindhyan supergroup the vindhyan supergroup is composed mostly of low dipping formations of sandstone shale and carbonate with few conglomerate and volcaniclastic beds separated by a major regional unconformity and several local unconformities bhattacharyya 1996 the regional unconformity occurs at the base of the kaimur group and divides the sequence into two units the lower vindhyans semri group and the upper vindhyans kaimur rewa and bhander groups the outcrop pattern of the super group resembles a simple saucer shaped syncline it is generally believed that the vindhyan basin was a vast intracratonic basin formed in response to intraplate stresses bose et al 2001 the occurrence and movement of groundwater in the area is mainly restricted within the weathered and fractured sandstone shale amaresh and prakash 2003 3 materials and methods of investigation the vlf em data are collected using abem wadi vlf instrument in frequency range 15 30 khz the instrument measured the real in phase component and imaginary out of phase or quadrature component of the vertical to horizontal magnetic field ratio the data are collected along seven vlf traverses p1 to p7 and readings are taken at station interval of 10 20 m depending on a particular traverse the vlf em ground survey is a rapid and powerful method for the study of geologic features within 100 m of the sub surface a qualitative interpretation of vlf em data is carried out using fraser and karous hjelt filtering techniques three vertical electrical sounding ves using schlumberger configuration are conducted around the anomalous zones of vlf profiles for further investigation and quantitative analysis the apparent resistivity values obtained from the survey are plotted against the half electrode spacing on a log log plot the initial interpretation of ves data are carried out using curve matching technique utilizing master curves koefoed 1979 and the corresponding auxiliary curves orellana and mooney 1966 from which the resistivity values and thicknesses of the layers are obtained further interpretation of sounding data is carried out using ipi2win software 4 theory 4 1 very low frequency electromagnetic vlf em method the vlf em is a passive method that uses em waves generated from ground based military radio transmitters for navigation purposes about 42 worldwide operating in the vlf band 15 30 khz as the primary electromagnetic em field to determine the locations of saturated sub vertical conductive zones in the subsurface the primary em wave induces the current flow in the subsurface conductive target body gnaneshwar et al 2011 the induced current in turn generates secondary magnetic field which is detected at the surface the data are collected along the traverses perpendicular to the strike of the subsurface during the survey efforts are made to avoid the traverses along the area that contain cultural features which may mask anomalies associated with the intended target strike while taking the readings it is kept in mind that the direction of transmitting station be perpendicular or nearly perpendicular to the traverse line a qualitative interpretation of vlf em data is carried out on the basis of cross over point between the real and imaginary data which appears as positive peaks in the fraser filtered real curve these regions constitute anomalous zones which can be attributed to the presence of vertical conductor or lateral contacts of different resistivities beneath the surface srigutomo et al 2005 the fraser filter q fraser 1969 is computed using the following filter operator 1 q 2 3 q 4 q 3 q 2 q 1 where q is the electromagnetic em data and subscript represents the station position the fraser filter is applied to real or in phase component of vlf data to transform it into the filtered real vlf data the filtered data shows positive peaks for the anomalous zones that could be a possible conductive body such as fault or fractures fraser and hjelt filtering and subsequent contouring of the observed responses are the most common practices to derive qualitative information about the subsurface fraser 1969 karous and hjelt 1983 the pseudo sections are generated and are shown in color codes with these apparent current density cross section plots it is possible to qualitatively discriminate between conductive and resistive structures where a high positive value corresponds to the conductive subsurface structure and low negative values correspond to the resistive one pirttijarvi 2004 karous hjelt filter is a direct modeling technique which provides good approximation of bodies and underground features that give rise to vlf anomalies karous and hjelt 1983 algorithm is based on biot savart law it assumes a small horizontal layer with several current densities located at a depth equal to the distance between the stations when this method is used for data correction results can be contoured as a proxy of conductivity versus depth function alatorre zamora et al 2014 karous and hjelt 1977 1983 uses linear filter theory to solve the integral equation for the current distribution assumed to be located in a thin horizontal sheet of varying current densities situated everywhere at a depth equal to the distance between the measurement stations by selecting data points at progressively greater distances apart the behavior of the current distribution in the assumed sheet at progressively greater depths can be inferred this determined that the shortest filter that correctly inverts the field of a single current line element with an error less than 8 has the simple form as following karous and hjelt 1977 1983 khalil and santos 2014 2 δ z 2 i a δ x 2 0 205 h 2 0 323 h 1 1 446 h 0 1 446 h 1 0 323 h 2 0 205 h 3 where δz is the assumed thickness of the current sheet ia is the current density x is the distance between the data points and also the depth to the current sheet the values of h 2 to h3 are the normalized vertical magnetic field anomalies at each of the six data points the location of the calculated apparent current density is beneath the center point of the six data points 4 2 electrical resistivity method the schlumberger configuration of electrical resistivity method comprises of four collinear electrodes two current and two potential electrodes separated apart from each other current and potential electrodes are placed in such a manner to maintain one fifth of the spacing between the inner and outer pairs of electrodes the separation between the electrodes progressively increases during the survey while potential electrodes remain in same position until it is observed that the voltage becomes too small to measure sharma 1997 resistivity measurements are associated with varying depths relative to the distance between the current and potential electrodes in the survey and can be interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of a lithologic and or geohydrologic model of the subsurface amadi 2011 further investigation is carried out at the anomalous zones of relative positive apparent current density versus apparent depth on the basis of qualitative interpretation of vlf em data and therefore three vertical sounding has been carried out in the study area at suitable locations using schlumberger configuration the calculation of apparent resistivity ρa is performed using the following equation 3 ρ a π a b 2 2 m n 2 2 m n δ v i where ab and mn are current electrode and potential electrode separation in meters respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 interpretation of vlf em data for interpretation of vlf em data along the vlf profile the khffilt software is used which show both positive and negative fraser and karous hjelt anomalies along the traverses an indication of the probable fracture zones along the traverses the vlf data along seven traverses p1 to p7 are collected at station interval of 10 20 m depending on a particular traverse however to enhance the results of vlf data these are interpolated at interval of 5 m the plot of the raw field data real and imaginary the fraser filtered data and the karous hjelt plots depicting variation of apparent current density with distance for all the traverses are illustrated in figs 2 8 the qualitative interpretation of vlf em data is carried out on the basis of cross over points of real and imaginary data and positive peaks in fraser filtered real curve these regions could represent anomalous zones of conductive body of different resistivities beneath the surface the fraser filter fraser 1969 converts crossover points into peak responses by 90 phase shifting this process removes direct current bias that reduces the random noise between consecutive stations resulting from very low frequency component of sharp irregular responses al tarazi et al 2008 the fraser filter real part always show a positive peak above a conductor while the imaginary part may show a positive as well as a negative peak depending upon the overburden layer the imaginary part is useful while making decision about the quality of the conductor in this work the real part of the filter is used to process the pseudo section of relative apparent current density variation with depth because areas with stronger positive anomalies only on real data map show zones with presence of groundwater ariyo et al 2009 the karous and hjelt pseudo section provides a pictorial indication of the depths of various current concentrations and hence the spatial distribution of subsurface geologic features ogilvy and lee 1991 the apparent current density pseudo sections are represented in color codes with conductivity increasing from negative to positive the high positive value constitutes the conductive sub surface and low negative value represents a resistive sub surface hence the sub surface features of high conductivity are identified on the vlf profiles as possible fracture zones along the vlf profile p1 the plot of fraser filtered data and apparent current density pseudo section using karous hjelt filtering of in phase data show positive response between 75 and 100 m 150 175 m and 225 250 m respectively fig 2 indicating the probable minor fracture zone located in between 75 and 100 m 150 175 m and 225 250 m along the vlf profile p1 at the depth range extending from 10 to 30 m 10 35 m and 5 25 m respectively along the vlf profile p2 the plot of fraser filtered data and apparent current density pseudo section using karous hjelt filtering of in phase data show prominent positive response between 20 and 50 m fig 3 suggesting a probable fracture zone located between 20 and 50 m along the profile at a depth range extending from 10 to 20 m from fig 4 presenting the plot of fraser filtered in phase and apparent current density pseudo section along the vlf profile p3 a positive response is noticed between 100 and 225 m which indicate probable fracture zone in between 100 and 225 m at a depth range of 10 35 m fig 5 presenting the plot of fraser filtered data and apparent current density pseudo section of in phase data along the profile p4 show a positive response from 200 m to 300 m which indicates a probable fracture at a depth range extending from 10 to 50 m the vlf response along the vlf profile p5 shows positive response between 100 and 200 m fig 6 resulting in probable fracture zone at a depth range extending from 10 to 40 m the plot of vlf response along the profile p6 shows positive response of fraser filtered in phase data between 100 and 125 m and 150 225 m distance fig 7 suggesting the probable fracture zones at the depth range extending from 20 to 35 m and 10 35 m respectively fig 8 presenting the plot of fraser filtered data and apparent current density pseudo section of in phase data along vlf profile p7 shows positive response between 140 and 150 m suggesting a probable fracture zone at the depth range of 5 20 m 5 2 interpretation of vertical electrical sounding data the result of vlf em traverses are further corroborated with the vertical electrical sounding data collected using schlumberger configuration near the anomalous zones of high conductivity along the vlf profiles in the area the model result of sounding curves at three sounding locations is shown in fig 9 and corresponding geo electrical cross sections at three sounding locations are shown in fig 10 the interpreted results of ves data consisting of layer parameters and lithology are given in table 1 the result of ves1 along the vlf profile p5 represent surface soil of resistivity about 9 ω m and thickness 2 37 m the second layer consists of subsurface soil of resistivity 19 ω m and thickness 6 7 m and third layer consists of fractured sandstone of resistivity 48 8 ω m and thickness 22 6 m followed by high resistivity compact sandstone as basement rock the sounding results at the location ves 2 along the vlf profile p7 consist of surface and subsurface soil layer followed by fractured and semi fractured sandstone of resistivity 35 2 ω m and 151 ω m with thickness 18 1 m and 24 3 m respectively and a basement of compact sandstone of very high resistivity this low resistivity layers could be the potential zones of groundwater exploration in the study area the sounding conducted at the site ves 3 along the vlf profile p2 suggests a surface and subsurface layers on the top followed by semi fractured sandstone of resistivity 109 ω m and thickness 6 92 m and a basement of compact sandstone of very high resistivity 1442 ω m these fractured zones of low resistivity namely at ves 1 location along the vlf profile p5 ves 2 location along the vlf profile p7 and at ves 3 location along the profile p2 could be the possible zones of groundwater exploration in the study area therefore on the basis of this study a drilling is recommended at the locations ves 1 along the vlf profile p5 ves 2 along the vlf profile p7 and ves 3 along the vlf profile p2 for possible exploration of groundwater at depth range of 10 40 m 5 20 m and 10 20 m respectively 6 conclusion in present research an integrated geophysical study combining vlf em and vertical electrical sounding survey is performed for the delineation of fracture zones in hard rock area of sangod block of kota district rajasthan india in this study vlf em results are used as prior information for selecting the probable fracture zones and locations for carrying out further vertical electrical soundings in the area for detailed information of lithology and depth of water saturated fractures the interpretation of vlf em data is carried out using fraser and karous hjelt filtering of real in phase vlf data the fraser filtered real data with positive peaks indicating the anomalous conductive body and the respective karous hjelt filtering showing low resistivity in apparent current density pseudo sections are interpreted as the probable fracture zones in the area to carry out the further vertical electrical sounding for detailed investigation at these anomalous locations and subsequently three ves are carried out at the locations ves 1 ves 2 and ves 3 along the vlf profiles p5 p7 and p2 respectively the interpretation of ves 1 indicates fractured sandstone of low resistivity about 49 ω m and thickness 22 6 m the interpretation of sounding results of ves 2 along the vlf profile p7 suggests highly fractured sandstone of low resistivity about 35 2 ω m and thickness 18 1 m and semi fractured sandstone of resistivity 151 ω m and thickness 24 3 m while the interpretation of sounding results of ves 3 suggests a semi fractured sandstone of low resistivity about 109 ω m and thickness 7 m these low resistivity regions below the sounding locations ves 1 ves 2 and ves 3 are the potential zones of water saturated fractures therefore the sounding locations ves 1 ves 2 and ves 3 coinciding with the anomalous zones of vlf profiles p5 p7 and p2 respectively could be the probable potential zones of groundwater exploration in the area thus on the basis of this study drilling of the productive boreholes is recommended at the locations ves 1 and ves 2 along the vlf profiles p5 and p7 in the sangod block of kota district rajasthan india to meet out the drinking and irrigation water supply problem at the local stage in the area acknowledgments the authors are thankful to department of geophysics banaras hindu university varanasi for providing

a δ x 2 0 205 h 2 0 323 h 1 1 446 h 0 1 446 h 1 0 323 h 2 0 205 h 3 where δz is the assumed thickness of the current sheet ia is the current density x is the distance between the data points and also the depth to the current sheet the values of h 2 to h3 are the normalized vertical magnetic field anomalies at each of the six data points the location of the calculated apparent current density is beneath the center point of the six data points 4 2 electrical resistivity method the schlumberger configuration of electrical resistivity method comprises of four collinear electrodes two current and two potential electrodes separated apart from each other current and potential electrodes are placed in such a manner to maintain one fifth of the spacing between the inner and outer pairs of electrodes the separation between the electrodes progressively increases during the survey while potential electrodes remain in same position until it is observed that the voltage becomes too small to measure sharma 1997 resistivity measurements are associated with varying depths relative to the distance between the current and potential electrodes in the survey and can be interpreted qualitatively and quantitatively in terms of a lithologic and or geohydrologic model of the subsurface amadi 2011 further investigation is carried out at the anomalous zones of relative positive apparent current density versus apparent depth on the basis of qualitative interpretation of vlf em data and therefore three vertical sounding has been carried out in the study area at suitable locations using schlumberger configuration the calculation of apparent resistivity ρa is performed using the following equation 3 ρ a π a b 2 2 m n 2 2 m n δ v i where ab and mn are current electrode and potential electrode separation in meters respectively 5 results and discussion 5 1 interpretation of vlf em data for interpretation of vlf em data along the vlf profile the khffilt software is used which show both positive and negative fraser and karous hjelt anomalies along the traverses an indication of the probable fracture zones along the traverses the vlf data along seven traverses p1 to p7 are collected at station interval of 10 20 m depending on a particular traverse however to enhance the results of vlf data these are interpolated at interval of 5 m the plot of the raw field data real and imaginary the fraser filtered data and the karous hjelt plots depicting variation of apparent current density with distance for all the traverses are illustrated in figs 2 8 the qualitative interpretation of vlf em data is carried out on the basis of cross over points of real and imaginary data and positive peaks in fraser filtered real curve these regions could represent anomalous zones of conductive body of different resistivities beneath the surface the fraser filter fraser 1969 converts crossover points into peak responses by 90 phase shifting this process removes direct current bias that reduces the random noise between consecutive stations resulting from very low frequency component of sharp irregular responses al tarazi et al 2008 the fraser filter real part always show a positive peak above a conductor while the imaginary part may show a positive as well as a negative peak depending upon the overburden layer the imaginary part is useful while making decision about the quality of the conductor in this work the real part of the filter is used to process the pseudo section of relative apparent current density variation with depth because areas with stronger positive anomalies only on real data map show zones with presence of groundwater ariyo et al 2009 the karous and hjelt pseudo section provides a pictorial indication of the depths of various current concentrations and hence the spatial distribution of subsurface geologic features ogilvy and lee 1991 the apparent current density pseudo sections are represented in color codes with conductivity increasing from negative to positive the high positive value constitutes the conductive sub surface and low negative value represents a resistive sub surface hence the sub surface features of high conductivity are identified on the vlf profiles as possible fracture zones along the vlf profile p1 the plot of fraser filtered data and apparent current density pseudo section using karous hjelt filtering of in phase data show positive response between 75 and 100 m 150 175 m and 225 250 m respectively fig 2 indicating the probable minor fracture zone located in between 75 and 100 m 150 175 m and 225 250 m along the vlf profile p1 at the depth range extending from 10 to 30 m 10 35 m and 5 25 m respectively along the vlf profile p2 the plot of fraser filtered data and apparent current density pseudo section using karous hjelt filtering of in phase data show prominent positive response between 20 and 50 m fig 3 suggesting a probable fracture zone located between 20 and 50 m along the profile at a depth range extending from 10 to 20 m from fig 4 presenting the plot of fraser filtered in phase and apparent current density pseudo section along the vlf profile p3 a positive response is noticed between 100 and 225 m which indicate probable fracture zone in between 100 and 225 m at a depth range of 10 35 m fig 5 presenting the plot of fraser filtered data and apparent current density pseudo section of in phase data along the profile p4 show a positive response from 200 m to 300 m which indicates a probable fracture at a depth range extending from 10 to 50 m the vlf response along the vlf profile p5 shows positive response between 100 and 200 m fig 6 resulting in probable fracture zone at a depth range extending from 10 to 40 m the plot of vlf response along the profile p6 shows positive response of fraser filtered in phase data between 100 and 125 m and 150 225 m distance fig 7 suggesting the probable fracture zones at the depth range extending from 20 to 35 m and 10 35 m respectively fig 8 presenting the plot of fraser filtered data and apparent current density pseudo section of in phase data along vlf profile p7 shows positive response between 140 and 150 m suggesting a probable fracture zone at the depth range of 5 20 m 5 2 interpretation of vertical electrical sounding data the result of vlf em traverses are further corroborated with the vertical electrical sounding data collected using schlumberger configuration near the anomalous zones of high conductivity along the vlf profiles in the area the model result of sounding curves at three sounding locations is shown in fig 9 and corresponding geo electrical cross sections at three sounding locations are shown in fig 10 the interpreted results of ves data consisting of layer parameters and lithology are given in table 1 the result of ves1 along the vlf profile p5 represent surface soil of resistivity about 9 ω m and thickness 2 37 m the second layer consists of subsurface soil of resistivity 19 ω m and thickness 6 7 m and third layer consists of fractured sandstone of resistivity 48 8 ω m and thickness 22 6 m followed by high resistivity compact sandstone as basement rock the sounding results at the location ves 2 along the vlf profile p7 consist of surface and subsurface soil layer followed by fractured and semi fractured sandstone of resistivity 35 2 ω m and 151 ω m with thickness 18 1 m and 24 3 m respectively and a basement of compact sandstone of very high resistivity this low resistivity layers could be the potential zones of groundwater exploration in the study area the sounding conducted at the site ves 3 along the vlf profile p2 suggests a surface and subsurface layers on the top followed by semi fractured sandstone of resistivity 109 ω m and thickness 6 92 m and a basement of compact sandstone of very high resistivity 1442 ω m these fractured zones of low resistivity namely at ves 1 location along the vlf profile p5 ves 2 location along the vlf profile p7 and at ves 3 location along the profile p2 could be the possible zones of groundwater exploration in the study area therefore on the basis of this study a drilling is recommended at the locations ves 1 along the vlf profile p5 ves 2 along the vlf profile p7 and ves 3 along the vlf profile p2 for possible exploration of groundwater at depth range of 10 40 m 5 20 m and 10 20 m respectively 6 conclusion in present research an integrated geophysical study combining vlf em and vertical electrical sounding survey is performed for the delineation of fracture zones in hard rock area of sangod block of kota district rajasthan india in this study vlf em results are used as prior information for selecting the probable fracture zones and locations for carrying out further vertical electrical soundings in the area for detailed information of lithology and depth of water saturated fractures the interpretation of vlf em data is carried out using fraser and karous hjelt filtering of real in phase vlf data the fraser filtered real data with positive peaks indicating the anomalous conductive body and the respective karous hjelt filtering showing low resistivity in apparent current density pseudo sections are interpreted as the probable fracture zones in the area to carry out the further vertical electrical sounding for detailed investigation at these anomalous locations and subsequently three ves are carried out at the locations ves 1 ves 2 and ves 3 along the vlf profiles p5 p7 and p2 respectively the interpretation of ves 1 indicates fractured sandstone of low resistivity about 49 ω m and thickness 22 6 m the interpretation of sounding results of ves 2 along the vlf profile p7 suggests highly fractured sandstone of low resistivity about 35 2 ω m and thickness 18 1 m and semi fractured sandstone of resistivity 151 ω m and thickness 24 3 m while the interpretation of sounding results of ves 3 suggests a semi fractured sandstone of low resistivity about 109 ω m and thickness 7 m these low resistivity regions below the sounding locations ves 1 ves 2 and ves 3 are the potential zones of water saturated fractures therefore the sounding locations ves 1 ves 2 and ves 3 coinciding with the anomalous zones of vlf profiles p5 p7 and p2 respectively could be the probable potential zones of groundwater exploration in the area thus on the basis of this study drilling of the productive boreholes is recommended at the locations ves 1 and ves 2 along the vlf profiles p5 and p7 in the sangod block of kota district rajasthan india to meet out the

natural resources through the world it is the main source of fresh water in semi arid regions and often subjected to severe human impacts razandi et al 2015 at present increasing pollution from city sewage inappropriate land use practices poor irrigation practices industrial wastewaters and intensive agricultural activities make it even more vulnerable mohammadi et al 2009 kumar and pandey 2016 the growing contamination of an aquifer is almost an irreversible process causape et al 2006 almasri 2008 chenini et al 2015 for this basis the protection of groundwater against pollution is of crucial importance zektser et al 2004 the concept of groundwater vulnerability is a keystone in the evaluation of the groundwater contamination and in the development of management options to preserve the groundwater quality fobe and goossens 1990 worrall et al 2002 worrall and besien 2004 thus vulnerability mapping is considered as a fundamental aspect of sustainable groundwater management especially in overexploited and threatens aquifers aydi et al 2013a 2013b groundwater contamination assessment concepts divide a geographical region into zones in terms of their vulnerability to pollution then effective groundwater protection measures are conducted in the susceptible areas prone to contamination bartzas et al 2015 zghibi et al 2016 there are different methods for identifying

specific hydrogeological conditions of the concerned aquifer kazakis and voudouris 2015 these methods omitted some criteria like the residential area concentrated land use proximity to rivers and proximity to road to generate groundwater potential zones map hamza et al 2004 hamza et al 2007 hentati et al 2011 aydi et al 2013a 2013b seekao and pharino 2016 however the integration of gis and multi criteria decision analysis is one of the methodological approaches applied to resolve highly complex decision making problems and being effectively applied in groundwater vulnearbility with criteria and decision options for better accuracy seekao and pharino 2016 rebolledo et al 2016 fernandez and lutz 2010 hence the multi criteria decision analysis methods have been selected for the purpose of the presented study because of their relative straightforwardness and flexibility to combine with gis techniques dujmovic and tre 2011 therefore the vulnerability of the groundwater resources in the agareb region is evaluated and assessed using gis based multi criteria decision analysis as well as using sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of used criteria on the obtained vulnerability map 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the agareb region is situated in the east of sfax city the south part of tunisia fig 1 the local climate of the studied area is classified as arid with average monthly temperature ranging from 8 c january to 30 c july the mean annual rainfall is about 210 mm characterized by dry and warm summer from june to august and cool and wet winter from december to february the mio pliocene and quaternary outcrops cover most of the study region they are mainly in the form of glacis or terraces ben akacha 2001 the agareb aquifer is located in old quaternary layer which is constituted mainly by sand and clay with high permeability beni akhy 1994 therefore it results in an easy infiltration of contaminants in the groundwater the average aquifer thickness is about 30 m chalbaoui 1989 the average well density in the study area is about 1 well km2 and the transmissivity values are 4 10 6 m2 s allouche et al 2015 groundwater chemical analyses such as ph total dissolved solids electrical conductivity and the concentrations of major and minor elements na ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 cl k and no3 demonstrated that most groundwater samples have concentrations higher than the tunisian drinking water guideline nt 09 14 1983 hentati et al 2011 despite the weak groundwater quantity it is used for drinking domestic and especially irrigation purposes because of inadequate surface water 2 2 methodology aquifer vulnerability is computed in gis using eight appreciation criteria such as aquifer type hydraulic conductivity depth to water table slope concentrated land uses proximity to rivers proximity to residential areas and proximity to main roads these criteria are clustered in two main groups including intrinsic and external forces related to aquifer vulnerability the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability concerns included aquifer type hydraulic conductivity and depth to water table the aquifer vulnerability related to external forces group considered slope concentrated land uses proximity to rivers proximity to residential areas and proximity to main roads in the arcview gis all factors introduced as map layers were transformed on a master grid and exported to the idrisi software idrisi ver 32 was used also to buffer the constraints calculate the weights of criteria standardize the factors by fuzzy functions and combine the constraints and factors by mce procedure a master grid cell of 50 50 m2was generated with each cell considered a homogenous unit for any given factor the size of raster cells depends on the resolution requirements and has been selected according to previous studies on tunisia country aydi et al 2013a 2013b the instead of 50 50 m2 raster grid cell size can improve the quality of the results aydi et al 2016 the factors were rated to a byte scale of 0 least vulnerable zones to 10 most vulnerable areas using fuzzy membership functions four fuzzy set membership functions are provided in idrisi sigmoidal j shaped linear and user defined eastman 1993 the selection of appropriate fuzzy functions and their control points are based on of local expert knowledge and extensive literature review related to aquifer vulnerability mapping the product from this normalization process expresses a relative degree of belonging to a fuzzy set ranging from 0 full non membership to 10 full membership for instance fuzzy maps for each criterion have membership values between 0 and 10 where 0 represents the least vulnerable areas and 10 represents the highest vulnerable areas the next step was implementation of analytic hierarchy process ahp to calculate the relative weights of the eight factors this step involved construction of a comparison matrix where weights are determined through the pairwise comparison method developed by saaty 1977 the final stage is to calculate a consistency ratio cr to measure how consistent the judgments have been relative to large samples of purely random judgments the cr should have a value of less than 0 1 to indicate consistence method saaty 1977 the last step included aggregation of all factor using factor weights from the ahp through weighted linear combination wlc method to map groundwater vulnerability to pollution a total score is then obtained as a sum of the products of each factor and its weight saaty 1980 1 s i 1 n w i x i where s is the vulnerability score w1 w2 wi are the weights of the factor and x1 x2 xn are the rated scores of the factor i as the sum of the weights is constrained to 1 the final combined estimate is presented on the same scale 2 3 factor description and application in this study factors were selected according to the extensive literature review hamza et al 2004 hamza et al 2007 gemitzi et al 2006 nobre et al 2007 aydi et al 2013a 2013b seekao and pharino 2016 rebolledo et al 2016 and a set of questionnaires sent to the international expert hydrogeologists likewise bunches of information including hydrogeological and chemicals factors couldn t be mapped and would most likely yield diverse alternatives in the present study eight influential criteria are considered in the computation process and distinguished as intrinsic and external forces criteria table 1 factor group 1 assignment of intrinsic aquifer vulnerability the factor group 1 comprises criteria related to intrinsic aquifer characteristics i e aquifer type hydraulic conductivity and depth to water table 2 3 1 criteria 1 aquifer type two different categories of aquifer types were assigned in the study area unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer unconfined aquifers are pore aquifers basically including the alluvial stores since they are not ensured by a keeping layer any potential toxin discharged on the ground surface may effortlessly come to the groundwater hence kept aquifers are ensured by a limiting layer so toxins are not anticipated that would effectively reach groundwater the layer was converted to raster format with 50 m cell size rescaling categorical data such as aquifer types requires giving a rating to each category based on some knowledge according to their relative vulnerability to pollution gemitzi et al 2006 in this study the aquifer vulnerability rating is specified assuming that the most vulnerable ones are unconfined aquifers which received the highest score value of 10 while confined aquifers are the least vulnerable received a value of 0 table 1 2 3 2 criteria 2 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity measures the ability of the aquifer materials to transmit water sener and sener 2014 the rate of groundwater flow within the aquifer media also controls the rate of contaminant movement baalousha 2006 a well inventory has been created including over 28 boreholes in the study area data have been collected from a variety of sources such as the crda and well from individual drillers the hydraulic conductivity of the agareb aquifer is calculated based on the following equation k t b where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer m s t is the transmissivity m2 s and b is the thickness of the aquifer expressed in m the hydraulic conductivity map obtained by interpolation using inverse distance weighted idw method for kriging and converted to a raster grid the hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 10 6 to 10 4 m s for calcareous soil gypsum from 10 4 to 10 3 m s for sands and from 10 3 to 10 1 m s for limestone a monotonically decreasing sigmoidal form s fuzzy membership function was used for rating assigning highest groundwater vulnerability to hydraulic conductivity values of 10 1 m s and lowest groundwater vulnerability to value of 10 6 m s table 1 2 3 3 criteria 3 depth to water table depth to water table consequently impacts on the degree of interaction between the percolating contaminant and sub surface materials air minerals water and therefore on the degree extent physico chemical attenuation and degradation process rahman 2008 in this study the 94 bores well data was collected from the crda commissariat régional au développementagricole of sfax the well data were then used to generate the map for depth to water table contoured by interpolating using inverse distance weighted idw method in gis software the study area was extracted using the district boundary as a mask the thematic map was thereafter converted into grid to make it raster data with 50 m cell size for gis operation the depth to water table in most of the study area ranges from less than 7 m to more than 60 m in the south west of the study area same as hydraulic conductivity a monotonically decreasing sigmoidal fuzzy function was used table 1 2 3 4 factor group 2 assignment of aquifer vulnerability related to external forces factor group 2 comprises factors external to the aquifer system i e slope proximity to concentrated land use proximity to rivers proximity to residential areas and proximity to main roads 2 3 5 criteria 4 slope slope of the terrain is a key factor which determines the amount of surface runoff and consequently the areas with low slope tend to retain water for a longer period of time al amoush et al 2010 by using the spatial analyst tool of arcview slope values were calculated from the topographic elevations with 50 50 m resolution the slope values were rated according to the normalized 0 10 scale by a monotonically increasing sigmoidal fuzzy membership the control point of fuzzy function membership for full membership is 10 while control point for full non membership is lower than 25 i e areas having a value of 10 have highest vulnerability while areas with lower value than 25 have the lowest vulnerability table 1 2 3 6 criteria 5 proximity to concentrated land use this factor was collected from crda data with 50 50 m resolution and includes all types of land uses that unlike industrial land uses cover a wide range of the study area the subsequent land use categories are introduced in the calculation process urban areas wetlands water vine mariachi culture cereals olive trees forager culture course way forest and naked soil as in the case of aquifer type factor rescaling categorical data such as land uses requires giving a rating to each category based on the results of investigations with experts agronomists environmentalists etc and some knowledge according to their relative groundwater vulnerability on the continuous 0 10 scale a vulnerability rating of 10 has been assigned to urban areas since they are considered to be equally polluting land uses as far as groundwater pollution is concerned a value of 10 was assigned to urban area a rating of 7 was assigned to the cereals mariachi culture forager culture where most of the livestock farming takes place a value of 3 has been assigned to course way and olive trees and 0 to forest to water bodies wetlands water and naked soil the least groundwater vulnerable areas table 1 2 3 7 criteria 6 proximity to rivers proximity to rivers is a decisive factor for groundwater vulnerability because it can be a potential final receiver wastewater in the present study distances to rivers were digitized and transformed to a 0 10 scale using a monotonically decreasing sigmoidal fuzzy membership function for the case study of the agareb aquifer control point of fuzzy function membership for full membership is 500 m while control point for full non membership is 1000 m i e areas having a value less than 500 m have the highest vulnerability while areas with value higher than 1000 m have the lowest vulnerability table 1 2 3 8 criteria 7 proximity to residential areas settlement like town cities and villages were digitized according to the 2014 census data provided by the national statistical service of tunisia each zone of influence has been assigned the value of the town population thus urban areas with a higher population are considered to have influence in greater distances and to a higher extent a monotonically increasing sigmoidal fuzzy membership function was used to convert data to a 0 10 scale i e the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution increases proportionally to the population the control points were set to 10 000 the city with the highest population in the study area where the fuzzy membership function becomes 10 and 0 where fuzzy membership function becomes 0 i e groundwater vulnerability is diminished in areas with no population present table 1 2 3 9 criteria 8 proximity to main roads the roads are the main routes of transport for harmful chemicals and are potential sources of groundwater pollution gemitzi et al 2006 in this study a monotonically increasing sigmoidal fuzzy membership was applied to transform distances to the 0 10 scale the first control point a 500 m indicates the highest vulnerability while the second control point b 3000 m and beyond indicates the least vulnerability table 1 3 results eight appreciation criteria relevant to intrinsic and external forces for aquifer vulnerability were rated using the fuzzy membership functions from table 1 and factors maps were consequently produced the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability concerns included aquifer type hydraulic conductivity and depth to water table the aquifer vulnerability related to external forces group considered slope concentrated land uses proximity to rivers proximity to residential areas and proximity to main roads were used fig 2 showed the normalized factors maps relevant the intrinsic and external forces aquifer vulnerability concerns after rating criteria weightings were performed pairwise comparison method was used to assign weights and establish importance of factor group 1 and factor group 2 using experience of local expert literature review as well as characteristics of the region table 2 shows the pairwise comparison matrix of relative importance and weights associated to the factor group 1 the highest weights assigned to the aquifer type were considered the most important factors the depth to water table is valued higher than the hydraulic conductivity the cr is 0 03 indicating a good consistency of the judgments used for the comparison on the other hand table 3 shows the pairwise comparison matrix of relative importance and weights associated to the factor group 2 the highest weights were assigned to concentrated land use the cr is 0 03 0 1 signifying a good consistency of the judgments used for the comparison weighted linear combination wlc is applied to compute and display two decision alternatives for groundwater vulnerability associated with the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability and the aquifer vulnerability related to external forces factors the two alternatives were generated by the overlay of the assigned weight of the rated criteria fig 3a for the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability and the aquifer vulnerability related to external forces fig 3b the wlc was used also to create the final groundwater vulnerability maps using same weights applied to the two groups of factors using an equal interval classification method groundwater vulnerability results of the agareb region were grouped into five classes low 0 2 moderately low 2 4 moderate 4 6 moderately high 6 8 and high 8 10 the produced vulnerability map is presented in fig 4 from the final groundwater vulnerability map it can be seen that 50 of the study area falls under low vulnerability while 25 and 18 of the study area is in moderately low and medium vulnerability range respectively the moderately high vulnerable and the high vulnerable areas represent 6 and 1 respectively of the study area the high vulnerable zone corresponds to the relatively shallow groundwater depth high permeable soils and densely residential inhabitants in addition there is a high pollution threat from industrials area and concentrated human activity in this zone fig 4 most of the study area falls under low vulnerability this is due to the deep groundwater depth and non concentrated human activity to validate the reliability of vulnerability results the nitrate concentration in groundwater were selected as the most common indicator of the anthropogenic impact on groundwater trojan et al 2003 white et al 2013 in general nitrate does not have a natural source in groundwater system hence its occurrence in groundwater system indicates a pollution source such as from agricultural and anthropogenic activities singh et al 2015 nitrate concentration observed from 100 boreholes in the agareb aquifer was overlaid on the vulnerability map in order to see how many wells was agreement with different vulnerable zones fig 4 most of observed nitrate concentrations in boreholes in the agareb region fields were in accordance with the vulnerability zones identified using gis based multi criteria decision analysis out of 200 wells about 15 wells with a high nitrate concentration 180 mg l coincided with the zone of high vulnerability 20 wells with a nitrate concentration ranging between 135 and 180 mg l overlap with the zone of moderately vulnerability 60 wells which have a nitrate concentration ranging from 90 to 135 mg l coincided with the zone of moderate vulnerability 40 wells with a nitrate concentration ranging between 45 and 90 mg l are located in the moderate low vulnerable zones for the remaining 65 wells with concentrations lower than 45 mg l agree with the zone of low vulnerability this suitable correlation resulted from the surface source of this pollution and the vulnerability parameters representative of the porous media behavior against the contamination process hentati et al 2011 however it should be noted that the concentration of specific pollutants e g nitrate in certain regions cannot be used as a robust calibration tool for groundwater vulnerability results it depends on land use patterns proximity to water supply wells spatial density of sampling wells and potential seasonal and temporal differences of potential contamination sources tilahun and merkel 2010 4 discussions gis based multi criteria decision analysis is a flexible tool that can support the decision makers to find map groundwater vulnerability hence the difficulty in the proposed gis based multi criteria decision analysis is the selection of factor to map groundwater vulnerability especially the choice of fuzzy membership function and their control points it requires a good knowledge of field data and the collaboration of hydrogeologist expert in the weighting and the selected factors in this study fuzzy logic been implemented for the rating of the selected factors ahp methodology was applied for establishing the relative importance of selection factors and weights generation providing an objective weight assessment the wlc was used also to create the final groundwater vulnerability maps using same weights applied to the two groups of factors gemitzi et al 2006 and kaliraj et al 2014 stated that gis based multi criteria decision analysis as an expert knowledge based approach is very useful for solving complex problems comparing the usual drastic model with the gis technique and multi criteria decision analysis one can conclude that the classic drastic model ignored some layer like proximity to road and land use with negligible potential and classified them as moderate application of the gis technique and multi criteria decision analysis to the prediction of groundwater vulnerability provides more flexible solutions 5 conclusions in this study the combination of gis and multi criteria decision analysis has opened up new opportunities to overcome the challenges task in assessing groundwater vulnerability to pollution the adopted methodology has been tested in the case of an agareb aquifer located in south tunisia eight factors relevant to intrinsic and external forces for aquifer vulnerability were analyzed in the computation process categorized into two main groups two decision alternatives for groundwater vulnerability were produced in order to produce the composite groundwater vulnerability map to pollution based on the groundwater vulnerability determination in the area it is concluded that about 1 area is covered under very high vulnerable zone 6 area under moderately high vulnerable zone 18 area under moderately vulnerable zone 25 area under moderately low vulnerable zone and 50 area under low vulnerable zone the results were validated using nitrate concentration in groundwater observed nitrate concentrations in boreholes are in accordance with the vulnerability map the results were validated using nitrate concentration in ground water observed nitrate concentrations in boreholes are in accordance with the vulnerability map certainly this study is not exhaustive but may serve as a scientific basis for groundwater vulnerability assessments and for effective groundwater resources management it can also be used for design of groundwater monitoring networks finally the method can be replicated in other similar region with appropriate modifications of selection and ratings of factors acknowledgements we are grateful to the anonymous reviewers and editorial team whose constructive comments greatly improved the manuscript

natural resources through the world it is the main source of fresh water in semi arid regions and often subjected to severe human impacts razandi et al 2015 at present increasing pollution from city sewage inappropriate land use practices poor irrigation practices industrial wastewaters and intensive agricultural activities make it even more vulnerable mohammadi et al 2009 kumar and pandey 2016 the growing contamination of an aquifer is almost an irreversible process causape et al 2006 almasri 2008 chenini et al 2015 for this basis the protection of groundwater against pollution is of crucial importance zektser et al 2004 the concept of groundwater vulnerability is a keystone in the evaluation of the groundwater contamination and in the development of management options to preserve the groundwater quality fobe and goossens 1990 worrall et al 2002 worrall and besien 2004 thus vulnerability mapping is considered as a fundamental aspect of sustainable groundwater management especially in overexploited and threatens aquifers aydi et al 2013a 2013b groundwater contamination assessment concepts divide a geographical region into zones in terms of their vulnerability to pollution then effective groundwater protection measures are conducted in the susceptible areas prone to contamination bartzas et al 2015 zghibi et al 2016 there are different methods for identifying

specific hydrogeological conditions of the concerned aquifer kazakis and voudouris 2015 these methods omitted some criteria like the residential area concentrated land use proximity to rivers and proximity to road to generate groundwater potential zones map hamza et al 2004 hamza et al 2007 hentati et al 2011 aydi et al 2013a 2013b seekao and pharino 2016 however the integration of gis and multi criteria decision analysis is one of the methodological approaches applied to resolve highly complex decision making problems and being effectively applied in groundwater vulnearbility with criteria and decision options for better accuracy seekao and pharino 2016 rebolledo et al 2016 fernandez and lutz 2010 hence the multi criteria decision analysis methods have been selected for the purpose of the presented study because of their relative straightforwardness and flexibility to combine with gis techniques dujmovic and tre 2011 therefore the vulnerability of the groundwater resources in the agareb region is evaluated and assessed using gis based multi criteria decision analysis as well as using sensitivity analysis to evaluate the effect of used criteria on the obtained vulnerability map 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the agareb region is situated in the east of sfax city the south part of tunisia fig 1 the local climate of the studied area is classified as arid with average monthly temperature ranging from 8 c january to 30 c july the mean annual rainfall is about 210 mm characterized by dry and warm summer from june to august and cool and wet winter from december to february the mio pliocene and quaternary outcrops cover most of the study region they are mainly in the form of glacis or terraces ben akacha 2001 the agareb aquifer is located in old quaternary layer which is constituted mainly by sand and clay with high permeability beni akhy 1994 therefore it results in an easy infiltration of contaminants in the groundwater the average aquifer thickness is about 30 m chalbaoui 1989 the average well density in the study area is about 1 well km2 and the transmissivity values are 4 10 6 m2 s allouche et al 2015 groundwater chemical analyses such as ph total dissolved solids electrical conductivity and the concentrations of major and minor elements na ca2 mg2 so4 2 hco3 cl k and no3 demonstrated that most groundwater samples have concentrations higher than the tunisian drinking water guideline nt 09 14 1983 hentati et al 2011 despite the weak groundwater quantity it is used for drinking domestic and especially irrigation purposes because of inadequate surface water 2 2 methodology aquifer vulnerability is computed in gis using eight appreciation criteria such as aquifer type hydraulic conductivity depth to water table slope concentrated land uses proximity to rivers proximity to residential areas and proximity to main roads these criteria are clustered in two main groups including intrinsic and external forces related to aquifer vulnerability the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability concerns included aquifer type hydraulic conductivity and depth to water table the aquifer vulnerability related to external forces group considered slope concentrated land uses proximity to rivers proximity to residential areas and proximity to main roads in the arcview gis all factors introduced as map layers were transformed on a master grid and exported to the idrisi software idrisi ver 32 was used also to buffer the constraints calculate the weights of criteria standardize the factors by fuzzy functions and combine the constraints and factors by mce procedure a master grid cell of 50 50 m2was generated with each cell considered a homogenous unit for any given factor the size of raster cells depends on the resolution requirements and has been selected according to previous studies on tunisia country aydi et al 2013a 2013b the instead of 50 50 m2 raster grid cell size can improve the quality of the results aydi et al 2016 the factors were rated to a byte scale of 0 least vulnerable zones to 10 most vulnerable areas using fuzzy membership functions four fuzzy set membership functions are provided in idrisi sigmoidal j shaped linear and user defined eastman 1993 the selection of appropriate fuzzy functions and their control points are based on of local expert knowledge and extensive literature review related to aquifer vulnerability mapping the product from this normalization process expresses a relative degree of belonging to a fuzzy set ranging from 0 full non membership to 10 full membership for instance fuzzy maps for each criterion have membership values between 0 and 10 where 0 represents the least vulnerable areas and 10 represents the highest vulnerable areas the next step was implementation of analytic hierarchy process ahp to calculate the relative weights of the eight factors this step involved construction of a comparison matrix where weights are determined through the pairwise comparison method developed by saaty 1977 the final stage is to calculate a consistency ratio cr to measure how consistent the judgments have been relative to large samples of purely random judgments the cr should have a value of less than 0 1 to indicate consistence method saaty 1977 the last step included aggregation of all factor using factor weights from the ahp through weighted linear combination wlc method to map groundwater vulnerability to pollution a total score is then obtained as a sum of the products of each factor and its weight saaty 1980 1 s i 1 n w i x i where s is the vulnerability score w1 w2 wi are the weights of the factor and x1 x2 xn are the rated scores of the factor i as the sum of the weights is constrained to 1 the final combined estimate is presented on the same scale 2 3 factor description and application in this study factors were selected according to the extensive literature review hamza et al 2004 hamza et al 2007 gemitzi et al 2006 nobre et al 2007 aydi et al 2013a 2013b seekao and pharino 2016 rebolledo et al 2016 and a set of questionnaires sent to the international expert hydrogeologists likewise bunches of information including hydrogeological and chemicals factors couldn t be mapped and would most likely yield diverse alternatives in the present study eight influential criteria are considered in the computation process and distinguished as intrinsic and external forces criteria table 1 factor group 1 assignment of intrinsic aquifer vulnerability the factor group 1 comprises criteria related to intrinsic aquifer characteristics i e aquifer type hydraulic conductivity and depth to water table 2 3 1 criteria 1 aquifer type two different categories of aquifer types were assigned in the study area unconfined aquifer and confined aquifer unconfined aquifers are pore aquifers basically including the alluvial stores since they are not ensured by a keeping layer any potential toxin discharged on the ground surface may effortlessly come to the groundwater hence kept aquifers are ensured by a limiting layer so toxins are not anticipated that would effectively reach groundwater the layer was converted to raster format with 50 m cell size rescaling categorical data such as aquifer types requires giving a rating to each category based on some knowledge according to their relative vulnerability to pollution gemitzi et al 2006 in this study the aquifer vulnerability rating is specified assuming that the most vulnerable ones are unconfined aquifers which received the highest score value of 10 while confined aquifers are the least vulnerable received a value of 0 table 1 2 3 2 criteria 2 hydraulic conductivity hydraulic conductivity measures the ability of the aquifer materials to transmit water sener and sener 2014 the rate of groundwater flow within the aquifer media also controls the rate of contaminant movement baalousha 2006 a well inventory has been created including over 28 boreholes in the study area data have been collected from a variety of sources such as the crda and well from individual drillers the hydraulic conductivity of the agareb aquifer is calculated based on the following equation k t b where k is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer m s t is the transmissivity m2 s and b is the thickness of the aquifer expressed in m the hydraulic conductivity map obtained by interpolation using inverse distance weighted idw method for kriging and converted to a raster grid the hydraulic conductivity values ranged from 10 6 to 10 4 m s for calcareous soil gypsum from 10 4 to 10 3 m s for sands and from 10 3 to 10 1 m s for limestone a monotonically decreasing sigmoidal form s fuzzy membership function was used for rating assigning highest groundwater vulnerability to hydraulic conductivity values of 10 1 m s and lowest groundwater vulnerability to value of 10 6 m s table 1 2 3 3 criteria 3 depth to water table depth to water table consequently impacts on the degree of interaction between the percolating contaminant and sub surface materials air minerals water and therefore on the degree extent physico chemical attenuation and degradation process rahman 2008 in this study the 94 bores well data was collected from the crda commissariat régional au développementagricole of sfax the well data were then used to generate the map for depth to water table contoured by interpolating using inverse distance weighted idw method in gis software the study area was extracted using the district boundary as a mask the thematic map was thereafter converted into grid to make it raster data with 50 m cell size for gis operation the depth to water table in most of the study area ranges from less than 7 m to more than 60 m in the south west of the study area same as hydraulic conductivity a monotonically decreasing sigmoidal fuzzy function was used table 1 2 3 4 factor group 2 assignment of aquifer vulnerability related to external forces factor group 2 comprises factors external to the aquifer system i e slope proximity to concentrated land use proximity to rivers proximity to residential areas and proximity to main roads 2 3 5 criteria 4 slope slope of the terrain is a key factor which determines the amount of surface runoff and consequently the areas with low slope tend to retain water for a longer period of time al amoush et al 2010 by using the spatial analyst tool of arcview slope values were calculated from the topographic elevations with 50 50 m resolution the slope values were rated according to the normalized 0 10 scale by a monotonically increasing sigmoidal fuzzy membership the control point of fuzzy function membership for full membership is 10 while control point for full non membership is lower than 25 i e areas having a value of 10 have highest vulnerability while areas with lower value than 25 have the lowest vulnerability table 1 2 3 6 criteria 5 proximity to concentrated land use this factor was collected from crda data with 50 50 m resolution and includes all types of land uses that unlike industrial land uses cover a wide range of the study area the subsequent land use categories are introduced in the calculation process urban areas wetlands water vine mariachi culture cereals olive trees forager culture course way forest and naked soil as in the case of aquifer type factor rescaling categorical data such as land uses requires giving a rating to each category based on the results of investigations with experts agronomists environmentalists etc and some knowledge according to their relative groundwater vulnerability on the continuous 0 10 scale a vulnerability rating of 10 has been assigned to urban areas since they are considered to be equally polluting land uses as far as groundwater pollution is concerned a value of 10 was assigned to urban area a rating of 7 was assigned to the cereals mariachi culture forager culture where most of the livestock farming takes place a value of 3 has been assigned to course way and olive trees and 0 to forest to water bodies wetlands water and naked soil the least groundwater vulnerable areas table 1 2 3 7 criteria 6 proximity to rivers proximity to rivers is a decisive factor for groundwater vulnerability because it can be a potential final receiver wastewater in the present study distances to rivers were digitized and transformed to a 0 10 scale using a monotonically decreasing sigmoidal fuzzy membership function for the case study of the agareb aquifer control point of fuzzy function membership for full membership is 500 m while control point for full non membership is 1000 m i e areas having a value less than 500 m have the highest vulnerability while areas with value higher than 1000 m have the lowest vulnerability table 1 2 3 8 criteria 7 proximity to residential areas settlement like town cities and villages were digitized according to the 2014 census data provided by the national statistical service of tunisia each zone of influence has been assigned the value of the town population thus urban areas with a higher population are considered to have influence in greater distances and to a higher extent a monotonically increasing sigmoidal fuzzy membership function was used to convert data to a 0 10 scale i e the vulnerability of groundwater to pollution increases proportionally to the population the control points were set to 10 000 the city with the highest population in the study area where the fuzzy membership function becomes 10 and 0 where fuzzy membership function becomes 0 i e groundwater vulnerability is diminished in areas with no population present table 1 2 3 9 criteria 8 proximity to main roads the roads are the main routes of transport for harmful chemicals and are potential sources of groundwater pollution gemitzi et al 2006 in this study a monotonically increasing sigmoidal fuzzy membership was applied to transform distances to the 0 10 scale the first control point a 500 m indicates the highest vulnerability while the second control point b 3000 m and beyond indicates the least vulnerability table 1 3 results eight appreciation criteria relevant to intrinsic and external forces for aquifer vulnerability were rated using the fuzzy membership functions from table 1 and factors maps were consequently produced the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability concerns included aquifer type hydraulic conductivity and depth to water table the aquifer vulnerability related to external forces group considered slope concentrated land uses proximity to rivers proximity to residential areas and proximity to main roads were used fig 2 showed the normalized factors maps relevant the intrinsic and external forces aquifer vulnerability concerns after rating criteria weightings were performed pairwise comparison method was used to assign weights and establish importance of factor group 1 and factor group 2 using experience of local expert literature review as well as characteristics of the region table 2 shows the pairwise comparison matrix of relative importance and weights associated to the factor group 1 the highest weights assigned to the aquifer type were considered the most important factors the depth to water table is valued higher than the hydraulic conductivity the cr is 0 03 indicating a good consistency of the judgments used for the comparison on the other hand table 3 shows the pairwise comparison matrix of relative importance and weights associated to the factor group 2 the highest weights were assigned to concentrated land use the cr is 0 03 0 1 signifying a good consistency of the judgments used for the comparison weighted linear combination wlc is applied to compute and display two decision alternatives for groundwater vulnerability associated with the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability and the aquifer vulnerability related to external forces factors the two alternatives were generated by the overlay of the assigned weight of the rated criteria fig 3a for the intrinsic aquifer vulnerability and the aquifer vulnerability related to external forces fig 3b the wlc was used also to create the final groundwater vulnerability maps using same weights applied to the two groups of factors using an equal interval classification method groundwater vulnerability results of the agareb region were grouped into five classes low 0 2 moderately low 2 4 moderate 4 6 moderately high 6 8 and high 8 10 the produced vulnerability map is presented in fig 4 from the final groundwater vulnerability map it can be seen that 50 of the study area falls under low vulnerability while 25 and 18 of the study area is in moderately low and medium vulnerability range respectively the moderately high vulnerable and the high vulnerable areas represent 6 and 1 respectively of the study area the high vulnerable zone corresponds to the relatively shallow groundwater depth high permeable soils and densely residential inhabitants in addition there is a high pollution threat from industrials area and concentrated human activity in this zone fig 4 most of the study area falls under low vulnerability this is due to the deep groundwater depth and non concentrated human activity to validate the reliability of vulnerability results the nitrate concentration in groundwater were selected as the most common indicator of the anthropogenic impact on groundwater trojan et al 2003 white et al 2013 in general nitrate does not have a natural source in groundwater system hence its occurrence in groundwater system indicates a pollution source such as from agricultural and anthropogenic activities singh et al 2015 nitrate concentration observed from 100 boreholes in the agareb aquifer was overlaid on the vulnerability map in order to see how many wells was agreement with different vulnerable zones fig 4 most of observed nitrate concentrations in boreholes in the agareb region fields were in accordance with the vulnerability zones identified using gis based multi criteria decision analysis out of 200 wells about 15 wells with a high nitrate concentration 180 mg l coincided with the zone of high vulnerability 20 wells with a nitrate concentration ranging between 135 and 180 mg l overlap with the zone of moderately vulnerability 60 wells which have a nitrate concentration ranging from 90 to 135 mg l coincided with the zone of moderate vulnerability 40 wells with a nitrate concentration ranging between 45 and 90 mg l are located in the moderate low vulnerable zones for the remaining 65 wells with concentrations lower than 45 mg l agree with the zone of low vulnerability this suitable correlation resulted from the surface source of this pollution and the vulnerability parameters representative of the porous media behavior against the contamination process hentati et al 2011 however it should be noted that the concentration of specific pollutants e g nitrate in certain regions cannot be used as a robust calibration tool for groundwater vulnerability results it depends on land use patterns proximity to water supply wells spatial density of sampling wells and potential seasonal and temporal differences of potential contamination sources tilahun and merkel 2010 4 discussions gis based multi criteria decision analysis is a flexible tool that can support the decision makers to find map groundwater vulnerability hence the difficulty in the proposed gis based multi criteria decision analysis is the selection of factor to map groundwater vulnerability especially the choice of fuzzy membership function and their control points it requires a good knowledge of field data and the collaboration of hydrogeologist expert in the weighting and the selected factors in this study fuzzy logic been implemented for the rating of the selected factors ahp methodology was applied for establishing the relative importance of selection factors and weights generation providing an objective weight assessment the wlc was used also to create the final groundwater vulnerability maps using same weights applied to the two groups of factors gemitzi et al 2006 and kaliraj et al 2014 stated that gis based multi criteria decision analysis as an expert knowledge based approach is very useful for solving complex problems comparing the usual drastic model with the gis technique and multi criteria decision analysis one can conclude that the classic drastic model ignored some layer like proximity to road and land use with negligible potential and classified them as moderate application of the gis technique and multi criteria decision analysis to the prediction of groundwater vulnerability provides more flexible solutions 5 conclusions in this study the combination of gis and multi criteria decision analysis has opened up new opportunities to overcome the challenges task in assessing groundwater vulnerability to pollution the adopted methodology has been tested in the case of an agareb aquifer located in south tunisia eight factors relevant to intrinsic and external forces for aquifer vulnerability were analyzed in the computation process categorized into two main groups two decision alternatives for groundwater vulnerability were produced in order to produce the composite groundwater vulnerability map to pollution based on the groundwater vulnerability determination in the area it is concluded that about 1 area is covered under very high vulnerable zone 6 area under moderately high vulnerable zone 18 area under moderately vulnerable zone 25 area under moderately low vulnerable zone and 50 area under low vulnerable zone the results were validated using nitrate concentration in groundwater observed nitrate concentrations in boreholes are in accordance with the vulnerability map the results were validated using nitrate concentration in ground water observed nitrate concentrations in boreholes are in accordance with the vulnerability map certainly this study is not exhaustive but may serve as a scientific basis for groundwater vulnerability assessments and for effective groundwater resources management it can also be used for design of groundwater monitoring networks finally the method can be replicated in other similar region with appropriate modifications of selection and ratings of factors acknowledgements we are grateful to the anonymous reviewers and editorial team whose constructive comments greatly improved the manuscript 
12357,evaluation of groundwater quality is very important in arid regions like united arab emirates where high evaporation rates and absence of present day recharge coupled with increasing groundwater extraction may limit its use for irrigation purposes the liwa aquifer in abu dhabi emirate is known for its intensive agriculture activities which depend on groundwater exploitation the objective of the study was to determine the hydrochemical processes governing the groundwater chemistry evaluation of groundwater quality and suitability for irrigation use in the present study 41 groundwater samples were collected from liwa area in abu dhabi and analyzed for various physiochemical parameters such as ph total dissolved solids tds electrical conductivity ec na k ca2 mg2 co3 hco3 cl so4 2 no3 and heavy metals electrical conductivity varies between 328 and 3003 us cm with an average value of 1478 5 us cm results show that changes in the groundwater chemistry is mainly controlled by rock weathering to some extent evaporation and agricultural activities the sodium ion was the main cation with an average value of 2923 2 mg l while the chloride ion was the dominant anion with an average value of 5670 8 mg l the water in the study area is mostly saline due to the dominance of these two ions according to piper diagram the main groundwater type in the study area was na cl so4 type the

surficial aquifer of liwa region ranges from 0 18 to 0 31 liwa region has witnessed significant decline in groundwater levels forestry department and other existing wells indicate a regional water table decline of less than 10 m between 1990 and 2005 for example the water table has declined by less than 3 m near liwa an area of widespread agricultural pumping the greatest declines occurred about 20 km north of liwa and about 10 km west of liwa along the liwa crescent based on its appropriateness liwa region has been selected for aquifer storage recovery 3 methodology 41 groundwater samples were randomly collected in march 2017 from water wells in the liwa aquifer in abu dhabi emirate united arab emirates fig 1 the samples were collected in polyethylene bottles of 1 l capacity prior to their filling with sampled water the plastic bottles were rinsed with distilled water to minimize the chance of any contamination the preservation of the samples was done by adding 65 of

12358,a number of geophysical investigations have been carried out over the least two years as part of a study for identifying suitable sites for underground dams in the semiarid region of south east brazil the results obtained in the municipality of jenipapo de minas have allowed identification of basement structures beneath shallow soil cover of the intermittent stream bolas according to current interpretation of electrical resistivity profiles and pseudo sections obtained in inversion techniques this structure is characterized by a high resistivity layer more than 1200ωm beneath a low resistivity surface layer less than 500ωm at depths of 1 5 m the high resistivity layer has been interpreted as the top parts of the highly impermeable metamorphic rocks of the basement rocks the low resistivity layer is composed mostly of sandy soil in the bed of the bolas stream results of repeat resistivity surveys carried out during dry and wet seasons have allowed new insights into the appearances of subsurface channels such features are associated with episodes of subsurface flow of water infiltration into the soil layer during periods of rainy season it appears that geoelectric surveys may be employed in mapping spatial and temporal characteristics of subsurface water flows associated with infiltration episodes of meteoric waters into subsoil layers beneath the stream bed identification of such features have been found to be useful in selection of suitable sites for grouting the foundation of underground dams in the study area of the present work graphical abstract fx1

placed on how to manage such resources in a sustainable manner clearly it is necessary to set limits for development and use of groundwater in a manner that can be sustained for relatively large period of time without causing unacceptable environmental economic or social consequences alley et al 1999 in the coming decades sustainability of surface resources is expected to become one of the key issues and shift towards groundwater inevitable the 1992 conference on global water resources in rio de janeiro brazil proposed implementation of subsurface dams a prime goal in its agenda 21 as part of recommendations for generating additional complementary water resources such projects are particularly suitable for use as small scale water supply in arid and semiarid regions these have the potential to act as anti erosion mechanisms in harvesting water resources prinz and singh 2000 in raising groundwater levels and in minimizing evaporation losses beaumont and kluger 1973 according to tsumuro 1998 underground damming may be an efficient method to fight against desertification it has the additional advantage of minimizing evaporative loss of impounded waters and does not interfere with environmental conditions at the dam site hanson and nilsson 1986 brito et al 1999 telmer and best 2004 usually underground dams are constructed in alluvial valleys a trench is dug perpendicular to the direction of surface drainage within the alluvial sediment down to the bedrock or at least as deep as the available equipment will allow the downstream wall and the bottom of the trench are covered with suitably selected impermeable sheets and then the trench is backfilled with the displaced alluvium the general schematics of the principle of operation of underground dam have been discussed extensively in the literature see e g gomes et al 2017 selection of sites for such dams require detailed subsurface studies earlier works during decades prior to 1970 were based on shallow excavations of near surface layers in a few selected spots followed by evaluation of soil samples such studies were also accompanied by analysis of the geologic context of the local structural features however uncertainties in such projects were considerable and success rates low with the advent of modern geophysical instrumentation of the decades of 1990 use has been made of the more reliable exploration techniques in investigation of subsurface layers it is well known in studies of applied geophysics that bulk electrical resistivity of the subsurface is dependent not only on the porosity of the soil layers but also on the characteristics of pore fluids these include electrical conductivity temperature saturation and cation exchange capacity or clay content of pore fluids hayley et al 2007 revil et al 1998 also moisture contents and temperature of the subsurface strongly influence the resistivity of soft sediments bernstone et al 2000 chambers et al 2009 guerin et al 2004 harmon and hajicek 1992 hayley et al 2009 nevertheless very little work has been carried out on variations in the physical properties of subsurface soil layers is response to changes in climatic conditions and precipitation changes occurring at the surface in the present work we investigate the viability of using geophysical surveys for understanding time dependent variations in electrical properties of subsurface layers and use it for selection of sites suitable for construction of underground dams in a semiarid region of brazil 2 study area the site selected in the present study is located in the low lying valley regions of jequitinhonha and mucuri of the municipality of jenipapo de minas in the state of minas gerais brazil the map of fig 1 indicates the locality selected in this figure the green colored curve indicates the setubal river which is perennial the red colored curve indicates the local stream bolas which is intermittent having no surface runoff water flow during the dry season the locality martins indicated in this map refer to the site where geophysical studies were carried out it is situated in a region where availability of water for domestic and agricultural purposes is a major problem especially during the dry season the map of fig 1 also outlines the local geologic units and drainage system of the area selected in the present work according to results of geological studies the rock formations in the municipality of jenipapo de minas is composed predominantly by the salinas formation pems of the macaúbas group in the east according to codemig 2012 there are areas of quaternary sedimentary rocks qtd these are composed of alluvium colluvium deposits overlying tertiary plateau surfaces geologic mapping has also identified occurrences of tertiary sediments of the são domingos formation tsd 3 climatological and hydrogeological aspects here we provide brief discussions of the climatological and hydrogeological characteristics of the study area the implications of interconnection between these two aspects were not obvious during the initial stages of this study even though the relations between precipitation run off of flood waters and subsurface infiltration were well understood hence the possibility that the interactions between climate pattern and hydrogeological characteristics has the potential to contribute to transient changes in the electrical properties of subsurface environments was considered the climatological data indicate that droughts are recurrent in the region and while el nino has driven some of these events others are more dependent on the tropical north atlantic sea surface temperature fields the drought affecting this region during the last 5 years is particularly remarkable it reveals intensity and impact patterns not seen during past decades in the regional economic framework these have contributed to significant reductions in water levels of surface reservoirs in the region leading to acute episodes of water crisis that was magnified by the negative rainfall anomalies since 2010 the regional pluviometry data employed in the present work are derived from reports furnished by the local organization for development of social infra structure emater mg analysis of data collected revealed considerable variability in monthly and annual precipitation levels fig 2 illustrates the nature of variations in the monthly mean values of rainfall for the period of 2005 2016 it is clear that the main draught season spans over the period from april to september while most of the rainfall occurs between the months of october to march characteristics of fluvial drainage pattern and surface morphology also has implications for low levels of retention of rain water in soil layers in many localities the altitude drops from values of higher than 900 m to as low as 400 m over distances of less than 10 km such variations contribute to high indices of surface runoff providing poor conditions for retention of flood waters in the soil layer hypsometric map of the study area derived by gomes and gomes 2015 is provided in fig 3 the hydrogeological domains in the municipality of jenipapo de minas have features determined by two dominant rock types 1 neoproterozoic metamorphic rocks and paleozoic granites which constitute highly fractured rock formations but which are relatively impermeable 2 cenozoic detrital covers which are highly permeable for groundwater flows as a result the aquifers in these domains can be considered as falling into categories of near impermeable fractured systems and highly permeable granular systems the hydrogeological potential of the fissure system is dependent on the intercommunication of the discontinuities an aspect that usually translates to random and small scale reservoirs cprm 2005 it occurs throughout the municipality and is related to the schist rocks of the macaúbas group and the mangabeiras granite in general it presents low hydrogeological potential with structural features responsible for local variations in groundwater productivity the granular aquifer system is represented by poorly consolidated sediments which constitute the detrital deposits of sand clay composition in hydrogeological terms it may be considered as lateralized these have primary porosity and good permeability cprm 2005 gomes et al 2016 4 geophysical studies a number of studies were carried out in the municipality of jenipapo de minas with the objective of identifying sites suitable for construction of underground dams it included compilations of data on local topography drainage systems and water wells the focus of initial efforts has been in mapping intermittent streams and identifying suitable sites for detailed geophysical surveys in the present work we report progress obtained in electrical resistivity surveys in the locality of martins the location of the profiles is shown in fig 4 the stream bed has intermixing deposits of sand and clay which forms a covering layer over the basement rocks outcrops of schist and granite are present along isolated stretches of the stream bed the banks of the stream reveal presence of erosional features and are composed mostly of clays deposited during past drainage episodes the geophysical surveys with focus on acquisition of electrical resistivity profiles were carried out on two different occasions along geoelectric profile 1 the first one was carried out during the dry season in the month of july 2016 on this occasion the stream bed was dry and had no fluvial discharge however shallow excavations revealed the presence of water in the subsurface soil layer the second survey was carried out during the end of the rainy season in april of 2017 at this time there were occasional episodes of localized precipitation but it did not lead to fluvial discharges along the stream bed the geoelectric profile 2 was carried out only in 2017 as part of attempt to better understand the physical properties of lithologic sequences in a nearby well 5 field procedures and initial data processing agi super sting resistivity equipment was used in data acquisition all measurements were carried out along profiles indicated in red color in fig 4 the werner arrangement was adopted for electrode configuration with spacing of four meters the built in software of the equipment used allows automatic acquisition and display of field data contact resistance test was carried out during the preparatory stage prior to field works during the initial phase data acquired in the field were processed using the earth imager 2d software finite element techniques coggon 1971 rijo 1977 dey and morrison 1979 were employed in data processing and in elaboration of electric resistivity model of the soil cover the cholesky decomposition technique was adopted in solving the model equations the main purpose has been to reduce misfit between field measurements and calculated values of a physically plausible model an inversion method based on procedure proposed by loke et al 2003 was employed in processing field data obtained in electrical resistivity surveys one of the objectives of the resistivity inversion has been to find a resistivity model whose response predicted values best fits the measured data the goodness of fit was characterized by calculating root mean square rms error in percent advanced geosciences 2008 the number of steps in the inversion is defined by the number of repetitions that the nonlinear iterative process needs to be performed in the present study the iteration cycle was interrupted when the value of rms becomes less than 3 or when a prescribed maximum number of iterations in the present case 8 is reached analysis of apparent electrical resistivity data generated an inversion model that presented the rms error values of 2 30 and 2 99 for the results acquired in the years 2016 and 2017 respectively 6 resistivity profiles and pseudo sections resistivity profiles are useful for initial assessment of electrical property variations of the sites selected as mentioned earlier the first set of geoelectric profiles were acquired in the dry season of the year 2016 at all depth levels the apparent resistivity is low 400 ωm along the initial segment of the profiles it increased to relatively higher values of 400 ωm in the middle segment between 80 and 96 m in length and then decreased back to lower values in the final segment the middle section with higher resistivity 400 ωm values match roughly with the main channel of dry stream bed the pseudo section of measured data for this survey is illustrated in the upper panel of fig 5 the results of the second survey acquired at the end of the wet season of 2017 are presented in the lower panel of fig 5 it also reveals a similar pattern with relatively high resistivity values in the central parts and low resistivity values along the border sections however the peak values of the second survey are systematically low when compared with those of the first survey it is clear indication that seepage of rain water into the subsurface layers have led to notable reductions in the resistivity of the medium along the central parts of the profile 7 inverted models of pseudo sections the pseudo sections of these geoelectric profiles for the dry season of 2016 and the end of the wet season of 2017 illustrated in fig 5 refer to a representation of the observational data acquired in the field illustrating vertical and horizontal distribution of electrical apparent resistivity the resistivity section models obtained in the inversion process for data acquired in 2016 and 2017 are illustrated in fig 6 in this case effects of surface elevation are also included note that the profile has relatively better resolution the trapezoidal shapes of the profiles in these figures result from the truncation process it leads to removal of a portion of the profile edges based on values of the aspect ratio of horizontal depth offset this procedure reduces uncertainties arising from edge effects in the interpretation it also minimizes undesirable effects of possible artifacts created by interpolation in those regions that do not have measured data it is also convenient to note that the black arrows in this figure indicate approximate limits of the main channel of the bolas stream thus the right margin is indicated by the abbreviation rm and the left margin by the abbreviation lm in both figures the ranges of resistivity and color scale settings adopted are identical note that both of profiles indicate a layer of low resistivity 300 ωm near the surface with thickness ranging from 1 5 to 6 m this is underlain by a layer with resistivity values in excess of 500 ωm the sharp resistivity contrast is indication of substantial changes in lithology occurring at shallow depths beneath the area traversed by the profile the dashed curve in black color indicates the upper limit of bedrock with resistivity greater than 1200 ωm depths to top of bedrock are slightly higher in the 2017 profile it is considered an indication of the effect of infiltration of meteoric waters leading to slightly reduced resistivity in the top layer a further geoelectric profile was acquired in 2017 at a site of only 5 m from a well drilled for groundwater by cprm the result is shown in fig 7 according to descriptive log data of this well the top layer is mostly weathered soil extending to a depth of 5 4 m the deeper parts of this well penetrates schist sequences which extend to depths of at least 104 m the log data of this well has been useful in identification of rock types responsible for the observed electrical resistivity variations in particular it has been possible to establish an association of the upper zone with the water saturated soil sediment cover where electrical resistivity values fall in the range of 22 ωm to about 300 ωm according to results illustrated in fig 7 the top layer is composed of two types of sediments the upper one is composed of sand and pebbles in the streambed while the lower one is composed of clays along the stream margins beneath the surficial sediment layer there is a thin transition layer where resistivity is higher than 1200 ωm beneath this intermediate layer resistivity increases rapidly to values in excess of 5000 ωm this deep layer has been considered indicative of basement rocks which are relatively impermeable schist sequences 8 transient changes in resistivity triggered by precipitation the interest here is in examining possible occurrence of changes in the subsurface electrical resistivity regime during the transition from the dry season to the wet season visual identification of transient variations in resistivity profiles is difficult as the presence of large magnitude variations associated with lithologic changes dominate the resistivity distribution in normal pseudo sections a convenient means of getting around this problem is to examine percentage changes in resistivity relative to a conveniently chosen mean value the advantage of this approach can be seen in the display of percent changes in resistivity illustrated in fig 8 this figure indicates areas where positive changes in resistivity has occurred marked in red color relative to those where negative changes indicated in blue color has taken place it is obvious that areas where decreases in resistivity has taken place is much larger in size than those where increases in resistivity have occurred such a pattern is compatible with the argument that episodes of precipitation have contributed to an overall decrease in resistivity values over the problem domain continuing further on this line of reasoning allows the postulate the belts of low resistivity may be considered as related to the migration paths of subsurface waters it is curious that there are progressive and systematic decreases in resistivity values along such paths which may be considered as compatible with the possibility of steady migration of waters into pockets of accumulation boundaries of such inferred zones of water accumulation are indicated by dashed curves the black arrows leading the dotted patterns 1 and 3 indicate down flowing trails of surface waters the total change in resistivity along such trails is more than 200 of the results of the first survey in 2016 a corresponding situation may also be envisaged by considering electrical conductivity inverse of resistivity values in the problem domain the results of such an attempt is illustrated in fig 9 the differences in conductivities of accumulating pockets indicate changes of over 80 9 conclusions the results of geoelectric surveys indicate the existence of three layers beneath the dry bed of the local bolas stream near the site of martins a semiarid region of the municipality of jenipapo de minas brazil the top layer has low electrical resistivity less than 500 ωm which has been considered as indicating the presence of a water saturated sandy layer in the subsoil below this top layer is a thin transition zone where substantial increases of resistivity occur more than 1200 ωm this is underlain by high resistivity layer with characteristics of the deep basement rocks results of repeat resistivity surveys carried out during dry and wet seasons have allowed insights into the appearances of subsurface percolation channels we advent the hypothesis that such features may be considered as associated with episodes of subsurface infiltration of meteoric waters into the soil layer occurred during periods of rainy season it points to the possibility that geoelectric surveys may be employed in mapping spatial and temporal characteristics of subsurface water flows such flow channels are likely to be associated with infiltration episodes of meteoric waters into subsoil layers identification of such features have been found to be useful in selection of suitable sites for grouting the foundation of underground dams in the study area of the present work we conclude that the bottommost layer beneath the bed of the local stream bolas may be considered as a suitable candidate for grouting the foundation of the proposed underground dam near the village of martins in the municipality of jenipapo de minas brazil however grouting operations should take care to avoid zones of seepage into subsurface layers according to results of geoelectric surveys the main infiltration channel is located at distance of approximately 90 m from the left bank of the stream acknowledgments this study is part of the doctoral thesis project of the first author at the department of

12358,a number of geophysical investigations have been carried out over the least two years as part of a study for identifying suitable sites for underground dams in the semiarid region of south east brazil the results obtained in the municipality of jenipapo de minas have allowed identification of basement structures beneath shallow soil cover of the intermittent stream bolas according to current interpretation of electrical resistivity profiles and pseudo sections obtained in inversion techniques this structure is characterized by a high resistivity layer more than 1200ωm beneath a low resistivity surface layer less than 500ωm at depths of 1 5 m the high resistivity layer has been interpreted as the top parts of the highly impermeable metamorphic rocks of the basement rocks the low resistivity layer is composed mostly of sandy soil in the bed of the bolas stream results of repeat resistivity surveys carried out during dry and wet seasons have allowed new insights into the appearances of subsurface channels such features are associated with episodes of subsurface flow of water infiltration into the soil layer during periods of rainy season it appears that geoelectric surveys may be employed in mapping spatial and temporal characteristics of subsurface water flows associated with infiltration episodes of meteoric waters into subsoil layers beneath the stream bed identification of such features have been found to be useful in selection of suitable sites for grouting the foundation of underground dams in the study area of the present work graphical abstract fx1

resistivity surveys carried out during dry and wet seasons have allowed insights into the appearances of subsurface percolation channels we advent the hypothesis that such features may be considered as associated with episodes of subsurface infiltration of meteoric waters into the soil layer occurred during periods of rainy season it points to the possibility that geoelectric surveys may be employed in mapping spatial and temporal characteristics of subsurface water flows such flow channels are likely to be associated with infiltration episodes of meteoric waters into subsoil layers identification of such features have been found to be useful in selection of suitable sites for grouting the foundation of underground dams in the study area of the present work we conclude that the bottommost layer beneath the bed of the local stream bolas may be considered as a suitable candidate for grouting the foundation of the proposed underground dam near the village of martins in the municipality of jenipapo de minas brazil however grouting operations should take care to avoid zones of seepage into subsurface layers according to results of geoelectric surveys the main infiltration channel is located at distance of approximately 90 m from the left bank of the stream acknowledgments this study is part of the doctoral thesis project of the first author at the department of geophysics of the national observatory on mcti the field surveys were carried out with operational support by the municipality of jenipapo de minas the group of studies and research in geosciences and

12359,the ultimate goal of this paper is to explore ways to upgrade energy and water services in rural areas of bangladesh while improving resource recovery the study analyzes the potential of a poly generation system using locally available biomass resources cow dung and agriculture residue for providing cooking energy electricity and drinking water to a rural community a questionnaire survey was conducted in pani para village with 52 households to investigate demand patterns and estimate the resource potential and amount of biogas needed in the poly generation system a poly generation system with 150 m3 biogas digester and a 10 kwe generator is required to meet cooking energy electricity and water demand in the village co digestion of available resources including cow dung and agriculture residues can provide 48 250 m3 biogas year which is sufficient to supply electricity and clean drinking water to all households in the village in addition around two thirds of the households can use biogas for cooking the sensitivity analysis shows that if the amount of agriculture residues is increased by 15 also cooking gas can be provided to all households the results indicate that such integrated solutions are worth further exploration graphical abstract fx1 keywords poly generation biogas cooking fuel electricity water 1 introduction bangladesh is one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world eighty percent of the population in the country lives in rural areas and approximately half has access to electricity asaduzzaman et al 2010 kerosene lamps hurricane and kupi are the most used appliances for lighting national institute of population research and training niport 2013 currently about 90 of the rural dwellings use traditional stoves and low grade solid fuels for cooking national institute of population research and training niport 2013 mainali et al 2014 biomass resources used for energy purpose include agricultural waste and residues cow dung and fuel wood jashimuddin et al 2006 inefficient combustion in traditional cooking stoves results in huge energy losses indoor air pollution and widespread respiratory diseases particularly among women and children yearly about 4 3 million premature deaths in the world of which 46 000 in bangladesh are associated with household air pollution who 2009a another alarming issue in the country is arsenic contamination of drinking water nearly 92 of the rural areas are affected by arsenic contaminated water biswas 2011 the long term use of contaminated water leads to different types of skin diseases cancer children s mental health and cardiovascular diseases loutatidou et al 2017 annaduzzamana et al 2018 thus energy water and health problems are intertwined in rural bangladesh solar pv technologies expansion of grid lines have been in practice for expansion of rural energy access while various water treatment technologies viz filtration membrane separation and ion exchange are used for cleaning the water in bangladesh however such efforts focus on one dimension of rural problems at a time missing the potential benefits of synergies and integration developmental challenges are complex and need to be addressed in a holistic manner in this context there are reasons to explore synergies in the implementation of sustainable development goals sdgs viz energy access sdg 7 good health and wellbeing sdg 3 and clean drinking water sdg 6 the ultimate goal of this paper is to explore ways to upgrade energy and water services in rural areas of bangladesh while improving resource recovery more specifically we evaluate the potential use of an integrated poly generation system in a village of bangladesh for providing clean energy and water the idea is to explore synergies and opportunities offered by innovative solutions for managing local resources to promote sustainable development a techno economic analysis of the poly generation system was carried out in a previous study khan et al 2014 in this paper we explore the possibility of implementing such a system in a typical village of bangladesh the insights are expected to inform on local conditions and the extent to which the technology can be disseminated to address multiple objectives in rural areas of the country following this introduction section 2 describes the methodology used in the study also presenting the biogas poly generation system and the village pani para that was chosen for the case study section 3 presents the estimation of energy demand in pani para section 4 discusses the socio economic attributes affecting clean energy and water service choices in the village total biogas potential available and amount needed to supply the village with energy and water is estimated in section 5 final conclusions are presented in section 6 2 methodology and data source the methodology used for this research comprises literature review and field survey the field work provided opportunity for close contact with the community and direct observation of characteristics of the local rural life the technical solution uses locally available biomass resources e g animal dung and agricultural waste as input therefore the site visit and survey were important for assessing the local availability of biomass resources as well as the demand for energy and drinking water in addition the survey served to analyze energy use patterns in relation to income and other characteristics of the 52 households in the village the perception and preferences of different socio economic groups could be observed and linked to the potential adoption of the poly generation technology for the purpose of our analysis we selected a typical poor village in bangladesh the pani para village is located in the faridpur district and was selected in consultation with a local partner organization the grameen shakti 1 1 grameen shakti is a well established ngo organization focusing on development work in bangladesh http www gshakti org the founder muhammad yunus is a nobel prize laureate the organization is well known to the rural population throughout the country not least due to the dissemination of energy technologies such as biogas the criteria adopted for site selection were i village without access to electricity or clean cooking fuels and ii located in the arsenic affected zone easy access to the site was also taken into consideration while choosing the village as if proven attractive the study could lead to a demo project to showcase the solution a semi structured questionnaire was used to carry out a survey in pani para village the questionnaire was designed in consultation with local experts from grameen shakti to gather socio economic data determine the energy demand and use patterns among different income groups and identify potential biomass sources for biogas production in the village household energy was estimated based on the collected information and used to verify the viability of the poly generation system proposed rapid rural appraisal rra technique was used to extract information regarding the socio economic conditions and fuel preferences rra is an effective technique to get information about social economic and environmental conditions of a rural location in close collaboration with community members the idea was to involve the community in all aspects of the data collection takasaki and braham 2000 freudenberge 2011 the principle of triangulation and search for convergence in the data collected from various sources was applied for crosschecking data quality data were also collected on the agriculture waste and animal dung available in each household and then used to estimate the biogas potential we wanted to identify the types of biomass available in the village that can potentially be used for biogas production in addition we wanted to calculate if the available resources are sufficient to meet the village s demand for cooking energy electricity and arsenic free drinking water when using a poly generation technology the researchers spent 3 weeks in the field and collected data with the support of local staff from grameen shakti it was important to incorporate women s perception in the survey as they are typically responsible for collecting firewood drinking water and cooking however women in bangladesh are often reluctant to speak to outsiders to overcome that the team had a female bengali native language speaker in the field work as a result the ratio of male to female respondents achieved was almost equal 51 male and 49 female rapport building is important when collecting reliable information from the respondent chambers 1994 luo and liu 2014 the facilitation role of the personnel from grameen shakti s local office throughout the survey contributed to the positive attitude and openness of the local population 2 1 proposed poly generation system for provision of clean energy and water the poly generation system considered in this study comprises a biogas digester unit an electricity generator unit and a membrane distillation md unit for water purification as implied in the term poly generation includes the generation of multiple outputs this system uses low value products such as agricultural waste and animal dung to produce multiple high value outputs viz electricity clean water and cooking gas if implemented in rural areas within favorable institutional and market conditions this technical solution can bring significant improvements to life quality as shown in the techno economic analysis previously carried out for the system khan et al 2014 fig 1 illustrates the flows and functionalities of the poly generation system cattle dung and agriculture residues viz rice straw wheat straw vegetable waste available in the village can be used in an anaerobic digester to generate biogas the plug flow digester can efficiently handle large volumes of substrate and operate under mesophilic conditions temperatures above 35 c the main advantages of the plug flow digester are i simple construction ii lower cost compared to other digesters and iii possibility of using different mixes of substrate with high percentage of solid content jewell and dell orto 1981 as proposed here part of the produced biogas will be distributed for cooking purposes and the other part will be used in a biogas generator for electricity production a thorough technical description can be found in khan et al 2014 in principle biogas is suitable for combustion in any type of engine including gas engines otto engine diesel engines gas turbines and stirling engines khan et al 2014 however biogas based internal combustion engines are the most commonly used for small scale electricity generation because of the low upfront cost and relatively easy operation and maintenance in comparison to other types of engines dimpl 2010 the electricity generated can be used for electrifying rural households in the combustion process the average efficiency of the engine is only about 30 thus around 70 of the energy is lost in the form of flue gas a part of the low grade heat in the flue gas can be extracted using a heat exchanger and utilized in a membrane distillation unit to purify arsenic contaminated water the arsenic contaminated water gets heated in the heat exchanger and passes through the membrane distillation unit the membrane distillation md is a thermally driven separation process and only vapor phase volatile compounds pass through a porous hydrophobic membrane being condensed on the cooling side the md unit achieves separation through the vapor pressure differences that exists between the porous hydrophobic membrane surfaces to purify the water at the end of this process arsenic and bacteria free clean water is obtained the amount of arsenic found in the water purified using this process is 0 4 μg l meaning that it is safe for drinking khan et al 2014 kullab and martin 2011 the permissible maximum amount of arsenic in drinking water as recommended by world health organization is 10 μg l khan et al 2014 chakraborti et al 2010 the process operates at lower temperature below normal water boiling temperature and the hydrostatic pressure in the md unit is lower in comparison to conventional pressure driven membrane processes like reverse osmosis ro alkhudhiri et al 2012 a small amount of heat is extracted from the cooling side and used to pre heat the digester and maintain the mesophilic condition the slurry obtained in this process can be used in fishponds to produce plankton and feed fish or as fertilizer in agriculture farms herrero et al 2015 the temperature inside the plug flow digester can be maintained at about 35 c by extracting the waste heat from the cooling side of the md unit 2 2 the pani para village in bangladesh pani para village is situated at a distance of 7 km from alfadanga upazilla sub district in faridpur district of bangladesh see fig 2 alfadanga is the only main town close to the village there is a small single lane brick road connecting the village to the town where cycles vans and auto rickshaws can use to reach the village houses in the village are clustered in small groups of 5 10 houses there are 52 households with a total of 261 inhabitants living in pani para all 52 households were surveyed for the purpose of this analysis the village pani para is not electrified yet but alfadanga sub district has access to electricity with a load shedding of 2 4 h every day general information about the village is summarized in table 1 the literacy rate of the villagers is 48 which is below the national average literacy rate of 58 bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs report on the bangladesh literacy survey 2010 most of the households in the village are poor but there are nevertheless significant differences among their income levels the average monthly expenditure is a proxy to disposable household income pandey and chaubal 2011 information on the average monthly household expenditures was collected through the survey the whole sample was then divided into three disposable income groups indicated as low medium and high income the low income group comprised 17 households with an average income of usd 57 month the medium income group comprised another 17 households with an average income of usd 107 month and the high income group consisted of 18 households with an average income of usd 342 month 1 usd 84 bdt 3 estimation of energy demand in pani para this section presents the energy mix and the estimated energy demand across different income groups in pani para village since most people do not keep any formal record of their fuel consumption the amount of biomass fuel used by the households had to be calculated based on understanding of local circumstances and information gathered during the survey it was relatively easy for the villagers to provide information on their agriculture production rather than on the amount of residue generated we estimated different types of agriculture residue consumption based on i the total agriculture production of each household in the village ii residue to final economic product ratio rpr ratio of non edible plant parts left after harvest to the final edible product and iii the average portion of the specific residue used for energy purposes ravindranath et al 2005 most people use local resources available at their own premises as agriculture residue or cattle dung and only a few buy fuel wood or cow dung the dung yield varies according to body weight of the cow and feed type the average weight of a bangladeshi cow is 150 kg which yields around 10 kg of dung per day khan et al 2014 snv 2011 fao 1996 we used the number of cattle in each household and the average yield per cow to estimate the amount of cattle dung available in each household data on the consumption of kerosene for lighting was easier to obtain as all households buy kerosene from the local market all households 100 rely on biomass for cooking irrespective of their income class a previous study carried out at noakhali in bangladesh also revealed that rural households relied solely on biomass for cooking miah et al 2011 different mixes of biomass sources are used for cooking depending upon availability agriculture residue along with leaves and branches cover about 50 of the cooking fuel needs followed by cattle dung 42 and firewood 8 respectively see fig 3 pani para is not electrified and the village is located far from the grid kerosene is the main energy source for lighting 92 but solar pv lights and dry cell batteries are also used by some households 8 solar pv systems are installed in the village with support from grameen shakti and micro finance schemes the villagers make 15 25 down payment and pay the rest on installments during a period varying between 12 and 36 months service charges are up to 12 islam et al 2014 solar panels of different capacities 20 85 w have been installed in the village and vary according to the household requirements and affordability also dry cell batteries are used in torch lights during the evening and night but the use is very limited household energy was estimated based on information collected during the survey the specific energy content considered for each fuel type followed parameters suggested by world bank world bank 2010 primarily 90 of the households use traditional biomass agriculture residue fuel woods and cattle dungs in mud stoves 6 use improved cook stoves and the other 4 of the households use biogas stoves with cattle dung as feedstock for cooking household income is one of the social attributes that influences the energy usage pattern fig 4 shows the overall energy consumption in the village across different income levels not surprisingly the high income household has much higher per capita energy consumption when compared to the low income groups previous research on household energy consumption has also indicated that the rural energy demand increases with rising income level ekholm et al 2010 mainali et al 2012 srivastava et al 2012 the estimated annual average energy consumption per capita is around 8 gj in pani para this value is quite close to the energy consumption 7 gj capita observed in a similar rural village in kalaroa sub district in bangladesh hassan et al 2012 notably the variation in the energy consumption is mainly in the cooking fuel per capita energy demand for lighting is almost the same in all the three income groups apparently the villagers use kerosene lamps to meet minimum lighting requirements irrespective of income 4 social and economic attributes affecting clean energy and water choices in pani para 4 1 willingness to adopt clean energy fuels in this section we analyze the households willingness to adopt clean fuels and the share of disposable income they are willing to spend on energy for lighting and cooking exposure to smoke and particulates due to the inefficient burning of solid fuels and black carbon emissions from kerosene lamps are the cause of indoor air pollution health problems and environmental degradation bruce et al 2000 desai et al 2004 however moving from traditional fuels to modern fuels is challenging extreme poverty and lack of competitive markets for modern fuels have forced rural people to heavily rely on traditional low grade solid fuels which are locally available almost at no cost the attributes that determine the choices of fuel can be broadly categorized into i socio economic attributes such as household income education age and gender and ii product specific attributes such as efficiency of cooking technologies and inconvenience associated with the fuels mainali et al 2012 takama et al 2012 the respondents were asked if they are willing to change to new fuels and what would motivate change of current cooking practices about 92 of the respondents indicated that they are willing to change cooking fuel fig 5 shows the main reason for household s willingness to change the current cooking fuel fifty four percent of households pointed out the inconvenience caused by the smoke as main reason for willing to change 24 of the households indicate the huge amount of time spent in collecting biomass as the main reason another 20 of the households want to change primarily for safety reasons and a small portion 2 of the households mention the cost of fuel as a primary reason and believe that improved cooking practices may help to save money when asked about their willingness to pay for the clean fuels around 80 households indicated that they would pay for clean cooking gas around 90 of the households are willing to pay for electricity lighting around 8 were already using solar pv and thus are used to pay for electricity most of the households that indicated no willingness to pay were living under extreme poverty notably however many low income households are willing to pay for upgrading cooking fuels and lighting fig 6 indicates how much of the disposable income households are willing to spend to acquire clean energy both for cooking and lighting the amount increases in line with increasing income levels and thus households with higher monthly income are willing to spend more than the households with lower income as can be read in the left vertical axis in fig 6 however the share of disposable income that the households are willing to spend on clean energy is significantly higher among the poor households than the rich ones that is 7 5 in the low income group in contrast with 5 2 in the high income group right vertical axis in fig 6 in addition it has also been observed that the willingness to pay is higher for lighting than for cooking in all income groups today most groups are able to obtain cooking fuel for free while kerosene has to be bought for lighting also the few that have access to electricity have to pay to install the equipment this may explain the higher preparedness among households for the fact that lighting particularly electricity will come at a cost although the population seems aware of problems related to the cooking fuels presently being used and the benefits of clean fuels their willingness to pay for the latter may still be constrained by the threshold implied in going from a free fuel to one that they have to pay for 4 2 water situation and willingness to pay for clean water the survey has shown that the drinking water demand in the village is around 2 2 5 l per person per day depending on the season the source of water for domestic services are tube well pond river etc villagers mainly collect drinking water from their private and community tube well for meeting the daily demand of cooking and drinking water during the survey it was also reported that the water in the vicinity is contaminated with high amount of iron and arsenic the women and girls have to spend 30 60 min each day fetching water from the community tube wells the existing practice is to collect water free of charge from these tube wells still most of people around 95 interviewed were willing to pay for the clean water service however there was no clear answer on how much they are willing to pay for the clean water services another recently conducted study in one a village in rural bangladesh has shown that villagers are willing to pay up to 3 of their disposable income for clean water islam et al 2018 4 3 health risks associated with cooking fuels and drinking water in bangladesh between 45 and 63 thousand premature deaths are associated with arsenic in drinking water every year around 43 000 death are associated with household indoor air pollution due to cooking fuels larsen 2016 who 2009b in this study we also explored the health impact associated with the cooking fuels and drinking water in the village common air borne diseases attributed to use of cooking fuels common among the villagers are asthma chronic headache eye irritation and respiratory infection and burn problems from our survey it has been found that 85 households are affected by these diseases the women and children are at high risk as they are the most exposed to the smoke in the kitchen similarly diarrhea black and weak teeth numbness and skin abrasions are common diseases in the village which can be attributed to contaminated water around 70 of the households have at least a member affected by one of the above listed water borne diseases fig 7 shows the percentage of households suffering from various diseases attributed to cooking fuels and the drinking water in the next section we explore the potential of providing clean energy and drinking water in a sustainable way focusing on the circularity of the local resources and harnessing the synergies among water energy and agriculture 5 demand and supply of biogas for a poly generation system in pani para 5 1 estimation of biogas to supply clean energy and water the information on available cattle dung and agricultural residue was collected during the field study and used for calculating the biogas potential in the village to estimate the total biogas required in the village to substitute fuels and provide improved energy services we assessed i the present final energy demand for cooking and ii the potential electricity demand in the village iii the amount water that can be purified in the electricity generation process the energy demand for cooking was estimated based on the household energy survey data the total useful energy demand was estimated based on the fuels and efficiency of stoves being used in the community the total amount of biogas needed for generating electricity for the village is estimated considering the potential demand for daily electricity in the village household and some productive end uses using calorific values of biogas and engine efficiency to generate such electricity the details on the estimations are presented in the sections below 5 1 1 biogas for cooking the annual amount of each fuel used in pani para and the useful energy obtained are presented in table 2 the overall fuel efficiency in the village is quite low 13 6 each household demand was taken into account while estimating the total final and useful energy useful cooking energy demand in pani para amounts to 278 gj year thus for biogas stoves with 60 efficiency the biogas needed for cooking in the whole village amounts to 463 gj year approximately 21 000 m3 year it has been observed that households cook two meals per day in average so the estimated average demand for biogas per meal per person is 0 11 m3 the demand varies among the households and across different income groups the demand in low income households is 0 083 m3 per meal per person while in the high income household it is 0 15 m3 per meal per person other studies have revealed that biogas demand for cooking can vary from 0 10 to 0 2 m3 meal person depending upon socio economic attributes such as food culture and income levels talukder 2010 5 1 2 biogas for electricity generation and clean water most people in pani para lack access to electricity and the nearest electrified area is alfadanga town located 7 km from the village during the survey the villagers showed interest and were quite enthusiastic about the possibility of getting electricity however the questions asked were aimed at an estimation of the load demand and no false promise was made about the implementation of a poly generation project the respondents were asked about i how many hours lighting they need daily and ii priorities regarding electrical appliances that they would like to have in case they had access to electricity they were asked to rank among choices including bulbs refrigerators fans television and radio and specify if they had any other preferences as expected almost all households indicated lighting as the first priority followed by fan refrigerator television and radio notably also households that already have solar pv are using electricity mainly for lighting and fan water pumps irrigation pumps huller grinder some retail shops and tailor shop are some of the potential end uses identified in the pani para village which can help to improve the local rural economy end uses similar to the ones identified for pani para village have benefitted various villages in bangladesh and in india purohit and kandpal 2007 bose et al 2013 based upon results from the survey a daily load demand has been estimated for pani para as shown in fig 8 each household has different needs for electricity depending upon their family size income level and preference in terms of appliances for the purpose of designing the daily load demand profile a three to five efficient lamps for each household with an average demand of 75 w b one ceiling fan 60 w operating for 12 h in 10 of the households c a television 80 w operating for 3 h in 10 of the households d radio 20 w operating for 3 h in 20 of the households and e refrigerators 500 w operating 24 h in 4 households were taken into account the productive business loads have been also estimated viz grinder huller around 6 kw operating for around 8 h per day on average irrigation and water pumps 3 kw for 3 h per day and some tailoring and retail shops about 1 kw for 6 h each day the average electricity demand of a household was estimated at 27 kwh per month productive end use demand in the village at 63 kwh day and energy internally consumed in the poly generation plant for running small pumps and lighting at 24 kwh day thus the average electricity demand of the village is estimated at 150 kwh per day including 10 distribution loss seasonal variation in the load has been taken into account for example considering more hours in the use of fans during the summer the efficiency of the gas generator varies from 26 to 32 depending upon the engine loading conditions part load or full load respectively assuming 30 of average efficiency in the generating system the biogas demand for electricity generation is around 32 800 m3 per year thus the biogas needed to meet cooking and electricity demand in pani para amounts to 53 800 m3 per year the contaminated water is purified in the membrane distillation unit with the utilization of waste heat from flue gas produced during the electricity generation this means that no additional biogas is required for cleaning the water around 0 6 kwh of low grade waste heat is needed to purify 1 l of water in the md unit kullab and martin 2011 in this way around 585 l of safe drinking water will be generated each day using waste heat generated during production of electricity which is sufficient to meet the drinking water demand of 2 2 5 l per day per person in the village this demands a poly generation system with a biogas digester for 150 n m3 and a biogas based generator of 3 phases and 10 kw capacity the typical daily load demand and potential clean water production from the poly generation system is shown in fig 8 5 2 biomass resources and biogas potential in pani para the field survey indicated 73 cows in the village due to lack of poultry farms in the village and insufficient number of poultry the analysis is focused on cow dung the local bangladeshi cow produces around 10 kg of dung per day khan et al 2014 snv 2011 fao 1996 as the cattle are not raised in a totally confined environment and grazed outside part of the day manure has to be collected from the field and thus not all manure is likely to be collected we assumed that around 80 of the cattle dung will be available for biogas production putting some reasonable price on the dung collection may result in increased amount of dung collected table 3 presents the amount of cow dung available for producing biogas the biogas generation was estimated according to equation 1 as suggested by biswas and lucas biswas and lucas 1997 the total solid content of cow dung may vary between 15 and 19 salam et al 2015 in this case total solid ts content was assumed to be 17 and the gas generation rate 0 3 m3 kg of dry solid khan et al 2014 biogas m3 raw material kg total solid ts content gas generation rate per unit of solid m3 kg eq 1 the available cattle dung is only sufficient to produce 10 900 m3 of biogas per year that is only enough to meet 20 of the total amount of biogas needed to meet the cooking fuel and electricity demand of the village thus cow dung alone does not add up to the input needed for a biogas based poly generation system that can provide energy and clean water to the village we therefore looked for other resources such as agricultural waste for possible co digestion jute and rice are the most cultivated crops followed by vegetables and wheat respectively among the agricultural residues available in the village residues from rice jute wheat and vegetables can be used as feedstock for biogas during the survey data were collected on annual production of each crop by the households the estimation of agriculture residue is based on the residue to final economic product ratio rpr the residue to final product ratio is different for different crops for example in the case of wheat rpr is 1 6 for rice it is 1 8 and for jute 1 6 straw and husk are rice residues straw is a low density residue and is the main residue rice husk is produced in the rice milling process and accounts for 20 of paddy ravindranath et al 2005 from these rpr values the amount of agriculture residues generated is estimated however not all these agriculture residues are available for biogas production as cattle is often fed with cereal residues mainly rice straw also known as fodder in the case of rice residues only 20 is available for energy production as the rest is used as fodder in the case of vegetables only 10 of the total amount produced is considered as residue for biogas jute fiber mainly contains cellulose 50 63 hemi cellulose 20 24 and lignin 12 15 cellulosic residues present in the jute fiber can be converted into biogas in the co digestion process banik 2004 the total solid ts content in the agriculture residue is an important parameter in determining the biogas generation the total solid ts content in straw is around 64 90 in jute 95 in carrot 13 16 potato peel 87 cabbage leaf 10 broccoli and leaves of cauliflower 16 and spinach stem 6 5 lehtomaki et al 2007 usda 2008 we have estimated biogas production with the assumption that 1 kg of dry solid residue of i rice straw produces 0 55 m3 of biogas ii wheat straw produces 0 2 m3 of biogas and iii vegetable residues 0 4 m3 of biogas ravindranath et al 2005 polprasert et al 1986 rajendran et al 2012 however jute residue alone is not suitable for the biogas generation as it does not contain methanogenic bacteria therefore addition of cattle dung i e co digestion is necessary to generate biogas from jute table 4 shows the amount of crop residues presently available in pani para and the quantity of biogas that could be generated from these residues for meeting the annual demand of energy for cooking and electricity and drinking water in pani para a production of 53 800 m3 of biogas per year is required the analysis has shown that cow dung in mono digestion can only generate some 20 of this amount co digestion process could be advantageous as it reduces toxic chemicals provides a better balance between carbon and nutrients and creates synergistic effects resulting in higher biogas yield in comparison to mono digestion process gelegenisa et al 2007 song and zhang 2015 riggio et al 2015 co digestion of agriculture residues and cattle dung will contribute to enhance the production of biogas different substrates and substrate mixtures have different carbon to nitrogen c n ratio and this can have a significant impact on the biogas production kayhanian 1999 wang et al 2012 panyadee et al 2013 while high carbon content helps enhance the methane ch4 production low level of nitrogen restricts microbial activity zhu 2010 maintaining the appropriate c n ratio in co digestion is therefore important for optimizing biogas production the best c n ratio for anaerobic digestion varies from 20 1 30 1 the cow dung has a c n ratio of approximately 9 1 addition of feedstock with higher carbon content such as agriculture residues will increase the c n ratio and thereby the biogas production apart from this cattle manure biodegrade very slowly in comparison to other organic matter the addition of agricultural waste in the co digestion increases the biodegradability and volatile solid content in the digester helping enhance the production of biogas crop residues when co digested with manure and urine substrates create homogenous or stable conditions within the digesters this enables keeping dry solids content within the digester below 10 facilitating reactor mixing murphy et al 2011 studies have shown that the co digestion of cattle dung with wheat straw have maximum biogas production at a 1 3 ratio of wheat straw to cattle dung the corresponding yield of biogas was 0 6 m3 kg of total solid of mix substrate song and zhang 2015 some other studies have shown that the optimal ratio of rice straw to cattle dung is 1 1 iyagba1 et al 2009 li et al 2015 the corresponding biogas yield is 0 64 m3 kg of total solid of the mix substrate li et al 2015 the optimum mix ratio for the co digestion of cattle dung with vegetable waste is also 1 1 and the biogas yield is 0 35 m3 kg of the mix substrate prakash and singh 2013 optimum mix ratio for the co digestion of jute waste with cattle dung is 1 2 and the biogas yield is 0 051 kg of mix substrate salam et al 2015 the proposed poly generation system relies on the substrates manure and crop residues that are scattered throughout the community after crops are harvested over the year thus collecting the substrate at one place and ensuring the supply of the substrate throughout the year is a challenging task that needs special attention rice crops are harvested two times a year in bangladesh aman dhan the major type of rice crops around 65 of the rice yield is harvested from mid november to mid january whereas boro dhan is harvested from mid april to mid june wheat is harvested in april whereas jute is harvested from mid june to mid august vegetables are available throughout the year with 50 of production in winter season november to february the feedstock supply chain can be managed across the year according to these varying harvesting times but additional infrastructure may be needed to collect and store some of the feedstock co digestion of rice straw and cow dung will be the major contributor to biogas production in jan feb may jun and nov dec whereas the co digestion of wheat and cow dung will occur in mar apr and co digestion of jute waste caddies and cow dung will occur in jul oct an ant colony optimization aco algorithm could be used for estimating the optimum condition for generation of biogas through co digestion with the available resources in real time verdaguer et al 2016 this could support further feedstock planning and definition of storage capacity but this is beyond the scope of this paper table 5 presents the estimation of potential biogas production with above optimum mix ratios for different agriculture residues and the cattle dung with the currently available resources in pani para approximately 48 250 m3 biogas can be produced per year in co digestion mode 5 3 conditions for providing energy and water services in pani para initially we explored the possibility of providing all the households in pani para with clean cooking fuel electricity and clean drinking water apparently there is a deficit of 5550 m3 of biogas per year to fulfill the multiple immediate needs identified in the village we have then analyzed what could be offered considering the supply side demand and priorities of the local we have found that with 48 250 m3 of biogas per year electricity and clean drinking water can be provided to all households in pani para and cooking gas can be provided to around 38 households out of 52 households this proposition is logical from the analysis of willingness to pay willingness to pay for electricity is higher than for cooking fuel and the low income households have limited economic means this option is therefore reasonable considering both supply and demand side constraints under such circumstances the remaining households with very low income could be provided with improved cooking stoves so that they can benefit from reduced fuel demand and improved indoor environment in this way the entire community will benefit in terms of access to electricity availability of safe drinking water and improved conditions for cooking this will be the main motivation factor for mobilizing the whole community around the implementation of this option a sensitivity analysis was carried out evaluating increments in agriculture residue and dung collection the amount of agriculture residue could be increased in case more land is cultivated in the village and residues are collected from the nearby vicinity the amount of dung can be increased by improving dung collection somewhat or increasing the number of cattle in the village the efficiency in the collection of cow dung can be improved to a certain extent by putting appropriate price on the cow dung besides the number of cattle can be increased in the village by developing a poly generation scheme in close coordination with micro financing institutions that provide government s interest free loans for buying livestock fao 1996 abores 2011 the analysis on variation in the biogas production with increment in the feedstock agriculture residue and cattle dung from 5 to 25 is presented in fig 9 the analysis shows that the biogas production increases more sharply with the increase in agriculture residues than with increment in the cattle dung the sensitivity analysis indicates that the demand for electricity cooking gas and water from all household could be met if the amount of agriculture residues is increased by 15 presence of high lignin in the substrate like jute can reduce the biogas yield in co digestion the low degradability of lignin can be overcome by reducing the particle size of the substrate chopping the feedstock material to appropriate sizes sieving mixing the feedstock homogeneously are important steps for increasing biogas yields mshandete et al 2006 reported 20 increment in biogas production when the chopping size of substrate decreased from 100 m to 2 mm this paper provided a theoretical potential analysis and is static in nature dynamic performance test on site is the next step for taking this technology development ahead a well defined business model needs to be explored addressing the challenges associated with the collection and storage of the feedstock for assuring regular flow of inputs to meet demand throughout the year such business model should include identification of the key activities resources partners and customer segments to be served value proposition for the business etc 6 conclusion this study assessed the potential of an integrated poly generation system to produce multiple services utilizing animal dung and agriculture waste in a rural village of bangladesh the study analyzed the present demand for energy for cooking and lighting and the availability of inputs to feed biogas production a survey was used to understand the perception and preferences for fuels among the households in the village presently most households have access to fuels for cooking and water at no cost but pay for lighting perhaps also therefore the villagers are willing to pay some more if they can have electricity while willingness to pay for cooking gas is relatively lower across all three income groups observed nevertheless the majority of households indicated that they are willing to shift to cleaner fuels and clean drinking water considering the raw materials available and the present economic situation of the village a reasonable option to improve the provision of energy and water services is to prioritize the provision of electricity and clean water to all households while cooking gas can be provided to two thirds of the households the remaining households may still experience improved cooking conditions and indoor environment if they are served with improved cooking stoves however if welfare improvements are achieved in the village leading to higher yields and cow ownership the total amount of biogas needed to provide the three services to the whole village can be obtained the sensitivity analysis shows that if the amount of agriculture residues is increased by 15 cooking gas can be provided to all households strong community participation and a viable business model to channel the feedstock available in the village to biogas production and establish the provision and commercialization of the poly generation scheme will still be necessary to successfully implement and demonstrate the solution proposed this is likely to be a challenge however it is important to explore opportunities for going beyond individual systems for the provision of critical services in the developing countries which can only be purchased by a few the technology proposed here offers the opportunity not only to upgrade energy services for the community but also to provide drinking water a major preoccupation in bangladesh where arsenic contamination is widely spread understanding local realities challenges and available technological options is crucial when deploying new systems solution at local level the shift towards resource circularity is a key element of the overall sustainability transition for various reasons viz improving resource efficiency and creating synergy among agriculture energy and water the results of this study indicate that such integrated solutions are worth further exploration acknowledgment this paper was written in the scope of the research project project no swe 2011 135 at kth and funded by the swedish international development cooperation agency we would like to thank grameen shakti in bangladesh and scarab development ab in sweden for their partnership in the project we would also like to thank nasrin akter for support during field study 
12359,the ultimate goal of this paper is to explore ways to upgrade energy and water services in rural areas of bangladesh while improving resource recovery the study analyzes the potential of a poly generation system using locally available biomass resources cow dung and agriculture residue for providing cooking energy electricity and drinking water to a rural community a questionnaire survey was conducted in pani para village with 52 households to investigate demand patterns and estimate the resource potential and amount of biogas needed in the poly generation system a poly generation system with 150 m3 biogas digester and a 10 kwe generator is required to meet cooking energy electricity and water demand in the village co digestion of available resources including cow dung and agriculture residues can provide 48 250 m3 biogas year which is sufficient to supply electricity and clean drinking water to all households in the village in addition around two thirds of the households can use biogas for cooking the sensitivity analysis shows that if the amount of agriculture residues is increased by 15 also cooking gas can be provided to all households the results indicate that such integrated solutions are worth further exploration graphical abstract fx1 keywords poly generation biogas cooking fuel electricity water 1 introduction bangladesh is one of the poorest and most densely populated countries in the world eighty percent of the population in the country lives in rural areas and approximately half has access to electricity asaduzzaman et al 2010 kerosene lamps hurricane and kupi are the most used appliances for lighting national institute of population research and training niport 2013 currently about 90 of the rural dwellings use traditional stoves and low grade solid fuels for cooking national institute of population research and training niport 2013 mainali et al 2014 biomass resources used for energy purpose include agricultural waste and residues cow dung and fuel wood jashimuddin et al 2006 inefficient combustion in traditional cooking stoves results in huge energy losses indoor air pollution and widespread respiratory diseases particularly among women and children yearly about 4 3 million premature deaths in the world of which 46 000 in bangladesh are associated with household air pollution who 2009a another alarming issue in the country is arsenic contamination of drinking water nearly 92 of the rural areas are affected by arsenic contaminated water biswas 2011 the long term use of contaminated water leads to different types of skin diseases cancer children s mental health and cardiovascular diseases loutatidou et al 2017 annaduzzamana et al 2018 thus energy water and health problems are intertwined in rural bangladesh solar pv technologies expansion of grid lines have been in practice for expansion of rural energy access while various water treatment technologies viz filtration membrane separation and ion exchange are used for cleaning the water in bangladesh however such efforts focus on one dimension of rural problems at a time missing the potential benefits of synergies and integration developmental challenges are complex and need to be addressed in a holistic manner in this context there are reasons to explore synergies in the implementation of sustainable development goals sdgs viz energy access sdg 7 good health and wellbeing sdg 3 and clean drinking water sdg 6 the ultimate goal of this paper is to explore ways to upgrade energy and water services in rural areas of bangladesh while improving resource recovery more specifically we evaluate the potential use of an integrated poly generation system in a village of bangladesh for providing clean energy and water the idea is to explore synergies and opportunities offered by innovative solutions for managing local resources to promote sustainable development a techno economic analysis of the poly generation system was carried out in a previous study khan et al 2014 in this paper we explore the possibility of implementing such a system in a typical village of bangladesh the insights are expected to inform on local conditions and the extent to which the technology can be disseminated to address multiple objectives in rural areas of the country following this introduction section 2 describes the methodology used in the study also presenting the biogas poly generation system and the village pani para that was chosen for the case study section 3 presents the estimation of energy demand in pani para section 4 discusses the socio economic attributes affecting clean energy and water service choices in the village total biogas potential available and amount needed to supply the village with energy and water is estimated in section 5 final conclusions are presented in section 6 2 methodology and data source the methodology used for this research comprises literature review and field survey the field work provided opportunity for close contact with the community and direct observation of characteristics of the local rural life the technical solution uses locally available biomass resources e g animal dung and agricultural waste as input therefore the site visit and survey were important for assessing the local availability of biomass resources as well as the demand for energy and drinking water in addition the survey served to analyze energy use patterns in relation to income and other characteristics of the 52 households in the village the perception and preferences of different socio economic groups could be observed and linked to the potential adoption of the poly generation technology for the purpose of our analysis we selected a typical poor village in bangladesh the pani para village is located in the faridpur district and was selected in consultation with a local partner organization the grameen shakti 1 1 grameen shakti is a well established ngo organization focusing on development work in bangladesh http www gshakti org the founder muhammad yunus is a nobel prize laureate the organization is well known to the rural population throughout the country not least due to the dissemination of energy technologies such as biogas the criteria adopted for site selection were i village without access to electricity or clean cooking fuels and ii located in the arsenic affected zone easy access to the site was also taken into consideration while choosing the village as if proven attractive the study could lead to a demo project to showcase the solution a semi structured questionnaire was used to carry out a survey in pani para village the questionnaire was designed in consultation with local experts from grameen shakti to gather socio economic data determine the energy demand and use patterns among different income groups and identify potential biomass sources for biogas production in the village household energy was estimated based on the collected information and used to verify the viability of the poly generation system proposed rapid rural appraisal rra technique was used to extract information regarding the socio economic conditions and fuel preferences rra is an effective technique to get information about social economic and environmental conditions of a rural location in close collaboration with community members the idea was to involve the community in all aspects of the data collection takasaki and braham 2000 freudenberge 2011 the principle of triangulation and search for convergence in the data collected from various sources was applied for crosschecking data quality data were also collected on the agriculture waste and animal dung available in each household and then used to estimate the biogas potential we wanted to identify the types of biomass available in the village that can potentially be used for biogas production in addition we wanted to calculate if the available resources are sufficient to meet the village s demand for cooking energy electricity and arsenic free drinking water when using a poly generation technology the researchers spent 3 weeks in the field and collected data with the support of local staff from grameen shakti it was important to incorporate women s perception in the survey as they are typically responsible for collecting firewood drinking water and cooking however women in bangladesh are often reluctant to speak to outsiders to overcome that the team had a female bengali native language speaker in the field work as a result the ratio of male to female respondents achieved was almost equal 51 male and 49 female rapport building is important when collecting reliable information from the respondent chambers 1994 luo and liu 2014 the facilitation role of the personnel from grameen shakti s local office throughout the survey contributed to the positive attitude and openness of the local population 2 1 proposed poly generation system for provision of clean energy and water the poly generation system considered in this study comprises a biogas digester unit an electricity generator unit and a membrane distillation md unit for water purification as implied in the term poly generation includes the generation of multiple outputs this system uses low value products such as agricultural waste and animal dung to produce multiple high value outputs viz electricity clean water and cooking gas if implemented in rural areas within favorable institutional and market conditions this technical solution can bring significant improvements to life quality as shown in the techno economic analysis previously carried out for the system khan et al 2014 fig 1 illustrates the flows and functionalities of the poly generation system cattle dung and agriculture residues viz rice straw wheat straw vegetable waste available in the village can be used in an anaerobic digester to generate biogas the plug flow digester can efficiently handle large volumes of substrate and operate under mesophilic conditions temperatures above 35 c the main advantages of the plug flow digester are i simple construction ii lower cost compared to other digesters and iii possibility of using different mixes of substrate with high percentage of solid content jewell and dell orto 1981 as proposed here part of the produced biogas will be distributed for cooking purposes and the other part will be used in a biogas generator for electricity production a thorough technical description can be found in khan et al 2014 in principle biogas is suitable for combustion in any type of engine including gas engines otto engine diesel engines gas turbines and stirling engines khan et al 2014 however biogas based internal combustion engines are the most commonly used for small scale electricity generation because of the low upfront cost and relatively easy operation and maintenance in comparison to other types of engines dimpl 2010 the electricity generated can be used for electrifying rural households in the combustion process the average efficiency of the engine is only about 30 thus around 70 of the energy is lost in the form of flue gas a part of the low grade heat in the flue gas can be extracted using a heat exchanger and utilized in a membrane distillation unit to purify arsenic contaminated water the arsenic contaminated water gets heated in the heat exchanger and passes through the membrane distillation unit the membrane distillation md is a thermally driven separation process and only vapor phase volatile compounds pass through a porous hydrophobic membrane being condensed on the cooling side the md unit achieves separation through the vapor pressure differences that exists between the porous hydrophobic membrane surfaces to purify the water at the end of this process arsenic and bacteria free clean water is obtained the amount of arsenic found in the water purified using this process is 0 4 μg l meaning that it is safe for drinking khan et al 2014 kullab and martin 2011 the permissible maximum amount of arsenic in drinking water as recommended by world health organization is 10 μg l khan et al 2014 chakraborti et al 2010 the process operates at lower temperature below normal water boiling temperature and the hydrostatic pressure in the md unit is lower in comparison to conventional pressure driven membrane processes like reverse osmosis ro alkhudhiri et al 2012 a small amount of heat is extracted from the cooling side and used to pre heat the digester and maintain the mesophilic condition the slurry obtained in this process can be used in fishponds to produce plankton and feed fish or as fertilizer in agriculture farms herrero et al 2015 the temperature inside the plug flow digester can be maintained at about 35 c by extracting the waste heat from the cooling side of the md unit 2 2 the pani para village in bangladesh pani para village is situated at a distance of 7 km from alfadanga upazilla sub district in faridpur district of bangladesh see fig 2 alfadanga is the only main town close to the village there is a small single lane brick road connecting the village to the town where cycles vans and auto rickshaws can use to reach the village houses in the village are clustered in small groups of 5 10 houses there are 52 households with a total of 261 inhabitants living in pani para all 52 households were surveyed for the purpose of this analysis the village pani para is not electrified yet but alfadanga sub district has access to electricity with a load shedding of 2 4 h every day general information about the village is summarized in table 1 the literacy rate of the villagers is 48 which is below the national average literacy rate of 58 bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs report on the bangladesh literacy survey 2010 most of the households in the village are poor but there are nevertheless significant differences among their income levels the average monthly expenditure is a proxy to disposable household income pandey and chaubal 2011 information on the average monthly household expenditures was collected through the survey the whole sample was then divided into three disposable income groups indicated as low medium and high income the low income group comprised 17 households with an average income of usd 57 month the medium income group comprised another 17 households with an average income of usd 107 month and the high income group consisted of 18 households with an average income of usd 342 month 1 usd 84 bdt 3 estimation of energy demand in pani para this section presents the energy mix and the estimated energy demand across different income groups in pani para village since most people do not keep any formal record of their fuel consumption the amount of biomass fuel used by the households had to be calculated based on understanding of local circumstances and information gathered during the survey it was relatively easy for the villagers to provide information on their agriculture production rather than on the amount of residue generated we estimated different types of agriculture residue consumption based on i the total agriculture production of each household in the village ii residue to final economic product ratio rpr ratio of non edible plant parts left after harvest to the final edible product and iii the average portion of the specific residue used for energy purposes ravindranath et al 2005 most people use local resources available at their own premises as agriculture residue or cattle dung and only a few buy fuel wood or cow dung the dung yield varies according to body weight of the cow and feed type the average weight of a bangladeshi cow is 150 kg which yields around 10 kg of dung per day khan et al 2014 snv 2011 fao 1996 we used the number of cattle in each household and the average yield per cow to estimate the amount of cattle dung available in each household data on the consumption of kerosene for lighting was easier to obtain as all households buy kerosene from the local market all households 100 rely on biomass for cooking irrespective of their income class a previous study carried out at noakhali in bangladesh also revealed that rural households relied solely on biomass for cooking miah et al 2011 different mixes of biomass sources are used for cooking depending upon availability agriculture residue along with leaves and branches cover about 50 of the cooking fuel needs followed by cattle dung 42 and firewood 8 respectively see fig 3 pani para is not electrified and the village is located far from the grid kerosene is the main energy source for lighting 92 but solar pv lights and dry cell batteries are also used by some households 8 solar pv systems are installed in the village with support from grameen shakti and micro finance schemes the villagers make 15 25 down payment and pay the rest on installments during a period varying between 12 and 36 months service charges are up to 12 islam et al 2014 solar panels of different capacities 20 85 w have been installed in the village and vary according to the household requirements and affordability also dry cell batteries are used in torch lights during the evening and night but the use is very limited household energy was estimated based on information collected during the survey the specific energy content considered for each fuel type followed parameters suggested by world bank world bank 2010 primarily 90 of the households use traditional biomass agriculture residue fuel woods and cattle dungs in mud stoves 6 use improved cook stoves and the other 4 of the households use biogas stoves with cattle dung as feedstock for cooking household income is one of the social attributes that influences the energy usage pattern fig 4 shows the overall energy consumption in the village across different income levels not surprisingly the high income household has much higher per capita energy consumption when compared to the low income groups previous research on household energy consumption has also indicated that the rural energy demand increases with rising income level ekholm et al 2010 mainali et al 2012 srivastava et al 2012 the estimated annual average energy consumption per capita is around 8 gj in pani para this value is quite close to the energy consumption 7 gj capita observed in a similar rural village in kalaroa sub district in bangladesh hassan et al 2012 notably the variation in the energy consumption is mainly in the cooking fuel per capita energy demand for lighting is almost the same in all the three income groups apparently the villagers use kerosene lamps to meet minimum lighting requirements irrespective of income 4 social and economic attributes affecting clean energy and water choices in pani para 4 1 willingness to adopt clean energy fuels in this section we analyze the households willingness to adopt clean fuels and the share of disposable income they are willing to spend on energy for lighting and cooking exposure to smoke and particulates due to the inefficient burning of solid fuels and black carbon emissions from kerosene lamps are the cause of indoor air pollution health problems and environmental degradation bruce et al 2000 desai et al 2004 however moving from traditional fuels to modern fuels is challenging extreme poverty and lack of competitive markets for modern fuels have forced rural people to heavily rely on traditional low grade solid fuels which are locally available almost at no cost the attributes that determine the choices of fuel can be broadly categorized into i socio economic attributes such as household income education age and gender and ii product specific attributes such as efficiency of cooking technologies and inconvenience associated with the fuels mainali et al 2012 takama et al 2012 the respondents were asked if they are willing to change to new fuels and what would motivate change of current cooking practices about 92 of the respondents indicated that they are willing to change cooking fuel fig 5 shows the main reason for household s willingness to change the current cooking fuel fifty four percent of households pointed out the inconvenience caused by the smoke as main reason for willing to change 24 of the households indicate the huge amount of time spent in collecting biomass as the main reason another 20 of the households want to change primarily for safety reasons and a small portion 2 of the households mention the cost of fuel as a primary reason and believe that improved cooking practices may help to save money when asked about their willingness to pay for the clean fuels around 80 households indicated that they would pay for clean cooking gas around 90 of the households are willing to pay for electricity lighting around 8 were already using solar pv and thus are used to pay for electricity most of the households that indicated no willingness to pay were living under extreme poverty notably however many low income households are willing to pay for upgrading cooking fuels and lighting fig 6 indicates how much of the disposable income households are willing to spend to acquire clean energy both for cooking and lighting the amount increases in line with increasing income levels and thus households with higher monthly income are willing to spend more than the households with lower income as can be read in the left vertical axis in fig 6 however the share of disposable income that the households are willing to spend on clean energy is significantly higher among the poor households than the rich ones that is 7 5 in the low income group in contrast with 5 2 in the high income group right vertical axis in fig 6 in addition it has also been observed that the willingness to pay is higher for lighting than for cooking in all income groups today most groups are able to obtain cooking fuel for free while kerosene has to be bought for lighting also the few that have access to electricity have to pay to install the equipment this may explain the higher preparedness among households for the fact that lighting particularly electricity will come at a cost although the population seems aware of problems related to the cooking fuels presently being used and the benefits of clean fuels their willingness to pay for the latter may still be constrained by the threshold implied in going from a free fuel to one that they have to pay for 4 2 water situation and willingness to pay for clean water the survey has shown that the drinking water demand in the village is around 2 2 5 l per person per day depending on the season the source of water for domestic services are tube well pond river etc villagers mainly collect drinking water from their private and community tube well for meeting the daily demand of cooking and drinking water during the survey it was also reported that the water in the vicinity is contaminated with high amount of iron and arsenic the women and girls have to spend 30 60 min each day fetching water from the community tube wells the existing practice is to collect water free of charge from these tube wells still most of people around 95 interviewed were willing to pay for the clean water service however there was no clear answer on how much they are willing to pay for the clean water services another recently conducted study in one a village in rural bangladesh has shown that villagers are willing to pay up to 3 of their disposable income for clean water islam et al 2018 4 3 health risks associated with cooking fuels and drinking water in bangladesh between 45 and 63 thousand premature deaths are associated with arsenic in drinking water every year around 43 000 death are associated with household indoor air pollution due to cooking fuels larsen 2016 who 2009b in this study we also explored the health impact associated with the cooking fuels and drinking water in the village common air borne diseases attributed to use of cooking fuels common among the villagers are asthma chronic headache eye irritation and respiratory infection and burn problems from our survey it has been found that 85 households are affected by these diseases the women and children are at high risk as they are the most exposed to the smoke in the kitchen similarly diarrhea black and weak teeth numbness and skin abrasions are common diseases in the village which can be attributed to contaminated water around 70 of the households have at least a member affected by one of the above listed water borne diseases fig 7 shows the percentage of households suffering from various diseases attributed to cooking fuels and the drinking water in the next section we explore the potential of providing clean energy and drinking water in a sustainable way focusing on the circularity of the local resources and harnessing the synergies among water energy and agriculture 5 demand and supply of biogas for a poly generation system in pani para 5 1 estimation of biogas to supply clean energy and water the information on available cattle dung and agricultural residue was collected during the field study and used for calculating the biogas potential in the village to estimate the total biogas required in the village to substitute fuels and provide improved energy services we assessed i the present final energy demand for cooking and ii the potential electricity demand in the village iii the amount water that can be purified in the electricity generation process the energy demand for cooking was estimated based on the household energy survey data the total useful energy demand was estimated based on the fuels and efficiency of stoves being used in the community the total amount of biogas needed for generating electricity for the village is estimated considering the potential demand for daily electricity in the village household and some productive end uses using calorific values of biogas and engine efficiency to generate such electricity the details on the estimations are presented in the sections below 5 1 1 biogas for cooking the annual amount of each fuel used in pani para and the useful energy obtained are presented in table 2 the overall fuel efficiency in the village is quite low 13 6 each household demand was taken into account while estimating the total final and useful energy useful cooking energy demand in pani para amounts to 278 gj year thus for biogas stoves with 60 efficiency the biogas needed for cooking in the whole village amounts to 463 gj year approximately 21 000 m3 year it has been observed that households cook two meals per day in average so the estimated average demand for biogas per meal per person is 0 11 m3 the demand varies among the households and across different income groups the demand in low income households is 0 083 m3 per meal per person while in the high income household it is 0 15 m3 per meal per person other studies have revealed that biogas demand for cooking can vary from 0 10 to 0 2 m3 meal person depending upon socio economic attributes such as food culture and income levels talukder 2010 5 1 2 biogas for electricity generation and clean water most people in pani para lack access to electricity and the nearest electrified area is alfadanga town located 7 km from the village during the survey the villagers showed interest and were quite enthusiastic about the possibility of getting electricity however the questions asked were aimed at an estimation of the load demand and no false promise was made about the implementation of a poly generation project the respondents were asked about i how many hours lighting they need daily and ii priorities regarding electrical appliances that they would like to have in case they had access to electricity they were asked to rank among choices including bulbs refrigerators fans television and radio and specify if they had any other preferences as expected almost all households indicated lighting as the first priority followed by fan refrigerator television and radio notably also households that already have solar pv are using electricity mainly for lighting and fan water pumps irrigation pumps huller grinder some retail shops and tailor shop are some of the potential end uses identified in the pani para village which can help to improve the local rural economy end uses similar to the ones identified for pani para village have benefitted various villages in bangladesh and in india purohit and kandpal 2007 bose et al 2013 based upon results from the survey a daily load demand has been estimated for pani para as shown in fig 8 each household has different needs for electricity depending upon their family size income level and preference in terms of appliances for the purpose of designing the daily load demand profile a three to five efficient lamps for each household with an average demand of 75 w b one ceiling fan 60 w operating for 12 h in 10 of the households c a television 80 w operating for 3 h in 10 of the households d radio 20 w operating for 3 h in 20 of the households and e refrigerators 500 w operating 24 h in 4 households were taken into account the productive business loads have been also estimated viz grinder huller around 6 kw operating for around 8 h per day on average irrigation and water pumps 3 kw for 3 h per day and some tailoring and retail shops about 1 kw for 6 h each day the average electricity demand of a household was estimated at 27 kwh per month productive end use demand in the village at 63 kwh day and energy internally consumed in the poly generation plant for running small pumps and lighting at 24 kwh day thus the average electricity demand of the village is estimated at 150 kwh per day including 10 distribution loss seasonal variation in the load has been taken into account for example considering more hours in the use of fans during the summer the efficiency of the gas generator varies from 26 to 32 depending upon the engine loading conditions part load or full load respectively assuming 30 of average efficiency in the generating system the biogas demand for electricity generation is around 32 800 m3 per year thus the biogas needed to meet cooking and electricity demand in pani para amounts to 53 800 m3 per year the contaminated water is purified in the membrane distillation unit with the utilization of waste heat from flue gas produced during the electricity generation this means that no additional biogas is required for cleaning the water around 0 6 kwh of low grade waste heat is needed to purify 1 l of water in the md unit kullab and martin 2011 in this way around 585 l of safe drinking water will be generated each day using waste heat generated during production of electricity which is sufficient to meet the drinking water demand of 2 2 5 l per day per person in the village this demands a poly generation system with a biogas digester for 150 n m3 and a biogas based generator of 3 phases and 10 kw capacity the typical daily load demand and potential clean water production from the poly generation system is shown in fig 8 5 2 biomass resources and biogas potential in pani para the field survey indicated 73 cows in the village due to lack of poultry farms in the village and insufficient number of poultry the analysis is focused on cow dung the local bangladeshi cow produces around 10 kg of dung per day khan et al 2014 snv 2011 fao 1996 as the cattle are not raised in a totally confined environment and grazed outside part of the day manure has to be collected from the field and thus not all manure is likely to be collected we assumed that around 80 of the cattle dung will be available for biogas production putting some reasonable price on the dung collection may result in increased amount of dung collected table 3 presents the amount of cow dung available for producing biogas the biogas generation was estimated according to equation 1 as suggested by biswas and lucas biswas and lucas 1997 the total solid content of cow dung may vary between 15 and 19 salam et al 2015 in this case total solid ts content was assumed to be 17 and the gas generation rate 0 3 m3 kg of dry solid khan et al 2014 biogas m3 raw material kg total solid ts content gas generation rate per unit of solid m3 kg eq 1 the available cattle dung is only sufficient to produce 10 900 m3 of biogas per year that is only enough to meet 20 of the total amount of biogas needed to meet the cooking fuel and electricity demand of the village thus cow dung alone does not add up to the input needed for a biogas based poly generation system that can provide energy and clean water to the village we therefore looked for other resources such as agricultural waste for possible co digestion jute and rice are the most cultivated crops followed by vegetables and wheat respectively among the agricultural residues available in the village residues from rice jute wheat and vegetables can be used as feedstock for biogas during the survey data were collected on annual production of each crop by the households the estimation of agriculture residue is based on the residue to final economic product ratio rpr the residue to final product ratio is different for different crops for example in the case of wheat rpr is 1 6 for rice it is 1 8 and for jute 1 6 straw and husk are rice residues straw is a low density residue and is the main residue rice husk is produced in the rice milling process and accounts for 20 of paddy ravindranath et al 2005 from these rpr values the amount of agriculture residues generated is estimated however not all these agriculture residues are available for biogas production as cattle is often fed with cereal residues mainly rice straw also known as fodder in the case of rice residues only 20 is available for energy production as the rest is used as fodder in the case of vegetables only 10 of the total amount produced is considered as residue for biogas jute fiber mainly contains cellulose 50 63 hemi cellulose 20 24 and lignin 12 15 cellulosic residues present in the jute fiber can be converted into biogas in the co digestion process banik 2004 the total solid ts content in the agriculture residue is an important parameter in determining the biogas generation the total solid ts content in straw is around 64 90 in jute 95 in carrot 13 16 potato peel 87 cabbage leaf 10 broccoli and leaves of cauliflower 16 and spinach stem 6 5 lehtomaki et al 2007 usda 2008 we have estimated biogas production with the assumption that 1 kg of dry solid residue of i rice straw produces 0 55 m3 of biogas ii wheat straw produces 0 2 m3 of biogas and iii vegetable residues 0 4 m3 of biogas ravindranath et al 2005 polprasert et al 1986 rajendran et al 2012 however jute residue alone is not suitable for the biogas generation as it does not contain methanogenic bacteria therefore addition of cattle dung i e co digestion is necessary to generate biogas from jute table 4 shows the amount of crop residues presently available in pani para and the quantity of biogas that could be generated from these residues for meeting the annual demand of energy for cooking and electricity and drinking water in pani para a production of 53 800 m3 of biogas per year is required the analysis has shown that cow dung in mono digestion can only generate some 20 of this amount co digestion process could be advantageous as it reduces toxic chemicals provides a better balance between carbon and nutrients and creates synergistic effects resulting in higher biogas yield in comparison to mono digestion process gelegenisa et al 2007 song and zhang 2015 riggio et al 2015 co digestion of agriculture residues and cattle dung will contribute to enhance the production of biogas different substrates and substrate mixtures have different carbon to nitrogen c n ratio and this can have a significant impact on the biogas production kayhanian 1999 wang et al 2012 panyadee et al 2013 while high carbon content helps enhance the methane ch4 production low level of nitrogen restricts microbial activity zhu 2010 maintaining the appropriate c n ratio in co digestion is therefore important for optimizing biogas production the best c n ratio for anaerobic digestion varies from 20 1 30 1 the cow dung has a c n ratio of approximately 9 1 addition of feedstock with higher carbon content such as agriculture residues will increase the c n ratio and thereby the biogas production apart from this cattle manure biodegrade very slowly in comparison to other organic matter the addition of agricultural waste in the co digestion increases the biodegradability and volatile solid content in the digester helping enhance the production of biogas crop residues when co digested with manure and urine substrates create homogenous or stable conditions within the digesters this enables keeping dry solids content within the digester below 10 facilitating reactor mixing murphy et al 2011 studies have shown that the co digestion of cattle dung with wheat straw have maximum biogas production at a 1 3 ratio of wheat straw to cattle dung the corresponding yield of biogas was 0 6 m3 kg of total solid of mix substrate song and zhang 2015 some other studies have shown that the optimal ratio of rice straw to cattle dung is 1 1 iyagba1 et al 2009 li et al 2015 the corresponding biogas yield is 0 64 m3 kg of total solid of the mix substrate li et al 2015 the optimum mix ratio for the co digestion of cattle dung with vegetable waste is also 1 1 and the biogas yield is 0 35 m3 kg of the mix substrate prakash and singh 2013 optimum mix ratio for the co digestion of jute waste with cattle dung is 1 2 and the biogas yield is 0 051 kg of mix substrate salam et al 2015 the proposed poly generation system relies on the substrates manure and crop residues that are scattered throughout the community after crops are harvested over the year thus collecting the substrate at one place and ensuring the supply of the substrate throughout the year is a challenging task that needs special attention rice crops are harvested two times a year in bangladesh aman dhan the major type of rice crops around 65 of the rice yield is harvested from mid november to mid january whereas boro dhan is harvested from mid april to mid june wheat is harvested in april whereas jute is harvested from mid june to mid august vegetables are available throughout the year with 50 of production in winter season november to february the feedstock supply chain can be managed across the year according to these varying harvesting times but additional infrastructure may be needed to collect and store some of the feedstock co digestion of rice straw and cow dung will be the major contributor to biogas production in jan feb may jun and nov dec whereas the co digestion of wheat and cow dung will occur in mar apr and co digestion of jute waste caddies and cow dung will occur in jul oct an ant colony optimization aco algorithm could be used for estimating the optimum condition for generation of biogas through co digestion with the available resources in real time verdaguer et al 2016 this could support further feedstock planning and definition of storage capacity but this is beyond the scope of this paper table 5 presents the estimation of potential biogas production with above optimum mix ratios for different agriculture residues and the cattle dung with the currently available resources in pani para approximately 48 250 m3 biogas can be produced per year in co digestion mode 5 3 conditions for providing energy and water services in pani para initially we explored the possibility of providing all the households in pani para with clean cooking fuel electricity and clean drinking water apparently there is a deficit of 5550 m3 of biogas per year to fulfill the multiple immediate needs identified in the village we have then analyzed what could be offered considering the supply side demand and priorities of the local we have found that with 48 250 m3 of biogas per year electricity and clean drinking water can be provided to all households in pani para and cooking gas can be provided to around 38 households out of 52 households this proposition is logical from the analysis of willingness to pay willingness to pay for electricity is higher than for cooking fuel and the low income households have limited economic means this option is therefore reasonable considering both supply and demand side constraints under such circumstances the remaining households with very low income could be provided with improved cooking stoves so that they can benefit from reduced fuel demand and improved indoor environment in this way the entire community will benefit in terms of access to electricity availability of safe drinking water and improved conditions for cooking this will be the main motivation factor for mobilizing the whole community around the implementation of this option a sensitivity analysis was carried out evaluating increments in agriculture residue and dung collection the amount of agriculture residue could be increased in case more land is cultivated in the village and residues are collected from the nearby vicinity the amount of dung can be increased by improving dung collection somewhat or increasing the number of cattle in the village the efficiency in the collection of cow dung can be improved to a certain extent by putting appropriate price on the cow dung besides the number of cattle can be increased in the village by developing a poly generation scheme in close coordination with micro financing institutions that provide government s interest free loans for buying livestock fao 1996 abores 2011 the analysis on variation in the biogas production with increment in the feedstock agriculture residue and cattle dung from 5 to 25 is presented in fig 9 the analysis shows that the biogas production increases more sharply with the increase in agriculture residues than with increment in the cattle dung the sensitivity analysis indicates that the demand for electricity cooking gas and water from all household could be met if the amount of agriculture residues is increased by 15 presence of high lignin in the substrate like jute can reduce the biogas yield in co digestion the low degradability of lignin can be overcome by reducing the particle size of the substrate chopping the feedstock material to appropriate sizes sieving mixing the feedstock homogeneously are important steps for increasing biogas yields mshandete et al 2006 reported 20 increment in biogas production when the chopping size of substrate decreased from 100 m to 2 mm this paper provided a theoretical potential analysis and is static in nature dynamic performance test on site is the next step for taking this technology development ahead a well defined business model needs to be explored addressing the challenges associated with the collection and storage of the feedstock for assuring regular flow of inputs to meet demand throughout the year such business model should include identification of the key activities resources partners and customer segments to be served value proposition for the business etc 6 conclusion this study assessed the potential of an integrated poly generation system to produce multiple services utilizing animal dung and agriculture waste in a rural village of bangladesh the study analyzed the present demand for energy for cooking and lighting and the availability of inputs to feed biogas production a survey was used to understand the perception and preferences for fuels among the households in the village presently most households have access to fuels for cooking and water at no cost but pay for lighting perhaps also therefore the villagers are willing to pay some more if they can have electricity while willingness to pay for cooking gas is relatively lower across all three income groups observed nevertheless the majority of households indicated that they are willing to shift to cleaner fuels and clean drinking water considering the raw materials available and the present economic situation of the village a reasonable option to improve the provision of energy and water services is to prioritize the provision of electricity and clean water to all households while cooking gas can be provided to two thirds of the households the remaining households may still experience improved cooking conditions and indoor environment if they are served with improved cooking stoves however if welfare improvements are achieved in the village leading to higher yields and cow ownership the total amount of biogas needed to provide the three services to the whole village can be obtained the sensitivity analysis shows that if the amount of agriculture residues is increased by 15 cooking gas can be provided to all households strong community participation and a viable business model to channel the feedstock available in the village to biogas production and establish the provision and commercialization of the poly generation scheme will still be necessary to successfully implement and demonstrate the solution proposed this is likely to be a challenge however it is important to explore opportunities for going beyond individual systems for the provision of critical services in the developing countries which can only be purchased by a few the technology proposed here offers the opportunity not only to upgrade energy services for the community but also to provide drinking water a major preoccupation in bangladesh where arsenic contamination is widely spread understanding local realities challenges and available technological options is crucial when deploying new systems solution at local level the shift towards resource circularity is a key element of the overall sustainability transition for various reasons viz improving resource efficiency and creating synergy among agriculture energy and water the results of this study indicate that such integrated solutions are worth further exploration acknowledgment this paper was written in the scope of the research project project no swe 2011 135 at kth and funded by the swedish
