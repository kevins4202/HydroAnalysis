4995,vadose zone has been proven as an essential buffer zone for aquifer recharge however most previous researches associated with vadose zone influence of groundwater recharge concern granular porous media aquifers despite of the massive karst formations on surface of earth the role of karst vadose zone on affecting recharge to the underneath karst aquifer is largely unknown the objective of this study is to conceptualize and understand the influence of a thick karst vadose zone on groundwater recharge in a regional karst formation in this work an integrated field and numerical investigation on such a thick vadose zone above the regional karst aquifer is conducted where the field component of the investigation involves survey and observation of hydraulic heads and spring discharge and the numerical component of the investigation involves coupled unsaturated saturated modeling exercises the numerical simulation works are conducted by building the following three models model 1 a coupled saturated unsaturated model model 2 a coupled saturated unsaturated model without preferential infiltration model 3 a saturated flow model without vadose zone process the influence of the vadose zone on groundwater recharge is analyzed by comparing the results of those three models the comparison results of the spring discharge groundwater level time curves show that in karst area with a thick vadose zone like the study area considering vadose zone will improve the simulation results significantly and the slow diffusive flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge the comparison of the recharge time curves shows that the thick karst vadose zone has a significant buffer effect on pattern and timing of recharge parameters of the vadose zone which controls the infiltration process are analyzed and prioritized our analysis suggests that the infiltration rate has a great influence on groundwater recharge and the specific yield of the deep seated unconfined aquifer affects not only the amount of recharge but also its time lag keywords karst coupled saturated unsaturated model thick vadose zone groundwater recharge parameter analysis 1 introduction karst area covers 7 12 percent of the earth s landmass and karst groundwater provides drinking water for at least 25 percent of the global population ford and williams 2007 compared with other types of aquifers fractured or granular karst aquifers are characterized by their high degrees of heterogeneity and anisotropy which give rise to tremendous spatiotemporal variations of recharge flow path storage and discharge in such systems due to the complexity and often unknown geometry of fractures and conduits in karst aquifers simulation of groundwater flow in karst aquifers becomes very challenging field 1997 halihan and wicks 1998 fleury et al 2007 hartmann et al 2014 to reduce the degree of difficulty many previous models concerning groundwater motion in a karst formation often focus on the saturated flow only and treat the recharge as an external force acting on the top boundary of the aquifer of concern and often time such a recharge term is unknown and has to be calibrated by best fitting the simulated hydraulic heads with observed hydraulic heads at monitoring wells scanlon et al 2003 ben itzhak and gvirtzman 2005 martínez santos and andreu 2010 this treatment ignores the unsaturated flow processes completely which is found to be unacceptable when the unsaturated flow process is very dynamic and complex for instance for a thick and karstified vadose zone contractor and jenson 2000 jocson et al 2002 chang et al 2019 petrič et al 2018 indeed many field evidences have shown that the vadose zone in a karst formation can play an important role in affecting the hydrological behavior of the underneath saturated zone including the recharge williams 1983 mudarra and andreo 2011 stevanović 2015 to understand the recharge process in a karst formation considering the vadose zone a series of methods including geophysical exploration isotope analysis tracer test etc have been employed aquilina et al 2005 jacob et al 2008 pronk et al 2009 arbel et al 2010 poulain et al 2018 some numerical methods have also been used for this endeavor with a general finding that the karst vadose zone has imposed significant impact on groundwater dynamics contractor and jenson 2000 dvory et al 2016 realizing the importance of considering the vadose zone process in regulating aquifer recharge in karst formations great attention has been paid to developing modeling tools for such a task in recent decades contractor and jenson 2000 doummar et al 2012 many coupled saturated unsaturated models considering the uniqueness of the karst formations have been proposed conceptual models or reservoir models are widely applied to simulate the discharge of karst spring as they are easy to implement denić jukić and jukić 2003 fleury et al 2007 2009 geyer et al 2008 the model proposed by jukić and denić jukić 2009 which divides the karst aquifer into soil cover epikarst zone composed of a production store and a routing store and vadose phreatic zone is a typical and relatively complete conceptual model a two reservoir conceptual model with a hysteretic transfer function was proposed for hydrological modeling of karst catchments by tritz et al 2011 chang et al 2017 have identified the dominant hydrological process and appropriate model structure of a karst catchment through a stepwise simplification of a complex conceptual model however spatial variations of flow patterns in the aquifer cannot be considered and model parameters have limited physical meaning in reservoir models in contrast distributed models can overcome those limitations and some coupled saturation unsaturated distributed models have been developed by combining swig2d and unsat1d contractor and jenson 2000 constructed a saturated unsaturated model to simulate hydrology in the northern guam lens aquifer doummar et al 2012 modeled the entire water cycle in the catchment area of gallusquelle spring southwest germany using an integrated hydrological modeling system and revealed the importance of vegetation soils saturated zone and unsaturated zone pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 proposed a parsimonious distributed model for simulating transient water flow in a high relief karst aquifer dvory et al 2018 employed a dual continuum model to simulate variable saturation flow and contaminant transport in a karst vadose zone and the groundwater system among the coupled saturation unsaturated models the method of combining a conceptual model with a distributed model has also been developed such as a reservoir model coupled with a conduit model swmm chen and goldscheider 2014 and a reservoir model coupled with a conduit continuum model cfpv2 chang et al 2019 hartmann et al 2012 and hartmann et al 2013 proposed a model varkarst model which combined the advantages of distributed and lumped modeling approaches to consider the spatial and temporal variability of karst aquifer recharge by distribution functions of karst properties unfortunately none of above mentioned models have taken into consideration of the influence of a thick karst vadose zone on groundwater recharge where the thickness of the vadose zone can be as high as 50 m to 1000 m the objective of the present study is to better conceptualize and understand the infiltration process at karst vadose zone and the influence of a thick karst vadose zone on the recharge of the underneath karst aquifer in this study we will conduct an integrated field and numerical investigation on such a thick vadose zone above a regional karst aquifer where the field component of the investigation involves survey and observation of hydraulic heads and spring discharge and the numerical component of the investigation involves coupled unsaturated saturated modeling exercises a coupled saturated unsaturated model model 1 will be built by one dimensional 1d unsaturated zone flow uzf package and three dimensional 3d groundwater flow modflow nwt package a coupled saturated unsaturated model without considering preferential infiltration model 2 and a saturated model without the vadose zone flow process model 3 are built to serve the purpose of testing several different aspects of the flow dynamics these three models will be applied to a high relief karst system with a thick vadose zone on the south of xianglushan mountain in yunnan province china the influence of such a vadose zone on groundwater recharge will be analyzed by comparing the simulation results of those three models a parameter analysis of the recharge characteristics will be conducted to reveal the relative importance of some key parameters characterizing the vadose zone 2 study area 2 1 site description the study area is in the xianglushan karst system located in xianglushan mountain lijiang northwest yunnan province china fig 1 the limestone as the most widely distributed rock forms a relatively thick karst aquifer underlain by an aquitard composed of sandstone the unconfined karst aquifer has a thick overlying vadose zone with a thickness of 50 m to 1000 m the west and east sides of the xianglushan karst system are the jianchuan basin and the heqing basin respectively and groundwater generally flows from xianglushan mountain to basins and discharges mainly through 13 springs q1 to q13 located at the contact area between xianglushan mountain limestone and the two basins unconsolidated sediments affected by north south trending tectonic activity the xianglushan karst system was divided into 9 sub systems i to ix by groundwater divides and a south facing overthrust nappe structure composed of east west trending thrust faults the study area blue area in fig 1 modeled in this paper is the sub system i sub system ii and a part of the heqing basin since there are sufficient monitoring data about this area to constrain the hydrogeological conditions of the site the study area covers an area of 170 6 km2 and the geographical coordinates are 26 24 26 32 n 100 0 100 12 e the altitude varies from 1990 m above mean sea level amsl the lowest part of heqing basin in the east to 3647 m amsl the summit of xianglushan mountain in the west there are two karst depressions three mean thrust faults f1 f3 and several small normal faults that does not appear to block groundwater flow in the study area fig 2 faults f1 and f3 constitute the no flow boundaries on the north and south of the study area the fault f2 divides sub system i and sub system ii the eastern boundary of the study area is yanggong river a tributary of jinshajiang river since the annual fluctuation range of the river stage is small it is regarded as a specified head boundary the head along the specified head arc is assumed to vary linearly along the river channel more discussion about the river boundary will be provided in section 6 the western boundary of the study area is a groundwater divide acting as a no flow boundary the climate is low latitude plateau monsoon climate with clear separation of dry and wet seasons the karst aquifer is primarily recharged by precipitation according to the meteorological data from national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn the mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are 874 7 mm and 13 5 c respectively fig 3 shows the rainfall pattern from 2014 to 2018 in the region one can clearly see a distinctive wet season from may to october and a dry season from november to the following april in the region furthermore the precipitation in wet season accounts for about 90 of the annual precipitation despite the high elevation there is no perennial snow cover in the study area and the groundwater is not recharged by snowmelt owing to a thick vadose zone evapotranspiration from groundwater can be ignored in this study kennedy et al 2016 groundwater generally flows from west to east and discharges through four springs q1 q4 the hydrochemical type of the groundwater is hco3 ca mg the water temperatures of the four springs range from 12 6 c to 15 1 c and the annual change is very small the spring flux of karst spring q4 accounts for more than 80 of the total groundwater discharge in the study area 2 2 field investigation in order to ascertain the hydrogeological conditions of the study area a series of field tests were conducted and a monitoring system was established borehole hydraulic tests were carried out in 12 wells to acquire hydraulic conductivities in xianglushan mountain and heqing basin including slug tests in 7 wells water injection test in 6 wells and packer permeability test in 2 wells fig 1 it is notable that the groundwater divide may or may not agree with the surface water divide which is closely controlled by surface topography one may see the recent studies of wang et al 2017 and han et al 2019 for detailed discussion of the groundwater divide and its relationship to surface water divide in order to determine the location of the groundwater divide between sub system ii and sub system ix tracer tests were performed by injecting sodium chloride into a sinkhole of dongdian karst depression near the surface water divide and signals were received at q4 and q13 fig 1 this indicates that the location of the groundwater divide is roughly the same as that of the surface water divide another tracer test with 600 kg of sodium chloride injected into a sinkhole in machang depression has received the tracer signal in q4 this shows that there is a karst conduit between machang depression and q4 fig 2 a a monitoring system was established in the study area consisting of one local weather station three groundwater level monitoring stations well zk1 zk3 and four spring flow monitoring stations spring q1 q4 spring q4 and well zk3 were selected as long term observation site the daily data of q4 and zk3 were recorded automatically by model gl 1a weir transducer nanjing genan industrial china and levelogger edge model 3001 solinst canada ltd canada respectively the discharges of q1 q3 and groundwater levels of zk1 zk2 were measured monthly the local weather station was built by hobo u30 nrc weather station onset computer corporation usa in xinfeng village near the study area fig 1 and record the daily precipitation automatically 3 method 3 1 modeling approach 3 1 1 saturated zone modflow nwt is applied for saturated zone modeling and it is a standalone program which is developed on the basis of modflow 2005 with newton formulation niswonger et al 2011 hunt and feinstein 2012 the program numerically solves the 3d groundwater flow governing equation for a porous medium using a finite difference method as follows 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are values of principal hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z axes lt 1 respectively h is the potentiometric head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water negative for source and positive for sink l3t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 the stream package str1 is used to deal with karst conduit flow in the saturated zone and detailed specifications of the stream package will be discussed in section 4 1 the use of str1 is advancement over the equivalent porous media epm approach for simulating groundwater flow in karst aquifers as the epm approach does not account for the specific features of conduit flow while str1 could simulate the conduit flow 3 1 2 vadose zone the karst vadose zone consists of soil layer epikarst and transfer zone fig 4 epikarst refers to a layer of enhanced permeability and porosity at the top of the vadose zone with an enhanced storage capacity and it can distribute flow between diffusive limestone blocks slow flow diffusive infiltration and doline infiltration system fast flow preferential infiltration atkinson 1977 williams 1983 doummar et al 2012 chang et al 2019 the epikarst is best developed in pure limestone where it is typically about 10 m thick williams 2008 compared with the vadose zone whose average thickness is 415 73 m the epikarst is very thin for this reason a homogeneous vadose zone is assumed but the capacity of vadose zone on distributing flow is considered a parameter α is used to account for the preferential infiltration meaning that the infiltration water will be split into α preferential infiltration and 100 α diffusive infiltration contractor and jenson 2000 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 the preferential infiltration is a rapid process thus is added at the upper surface of the saturated zone i e the top of the water table directly and the diffusive infiltration is slow process and it has to cross the vadose zone to reach the water table the unsaturated zone flow uzf package is utilized to simulate slow flow in the vadose zone in uzf package a kinematic wave approximation to richards equation is solved by the method of characteristics to simulate vertical unsaturated flow eq 2 because the approach assumes that unsaturated flow occurs in response to gravity potential gradients only it is more suitable for areas with thick vadose zones niswonger et al 2006 campbell 2010 to characterize the unsaturated zone constitutive relation the brook corey model has been used quite extensively in granular nielsen et al 1986 and fractured hunt and feinstein 2012 unsaturated zones and is adopted here as well eq 3 2 θ t k θ z i 0 3 k θ k s θ θ r θ s θ r ε k s θ θ r s y ε where θ is the volumetric water content z is the elevation in the vertical direction l k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of water content lt 1 i is the evaporation rate per unit depth lt 1l 1 t is time t ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 θr is the residual water content θs is the saturated water content ε is the brooks corey exponent sy is specific yield a point to note is that the use of brooks corey relation here is partially for the purpose of illustration and partially because of its broad application for dealing with unsaturated flow problems before the exact relation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content in the thick vadose zone of this study is unlikely to be known precisely because that relation is only possible to know when conducting hydraulic tests at different depths with different water contents a task so challenging given the thickness of the vadose zone the following eqs 4 and 5 are used respectively to calculate the wave s velocity and water content of a wave generated from infiltration the velocity of the deepest point along a trailing wave which represents drying front is calculated by eq 4 the infiltration rate is converted to water content to apply the characteristic solutions for unsaturated flow a relation between water content and infiltration rate can be determined assuming that the flux is equal to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity using eq 5 niswonger et al 2006 4 v θ ε k s s y θ θ r s y ε 1 5a θ q in k s 1 ε s y θ r 0 q in k s 5b θ θ s k s q in where v θ is the velocity at the deepest point along a trailing wave lt 1 θ is the change in water content between two adjacent locations along a trailing wave θ is the water content of a wave generated from infiltration qin is the infiltration rate specified in the model input lt 1 3 2 performance criteria model performance was measured using four different criteria root mean square error rmse eq 6 was used to measure the deviation between the measured and simulated data volume error errorv eq 7 was used to measure the agreement between the measured and simulated total spring flux or total groundwater table nash sutcliffe coefficient nsc eq 8 was used to measure the agreement of the shape of the hydrography linear regression analysis eq 9 was also used to measure the correlation between measured and simulated data 6 rmse 1 n i 1 n x m i x s i 2 7

data at time i xs i is the simulated data at time i x m is the average measured data x s is the average simulated data a and b are coefficients of linear regression 3 3 calibration procedure and parameter sensitivities 3 3 1 calibration procedure parameters used in this study were grouped into fixed and fitting parameters table 1 fixed parameters are determined based on assumptions or experience and do not need calibration fitting parameters are refined by calibration the model calibration and parameter optimization were carried out by combining a trial and error method with automated model calibration the nonlinear parameter estimation code pest was used for the automated model calibration through an inverse parameter estimation process based on the gauss marquardt levenberg method doherty 2004 engelhardt et al 2014 pest has been widely used in groundwater flow models zyvoloski et al 2003 fang et al 2010 the objective function f used in pest is the weighted sum of squared differences between model generated data and those actually measured in the field eq 10 once interfaced with a model pest s role is to minimize the objective function 10 f f q f h i 1 n q x q m i x q s i 2 ω q 2 i 1 n h x h m i x h s i 2 ω h 2 where n is the number of measured data xm i is the i th measured data xs i is the i th simulated data ω is the weight q and h correspond to spring flow and groundwater level respectively 3 3 2 parameter sensitivities pest could calculate composite sensitivities of each parameter pertaining to all observation and the composite sensitivity of parameter i is defined as 11 s i j t q j ii 1 2 m where m is the number of observations j is the jacobian matrix and q is the cofactor matrix which is a diagonal matrix comprised of the squared weights of observations to investigate the influence of different parameters for different observation groups the relative composite sensitivity needs to be calculated the relative composite sensitivity of a parameter is obtained by multiplying its composite sensitivity by the absolute value of the parameter or their log value for a log transformed parameter doherty 2004 4 model construction and calibration in order to investigate the influence of the thick vadose zone on groundwater recharge the following three models were constructed according to whether the vadose zone was modeled and whether the preferential infiltration was considered model 1 a coupled saturated unsaturated model model 2 a coupled saturated unsaturated model without considering the preferential infiltration model 3 a saturated model without the vadose zone flow process model 2 and model 3 were built on the basis of model 1 ignoring preferential infiltration and vadose zone flow process respectively 4 1 model 1 model 1 consists of 4 layers and each layer has 76 rows and 92 columns and the size of individual cell is 200 m 200 m the mesh around the spring was refined to 50 m 50 m the 3d diagram of the model was shown in fig 2 d by comparing the profile of study area fig 2 b and the profile of model fig 2 c it can be found that the division of rock types in the model is similar to the actual distribution of sedimentary sequence the data of land surface altitude are obtained from a 30 meter horizontal resolution digital elevation model dem aster gdem and the data set is provided by geospatial data cloud site computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn the bottom of the study area is a horizontal plane with an elevation of 1700 m amsl as described previously the northern southern and western boundaries are assigned as no flow boundaries and the eastern boundary is assigned as a specified head boundary the simulation time is 281 days beginning on april 13 2017 and ending on january 18 2018 a total of 281 stress periods were established and the corresponding period is one day the transient simulation deserves some discussion firstly it is based on the unique hydrological characteristics of the site which can be roughly divided into a dry season started from november at present year to april of the following year and a wet season from may to october the hydraulic head and groundwater level spring discharge during the dry season varies mildly with time mostly because of lack of precipitation and groundwater recharge for example the groundwater level of zk3 varies from 2397 6 to 2410 7 m the spring discharge of q1 varies from 0 0019 to 0 0027 m3 s the spring discharge of q4 varies from 1 048 to 1 307 m3 s during the dry season in particular when approaching the end of the dry season the groundwater system essentially approaches a sort of quasi steady state condition with almost no change of hydraulic head and groundwater level spring discharge with time on the other hand the hydraulic head and groundwater level spring discharge vary considerably during the wet season mostly because of the heavy precipitation and strong groundwater recharge during this season this is why we choose to conduct the transient flow simulation mostly for the wet season april to november and the early state of the dry season december to january next year secondly another reason to choose the period of april 13 2017 to january 18 2018 for the transient simulation is because of an intensive data collection campaign over this period with daily collection of spring discharge data and precipitation data in the region as the starting date of the transient simulation is towards the end of the dry season april 13 2017 and the hydrological system is approaching the quasi steady state condition for the dry season then the initial condition chosen for the transient simulation can be set as the result of the quasi steady state of the dry season the quasi steady state model for the dry season is also used to determine the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity as such a model does not need to consider the storage capacity of aquifers which would be required for a transient model the hydraulic conductivities of rock mass here are mainly obtained from field tests as stated in section 2 2 since field tests tend to underestimate the actual hydraulic conductivity in karst aquifer rimmer and salingar 2006 jukić and denić jukić 2009 the parameters obtained through field tests need to be optimized in the model measured discharge of four springs q1 to q4 and groundwater level of three monitoring wells zk1 zk2 zk3 in april are used for calibration of the quasi steady state model for the dry season the simulation results of spring discharge and groundwater level in the quasi steady state model for the dry season are shown in fig 5 and the differences which are less than 10 between the measured and simulated values prove the reliability of the model specific yield sy and specific storage ss are optimized in the transient model due to the fact that the groundwater level is very deep and it is difficult to conduct pumping tests or any other hydraulic tests to acquire the values of sy and ss their values are determined by the optimization process daily measured discharge of q4 and observation of monitoring well zk3 are used for the transient model calibration and evaluation three parameters used in vadose zone percentage of preferential infiltration α brooks corey coefficient ε saturated water content θs are also calibrated in the transient model table 1 as for the simulation of springs q1 q2 and q3 are represented as drains with elevations at 2279 m 2217 m and 2188 m amsl respectively the flow from the aquifer into the drain is cd times the difference between drains elevation and head in the cell containing the drain when the latter is greater than the former harbaugh 2005 cd drain conductance was set high enough 1 105 m2 d to allow unrestricted discharge of water in this study scanlon et al 2003 budge and sharp 2009 the karst conduit between machang karst depression and q4 is represented as a stream using the stream package str1 and the downstream flow of the stream is regarded as q4 discharge chen et al 2013 the str1 package uses the manning s equation to calculate flow in the conduit due to the lack of detailed geometric information about the conduit the conduit was set as a straight stream without tortuosity i e si 1 0 and the width of stream d is 0 1 m equal to the diameter of karst conduit the hydraulic conductivity of streambed kst is equal to the hydraulic conductivity of surrounding rock prudic 1989 the manning s roughness coefficient n is calibrated in the quasi steady state model table 1 as for the thrust fault the horizontal flow barrier hfb package was utilized to simulate the effect of fault f2 on groundwater flow mechal et al 2016 the hydraulic conductance cf is the barrier hydraulic conductivity divided by the width of the barrier hsieh and freckleton 1993 and its value is calibrated in quasi steady state model table 1 the rainfall infiltration coefficients were determine by groundwater balance estimation ranging from 0 63 to 0 91 in karst area and 0 29 to 0 77 in non karst area according to the overlying rock and land use 4 2 model 2 and model 3 two additional models were constructed as comparison model 2 is a coupled saturated unsaturated model without considering the preferential infiltration i e percentage of preferential infiltration is 0 and all the infiltration is through the slow flow model 3 is a saturated model without considering the vadose zone process meaning that the infiltration recharges the aquifer directly except for the different recharge methods the structures of the saturated zone are identical in those three models the sy ss ε and θs values of model 2 and model 3 are calibrated in the transient model using an automatic calibration process and the results are shown in table 1 5 results 5 1 general model performance the simulation results of those three models are shown in figs 6 and 7 as for the results of model 1 it can be seen that good agreement is obtained between measured and simulated data in spring q4 and well zk3 there are 219 consecutive daily spring fluxes of q4 and 270 consecutive daily groundwater levels of well zk3 from april 2017 to january 2018 a high degree of coincidence is found by comparing the measured discharge groundwater level time curves with the simulated discharge groundwater time curves the curve fluctuation trends are consistent and the main peaks overlapped with each other fig 6 according to the results of four criteria the quality of model 1 simulation is satisfactory rmse values are 0 101 m3 s for q4 and 3 037 m for zk3 which respectively account 6 903 of the discharge fluctuations measured at q4 and 10 286 groundwater level fluctuation measured at zk3 errorv values are 1 241 for q4 and 0 041 for zk3 nsc values are 0 907 for q4 and 0 911 for zk3 the linear trend lines of data with slope of 0 832 and 1 029 are slightly deviated from the expected 45 line for a slope of 1 0 the pearson correlation coefficients r are 0 958 and 0 911 for q4 and zk3 respectively which indicates good correlation between measured and simulated spring discharge groundwater level model 3 without considering the vadose zone process get the worst simulation results among the three models fig 6 shows that a significant and systematic mismatch between the measured and simulated discharge time groundwater level time curves the simulated data time curves always peak earlier and have more secondary peaks than the measured ones the data time curves of coupled saturated unsaturated models with and without the preferential infiltration model 1 and model 2 look much better the values of criteria also show that the simulation of model 3 is not very satisfactory compared with model 1 and model 2 fig 7 the vadose zone process reduces the rmse between measured and computed spring discharge from 0 235 m3 s model 3 to 0 101 m3 s model 1 a reduction of 57 02 the reduction of 26 61 for rmse in groundwater level the increase of 80 67 for nsc in spring discharge and the increase of 9 23 for nsc in groundwater level also indicate that considering the vadose zone process makes the simulation result better model 2 even if it only takes into account the diffusive infiltration process is much better in simulation results than model 3 the rmse of spring discharge and groundwater level in model 2 are 54 04 and 24 72 lower than those in model 3 respectively the much better data time curves and tremendous improvement on calibration criteria suggest a significant role for the vadose zone when we compared the simulation results of model 1 and model 2 it is found that both model 1 and model 2 have rather good simulation results considering the preferential infiltration has little improvement on modeling since the data time curves of the two models almost coincide fig 6 and the calibration criteria of model 1 are slightly better than those of model 2 fig 7 the rmse of spring discharge and groundwater head in model 1 are only 6 48 and 2 5 lower than those in model 2 respectively the increase of 1 45 and 0 55 for nsc in spring discharge and groundwater level are not remarkable this phenomenon may be explained by two factors 1 in karst area with a thick vadose zone like the study area slow flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge for long term groundwater simulation this results in the model being able to get pretty good simulation results even without considering preferential replenishment 2 using the parameter α to divide the preferential infiltration and diffusive recharge is a rather simple approximation its defect in the characterization of infiltration division during rainstorm renders it incapable of simulating the secondary peak of hydrograph for the above two reasons the improvement of model 1 to model 2 is limited 5 2 sensitivity analysis a parameter study could help better characterizing parameters in the model and facilitate its further application extension and transfer to other karst aquifer systems chen and goldscheider 2014 relative composite sensitivity of parameters with respect to all observations spring discharge and groundwater level in the transient model was calculated for three models using the pest parameter sensitivity output fig 8 the most influential parameters in model 1 were the three specific yield values sy1 sy2 sy3 in model 2 with only diffusive infiltration the vadose zone parameter ε was the most influential parameter in model 3 which did not consider vadose zone sy had particularly high sensitivity compared with ss in each model sy1 was the most sensitive among the three sy values another sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the optimal parameter set for further investigation of the effects of six vadose zone parameters on simulation result of model 1 this is done by selecting one of the parameters to increase or decrease while keeping other five parameters at their optimized values where parameters ks q and sy were multiplied by different numbers note that the parameters should vary within physically reasonable ranges e g the value of θs cannot be greater than 1 fig 9 shows the response of objective function f to each parameter change the simulation results show an obvious deterioration with the change of q since the value of the highest f is two orders of magnitude higher than what was before changing ks and sy will raise the value of f by an order of magnitude and the deterioration caused by reducing these two parameters is more obvious than that caused by increasing them compared with the above three parameters ε θs and α have less influence on the simulation results since they do not change the order of magnitude of f as shown in fig 9 e the value of f with θs of 0 7 is smaller than that with θs of the optimized value 0 284 however θs 0 7 does not appear to be physically realistic based on the rock types of the formation therefore 0 284 is still the optimized values for θs 5 3 comparison of recharge time curves as the objective of this study is to conceptualize and understand the influence of a thick vadose zone on groundwater recharge in a karst formation the main task is to compare the difference between the recharge time curves generated by those three models in karst area sub system i and sub system ii in the coupled unsaturated saturated flow modeling the diffusive recharge is determined using the following procedures firstly after conducting the saturated unsaturated flow simulations one could obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of hydraulic head from which the spatiotemporal distribution of the pressure head can also be obtained by subtracting the elevation head from the hydraulic head after this the water table position is determined by searching for the zero pressure head secondly after determining the location of the water table uzf package is applied to calculate the downward darcian velocity at the water table which is the recharge rate to groundwater campbell 2010 thirdly if one wants to calculate the volumetric recharge over a certain designated area one simply needs to carry out the integration of the recharge rate over the designated area as stated in section 4 the groundwater recharge of model 1 is composed of the diffusive recharge and the preferential recharge where the diffusive recharge is provided by the output of the saturated unsaturated modeling and the preferential recharge is equal to the specified preferential infiltration the recharge of model 2 is entirely from the diffusive recharge and the recharge of model 3 is equal to the specified infiltration the results are shown in the following figures firstly recharge in response to a single rainfall event 100 mm d is considered the initial condition was computed by the quasi steady state model for the dry season and the model generated response of recharge is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that after the single rainfall event model 3 recharge time curve peaks immediately model 2 recharge time curve does not reach the peak until eight days later and model 1 recharge time curve has two obvious peaks occurred at the first and ninth day respectively it makes sense that recharge time curve of model 3 peaks immediately since the infiltration is added directly to the groundwater surface the peak lag of model 2 recharge time curve is caused by the infiltration process in the diffusive limestone blocks the first peak in model 1 was caused by the fast flow preferential infiltration which account for 10 of the total infiltration and the second peak was caused by the slow flow diffusive infiltration afterwards the simulated transient recharge time curves of model 1 and model 3 are shown in fig 11 comparing with the model 3 recharge time curve the model 1 recharge time curve is continuous and smoother fig 11 a permitting water to recharge the saturated zone constantly even during the dry season it is consistent with the actual recharge pattern that water in the vadose zone recharges the groundwater continuously hunt et al 2008 cao et al 2016 in addition to the recharge pattern the vadose zone has a profound impact on timing of recharge for a more intuitive view of the difference in timing between model 1 recharge and model 3 recharge the recharge calculated by the two models are combined into monthly rates fig 11 b it can be seen visually that there is a considerable difference in recharge time between the two recharge methods i e whether the thick vadose zone is considered or not has an important influence on timing of recharge the heavy rainfall model 3 recharge in july appears as model 1 recharge in august and even partially shows up in september the migration time of infiltration is prolonged in the thick vadose zone which makes the time lag more obvious the influence of karst thick vadose zone on pattern and timing of recharge reflects its strong buffer effect which is caused by propagation time requiring for the signal of precipitation induced infiltration passing through the vadose zone and storage capacity of the vadose zone emblanch et al 2003 carrière et al 2016 azzaz et al 2018 5 4 effects of different parameters on recharge given the fact that the vadose zone plays a considerable role in regulating the aquifer recharge it is important to perform a parameter analysis on parameters used in the vadose zone to prioritize the parameters that play a major role in the infiltration processes the parameter analysis is restricted to the range of 20 to 50 in this study the initial water content is not analyzed in this parameter analysis this is because when steady state is specified for the initial stress period the water content is computed for each active cell which is used automatically as the initial conditions for the following transient stress period niswonger et al 2006 since the sensitivity of parameters can change as their values change the following analysis is strictly quantitative only for the values of model 1 shown in table 1 infiltration rate q has the greatest influence on recharge among all the parameters table 2 fig 12 b when q is increased by 50 the increase of the mean groundwater recharge is lower than 50 table 2 this phenomenon can occur via two mechanisms 1 the storage capacity of the vadose zone will decrease with a rising water level so that part of the infiltration will turn into dunnian overland runoff dunne and black 1970 hunt et al 2008 as q increases the groundwater level rises causing more infiltration routed into dunnian overland runoff 2 as shown in eq 5 not all the infiltration specified in the uzf package input file can enter the vadose zone when the infiltration rate qin specified in the uzf package input exceeds the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity of the vadose zone ks the difference between qin and k s will be converted to hortonian overland flow horton 1933 hunt et al 2008 i e the actual diffusive infiltration rate qin will be smaller than qin when storm events qin ks occurs as q increases so does the number of storm events qin ks leading to an increase in the amount of infiltration converted to hortonian overland flow for this reason the increase of qin is less than 50 leading to the increase of mean recharge also less than 50 in another word when infiltration rate is increased the diffusive infiltration does not increase by the same percentage in model 1 and more rainfall will turn into runoff in this study when the infiltration rate increased by 50 in model 1 the total runoff increased from6 506 106 m3 to1 132 107 m3 increasing by more than 50 decreasing the specified infiltration rate has the opposite effect of increasing the specified infiltration rate the influences of the specific yield sy brooks corey coefficient ε and percentage of preferential infiltration α on recharge are also evident table 2 fig 12 c d and f as can be seen from table 2 and fig 12 d when ε is increased by 50 the range of recharge increases significantly sy is not only used for the purpose of calculating changes in saturated zone storage during fluctuation of the water table it is also used to calculate the timing and the volume of recharge since the wetting front velocity and the amount of water stored in the unsaturated area are also affected by sy when the value of sy is increased by 50 the maximum recharge decreases obviously the minimum recharge does not change much and the range of recharge time curve decreases compared with other parameters changing the value of sy can cause significant change in timing of recharge fig 12 c this is because in the uzf package the velocity of wetting front will decrease when sy is increased eq 4 resulting in a more obvious time lag in diffusive recharge decreasing sy has an opposite effect as that of increasing sy as for the percentage of preferential infiltration α it can be seen that increasing the value of α makes the recharge time curve fluctuating more dramatically and the secondary peaks sharper this is because with the increase of α a part of diffusive infiltration gets converted into preferential infiltration leading to more infiltration reaching the groundwater table directly the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity ks and saturated water content θs have little influence on recharge increasing these two parameters by up to 50 results in less than 1 changes in the mean recharge table 2 figs 12 a and 10 e whether ks and θs are increased or decreased the recharge time curves do not change significantly 6 discussions first of all we want to emphasize that the site of concern in this study represents a unique hydrological system with a thick karst vadose zone above a karst aquifer bounded by various faults and rivers few studies have been conducted on such a system before with a lot of unanswered salient scientific questions from an application perspective the site of concern here is also in the middle of some major hydraulic engineering projects such as cross basin water transfer using deep seated long tunnels though the karst formations thus a better understanding of the karst hydrologic system is essential for the engineering design of such hydraulic engineering projects given the scientific importance and application value of the site unfortunately the site is poorly studied before and the monitoring data are sparse and inconsistent before the initiation of this study therefore this research can only be regarded as a phase 1 research over a long term investigation that will last for decades in the future given the highly complex system of concern here and the limited datasets available to the investigators so far this study undoubtedly has some limitations and cannot answer all the questions nevertheless despite of its limitations this study sheds some important new lights on the hydrological characteristics of the site for instance it shows that slow flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge in karst area with a thick vadose zone although some of the findings of the study may appear self explained the modeling exercises provide further confirmation in a quantitative manner about those findings given the fact that this study is only a phase 1 investigation it is important to elaborate more on the limitations of the study analysis of such limitations not only sets constrains on the applicability of this study but also sheds lights on the need of future investigations and further data gathering effort the following points are certainly notable firstly using the parameter α to divide the preferential infiltration and diffusive infiltration is a rather simple approach and its simulation results are acceptable in the case of long term groundwater simulation however if one wants to conduct a high resolution simulation of a transient flow process with a much short time step such as 1 hr such a simple approach may not be valid and a more complex method is needed to accommodate the preferential infiltration and diffusive infiltration processes which may be closely interrelated even without considering the preferential infiltration model 2 discussed above has obtained some good simulation results based on such results we can conclude that the slow flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge in karst area with a thick vadose zone in the following work we will analyze multiple karst sites and explore the roles of preferential versus diffusive infiltration processes secondly as stated in the introduction there are a host of theoretical approaches that can be utilized to investigate the hydrologic characteristics of a karst system to answer questions of how long is the lag time of groundwater recharge to rainfall and how much flow that the vadose zone could store a lumped model combined with environmental isotopes and hydrochemical signals for hydrologic analysis could be used unfortunately the isotopic and hydrochemical investigations have not been implemented for this site and should be carried out in the future up to present none of those approaches are proven superior than others given the unique thick karst vadose zone of the site this study offers a different perspective of using various modeling exercises two coupled saturated unsaturated flow models and one saturated flow model to gain insights into the system of concern this is not to say that this approach is better than other approaches it is our attempt to combine different approaches to investigate the problem when more datasets are collected in the future as a matter of fact utilization and advancement of multiple approaches is probably the best choice for understanding the highly complex karst system thirdly in this study the river is treated as a boundary of the mountain karst system the rationale of doing so is based on the observation that the absence of specific water boundary conditions such as thrust fault groundwater divide between mountain and basin systems which makes the hydraulic connection of the groundwater in the mountain and basin systems possible further investigations probably through isotope and or large scale tracer studies will be needed to confirm the exact nature of hydraulic connection among different hydrological elements such as rivers faults groundwater in mountain system and groundwater in basin system fourthly this study relies on the spring discharge data and saturated zone hydraulic head data to calibrate the models even with enormous efforts putting forward in various modeling exercises models 1 3 of this study it is still quite challenging to completely decouple the contribution of selected controlling parameters in recharge to resolve this issue additional field work must be carried out in the future for instance various field methods such as tracers cl 3h and 36cl methods water balance and darcy flux measurements methods and lysimeters are commonly employed to estimate recharge in the field gee and hillel 1988 allison et al 1994 scanlon and cook 2002 xu and beekman 2019 in respect to recharge estimation in karst aquifers one may consult the works of leaney and herczeg 1995 jones et al 2000 and allocca et al 2014 in particular jones et al 2000 pointed out that the recharge estimated using groundwater constituents such as oxygen isotopes and dissolved chloride had fewer uncertainties than recharge estimated using direct measurement of hydrologic parameters such field work is necessary to further advance our understanding of the unique karst formation of this study which has a thick vadose zone that is rarely reported in previous investigations 7 conclusions this study uses various modeling exercises including two coupled saturated unsaturated flow models model 1and model 2 and one saturated flow model model 3 to investigate a karst system in yunnan province china which is characterized by a thick karst vadose zone overlying a regional karst aquifer model 1is built by 1d unsaturated zone flow uzf package and 3d groundwater flow modflow nwt package model 2 is built on the basis of model 1 but without considering the preferential infiltration model 3 is built on the basis of model 1 but without the vadose zone process this study focuses on analyzing the influence of thick karst vadose zone on aquifer recharge the primary conclusions are as follows 1 in both model 1 and model 2 the rmse values of spring discharge and groundwater level are more than 50 and 20 lower than those in model 3 when simulate groundwater in karst area with thick vadose zone coupled saturated unsaturated model no matter considering the preferential infiltration or not performs much better than the saturated model without considering the infiltration process in the vadose zone 2 by comparing the results of model 1 and model 2 it is found that even without considering preferential infiltration model 2 can still well simulate the hydrograph in the study area since the rmse of spring discharge and groundwater head in model 1 are only 6 48 and 2 5 lower than those in model 2 respectively it can be inferred that in karst area with thick vadose zone like the study area slow flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge for long term groundwater simulation 3 by comparing the recharge time curves of model 1 and model 3 it is found that the thick karst vadose zone has imposed a significant buffer effect on the overall hydrodynamic response of the unsaturated saturated karst formation the buffer effect is manifested in the obvious time lag of recharge and alternation of recharge pattern in tens of days a single rainfall fig 10 and months long term rainfall fig 11 4 influences of different parameters on recharge are evaluated and prioritized infiltration rate has the greatest impact on recharge followed by the specific yield percentage of preferential infiltration and the brooks corey coefficient the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity and saturated water content have little impact on recharge 5 the study improves our understanding on the influence of a thick karst vadose zone on aquifer recharge but it is only a phase 1 investigation and it should be combined with other approaches such as reservoir modeling and isotopic analysis to better understand the system of concern large scale long term years and decades hydrological monitoring datasets are essential to understand the hydrologic characteristics of the karst systems including the exact nature of hydraulic connection of different elements such has rivers faults mountain groundwater and basin groundwater 6 even with enormous efforts putting forward in various modeling exercises models 1 3 of this study it is still quite challenging to decouple the contribution of selected controlling parameters in recharge to resolve this issue additional field work such as vadose zone tracer tests using oxygen isotopes and dissolved chloride may be carried out in the future credit authorship contribution statement ruitong liu methodology software formal analysis writing original draft jinguo wang

4995,vadose zone has been proven as an essential buffer zone for aquifer recharge however most previous researches associated with vadose zone influence of groundwater recharge concern granular porous media aquifers despite of the massive karst formations on surface of earth the role of karst vadose zone on affecting recharge to the underneath karst aquifer is largely unknown the objective of this study is to conceptualize and understand the influence of a thick karst vadose zone on groundwater recharge in a regional karst formation in this work an integrated field and numerical investigation on such a thick vadose zone above the regional karst aquifer is conducted where the field component of the investigation involves survey and observation of hydraulic heads and spring discharge and the numerical component of the investigation involves coupled unsaturated saturated modeling exercises the numerical simulation works are conducted by building the following three models model 1 a coupled saturated unsaturated model model 2 a coupled saturated unsaturated model without preferential infiltration model 3 a saturated flow model without vadose zone process the influence of the vadose zone on groundwater recharge is analyzed by comparing the results of those three models the comparison results of the spring discharge groundwater level time curves show that in karst area with a thick vadose zone like the study area considering vadose zone will improve the simulation results significantly and the slow diffusive flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge the comparison of the recharge time curves shows that the thick karst vadose zone has a significant buffer effect on pattern and timing of recharge parameters of the vadose zone which controls the infiltration process are analyzed and prioritized our analysis suggests that the infiltration rate has a great influence on groundwater recharge and the specific yield of the deep seated unconfined aquifer affects not only the amount of recharge but also its time lag keywords karst coupled saturated unsaturated model thick vadose zone groundwater recharge parameter analysis 1 introduction karst area covers 7 12 percent of the earth s landmass and karst groundwater provides drinking water for at least 25 percent of the global population ford and williams 2007 compared with other types of aquifers fractured or granular karst aquifers are characterized by their high degrees of heterogeneity and anisotropy which give rise to tremendous spatiotemporal variations of recharge flow path storage and discharge in such systems due to the complexity and often unknown geometry of fractures and conduits in karst aquifers simulation of groundwater flow in karst aquifers becomes very challenging field 1997 halihan and wicks 1998 fleury et al 2007 hartmann et al 2014 to reduce the degree of difficulty many previous models concerning groundwater motion in a karst formation often focus on the saturated flow only and treat the recharge as an external force acting on the top boundary of the aquifer of concern and often time such a recharge term is unknown and has to be calibrated by best fitting the simulated hydraulic heads with observed hydraulic heads at monitoring wells scanlon et al 2003 ben itzhak and gvirtzman 2005 martínez santos and andreu 2010 this treatment ignores the unsaturated flow processes completely which is found to be unacceptable when the unsaturated flow process is very dynamic and complex for instance for a thick and karstified vadose zone contractor and jenson 2000 jocson et al 2002 chang et al 2019 petrič et al 2018 indeed many field evidences have shown that the vadose zone in a karst formation can play an important role in affecting the hydrological behavior of the underneath saturated zone including the recharge williams 1983 mudarra and andreo 2011 stevanović 2015 to understand the recharge process in a karst formation considering the vadose zone a series of methods including geophysical exploration isotope analysis tracer test etc have been employed aquilina et al 2005 jacob et al 2008 pronk et al 2009 arbel et al 2010 poulain et al 2018 some numerical methods have also been used for this endeavor with a general finding that the karst vadose zone has imposed significant impact on groundwater dynamics contractor and jenson 2000 dvory et al 2016 realizing the importance of considering the vadose zone process in regulating aquifer recharge in karst formations great attention has been paid to developing modeling tools for such a task in recent decades contractor and jenson 2000 doummar et al 2012 many coupled saturated unsaturated models considering the uniqueness of the karst formations have been proposed conceptual models or reservoir models are widely applied to simulate the discharge of karst spring as they are easy to implement denić jukić and jukić 2003 fleury et al 2007 2009 geyer et al 2008 the model proposed by jukić and denić jukić 2009 which divides the karst aquifer into soil cover epikarst zone composed of a production store and a routing store and vadose phreatic zone is a typical and relatively complete conceptual model a two reservoir conceptual model with a hysteretic transfer function was proposed for hydrological modeling of karst catchments by tritz et al 2011 chang et al 2017 have identified the dominant hydrological process and appropriate model structure of a karst catchment through a stepwise simplification of a complex conceptual model however spatial variations of flow patterns in the aquifer cannot be considered and model parameters have limited physical meaning in reservoir models in contrast distributed models can overcome those limitations and some coupled saturation unsaturated distributed models have been developed by combining swig2d and unsat1d contractor and jenson 2000 constructed a saturated unsaturated model to simulate hydrology in the northern guam lens aquifer doummar et al 2012 modeled the entire water cycle in the catchment area of gallusquelle spring southwest germany using an integrated hydrological modeling system and revealed the importance of vegetation soils saturated zone and unsaturated zone pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 proposed a parsimonious distributed model for simulating transient water flow in a high relief karst aquifer dvory et al 2018 employed a dual continuum model to simulate variable saturation flow and contaminant transport in a karst vadose zone and the groundwater system among the coupled saturation unsaturated models the method of combining a conceptual model with a distributed model has also been developed such as a reservoir model coupled with a conduit model swmm chen and goldscheider 2014 and a reservoir model coupled with a conduit continuum model cfpv2 chang et al 2019 hartmann et al 2012 and hartmann et al 2013 proposed a model varkarst model which combined the advantages of distributed and lumped modeling approaches to consider the spatial and temporal variability of karst aquifer recharge by distribution functions of karst properties unfortunately none of above mentioned models have taken into consideration of the influence of a thick karst vadose zone on groundwater recharge where the thickness of the vadose zone can be as high as 50 m to 1000 m the objective of the present study is to better conceptualize and understand the infiltration process at karst vadose zone and the influence of a thick karst vadose zone on the recharge of the underneath karst aquifer in this study we will conduct an integrated field and numerical investigation on such a thick vadose zone above a regional karst aquifer where the field component of the investigation involves survey and observation of hydraulic heads and spring discharge and the numerical component of the investigation involves coupled unsaturated saturated modeling exercises a coupled saturated unsaturated model model 1 will be built by one dimensional 1d unsaturated zone flow uzf package and three dimensional 3d groundwater flow modflow nwt package a coupled saturated unsaturated model without considering preferential infiltration model 2 and a saturated model without the vadose zone flow process model 3 are built to serve the purpose of testing several different aspects of the flow dynamics these three models will be applied to a high relief karst system with a thick vadose zone on the south of xianglushan mountain in yunnan province china the influence of such a vadose zone on groundwater recharge will be analyzed by comparing the simulation results of those three models a parameter analysis of the recharge characteristics will be conducted to reveal the relative importance of some key parameters characterizing the vadose zone 2 study area 2 1 site description the study area is in the xianglushan karst system located in xianglushan mountain lijiang northwest yunnan province china fig 1 the limestone as the most widely distributed rock forms a relatively thick karst aquifer underlain by an aquitard composed of sandstone the unconfined karst aquifer has a thick overlying vadose zone with a thickness of 50 m to 1000 m the west and east sides of the xianglushan karst system are the jianchuan basin and the heqing basin respectively and groundwater generally flows from xianglushan mountain to basins and discharges mainly through 13 springs q1 to q13 located at the contact area between xianglushan mountain limestone and the two basins unconsolidated sediments affected by north south trending tectonic activity the xianglushan karst system was divided into 9 sub systems i to ix by groundwater divides and a south facing overthrust nappe structure composed of east west trending thrust faults the study area blue area in fig 1 modeled in this paper is the sub system i sub system ii and a part of the heqing basin since there are sufficient monitoring data about this area to constrain the hydrogeological conditions of the site the study area covers an area of 170 6 km2 and the geographical coordinates are 26 24 26 32 n 100 0 100 12 e the altitude varies from 1990 m above mean sea level amsl the lowest part of heqing basin in the east to 3647 m amsl the summit of xianglushan mountain in the west there are two karst depressions three mean thrust faults f1 f3 and several small normal faults that does not appear to block groundwater flow in the study area fig 2 faults f1 and f3 constitute the no flow boundaries on the north and south of the study area the fault f2 divides sub system i and sub system ii the eastern boundary of the study area is yanggong river a tributary of jinshajiang river since the annual fluctuation range of the river stage is small it is regarded as a specified head boundary the head along the specified head arc is assumed to vary linearly along the river channel more discussion about the river boundary will be provided in section 6 the western boundary of the study area is a groundwater divide acting as a no flow boundary the climate is low latitude plateau monsoon climate with clear separation of dry and wet seasons the karst aquifer is primarily recharged by precipitation according to the meteorological data from national meteorological information center of china http data cma cn the mean annual precipitation and mean annual temperature are 874 7 mm and 13 5 c respectively fig 3 shows the rainfall pattern from 2014 to 2018 in the region one can clearly see a distinctive wet season from may to october and a dry season from november to the following april in the region furthermore the precipitation in wet season accounts for about 90 of the annual precipitation despite the high elevation there is no perennial snow cover in the study area and the groundwater is not recharged by snowmelt owing to a thick vadose zone evapotranspiration from groundwater can be ignored in this study kennedy et al 2016 groundwater generally flows from west to east and discharges through four springs q1 q4 the hydrochemical type of the groundwater is hco3 ca mg the water temperatures of the four springs range from 12 6 c to 15 1 c and the annual change is very small the spring flux of karst spring q4 accounts for more than 80 of the total groundwater discharge in the study area 2 2 field investigation in order to ascertain the hydrogeological conditions of the study area a series of field tests were conducted and a monitoring system was established borehole hydraulic tests were carried out in 12 wells to acquire hydraulic conductivities in xianglushan mountain and heqing basin including slug tests in 7 wells water injection test in 6 wells and packer permeability test in 2 wells fig 1 it is notable that the groundwater divide may or may not agree with the surface water divide which is closely controlled by surface topography one may see the recent studies of wang et al 2017 and han et al 2019 for detailed discussion of the groundwater divide and its relationship to surface water divide in order to determine the location of the groundwater divide between sub system ii and sub system ix tracer tests were performed by injecting sodium chloride into a sinkhole of dongdian karst depression near the surface water divide and signals were received at q4 and q13 fig 1 this indicates that the location of the groundwater divide is roughly the same as that of the surface water divide another tracer test with 600 kg of sodium chloride injected into a sinkhole in machang depression has received the tracer signal in q4 this shows that there is a karst conduit between machang depression and q4 fig 2 a a monitoring system was established in the study area consisting of one local weather station three groundwater level monitoring stations well zk1 zk3 and four spring flow monitoring stations spring q1 q4 spring q4 and well zk3 were selected as long term observation site the daily data of q4 and zk3 were recorded automatically by model gl 1a weir transducer nanjing genan industrial china and levelogger edge model 3001 solinst canada ltd canada respectively the discharges of q1 q3 and groundwater levels of zk1 zk2 were measured monthly the local weather station was built by hobo u30 nrc weather station onset computer corporation usa in xinfeng village near the study area fig 1 and record the daily precipitation automatically 3 method 3 1 modeling approach 3 1 1 saturated zone modflow nwt is applied for saturated zone modeling and it is a standalone program which is developed on the basis of modflow 2005 with newton formulation niswonger et al 2011 hunt and feinstein 2012 the program numerically solves the 3d groundwater flow governing equation for a porous medium using a finite difference method as follows 1 x k xx h x y k yy h y z k zz h z w s s h t where kxx kyy and kzz are values of principal hydraulic conductivity along the x y and z axes lt 1 respectively h is the potentiometric head l w is a volumetric flux per unit volume representing sources and or sinks of water negative for source and positive for sink l3t 1 ss is the specific storage of the porous material l 1 the stream package str1 is used to deal with karst conduit flow in the saturated zone and detailed specifications of the stream package will be discussed in section 4 1 the use of str1 is advancement over the equivalent porous media epm approach for simulating groundwater flow in karst aquifers as the epm approach does not account for the specific features of conduit flow while str1 could simulate the conduit flow 3 1 2 vadose zone the karst vadose zone consists of soil layer epikarst and transfer zone fig 4 epikarst refers to a layer of enhanced permeability and porosity at the top of the vadose zone with an enhanced storage capacity and it can distribute flow between diffusive limestone blocks slow flow diffusive infiltration and doline infiltration system fast flow preferential infiltration atkinson 1977 williams 1983 doummar et al 2012 chang et al 2019 the epikarst is best developed in pure limestone where it is typically about 10 m thick williams 2008 compared with the vadose zone whose average thickness is 415 73 m the epikarst is very thin for this reason a homogeneous vadose zone is assumed but the capacity of vadose zone on distributing flow is considered a parameter α is used to account for the preferential infiltration meaning that the infiltration water will be split into α preferential infiltration and 100 α diffusive infiltration contractor and jenson 2000 pardo igúzquiza et al 2018 the preferential infiltration is a rapid process thus is added at the upper surface of the saturated zone i e the top of the water table directly and the diffusive infiltration is slow process and it has to cross the vadose zone to reach the water table the unsaturated zone flow uzf package is utilized to simulate slow flow in the vadose zone in uzf package a kinematic wave approximation to richards equation is solved by the method of characteristics to simulate vertical unsaturated flow eq 2 because the approach assumes that unsaturated flow occurs in response to gravity potential gradients only it is more suitable for areas with thick vadose zones niswonger et al 2006 campbell 2010 to characterize the unsaturated zone constitutive relation the brook corey model has been used quite extensively in granular nielsen et al 1986 and fractured hunt and feinstein 2012 unsaturated zones and is adopted here as well eq 3 2 θ t k θ z i 0 3 k θ k s θ θ r θ s θ r ε k s θ θ r s y ε where θ is the volumetric water content z is the elevation in the vertical direction l k θ is the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity as a function of water content lt 1 i is the evaporation rate per unit depth lt 1l 1 t is time t ks is the saturated hydraulic conductivity lt 1 θr is the residual water content θs is the saturated water content ε is the brooks corey exponent sy is specific yield a point to note is that the use of brooks corey relation here is partially for the purpose of illustration and partially because of its broad application for dealing with unsaturated flow problems before the exact relation of unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water content in the thick vadose zone of this study is unlikely to be known precisely because that relation is only possible to know when conducting hydraulic tests at different depths with different water contents a task so challenging given the thickness of the vadose zone the following eqs 4 and 5 are used respectively to calculate the wave s velocity and water content of a wave generated from infiltration the velocity of the deepest point along a trailing wave which represents drying front is calculated by eq 4 the infiltration rate is converted to water content to apply the characteristic solutions for unsaturated flow a relation between water content and infiltration rate can be determined assuming that the flux is equal to the unsaturated hydraulic conductivity using eq 5 niswonger et al 2006 4 v θ ε k s s y θ θ r s y ε 1 5a θ q in k s 1 ε s y θ r 0 q in k s 5b θ θ s k s q in where v θ is the velocity at the deepest point along a trailing wave

model input lt 1 3 2 performance criteria model performance was measured using four different criteria root mean square error rmse eq 6 was used to measure the deviation between the measured and

flow and groundwater level respectively 3 3 2 parameter sensitivities pest could calculate composite sensitivities of each parameter pertaining to all observation and the composite sensitivity of parameter i is defined as 11 s i j t q j ii 1 2 m where m is the number of observations j is the jacobian matrix and q is the cofactor matrix which is a diagonal matrix comprised of the squared weights of observations to investigate the influence of different parameters for different observation groups the relative composite sensitivity needs to be calculated the relative composite sensitivity of a parameter is obtained by multiplying its composite sensitivity by the absolute value of the parameter or their log value for a log transformed parameter doherty 2004 4 model construction and calibration in order to investigate the influence of the thick vadose zone on groundwater recharge the following three models were constructed according to whether the vadose zone was modeled and whether the preferential infiltration was considered model 1 a coupled saturated unsaturated model model 2 a coupled saturated unsaturated model without considering the preferential infiltration model 3 a saturated model without the vadose zone flow process model 2 and model 3 were built on the basis of model 1 ignoring preferential infiltration and vadose zone flow process respectively 4 1 model 1 model 1 consists of 4 layers and each layer has 76 rows and 92 columns and the size of individual cell is 200 m 200 m the mesh around the spring was refined to 50 m 50 m the 3d diagram of the model was shown in fig 2 d by comparing the profile of study area fig 2 b and the profile of model fig 2 c it can be found that the division of rock types in the model is similar to the actual distribution of sedimentary sequence the data of land surface altitude are obtained from a 30 meter horizontal resolution digital elevation model dem aster gdem and the data set is provided by geospatial data cloud site computer network information center chinese academy of sciences http www gscloud cn the bottom of the study area is a horizontal plane with an elevation of 1700 m amsl as described previously the northern southern and western boundaries are assigned as no flow boundaries and the eastern boundary is assigned as a specified head boundary the simulation time is 281 days beginning on april 13 2017 and ending on january 18 2018 a total of 281 stress periods were established and the corresponding period is one day the transient simulation deserves some discussion firstly it is based on the unique hydrological characteristics of the site which can be roughly divided into a dry season started from november at present year to april of the following year and a wet season from may to october the hydraulic head and groundwater level spring discharge during the dry season varies mildly with time mostly because of lack of precipitation and groundwater recharge for example the groundwater level of zk3 varies from 2397 6 to 2410 7 m the spring discharge of q1 varies from 0 0019 to 0 0027 m3 s the spring discharge of q4 varies from 1 048 to 1 307 m3 s during the dry season in particular when approaching the end of the dry season the groundwater system essentially approaches a sort of quasi steady state condition with almost no change of hydraulic head and groundwater level spring discharge with time on the other hand the hydraulic head and groundwater level spring discharge vary considerably during the wet season mostly because of the heavy precipitation and strong groundwater recharge during this season this is why we choose to conduct the transient flow simulation mostly for the wet season april to november and the early state of the dry season december to january next year secondly another reason to choose the period of april 13 2017 to january 18 2018 for the transient simulation is because of an intensive data collection campaign over this period with daily collection of spring discharge data and precipitation data in the region as the starting date of the transient simulation is towards the end of the dry season april 13 2017 and the hydrological system is approaching the quasi steady state condition for the dry season then the initial condition chosen for the transient simulation can be set as the result of the quasi steady state of the dry season the quasi steady state model for the dry season is also used to determine the spatial distribution of hydraulic conductivity as such a model does not need to consider the storage capacity of aquifers which would be required for a transient model the hydraulic conductivities of rock mass here are mainly obtained from field tests as stated in section 2 2 since field tests tend to underestimate the actual hydraulic conductivity in karst aquifer rimmer and salingar 2006 jukić and denić jukić 2009 the parameters obtained through field tests need to be optimized in the model measured discharge of four springs q1 to q4 and groundwater level of three monitoring wells zk1 zk2 zk3 in april are used for calibration of the quasi steady state model for the dry season the simulation results of spring discharge and groundwater level in the quasi steady state model for the dry season are shown in fig 5 and the differences which are less than 10 between the measured and simulated values prove the reliability of the model specific yield sy and specific storage ss are optimized in the transient model due to the fact that the groundwater level is very deep and it is difficult to conduct pumping tests or any other hydraulic tests to acquire the values of sy and ss their values are determined by the optimization process daily measured discharge of q4 and observation of monitoring well zk3 are used for the transient model calibration and evaluation three parameters used in vadose zone percentage of preferential infiltration α brooks corey coefficient ε saturated water content θs are also calibrated in the transient model table 1 as for the simulation of springs q1 q2 and q3 are represented as drains with elevations at 2279 m 2217 m and 2188 m amsl respectively the flow from the aquifer into the drain is cd times the difference between drains elevation and head in the cell containing the drain when the latter is greater than the former harbaugh 2005 cd drain conductance was set high enough 1 105 m2 d to allow unrestricted discharge of water in this study scanlon et al 2003 budge and sharp 2009 the karst conduit between machang karst depression and q4 is represented as a stream using the stream package str1 and the downstream flow of the stream is regarded as q4 discharge chen et al 2013 the str1 package uses the manning s equation to calculate flow in the conduit due to the lack of detailed geometric information about the conduit the conduit was set as a straight stream without tortuosity i e si 1 0 and the width of stream d is 0 1 m equal to the diameter of karst conduit the hydraulic conductivity of streambed kst is equal to the hydraulic conductivity of surrounding rock prudic 1989 the manning s roughness coefficient n is calibrated in the quasi steady state model table 1 as for the thrust fault the horizontal flow barrier hfb package was utilized to simulate the effect of fault f2 on groundwater flow mechal et al 2016 the hydraulic conductance cf is the barrier hydraulic conductivity divided by the width of the barrier hsieh and freckleton 1993 and its value is calibrated in quasi steady state model table 1 the rainfall infiltration coefficients were determine by groundwater balance estimation ranging from 0 63 to 0 91 in karst area and 0 29 to 0 77 in non karst area according to the overlying rock and land use 4 2 model 2 and model 3 two additional models were constructed as comparison model 2 is a coupled saturated unsaturated model without considering the preferential infiltration i e percentage of preferential infiltration is 0 and all the infiltration is through the slow flow model 3 is a saturated model without considering the vadose zone process meaning that the infiltration recharges the aquifer directly except for the different recharge methods the structures of the saturated zone are identical in those three models the sy ss ε and θs values of model 2 and model 3 are calibrated in the transient model using an automatic calibration process and the results are shown in table 1 5 results 5 1 general model performance the simulation results of those three models are shown in figs 6 and 7 as for the results of model 1 it can be seen that good agreement is obtained between measured and simulated data in spring q4 and well zk3 there are 219 consecutive daily spring fluxes of q4 and 270 consecutive daily groundwater levels of well zk3 from april 2017 to january 2018 a high degree of coincidence is found by comparing the measured discharge groundwater level time curves with the simulated discharge groundwater time curves the curve fluctuation trends are consistent and the main peaks overlapped with each other fig 6 according to the results of four criteria the quality of model 1 simulation is satisfactory rmse values are 0 101 m3 s for q4 and 3 037 m for zk3 which respectively account 6 903 of the discharge fluctuations measured at q4 and 10 286 groundwater level fluctuation measured at zk3 errorv values are 1 241 for q4 and 0 041 for zk3 nsc values are 0 907 for q4 and 0 911 for zk3 the linear trend lines of data with slope of 0 832 and 1 029 are slightly deviated from the expected 45 line for a slope of 1 0 the pearson correlation coefficients r are 0 958 and 0 911 for q4 and zk3 respectively which indicates good correlation between measured and simulated spring discharge groundwater level model 3 without considering the vadose zone process get the worst simulation results among the three models fig 6 shows that a significant and systematic mismatch between the measured and simulated discharge time groundwater level time curves the simulated data time curves always peak earlier and have more secondary peaks than the measured ones the data time curves of coupled saturated unsaturated models with and without the preferential infiltration model 1 and model 2 look much better the values of criteria also show that the simulation of model 3 is not very satisfactory compared with model 1 and model 2 fig 7 the vadose zone process reduces the rmse between measured and computed spring discharge from 0 235 m3 s model 3 to 0 101 m3 s model 1 a reduction of 57 02 the reduction of 26 61 for rmse in groundwater level the increase of 80 67 for nsc in spring discharge and the increase of 9 23 for nsc in groundwater level also indicate that considering the vadose zone process makes the simulation result better model 2 even if it only takes into account the diffusive infiltration process is much better in simulation results than model 3 the rmse of spring discharge and groundwater level in model 2 are 54 04 and 24 72 lower than those in model 3 respectively the much better data time curves and tremendous improvement on calibration criteria suggest a significant role for the vadose zone when we compared the simulation results of model 1 and model 2 it is found that both model 1 and model 2 have rather good simulation results considering the preferential infiltration has little improvement on modeling since the data time curves of the two models almost coincide fig 6 and the calibration criteria of model 1 are slightly better than those of model 2 fig 7 the rmse of spring discharge and groundwater head in model 1 are only 6 48 and 2 5 lower than those in model 2 respectively the increase of 1 45 and 0 55 for nsc in spring discharge and groundwater level are not remarkable this phenomenon may be explained by two factors 1 in karst area with a thick vadose zone like the study area slow flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge for long term groundwater simulation this results in the model being able to get pretty good simulation results even without considering preferential replenishment 2 using the parameter α to divide the preferential infiltration and diffusive recharge is a rather simple approximation its defect in the characterization of infiltration division during rainstorm renders it incapable of simulating the secondary peak of hydrograph for the above two reasons the improvement of model 1 to model 2 is limited 5 2 sensitivity analysis a parameter study could help better characterizing parameters in the model and facilitate its further application extension and transfer to other karst aquifer systems chen and goldscheider 2014 relative composite sensitivity of parameters with respect to all observations spring discharge and groundwater level in the transient model was calculated for three models using the pest parameter sensitivity output fig 8 the most influential parameters in model 1 were the three specific yield values sy1 sy2 sy3 in model 2 with only diffusive infiltration the vadose zone parameter ε was the most influential parameter in model 3 which did not consider vadose zone sy had particularly high sensitivity compared with ss in each model sy1 was the most sensitive among the three sy values another sensitivity analysis was conducted based on the optimal parameter set for further investigation of the effects of six vadose zone parameters on simulation result of model 1 this is done by selecting one of the parameters to increase or decrease while keeping other five parameters at their optimized values where parameters ks q and sy were multiplied by different numbers note that the parameters should vary within physically reasonable ranges e g the value of θs cannot be greater than 1 fig 9 shows the response of objective function f to each parameter change the simulation results show an obvious deterioration with the change of q since the value of the highest f is two orders of magnitude higher than what was before changing ks and sy will raise the value of f by an order of magnitude and the deterioration caused by reducing these two parameters is more obvious than that caused by increasing them compared with the above three parameters ε θs and α have less influence on the simulation results since they do not change the order of magnitude of f as shown in fig 9 e the value of f with θs of 0 7 is smaller than that with θs of the optimized value 0 284 however θs 0 7 does not appear to be physically realistic based on the rock types of the formation therefore 0 284 is still the optimized values for θs 5 3 comparison of recharge time curves as the objective of this study is to conceptualize and understand the influence of a thick vadose zone on groundwater recharge in a karst formation the main task is to compare the difference between the recharge time curves generated by those three models in karst area sub system i and sub system ii in the coupled unsaturated saturated flow modeling the diffusive recharge is determined using the following procedures firstly after conducting the saturated unsaturated flow simulations one could obtain the spatiotemporal distribution of hydraulic head from which the spatiotemporal distribution of the pressure head can also be obtained by subtracting the elevation head from the hydraulic head after this the water table position is determined by searching for the zero pressure head secondly after determining the location of the water table uzf package is applied to calculate the downward darcian velocity at the water table which is the recharge rate to groundwater campbell 2010 thirdly if one wants to calculate the volumetric recharge over a certain designated area one simply needs to carry out the integration of the recharge rate over the designated area as stated in section 4 the groundwater recharge of model 1 is composed of the diffusive recharge and the preferential recharge where the diffusive recharge is provided by the output of the saturated unsaturated modeling and the preferential recharge is equal to the specified preferential infiltration the recharge of model 2 is entirely from the diffusive recharge and the recharge of model 3 is equal to the specified infiltration the results are shown in the following figures firstly recharge in response to a single rainfall event 100 mm d is considered the initial condition was computed by the quasi steady state model for the dry season and the model generated response of recharge is shown in fig 10 it can be seen that after the single rainfall event model 3 recharge time curve peaks immediately model 2 recharge time curve does not reach the peak until eight days later and model 1 recharge time curve has two obvious peaks occurred at the first and ninth day respectively it makes sense that recharge time curve of model 3 peaks immediately since the infiltration is added directly to the groundwater surface the peak lag of model 2 recharge time curve is caused by the infiltration process in the diffusive limestone blocks the first peak in model 1 was caused by the fast flow preferential infiltration which account for 10 of the total infiltration and the second peak was caused by the slow flow diffusive infiltration afterwards the simulated transient recharge time curves of model 1 and model 3 are shown in fig 11 comparing with the model 3 recharge time curve the model 1 recharge time curve is continuous and smoother fig 11 a permitting water to recharge the saturated zone constantly even during the dry season it is consistent with the actual recharge pattern that water in the vadose zone recharges the groundwater continuously hunt et al 2008 cao et al 2016 in addition to the recharge pattern the vadose zone has a profound impact on timing of recharge for a more intuitive view of the difference in timing between model 1 recharge and model 3 recharge the recharge calculated by the two models are combined into monthly rates fig 11 b it can be seen visually that there is a considerable difference in recharge time between the two recharge methods i e whether the thick vadose zone is considered or not has an important influence on timing of recharge the heavy rainfall model 3 recharge in july appears as model 1 recharge in august and even partially shows up in september the migration time of infiltration is prolonged in the thick vadose zone which makes the time lag more obvious the influence of karst thick vadose zone on pattern and timing of recharge reflects its strong buffer effect which is caused by propagation time requiring for the signal of precipitation induced infiltration passing through the vadose zone and storage capacity of the vadose zone emblanch et al 2003 carrière et al 2016 azzaz et al 2018 5 4 effects of different parameters on recharge given the fact that the vadose zone plays a considerable role in regulating the aquifer recharge it is important to perform a parameter analysis on parameters used in the vadose zone to prioritize the parameters that play a major role in the infiltration processes the parameter analysis is restricted to the range of 20 to 50 in this study the initial water content is not analyzed in this parameter analysis this is because when steady state is specified for the initial stress period the water content is computed for each active cell which is used automatically as the initial conditions for the following transient stress period niswonger et al 2006 since the sensitivity of parameters can change as their values change the following analysis is strictly quantitative only for the values of model 1 shown in table 1 infiltration rate q has the greatest influence on recharge among all the parameters table 2 fig 12 b when q is increased by 50 the increase of the mean groundwater recharge is lower than 50 table 2 this phenomenon can occur via two mechanisms 1 the storage capacity of the vadose zone will decrease with a rising water level so that part of the infiltration will turn into dunnian overland runoff dunne and black 1970 hunt et al 2008 as q increases the groundwater level rises causing more infiltration routed into dunnian overland runoff 2 as shown in eq 5 not all the infiltration specified in the uzf package input file can enter the vadose zone when the infiltration rate qin specified in the uzf package input exceeds the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity of the vadose zone ks the difference between qin and k s will be converted to hortonian overland flow horton 1933 hunt et al 2008 i e the actual diffusive infiltration rate qin will be smaller than qin when storm events qin ks occurs as q increases so does the number of storm events qin ks leading to an increase in the amount of infiltration converted to hortonian overland flow for this reason the increase of qin is less than 50 leading to the increase of mean recharge also less than 50 in another word when infiltration rate is increased the diffusive infiltration does not increase by the same percentage in model 1 and more rainfall will turn into runoff in this study when the infiltration rate increased by 50 in model 1 the total runoff increased from6 506 106 m3 to1 132 107 m3 increasing by more than 50 decreasing the specified infiltration rate has the opposite effect of increasing the specified infiltration rate the influences of the specific yield sy brooks corey coefficient ε and percentage of preferential infiltration α on recharge are also evident table 2 fig 12 c d and f as can be seen from table 2 and fig 12 d when ε is increased by 50 the range of recharge increases significantly sy is not only used for the purpose of calculating changes in saturated zone storage during fluctuation of the water table it is also used to calculate the timing and the volume of recharge since the wetting front velocity and the amount of water stored in the unsaturated area are also affected by sy when the value of sy is increased by 50 the maximum recharge decreases obviously the minimum recharge does not change much and the range of recharge time curve decreases compared with other parameters changing the value of sy can cause significant change in timing of recharge fig 12 c this is because in the uzf package the velocity of wetting front will decrease when sy is increased eq 4 resulting in a more obvious time lag in diffusive recharge decreasing sy has an opposite effect as that of increasing sy as for the percentage of preferential infiltration α it can be seen that increasing the value of α makes the recharge time curve fluctuating more dramatically and the secondary peaks sharper this is because with the increase of α a part of diffusive infiltration gets converted into preferential infiltration leading to more infiltration reaching the groundwater table directly the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity ks and saturated water content θs have little influence on recharge increasing these two parameters by up to 50 results in less than 1 changes in the mean recharge table 2 figs 12 a and 10 e whether ks and θs are increased or decreased the recharge time curves do not change significantly 6 discussions first of all we want to emphasize that the site of concern in this study represents a unique hydrological system with a thick karst vadose zone above a karst aquifer bounded by various faults and rivers few studies have been conducted on such a system before with a lot of unanswered salient scientific questions from an application perspective the site of concern here is also in the middle of some major hydraulic engineering projects such as cross basin water transfer using deep seated long tunnels though the karst formations thus a better understanding of the karst hydrologic system is essential for the engineering design of such hydraulic engineering projects given the scientific importance and application value of the site unfortunately the site is poorly studied before and the monitoring data are sparse and inconsistent before the initiation of this study therefore this research can only be regarded as a phase 1 research over a long term investigation that will last for decades in the future given the highly complex system of concern here and the limited datasets available to the investigators so far this study undoubtedly has some limitations and cannot answer all the questions nevertheless despite of its limitations this study sheds some important new lights on the hydrological characteristics of the site for instance it shows that slow flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge in karst area with a thick vadose zone although some of the findings of the study may appear self explained the modeling exercises provide further confirmation in a quantitative manner about those findings given the fact that this study is only a phase 1 investigation it is important to elaborate more on the limitations of the study analysis of such limitations not only sets constrains on the applicability of this study but also sheds lights on the need of future investigations and further data gathering effort the following points are certainly notable firstly using the parameter α to divide the preferential infiltration and diffusive infiltration is a rather simple approach and its simulation results are acceptable in the case of long term groundwater simulation however if one wants to conduct a high resolution simulation of a transient flow process with a much short time step such as 1 hr such a simple approach may not be valid and a more complex method is needed to accommodate the preferential infiltration and diffusive infiltration processes which may be closely interrelated even without considering the preferential infiltration model 2 discussed above has obtained some good simulation results based on such results we can conclude that the slow flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge in karst area with a thick vadose zone in the following work we will analyze multiple karst sites and explore the roles of preferential versus diffusive infiltration processes secondly as stated in the introduction there are a host of theoretical approaches that can be utilized to investigate the hydrologic characteristics of a karst system to answer questions of how long is the lag time of groundwater recharge to rainfall and how much flow that the vadose zone could store a lumped model combined with environmental isotopes and hydrochemical signals for hydrologic analysis could be used unfortunately the isotopic and hydrochemical investigations have not been implemented for this site and should be carried out in the future up to present none of those approaches are proven superior than others given the unique thick karst vadose zone of the site this study offers a different perspective of using various modeling exercises two coupled saturated unsaturated flow models and one saturated flow model to gain insights into the system of concern this is not to say that this approach is better than other approaches it is our attempt to combine different approaches to investigate the problem when more datasets are collected in the future as a matter of fact utilization and advancement of multiple approaches is probably the best choice for understanding the highly complex karst system thirdly in this study the river is treated as a boundary of the mountain karst system the rationale of doing so is based on the observation that the absence of specific water boundary conditions such as thrust fault groundwater divide between mountain and basin systems which makes the hydraulic connection of the groundwater in the mountain and basin systems possible further investigations probably through isotope and or large scale tracer studies will be needed to confirm the exact nature of hydraulic connection among different hydrological elements such as rivers faults groundwater in mountain system and groundwater in basin system fourthly this study relies on the spring discharge data and saturated zone hydraulic head data to calibrate the models even with enormous efforts putting forward in various modeling exercises models 1 3 of this study it is still quite challenging to completely decouple the contribution of selected controlling parameters in recharge to resolve this issue additional field work must be carried out in the future for instance various field methods such as tracers cl 3h and 36cl methods water balance and darcy flux measurements methods and lysimeters are commonly employed to estimate recharge in the field gee and hillel 1988 allison et al 1994 scanlon and cook 2002 xu and beekman 2019 in respect to recharge estimation in karst aquifers one may consult the works of leaney and herczeg 1995 jones et al 2000 and allocca et al 2014 in particular jones et al 2000 pointed out that the recharge estimated using groundwater constituents such as oxygen isotopes and dissolved chloride had fewer uncertainties than recharge estimated using direct measurement of hydrologic parameters such field work is necessary to further advance our understanding of the unique karst formation of this study which has a thick vadose zone that is rarely reported in previous investigations 7 conclusions this study uses various modeling exercises including two coupled saturated unsaturated flow models model 1and model 2 and one saturated flow model model 3 to investigate a karst system in yunnan province china which is characterized by a thick karst vadose zone overlying a regional karst aquifer model 1is built by 1d unsaturated zone flow uzf package and 3d groundwater flow modflow nwt package model 2 is built on the basis of model 1 but without considering the preferential infiltration model 3 is built on the basis of model 1 but without the vadose zone process this study focuses on analyzing the influence of thick karst vadose zone on aquifer recharge the primary conclusions are as follows 1 in both model 1 and model 2 the rmse values of spring discharge and groundwater level are more than 50 and 20 lower than those in model 3 when simulate groundwater in karst area with thick vadose zone coupled saturated unsaturated model no matter considering the preferential infiltration or not performs much better than the saturated model without considering the infiltration process in the vadose zone 2 by comparing the results of model 1 and model 2 it is found that even without considering preferential infiltration model 2 can still well simulate the hydrograph in the study area since the rmse of spring discharge and groundwater head in model 1 are only 6 48 and 2 5 lower than those in model 2 respectively it can be inferred that in karst area with thick vadose zone like the study area slow flow plays a major role in controlling groundwater recharge for long term groundwater simulation 3 by comparing the recharge time curves of model 1 and model 3 it is found that the thick karst vadose zone has imposed a significant buffer effect on the overall hydrodynamic response of the unsaturated saturated karst formation the buffer effect is manifested in the obvious time lag of recharge and alternation of recharge pattern in tens of days a single rainfall fig 10 and months long term rainfall fig 11 4 influences of different parameters on recharge are evaluated and prioritized infiltration rate has the greatest impact on recharge followed by the specific yield percentage of preferential infiltration and the brooks corey coefficient the saturated vertical hydraulic conductivity and saturated water content have little impact on recharge 5 the study improves our understanding on the influence of a thick karst vadose zone on aquifer recharge but it is only a phase 1 investigation and it should be combined with other approaches such as reservoir modeling and isotopic analysis to better understand the system of concern large scale long term years and decades hydrological monitoring datasets are essential to understand the hydrologic characteristics of the karst systems including the exact nature of hydraulic connection of different elements such has rivers faults mountain groundwater and basin groundwater 6 even with enormous efforts putting forward in various modeling exercises models 1 3 of this study it is still quite challenging to decouple the contribution of selected controlling parameters in recharge to resolve this issue additional field work such as vadose zone tracer tests using oxygen isotopes and dissolved chloride may be carried out in the future credit authorship contribution statement ruitong liu methodology software formal analysis writing original draft jinguo wang

4996,the differential response of hydrologic system hsdr can represent the relation between errors of model outputs and influencing variables which has been proposed for error correction in flood forecasting in this study the hsdr method with stepwise approximation is established to update areal mean rainfall in whole basin hsdr amp and spatial distributed rainfall in each sub basin hsdr sdp respectively the regularized least square algorithm is employed to calculate the solutions the performance of the proposed method on improving the predictions by the xinanjiang xaj model is demonstrated in a synthetic case with different rainfall errors and in real basins with different flow characteristics the results show that 1 the hsdr can improve flood predictions by updating rainfall 2 the improved hsdr with stepwise approximation outperforms that without iteration 3 the hsdr sdp converges faster than the hsdr amp 4 the hsdr sdp with enough observations used for updating can perform better due to the consideration of rainfall spatial distribution 5 when increasing lead time the hsdr performance generally deteriorates slowly than the autoregressive ar technique to some extent the hsdr for error updating can utilize physical mechanism of hydrological process represented by hydrological models with clear concept simple structure and stable performance the enhanced method is worthy of further applications for real time flood forecasting and ultimately extend the understanding of error feedback in hydrologic process keywords hydrologic system differential response rainfall updating xinanjiang model flood forecasting 1 introduction the key elements of a real time flood forecasting system include a rainfall runoff model either lumped distributed or semi distributed a river flow routing model and an updating procedure wood and o connell 1985 wmo 1992 the basic predictions by rainfall runoff and river flow routing models are very essential for accurate flood forecasting refsgaard 1997 forthermore updating procedure and comprehensive data processing are important for operational flood forecasting due to spatial and temporal variability of precipitation and underlying landscape characteristics hydrological processes are highly nonlinear timedependent and spatially varying beven 2000 2002 liu and han 2013 chang and yeh 2018 the nonlinear dynamic relationship between rainfall and river flow is a complex hydrological process to model besides the complexity of processes in nature there exist inevitably various errors in flood forecasting kavetski and clark 2011 westerberg and mcmillan 2015 pianosi and wagener 2016 seibert et al 2018 flood forecasting has always been a dominant and challenging field in operational hydrology diverse

tiedeman and green 2013 li et al 2014 zhang et al 2018 leach et al 2018 operational flood forecasting requires accurate forecasts with a suitable lead time for the issuance of a flood warning generally the performance of autoregressive ar technique becomes poorer due to poorer correlations between error series with increasing lead time bao et al 2011 there still needs the development of reliable error updating methods to issue good and stable performance with sufficient lead time for flood forecasting current error correction methods mainly focus on error series between observations and calculations e g chen et al 2013 leach et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in error updating more attention needs to be paid to the physical base of hydrological process characterized by hydrological models the total differential has been widely applied in the field of error estimation the differential represents the principal part of the change in a function with respect to changes in the independent variables kirchner 2009 the differential response between the change of independent variables and dependent variables can reflect the inherent relation between the cause and the effect which is based on the physical mechanism of the adopted model hydrologic modelling uses the integration of hydrologic processes to determine watershed response singh and woolhiser 2002 in flood forecasting the differential response of hydrologic system hsdr can be used to derive the relation between errors of model outputs dependent variables and influencing factors independent variables producing the update of independent variables the error updating using the hsdr is a feedback process the dynamic system response curve dsrc method based on the hsdr has been used for runoff updating

et al 2017 the results demonstrate that the hsdr can improve flood predictions without increasing model complexity or model parameters the nonlinear hydrological relationship between the model outputs and variables is approximately characterized as simple first order taylor linearization in simple matrix forms in previous works little attention has been given to the errors caused by linearization of nonlinear system commonly a successive approximation approach can produce better inversion in the feedback problem this motivates us to investigate the performance of the hsdr method with and without stepwise approximation reducing errors and uncertainties on hydrological processes has been the focus in hydrological forecasting wagener and gupta 2005 kavetski et al 2006 liu and gupta 2007 rainfall is an important input of hydrological model that presents high uncertainty with great impact on model performance bertoni et al 1992 bárdossy and das 2008 nanda et al 2016 fraga et al 2019 adams and dymond 2019 flood forecasting requires observed rainfall data which may be rarely sufficient to capture spatial and temporal variability of rainfall at small scales singh 1997 silberstein 2006 villarini and krajewski 2008 mcmillan et al 2012 rainfall errors interact with rainfall runoff process resulting in error of flow simulation understanding the nature of streamflow response to rainfall is essential for flood forecasting coustau et al 2013 cristiano et al 2017 criss 2018 the difficulty arises due to the nonlinearity inherent in hydrological processes especially in spatial complexities of rainfall the informations contributed by all error sources are compressed into model outputs however it is difficult to decompose the residuals between observations and calculations to trace error sources for error correction bogner and kalas 2008 liu et al 2011 renard et al 2011 li et al 2017 errors in hydrograph properties are strongly correlated with errors in space time characteristics of precipitation mei et al 2017 extracting rainfall error from discharge residuals is important for flow updating in previous studies the hsdr was used to update areal mean value of variables in whole basins how to consider the spatial and temporal variability of updated variables in error updating is another problem that needs to be investigated this paper presents an extension of the hsdr method based on differential response of hydrologic rainfall runoff system for improving flood forecasting in this study we propose the hsdr with successive approximation to gradually update spatial distributed rainfall sdp and areal mean rainfall amp respectively the main contents include 1 a successive approximation approach for the hsdr is adopted 2 the comparison of spatial distributed rainfall sdp and areal mean rainfall amp updating by the hsdr is demonstrated through a synthetic case and real case studies 3 the performance of the hsdr and autoregressive technique ar with increasing lead time is analysed this work can provide an investigation of the hsdr on spatial and temporal error updating it could help improve real time flood forecasting flood control and disaster reduction 2 methodology 2 1 hydrologic system differential response method hsdr hydrological process of transforming rainfall to streamflow is commonly conceptualized as evaporation runoff generation flow concentration and flood routing every process in the hydrological process can be generalized as a single system and some related processes also can be regarded as a bigger system a flood forecasting model consisting of rainfall runoff and river flow routing models can be described as composition of a set of interconnected mathematical functions that contain variables and parameters a mathematical form of a nonlinear hydrologic system can be generalized as a complex function 1 q f i s θ where q is the time order model output dependent variable i is the vector of model inputs independent variable s is the vector of state variables independent variable θ is the vector of model parameters independent variable any change of variables i s and θ in eq 1 can affect the model outputs the first order partial derivative of eq 1 is written as 2 dq f i d i f s d s f θ d θ where f i is the differential response of model input variable f s is the differential response of model state variable f θ is the differential response of model parameter eq 2 represents the sum of the partial differentials with respect to all independent variables it shows that the variation of dependent variable is caused by the change of independent variables for simplicity and generality we take the differential response to one variable x as an example namely q f x t where t is the time eq 2 can be simplified as 3 dq f x x x c d x where x x 1 x 2 x n t is the time order model variable x c x c 1 x c 2 x cn t is the current best estimate of x q q 1 q 2 q m t is the observed output m is the data length of observed outputs used for updating n is the length of time order variable needed to be updated m n when the change of independent variable x is small enough the matrix form of eq 3 can be written as 4 δ q u δ x ξ where u f x 1 x 1 f x 1 x j f x 1 x n f x 2 x 1 f x 2 x j f x 2 x n f x m x 1 f x m x j f x m x n m n is the system differential response matrix δ q q o 1 q c 1 q o 2 q c 2 q om q cm q o q o 1 q o 2 q om t is the actual output q c q c 1 q c 2 q cm t is the calculated output δ x δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x n t is the estimated errors of variable x ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m t is the vector of residuals which generally obeys the white noise vector of zero mean value the u varies dynamically with the change of variables it can be simplified as u u 1 u j u n where u j f x 1 x j f x 2 x j f x m x j t represents the differential response due to the variable change at time j each term in the matrix u can be computed by differential approximation as 5 f x t x j f x 1 x j δ x j x n t t f x 1 x j x n t t δ x j using the regularized least square algorithm we can obtain the solution 6 δ x u t u β i 1 u t δ q where β is the regularization coefficient the updated variable x can be expressed as 7 x x c δ x in flood forecasting we can use real time residuals between calculated and observed discharges to update variables inputs or states or parameters the streamflow prediction can be improved by re running the hydrological model with updated variables 2 2 calculation procedure the rainfall runoff system represented by eq 1 is nonlinear and implicit it is difficult to calculate δ x from δ q for better inversion we suggest a successive approximation approach for the hsdr to reflect the differential response of the nonlinear system which is different from the previous studies bao et al 2014 si et al 2015 sun et al 2018a 2018b eq 6 can be rewritten as 8 δ x k u k t u k β i 1 u k t δ q k where the superscript k represents the number of iteration δ x k is the estimated error of x in the k iteration u k is the system differential response matrix in the k iteration δ q k q o q c k q c k is the calculated output in the k iteration the estimate of x can be rewritten as 9 x k 1 x k δ x k the calculation frame of the stepwise approximation approach for the hsdr is shown in fig 1 in the flowchart k is the iteration number qo is the observed discharge qc k and qcc k is the calculated discharge using the x k and perturbed x k plus with one unit x k 1 respectively in accordance with the frame the specific calculation procedure is described as follows step 1 calculate qc k and qcc k at the basin outlet using the adopted hydrologic model step 2 calculate the vector δq k and matrix u k step 3 determine the new estimated x k 1 using eqs 8 and 9 step 4 judge whether the x k 1 are optimal if they are the calculation ends otherwise go to step 1 and continue the followed steps the calculation procedure from step 1 to step 3 is used to calculate x k 1 step 4 is used to judge whether to carry the iteration theoretically with the successive iterations of steps 1 through 4 the estimated x k 1 will approach the actual representation of the variable the calculation without iteration by using steps 1 to 3 was adopted in previous works three predefined criteria can be commonly used to terminate iteration including the change of objective function convergence of updated variables and number of iteration in this study we use the root mean square error rmse as objective function if the value of rmse is not decreased in next five iterations the iteration ends 2 3 rainfall updating using hsdr in hydrological modelling using conceptual hydrological models such as the xinangjiang model zhao 1992 the study basin is commonly divided into a set of sub basins to represent spatial characteristics the outflow of each sub basin is routed to the outlet of whole basin the outflow discharge variations at the basin outlet are primarily caused by the changes of areal mean rainfall in each sub basin considering the hydrological response to rainfall the eq 1 can be simply written as 10 q f p 1 p 2 p s t where q is the discharge at the basin outlet p s p s 1 p s 2 p s n t is the areal mean rainfall series in the s sub basin s is the number of sub basins n is the length of the variable needed to be updated eq 10 determines how basin outlet discharge responds to rainfall inputs it also can be used to interpret how error accumulates from rainfall input to discharge outputs the updating of input variables can lead to state variables updating finally producing the improvement of flow prediction there are two ways to update rainfall by using the hsdr shown in fig 2 one is the areal mean rainfall updating in whole basin referred as hsdr amp shown in fig 2 a and another is the spatial distributed rainfall updating that gradually updates the areal mean rainfall in each sub basin referred as hsdr sdp shown in fig 2 b as shown in fig 2 a the differential response matrix u for the whole basin is calculated from the change of outlet discharge to the perturbations of areal mean rainfall in the whole basin the procedure of the hsdr amp mainly includes 1 generate a perturbed areal mean rainfall series by increasing the areal mean rainfall p i j i 1 to s at time j by one unit in the whole basin while keeping the rainfall at other time unchanged 2 input the perturbed areal mean rainfall series to the hydrological model to calculate flow series the response vector u j of the response matrix u for the whole basin can be computed that is the difference between calculated flows resulting from the perturbed rainfall and original rainfall 3 repeat steps 1 and 2 at different time and all the columns of matrix u u 1 u j u n are obtained thus the estimate of the incremental rainfall δ p for the whole basin can be calculated according to the area proportion of sub basin to whole basin the estimated areal mean rainfall in the i sub basin can be calculated 11 δ p i δ p η i i 1 t o s where η η 1 η 2 η s represents the sub basin area weight that is the area proportion of the sub basin to the whole basin as shown in fig 2 b the differential response matrix u for each sub basin is calculated according to the response of outlet discharge to rainfall change in the corresponding sub basin the procedure of the hsdr sdp mainly includes 1 increase rainfall at time j by one unit in the i sub basin while keeping the rainfall at other time in the sub basin and all rainfall in other sub basins unchanged 2 input the perturbed rainfall series to the model to calculate flow series the response matrix u j for the i sub basin at time j can be computed 3 repeat steps 1 and 2 at different time all the columns of matrix u u 1 u j u n for the i sub basin are obtained 4 estimate δ p by using the u for the sub basin and the estimate of δ p i for the sub basin can be calculated according to the area proportion of the sub basin to the whole basin 5 repeat steps 1 to 4 for different sub basins we can obtain the estimated areal mean rainfall in each sub basin the major differences between the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are the consideration of differential response matrix u for the whole basin or each sub basin and the assignment of the estimated incremental rainfall for each sub basin the u for whole basin is calculated in the hsdr amp while the u for each sub basin is calculated in the hsdr sdp in the hsdr sdp the information of residuals between observations and calculations can be decomposed to update spatial distributed rainfall in each sub basin compared with the hsdr amp the hsdr sdp can account for the impact of spatial distribution of rainfall on model output the hsdr amp without iteration was adopted in previous works si et al 2015 theoretically and practice confirms with enough observations the hsdr sdp updating can perform better due to the consideration of rainfall spatial distribution especially in basins with strongly uneven spatial distribution of rainfall 3 case study 3 1 study design the xinanjiang model xaj is adopted in this study to represent rainfall runoff process it has been extensively and successfully applied for flood forecasting and water resources planning in humid and semi humid regions in china e g yao et al 2009 lü et al 2013 lin et al 2014 bai et al 2017 the xaj model uses soil moisture storage capacity curve to represent spatial distribution of soil moisture storage capacity the study basin is usually divided into sub basins to capture spatial variability of precipitation evaporation and underlying surface the basic inputs of the xaj model are mean areal rainfall and evaporation in each sub basin the model output is streamflow at basin outlet this semi distributed modelling provides advantages over lumped modelling in representing the effect of spatially variable inputs and catchment properties the structure of the xaj model includes evaporation runoff generation runoff separation flow concentration and flood routing a three layer evapotranspiration scheme is used in evaporation module runoff production occurs on the repletion of storage capacity total runoff is divided into surface runoff interflow and groundwater runoff by a free reservoir three runoff components are routed through linear reservoirs respectively outflow from each sub basin is finally routed by the muskingum model to produce flow at the outlet of whole basin more specifications of the xaj model can be found in the following reference zhao 1992 the synthetic case and real case are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the hdsr on rainfall updating in flood predictions in the synthetic case different rainfall errors are set to test the suitability and effectiveness of the hsdr in different conditions in the real cases we illustrate the proposed hsdr sdp and hsdr amp in three basins with different rain gauge density and different flood characteristics the comparison of the hsdr updating with and without iteration is presented moreover the performances of the hsdr and the second order autoregressive technique ar with different lead time are compared the ar model has a simple structure minimal computational cost and distinct model improvement capacity which has been widely used in application the lead time in this study represents the time ahead of flood peak timing we set different lead times by using different number of observations for updating smaller lead time means more observations used for updating note that in this study the parameter values remain unchanged during both the prediction and updating processes m is set equal to n the regularization coefficient β is insensitive estimated as β 0 5 and model simulations are performed at hourly time steps 3 2 synthetic area and data we designed a typical watershed having drainage area of 1000 km2 with five rain gauges the basin is divided into five sub basins each sub basin has one rain gauge and the area weight for each sub basin is 0 21 0 19 0 18 0 16 and 0 26 respectively synthetic case suffers from little uncertainties as the model structure and parameters boundary conditions input and output and other related information are assumed known the areal mean rainfall data for each sub basin are represented by synthetic true point measurements at corresponding rain gauge the synthetic rainfall data are generated corresponding to an actual flood event the synthetic true river flow data are generated by running the xaj model with the synthetic rainfall parameters and initial states note that no errors exist in the true input and output data to investigate the impact of data errors on the performance of hsdr method simulation experiments are repeated using corrupted rainfall data the corruption is set by introducing three types of errors described below the areal mean rainfall data with different errors referred as a b and c are shown in fig 3 from scenarios a to c the rainfall errors are set from simpler to more complex series scenario a the rainfall errors are assumed to be constant in space and time the synthetic true rainfall data in each sub basin are added with the same spatial temporal error of 0 5 mm scenario b the rainfall errors are assumed to be time variable and space invariable the synthetic true rainfall data in each sub basin are added with the same time variable zero mean error series scenario c the rainfall errors are assumed to be spatial temporal variable the synthetic true rainfall data in each sub basin are added with different time variable non zero mean error series 3 3 real area and data the baishuikeng bsk reservoir basin dapoling dpl basin and shaowu sw basin in china fig 4 are selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed hsdr method on flood forecasting updating the characteristics of these basins are summarized in table 1 the bsk hydrographs are serrated because the observed reservoir inflow discharges are calculated according to the reservoir water level and outflow discharge most of the dpl floods rise rapidly with single peak most of the sw hydrographs have multi peaks the bsk dpl and sw basins are divided into 7 sub basins 13 sub basins and 9 sub basins by using the thiessen polygon method respectively measured rainfall pan evaporation and discharge data are provided by the local hydrological bureau the xaj model parameters are calibrated by using historical daily data and hourly data during flood events 3 4 evaluation measures the absolute relative peak error arpe root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 are employed to evaluate the model performance they are calculated as follows absolute relative peak error 12 arpe q c p q p q p 100 root mean square error 13 rmse t 1 n q c t q t 2 n nash sutcliffe efficiency 14 nse 1 t 1 n q c t q t 2 t 1 n q t q 2 where qp and qcp represent the observed and calculated peak discharge respectively q t and qc t represent the observed and calculated discharge at time t respectively n is the length of observations for one flood event q is the mean value of the observations for one flood event 4 results and discussions 4 1 synthetic case results the results for scenarios a b c by the hsdr rainfall updating with successive approximation are shown in fig 5 and some hydrographs are shown in fig 6 the results by the xaj model without updating are referred as xaj that by using areal mean rainfall updating referred as amp and that by using spatial distributed rainfall updating in each sub basin referred as sdp in is the number of iteration in fig 6 p is the rainfall with errors and qobs is the synthetic true discharge the results for amp and sdp with different number m of observations used for updating are suffixed by amp m and sdp m respectively as expected the hsdr can improve the xaj predictions from fig 5 in scenarios a and c and scenario b when m 11 the rmse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are decreased the nse values are increased and the arpe values are mainly reduced as fig 5 a and 5 b show in both scenarios a and b with space invariable errors the performances of the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are similar when m 12 the rmse for the hsdr amp are smaller than that for the hsdr sdp indicating that the hsdr sdp is not superior to the hsdr amp when updating space invariable errors as fig 5 c shows in the scenario c with spatial temporal rainfall errors when m 14 the rmse 5 4 m3 s for the hsdr sdp is marginally smaller than that 5 9 m3 s for the hsdr amp it indicates that with enough observed discharge data used for updating the hsdr sdp can perform better to update spatial temporal rainfall errors fig 6 also shows that the more observed data used for updating the better the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp perform to some extent the hsdr sdp can enhance information utilization by decomposing the outlet discharges for updating rainfall in each sub basin moreover the iterations for the hsdr sdp are generally less than the ones for hsdr amp indicating that the hsdr sdp converges faster than the hsdr amp 4 2 real case results the evaluation measure results are shown in fig 7 for the bsk basin fig 10 for the dpl basin and fig 13 for the sw basin some hydrographs are displayed in fig 8 for the bsk fig 11 for the dpl and fig 14 for the sw the mean evaluation measures for all events with different lead time are shown in fig 9 for the bsk fig 12 for the dpl and fig 15 for the sw the results suffixed by amp and sdp are obtained without iteration as expected the results for the hsdr sdp and hsdr amp are improved compared with the original results using the xaj from fig 7 a for the bsk fig 10 a for the dpl and fig 13 a for the sw the rmse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are smaller than those for the xaj and the nse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are larger than those for the xaj the results for the hsdr sdp are generally superior to those using the hsdr amp shown in figs 7 b 10 b and 13 b the rmse values for the hsdr sdp are generally smaller than those for the hsdr amp and the nse values for the hsdr sdp are generally greater than those for the hsdr amp the iterations for the hsdr sdp are generally smaller than those for the hsdr amp figs 7 c 10 c and 13 c show that the results for the hsdr with iteration are better than those without iteration the rmse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp with iteration are smaller than those without it and the nse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp with iteration are greater than those without it the hydrographs by the hsdr sdp are better matched to the observed as figs 8 11 and 14 display the simulations by the hsdr sdp generally agree well with the observations and the hsdr sdp can better capture flood peaks from the rmse values in figs 9 12 and 15 the hsdr sdp outperforms the hsdr amp in the bsk when the lead time smaller than 2 h in the dpl when the lead time smaller than 5 h and in the sw when the lead time smaller than 8 h according to the collected historical floods the average duration from the beginning of the flood to the time of flood peak is 34 6 h in the bsk 36 3 h in the dpl and 61 1 h in the sw which can affect the data length of observations used for updating with different lead time generally with more reliable observed information used for updating the hsdr sdp can perform better due to the consideration of spatial distribution of rainfall in comparison with the ar the hsdr performance decreases slowly with increasing lead time from fig 9 the performance of the ar and hsdr sdp decreases faster than hsdr amp when the lead time is extended when the lead time is greater than 2 h in figs 12 and 4h in fig 15 the ar performs poorer than the hsdr sdp and hsdr amp it indicates that the hsdr is more robust than the ar on streamflow updating with increasing lead time it also can be seen that the iterations for the hsdr sdp are fewer than those for the hsdr amp moreover it is found that there exists large error around flood peak by using the ar which may be due to poor correlation between the discharges around flood peak the real case results above show that the hsdr sdp and hsdr amp can improve the xaj model predictions the hsdr approach is effective with strong convergence and stable performance the hsdr sdp with enough observations used for updating generally can perform better than the hsdr amp 4 3 discussions the synthetic and real case studies demonstrate that the hydrologic system differential response hsdr can improve discharge predictions by updating rainfall the error updating based on the hsdr can utilize the conservation and response laws for describing hydrological characteristics in hydrological models one of the most important contributions of this study is the simple successive approximation approach for the hsdr another important contribution is the updating of spatial and temporal rainfall using the hsdr the solution of the hsdr is an inverse problem it is difficult to invert the change of independent variables from dependent variables in a highly nonlinear rainfall runoff system in this study the first order partial derivative is adopted to represent the hydrological response to the change of variables for better inversion a successive approximation approach for the hsdr is employed to reduce the effect of the linearization of nonlinear system in the study the hsdr through a few iterations can yield better improvement of model outputs we use the rmse as objective function for iteration termination which cannot guarantee that the peak error can be improved for all flood events in the study case the arpe for some flood events are not improved different objectives may prefer different estimated errors of updated variable although the optimal estimate of independent variables is beyond the scope of this paper further works could be devoted to use multi objective functions considering both rmse and arpe for optimal estimation and investigate the convergence in this inversion problem quantifying model error is a difficult task although the hsdr cannot directly quantify the influence of spatial errors on flood forecasting the hsdr sdp can account for the effect of spatial and temporal variability in rainfall updating on hydrological response through the differential response matrix u for each sub basin compared with the hsdr amp using the matrix u for the whole basin the hsdr sdp with more reliable observations used for updating can better improve flood predictions in the program the matrix u is 2 dimensional represented as u m n for the hsdr amp while it is 3 dimensional represented as u m n s for the hsdr sdp with increasing lead time the performances of the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp degrade slowly in comparison with the ar technique overall the study results show that the hsdr sdp can achieve better performance than the hsdr amp nevertheless the hsdr amp outperforms the hsdr sdp in the bsk when the lead time greater than 2 h in the dpl when the lead time greater than 5 h and in the sw when the lead time greater than 8 h in a basin longer lead time means fewer observations can be used for error updating it indicates that the hsdr sdp needs enough reliable observed information for updating to produce satisfactory results the hsdr performance varies with basins in the real case in basins with large flow concentration time and sparse density raingauge such as the sw basin fig 15 we recommend the hsdr sdp with stepwise approximation for long lead time predictions in basins with short flow concentration time and high density raingauge such as the dpl basin fig 12 the hsdr amp can obtain better results with long lead time in reservoir basin such as the bsk fig 9 the hsdr amp can obtain better results for reservoir inflow correction it is difficult and practically impossible to observe the actual reservoir inflow the reservoir inflow calculated according to reservoir water level and outflow discharge is commonly regarded as observed inflow the observed inflow hydrographs usually display large fluctuations fig 8 possibly involved errors even though the serrated observed inflow in reservoir basins can affect the performance of the hsdr the hsdr amp method can improve reservoir inflow forecasting model output errors are contributed by many sources such as model inputs model structure parameters states and initial conditions in the case studies we use the hsdr to update rainfall it may be inappropriate to attribute all the errors to the error of rainfall resulting in model inputs to compensate for all the errors the hsdr performance depends on whether the errors of updated variable are the primary cause of discrepancy between observed and computed streamflow there exist many errors in hydrological modelling that we cannot quantify from the rmse values in figs 9 12 and 15 the ar performs better for the 1 hr prediction in the bsk and dpl basins and for the 1 hr 2 hr and 3 hr predictions in the sw basin it is possible due to that the ar technique takes all errors into consideration from a black box perspective updating of input variables is the classical method justified by the fact that input uncertainties may often be the dominant error source in operational forecasting the hsdr method also can be extended to adjust other variables such as runoff soil moisture parameter and state producing reasonable flood forecasting results it can improve the understanding of how basin responds to related variables meanwhile more attention should be devoted to the data quality and computation in general the proposed hsdr method has the potential to improve real time flood forecasting without increasing model complexity or model parameters the updating procedure can be adapted from one forecast to the next without any need for user intervention it is highly suitable for real time applications in the study case the iterations of the stepwise approximation for the hsdr are fewer than 10 for most events figs 5 7 9 10 12 13 and 15 the updating procedure has small amount of calculation in applications the computing time is associated with the length of updated variable n the number of sub basins s the number of iteration in and the complexity of the adopted hydrological model the hsdr method is general and can be applied to other models including lumped quasi distributed models and fully distributed models moreover the hsdr without stepwise approximation also can improve model predictions for computationally intensive models if necessary we can choose the hsdr without iteration we will further demonstrate the enhanced method using more hydrologic models in other basins and gain some insight into the level of model complexity suitable for error correction using the hsdr in flood forecasting in general the shortcomings of the proposed method mainly includes 1 the hsdr performance depends on whether the updated variable is the main cause of discrepancy between observed and computed streamflow due to that the hsdr attributes all the errors to the error of adjusted variables 2 the hsdr performance is considerably affected by the observations used for updating this problem exists in any error correction technique theoretically a longer set of reliable observation data used for updating should achieve a better improvement on predictions although the hsdr performance is limited by the main causes of errors and the length of observations used for updating the study provides a promising approach for error correction 5 conclusions the differential is widely used in the field of error estimation the differential response of hydrologic system hsdr can be used to represent the relation between errors of model outputs and influencing variables we present an extensive effort to enhance the hsdr with successive approximation for flood forecasting in practical applications in this study the hsdr is used to gradually update area mean rainfall in each sub basin spatial distributed rainfall sdp and areal mean rainfall in whole basin amp respectively the proposed method is tested via a synthetic case and different real basins the results are encouraging including 1 the hsdr method with successive approximation can improve flood predictions by updating rainfall 2 the hsdr with iteration performs better than that without iteration 3 the hsdr sdp generally converges faster than the hsdr amp 4 the hsdr sdp outperforms the hsdr amp when enough observed discharge information is used for updating 5 the performance of the hsdr compared with the ar exhibits less deterioration when increasing lead time it is worthy to note that the hsdr method has a clear physical explanation related with the mechanism of hydrological process characterized by hydrological models to some extent the hsdr sdp can decompose the basin outlet discharge for error update in each sub basin the clear concept simple structure and stable performance of the hsdr make it a convenient and effective tool for real time flood forecasting the hsdr for error updating can better utilize real time observations for flood forecasting more attention will be paid to other variables updating by using the hsdr such as runoff and soil moisture it could enhance the hsdr performance and ultimately extend the understanding of error feedback in hydrologic process we will further examine the proposed method in different basins through various hydrological forecasting systems meanwhile quantifying the uncertainty of updated variables in conjunction with uncertainty estimation techniques would be a challenge in future works

4996,the differential response of hydrologic system hsdr can represent the relation between errors of model outputs and influencing variables which has been proposed for error correction in flood forecasting in this study the hsdr method with stepwise approximation is established to update areal mean rainfall in whole basin hsdr amp and spatial distributed rainfall in each sub basin hsdr sdp respectively the regularized least square algorithm is employed to calculate the solutions the performance of the proposed method on improving the predictions by the xinanjiang xaj model is

generally the performance of autoregressive ar technique becomes poorer due to poorer correlations between error series with increasing lead time bao et al 2011 there still needs the development of reliable error updating methods to issue good and stable performance with sufficient lead time for flood forecasting current error correction methods mainly focus on error series between observations and calculations e g chen et al 2013 leach et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 in error updating more attention needs to be paid to the physical base of hydrological process characterized by hydrological models the total differential has been widely applied in the field of error estimation the differential represents the principal part of the change in a function with respect to changes in the independent variables kirchner 2009 the differential response between the change of independent variables and dependent variables can reflect the inherent relation between the cause and the effect which is based on the physical mechanism of the adopted model hydrologic modelling uses the integration of hydrologic processes to determine watershed response singh and woolhiser 2002 in flood forecasting the differential response of hydrologic system hsdr can be used to derive the relation between errors of model outputs dependent variables and influencing factors independent variables producing the update of independent variables the error updating using the hsdr is a feedback process the dynamic system response curve dsrc method based on the hsdr has been used for runoff updating bao et al 2014 areal mean rainfall updating si et al 2015 state variables updating sun et al 2018a initial conditions sun et al 2018b and parameter estimation hendrickson et al 1988 bao et al 2013 qin et al 2017 the results demonstrate that the hsdr can improve flood predictions without increasing model complexity or model parameters the nonlinear hydrological relationship between the model outputs and variables is approximately characterized as simple first order taylor linearization in simple matrix forms in previous works little attention has been given to the errors caused by linearization of nonlinear system commonly a successive approximation approach can produce better inversion in the feedback problem this motivates us to investigate the performance of the hsdr method with and without stepwise approximation reducing errors and uncertainties on hydrological processes has been the focus in hydrological forecasting wagener and gupta 2005 kavetski et al 2006 liu and gupta 2007 rainfall is an important input of hydrological model that presents high uncertainty with great impact on model performance bertoni et al 1992 bárdossy and das 2008 nanda et al 2016 fraga et al 2019 adams and dymond 2019 flood forecasting requires observed rainfall data which may be rarely sufficient to capture spatial and temporal variability of rainfall at small scales singh 1997 silberstein 2006 villarini and krajewski 2008 mcmillan et al 2012 rainfall errors interact with rainfall runoff process resulting in error of flow simulation understanding the nature of streamflow response to rainfall is essential for flood forecasting coustau et al 2013 cristiano et al 2017 criss 2018 the difficulty arises due to the nonlinearity inherent in hydrological processes especially in spatial complexities of rainfall the informations contributed by all error sources are compressed into model outputs however it is difficult to decompose the residuals between observations and calculations to trace error sources for error correction bogner and kalas 2008 liu et al 2011 renard et al 2011 li et al 2017 errors in hydrograph properties are strongly correlated with errors in space time characteristics of precipitation mei et al 2017 extracting rainfall error from discharge residuals is important for flow updating in previous studies the hsdr was used to update areal mean value of variables in whole basins how to consider the spatial and temporal variability of updated variables in error updating is another problem that needs to be investigated this paper presents an extension of the hsdr method based on differential response of hydrologic rainfall runoff system for improving flood forecasting in this study we propose the hsdr with successive approximation to gradually update spatial distributed rainfall sdp and areal mean rainfall amp respectively the main contents include 1 a successive approximation approach for the hsdr is adopted 2 the comparison of spatial distributed rainfall sdp and areal mean rainfall amp updating by the hsdr is demonstrated through a synthetic case and real case studies 3 the performance of the hsdr and autoregressive technique ar with increasing lead time is analysed this work can provide an investigation of the hsdr on spatial and temporal error updating it could help improve real time flood forecasting flood control and disaster reduction 2 methodology 2 1 hydrologic system differential response method hsdr hydrological process of transforming rainfall to streamflow is commonly conceptualized as evaporation runoff generation flow concentration and flood routing every process in the hydrological process can be generalized as a single system and some related processes also can be regarded as a bigger system a flood forecasting model consisting of rainfall runoff and river flow routing models can be described as composition of a set of interconnected mathematical functions that contain variables and parameters a mathematical form of a nonlinear hydrologic system can be generalized as a complex function 1 q f i s θ where q is the time order model output dependent variable i is the vector of model inputs independent variable s is the vector of state variables independent variable θ is the vector of model parameters independent variable any change of variables i s and θ in eq 1 can affect the model outputs the first order partial derivative of eq 1 is written as 2 dq f i d i f s d s f θ d θ where f i is the differential response of model input variable f s is the differential response of model state variable f θ is the differential response of model parameter eq 2 represents the sum of the partial differentials with respect to all independent variables it shows that the variation of dependent variable is caused by the change of independent variables for simplicity and generality we take the differential response to one variable x as an example namely q f x t where t is the time eq 2 can be simplified as 3 dq f x x x c d x where x x 1 x 2 x n t is the time order model variable x c x c 1 x c 2 x cn t is the current best estimate of x q q 1 q 2 q m t is the observed output m is the data length of observed outputs used for updating n is the length of time order variable needed to be updated m n when the change of independent variable x is small enough the matrix form of eq 3 can be written as 4 δ q u δ x ξ where u f x 1 x 1 f x 1 x j f x 1 x n f x 2 x 1 f x 2 x j f x 2 x n f x m x 1 f x m x j f x m x n m n is the system differential response matrix δ q q o 1 q c 1 q o 2 q c 2 q om q cm q o q o 1 q o 2 q om t is the actual output q c q c 1 q c 2 q cm t is the calculated output δ x δ x 1 δ x 2 δ x n t is the estimated errors of variable x ξ ξ 1 ξ 2 ξ m t is the vector of residuals which generally obeys the white noise vector of zero mean value the u varies dynamically with the change of variables it can be simplified as u u 1 u j u n where u j f x 1 x j f x 2 x j f x m x j t represents the differential response due to the variable change at time j each term in the matrix u can be computed by differential approximation as 5 f x t x j f x 1 x j δ x j x n t t f x 1 x j x n t t δ x j using the regularized least square algorithm we can obtain the solution 6 δ x u t u β i 1 u t δ q where β is the regularization coefficient the updated variable x can be expressed as 7 x x c δ x in flood forecasting we can use real time residuals between calculated and observed discharges to update variables inputs or states or parameters the streamflow prediction can be improved by re running the hydrological model with updated variables 2 2 calculation procedure the rainfall runoff system represented by eq 1 is nonlinear and implicit it is difficult to calculate δ x from δ q for better inversion we suggest a successive approximation approach for the hsdr to reflect the differential response of the nonlinear system which is different from the previous studies bao et al 2014 si et al 2015 sun et al 2018a 2018b eq 6 can be rewritten as 8 δ x k u k t u k β i 1 u k t δ q k where the superscript k represents the number of iteration δ x k is the estimated error of x in the k iteration u k is the system differential response matrix in the k iteration δ q k q o q c k q c k is the calculated output in the k iteration the estimate of x can be rewritten as 9 x k 1 x k δ x k the calculation frame of the stepwise approximation approach for the hsdr is shown in fig 1 in the flowchart k is the iteration number qo is the observed discharge qc k and qcc k is the calculated discharge using the x k and perturbed x k plus with one unit x k 1 respectively in accordance with the frame the specific calculation procedure is described as follows step 1 calculate qc k and qcc k at the basin outlet using the adopted hydrologic model step 2 calculate the vector δq k and matrix u k step 3 determine the new estimated x k 1 using eqs 8 and 9 step 4 judge whether the x k 1 are optimal if they are the calculation ends otherwise go to step 1 and continue the followed steps the calculation procedure from step 1 to step 3 is used to calculate x k 1 step 4 is used to judge whether to carry the iteration theoretically with the successive iterations of steps 1 through 4 the estimated x k 1 will approach the actual representation of the variable the calculation without iteration by using steps 1 to 3 was adopted in previous works three predefined criteria can be commonly used to terminate iteration including the change of objective function convergence of updated variables and number of iteration in this study we use the root mean square error rmse as objective function if the value of rmse is not decreased in next five iterations the iteration ends 2 3 rainfall updating using hsdr in hydrological modelling using conceptual hydrological models such as the xinangjiang model zhao 1992 the study basin is commonly divided into a set of sub basins to represent spatial characteristics the outflow of each sub basin is routed to the outlet of whole basin the outflow discharge variations at the basin outlet are primarily caused by the changes of areal mean rainfall in each sub basin considering the hydrological response to rainfall the eq 1 can be simply written as 10 q f p 1 p 2 p s t where q is the discharge at the basin outlet p s p s 1 p s 2 p s n t is the areal mean rainfall series in the s sub basin s is the number of sub basins n is the length of the variable needed to be updated eq 10 determines how basin outlet discharge responds to rainfall inputs it also can be used to interpret how error accumulates from rainfall input to discharge outputs the updating of input variables can lead to state variables updating finally producing the improvement of flow prediction there are two ways to update rainfall by using the hsdr shown in fig 2 one is the areal mean rainfall updating in whole basin referred as hsdr amp shown in fig 2 a and another is the spatial distributed rainfall updating that gradually updates the areal mean rainfall in each sub basin referred as hsdr sdp shown in fig 2 b as shown in fig 2 a the differential response matrix u for the whole basin is calculated from the change of outlet discharge to the perturbations of areal mean rainfall in the whole basin the procedure of the hsdr amp mainly includes 1 generate a perturbed areal mean rainfall series by increasing the areal mean rainfall p i j i 1 to s at time j by one unit in the whole basin while keeping the rainfall at other time unchanged 2 input the perturbed areal mean rainfall series to the hydrological model to calculate flow series the response vector u j of the response matrix u for the whole basin can be computed that is the difference between calculated flows resulting from the perturbed rainfall and original rainfall 3 repeat steps 1 and 2 at different time and all the columns of matrix u u 1 u j u n are obtained thus the estimate of the incremental rainfall δ p for the whole basin can be calculated according to the area proportion of sub basin to whole basin the estimated areal mean rainfall in the i sub basin can be calculated 11 δ p i δ p η i i 1 t o s where η η 1 η 2 η s represents the sub basin area weight that is the area proportion of the sub basin to the whole basin as shown in fig 2 b the differential response matrix u for each sub basin is calculated according to the response of outlet discharge to rainfall change in the corresponding sub basin the procedure of the hsdr sdp mainly includes 1 increase rainfall at time j by one unit in the i sub basin while keeping the rainfall at other time in the sub basin and all rainfall in other sub basins unchanged 2 input the perturbed rainfall series to the model to calculate flow series the response matrix u j for the i sub basin at time j can be computed 3 repeat steps 1 and 2 at different time all the columns of matrix u u 1 u j u n for the i sub basin are obtained 4 estimate δ p by using the u for the sub basin and the estimate of δ p i for the sub basin can be calculated according to the area proportion of the sub basin to the whole basin 5 repeat steps 1 to 4 for different sub basins we can obtain the estimated areal mean rainfall in each sub basin the major differences between the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are the consideration of differential response matrix u for the whole basin or each sub basin and the assignment of the estimated incremental rainfall for each sub basin the u for whole basin is calculated in the hsdr amp while the u for each sub basin is calculated in the hsdr sdp in the hsdr sdp the information of residuals between observations and calculations can be decomposed to update spatial distributed rainfall in each sub basin compared with the hsdr amp the hsdr sdp can account for the impact of spatial distribution of rainfall on model output the hsdr amp without iteration was adopted in previous works si et al 2015 theoretically and practice confirms with enough observations the hsdr sdp updating can perform better due to the consideration of rainfall spatial distribution especially in basins with strongly uneven spatial distribution of rainfall 3 case study 3 1 study design the xinanjiang model xaj is adopted in this study to represent rainfall runoff process it has been extensively and successfully applied for flood forecasting and water resources planning in humid and semi humid regions in china e g yao et al 2009 lü et al 2013 lin et al 2014 bai et al 2017 the xaj model uses soil moisture storage capacity curve to represent spatial distribution of soil moisture storage capacity the study basin is usually divided into sub basins to capture spatial variability of precipitation evaporation and underlying surface the basic inputs of the xaj model are mean areal rainfall and evaporation in each sub basin the model output is streamflow at basin outlet this semi distributed modelling provides advantages over lumped modelling in representing the effect of spatially variable inputs and catchment properties the structure of the xaj model includes evaporation runoff generation runoff separation flow concentration and flood routing a three layer evapotranspiration scheme is used in evaporation module runoff production occurs on the repletion of storage capacity total runoff is divided into surface runoff interflow and groundwater runoff by a free reservoir three runoff components are routed through linear reservoirs respectively outflow from each sub basin is finally routed by the muskingum model to produce flow at the outlet of whole basin more specifications of the xaj model can be found in the following reference zhao 1992 the synthetic case and real case are conducted to demonstrate the performance of the hdsr on rainfall updating in flood predictions in the synthetic case different rainfall errors are set to test the suitability and effectiveness of the hsdr in different conditions in the real cases we illustrate the proposed hsdr sdp and hsdr amp in three basins with different rain gauge density and different flood characteristics the comparison of the hsdr updating with and without iteration is presented moreover the performances of the hsdr and the second order autoregressive technique ar with different lead time are compared the ar model has a simple structure minimal computational cost and distinct model improvement capacity which has been widely used in application the lead time in this study represents the time ahead of flood peak timing we set different lead times by using different number of observations for updating smaller lead time means more observations used for updating note that in this study the parameter values remain unchanged during both the prediction and updating processes m is set equal to n the regularization coefficient β is insensitive estimated as β 0 5 and model simulations are performed at hourly time steps 3 2 synthetic area and data we designed a typical watershed having drainage area of 1000 km2 with five rain gauges the basin is divided into five sub basins each sub basin has one rain gauge and the area weight for each sub basin is 0 21 0 19 0 18 0 16 and 0 26 respectively synthetic case suffers from little uncertainties as the model structure and parameters boundary conditions input and output and other related information are assumed known the areal mean rainfall data for each sub basin are represented by synthetic true point measurements at corresponding rain gauge the synthetic rainfall data are generated corresponding to an actual flood event the synthetic true river flow data are generated by running the xaj model with the synthetic rainfall parameters and initial states note that no errors exist in the true input and output data to investigate the impact of data errors on the performance of hsdr method simulation experiments are repeated using corrupted rainfall data the corruption is set by introducing three types of errors described below the areal mean rainfall data with different errors referred as a b and c are shown in fig 3 from scenarios a to c the rainfall errors are set from simpler to more complex series scenario a the rainfall errors are assumed to be constant in space and time the synthetic true rainfall data in each sub basin are added with the same spatial temporal error of 0 5 mm scenario b the rainfall errors are assumed to be time variable and space invariable the synthetic true rainfall data in each sub basin are added with the same time variable zero mean error series scenario c the rainfall errors are assumed to be spatial temporal variable the synthetic true rainfall data in each sub basin are added with different time variable non zero mean error series 3 3 real area and data the baishuikeng bsk reservoir basin dapoling dpl basin and shaowu sw basin in china fig 4 are selected to evaluate the performance of the proposed hsdr method on flood forecasting updating the characteristics of these basins are summarized in table 1 the bsk hydrographs are serrated because the observed reservoir inflow discharges are calculated according to the reservoir water level and outflow discharge most of the dpl floods rise rapidly with single peak most of the sw hydrographs have multi peaks the bsk dpl and sw basins are divided into 7 sub basins 13 sub basins and 9 sub basins by using the thiessen polygon method respectively measured rainfall pan evaporation and discharge data are provided by the local hydrological bureau the xaj model parameters are calibrated by using historical daily data and hourly data during flood events 3 4 evaluation measures the absolute relative peak error arpe root mean square error rmse and nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 are employed to evaluate the model performance they are calculated as follows absolute relative peak error 12 arpe q c p q p q p 100 root mean square error 13 rmse t 1 n q c t q t 2 n nash sutcliffe efficiency 14 nse 1 t 1 n q c t q t 2 t 1 n q t q 2 where qp and qcp represent the observed and calculated peak discharge respectively q t and qc t represent the observed and calculated discharge at time t respectively n is the length of observations for one flood event q is the mean value of the observations for one flood event 4 results and discussions 4 1 synthetic case results the results for scenarios a b c by the hsdr rainfall updating with successive approximation are shown in fig 5 and some hydrographs are shown in fig 6 the results by the xaj model without updating are referred as xaj that by using areal mean rainfall updating referred as amp and that by using spatial distributed rainfall updating in each sub basin referred as sdp in is the number of iteration in fig 6 p is the rainfall with errors and qobs is the synthetic true discharge the results for amp and sdp with different number m of observations used for updating are suffixed by amp m and sdp m respectively as expected the hsdr can improve the xaj predictions from fig 5 in scenarios a and c and scenario b when m 11 the rmse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are decreased the nse values are increased and the arpe values are mainly reduced as fig 5 a and 5 b show in both scenarios a and b with space invariable errors the performances of the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are similar when m 12 the rmse for the hsdr amp are smaller than that for the hsdr sdp indicating that the hsdr sdp is not superior to the hsdr amp when updating space invariable errors as fig 5 c shows in the scenario c with spatial temporal rainfall errors when m 14 the rmse 5 4 m3 s for the hsdr sdp is marginally smaller than that 5 9 m3 s for the hsdr amp it indicates that with enough observed discharge data used for updating the hsdr sdp can perform better to update spatial temporal rainfall errors fig 6 also shows that the more observed data used for updating the better the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp perform to some extent the hsdr sdp can enhance information utilization by decomposing the outlet discharges for updating rainfall in each sub basin moreover the iterations for the hsdr sdp are generally less than the ones for hsdr amp indicating that the hsdr sdp converges faster than the hsdr amp 4 2 real case results the evaluation measure results are shown in fig 7 for the bsk basin fig 10 for the dpl basin and fig 13 for the sw basin some hydrographs are displayed in fig 8 for the bsk fig 11 for the dpl and fig 14 for the sw the mean evaluation measures for all events with different lead time are shown in fig 9 for the bsk fig 12 for the dpl and fig 15 for the sw the results suffixed by amp and sdp are obtained without iteration as expected the results for the hsdr sdp and hsdr amp are improved compared with the original results using the xaj from fig 7 a for the bsk fig 10 a for the dpl and fig 13 a for the sw the rmse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are smaller than those for the xaj and the nse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp are larger than those for the xaj the results for the hsdr sdp are generally superior to those using the hsdr amp shown in figs 7 b 10 b and 13 b the rmse values for the hsdr sdp are generally smaller than those for the hsdr amp and the nse values for the hsdr sdp are generally greater than those for the hsdr amp the iterations for the hsdr sdp are generally smaller than those for the hsdr amp figs 7 c 10 c and 13 c show that the results for the hsdr with iteration are better than those without iteration the rmse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp with iteration are smaller than those without it and the nse values for the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp with iteration are greater than those without it the hydrographs by the hsdr sdp are better matched to the observed as figs 8 11 and 14 display the simulations by the hsdr sdp generally agree well with the observations and the hsdr sdp can better capture flood peaks from the rmse values in figs 9 12 and 15 the hsdr sdp outperforms the hsdr amp in the bsk when the lead time smaller than 2 h in the dpl when the lead time smaller than 5 h and in the sw when the lead time smaller than 8 h according to the collected historical floods the average duration from the beginning of the flood to the time of flood peak is 34 6 h in the bsk 36 3 h in the dpl and 61 1 h in the sw which can affect the data length of observations used for updating with different lead time generally with more reliable observed information used for updating the hsdr sdp can perform better due to the consideration of spatial distribution of rainfall in comparison with the ar the hsdr performance decreases slowly with increasing lead time from fig 9 the performance of the ar and hsdr sdp decreases faster than hsdr amp when the lead time is extended when the lead time is greater than 2 h in figs 12 and 4h in fig 15 the ar performs poorer than the hsdr sdp and hsdr amp it indicates that the hsdr is more robust than the ar on streamflow updating with increasing lead time it also can be seen that the iterations for the hsdr sdp are fewer than those for the hsdr amp moreover it is found that there exists large error around flood peak by using the ar which may be due to poor correlation between the discharges around flood peak the real case results above show that the hsdr sdp and hsdr amp can improve the xaj model predictions the hsdr approach is effective with strong convergence and stable performance the hsdr sdp with enough observations used for updating generally can perform better than the hsdr amp 4 3 discussions the synthetic and real case studies demonstrate that the hydrologic system differential response hsdr can improve discharge predictions by updating rainfall the error updating based on the hsdr can utilize the conservation and response laws for describing hydrological characteristics in hydrological models one of the most important contributions of this study is the simple successive approximation approach for the hsdr another important contribution is the updating of spatial and temporal rainfall using the hsdr the solution of the hsdr is an inverse problem it is difficult to invert the change of independent variables from dependent variables in a highly nonlinear rainfall runoff system in this study the first order partial derivative is adopted to represent the hydrological response to the change of variables for better inversion a successive approximation approach for the hsdr is employed to reduce the effect of the linearization of nonlinear system in the study the hsdr through a few iterations can yield better improvement of model outputs we use the rmse as objective function for iteration termination which cannot guarantee that the peak error can be improved for all flood events in the study case the arpe for some flood events are not improved different objectives may prefer different estimated errors of updated variable although the optimal estimate of independent variables is beyond the scope of this paper further works could be devoted to use multi objective functions considering both rmse and arpe for optimal estimation and investigate the convergence in this inversion problem quantifying model error is a difficult task although the hsdr cannot directly quantify the influence of spatial errors on flood forecasting the hsdr sdp can account for the effect of spatial and temporal variability in rainfall updating on hydrological response through the differential response matrix u for each sub basin compared with the hsdr amp using the matrix u for the whole basin the hsdr sdp with more reliable observations used for updating can better improve flood predictions in the program the matrix u is 2 dimensional represented as u m n for the hsdr amp while it is 3 dimensional represented as u m n s for the hsdr sdp with increasing lead time the performances of the hsdr amp and hsdr sdp degrade slowly in comparison with the ar technique overall the study results show that the hsdr sdp can achieve better performance than the hsdr amp nevertheless the hsdr amp outperforms the hsdr sdp in the bsk when the lead time greater than 2 h in the dpl when the lead time greater than 5 h and in the sw when the lead time greater than 8 h in a basin longer lead time means fewer observations can be used for error updating it indicates that the hsdr sdp needs enough reliable observed information for updating to produce satisfactory results the hsdr performance varies with basins in the real case in basins with large flow concentration time and sparse density raingauge such as the sw basin fig 15 we recommend the hsdr sdp with stepwise approximation for long lead time predictions in basins with short flow concentration time and high density raingauge such as the dpl basin fig 12 the hsdr amp can obtain better results with long lead time in reservoir basin such as the bsk fig 9 the hsdr amp can obtain better results for reservoir inflow correction it is difficult and practically impossible to observe the actual reservoir inflow the reservoir inflow calculated according to reservoir water level and outflow discharge is commonly regarded as observed inflow the observed inflow hydrographs usually display large fluctuations fig 8 possibly involved errors even though the serrated observed inflow in reservoir basins can affect the performance of the hsdr the hsdr amp method can improve reservoir inflow forecasting model output errors are contributed by many sources such as model inputs model structure parameters states and initial conditions in the case studies we use the hsdr to update rainfall it may be inappropriate to attribute all the errors to the error of rainfall resulting in model inputs to compensate for all the errors the hsdr performance depends on whether the errors of updated variable are the primary cause of discrepancy between observed and computed streamflow there exist many errors in hydrological modelling that we cannot quantify from the rmse values in figs 9 12 and 15 the ar performs better for the 1 hr prediction in the bsk and dpl basins and for the 1 hr 2 hr and 3 hr predictions in the sw basin it is possible due to that the ar technique takes all errors into consideration from a black box perspective updating of input variables is the classical method justified by the fact that input uncertainties may often be the dominant error source in operational forecasting the hsdr method also can be extended to adjust other variables such as runoff soil moisture parameter and state producing reasonable flood forecasting results it can improve the understanding of how basin responds to related variables meanwhile more attention should be devoted to the data quality and computation in general the proposed hsdr method has the potential to improve real time flood forecasting without increasing model complexity or model parameters the updating procedure can be adapted from one forecast to the next without any need for user intervention it is highly suitable for real time applications in the study case the iterations of the stepwise approximation for the hsdr are fewer than 10 for most events figs 5 7 9 10 12 13 and 15 the updating procedure has small amount of calculation in applications the computing time is associated with the length of updated variable n the number of sub basins s the number of iteration in and the complexity of the adopted hydrological model the hsdr method is general and can be applied to other models including lumped quasi distributed models and fully distributed models moreover the hsdr without stepwise approximation also can improve model predictions for computationally intensive models if necessary we can choose the hsdr without iteration we will further demonstrate the enhanced method using more hydrologic models in other basins and gain some insight into the level of model complexity suitable for error correction using the hsdr in flood forecasting in general the shortcomings of the proposed method mainly includes 1 the hsdr performance depends on whether the updated variable is the main cause of discrepancy between observed and computed streamflow due to that the hsdr attributes all the errors to the error of adjusted variables 2 the hsdr performance is considerably affected by the observations used for updating this problem exists in any error correction technique theoretically a longer set of reliable observation data used for updating should achieve a better improvement on predictions although the hsdr performance is limited by the main causes of errors and the length of observations used for updating the study provides a promising approach for error correction 5 conclusions the differential is widely used in the field of error estimation the differential response of hydrologic system hsdr can be used to represent the relation between errors of model outputs and influencing variables we present an extensive effort to enhance the hsdr with successive approximation for flood forecasting in practical applications in this study the hsdr is used to gradually update area mean rainfall in each sub basin spatial distributed rainfall sdp and areal mean rainfall in whole basin amp respectively the proposed method is tested via a synthetic case and different real basins the results are encouraging including 1 the hsdr method with successive approximation can improve flood predictions by updating rainfall 2 the hsdr with iteration performs better than that without iteration 3 the hsdr sdp generally converges faster than the hsdr amp 4 the hsdr sdp outperforms the hsdr amp when enough observed discharge information is used for updating 5 the performance of the hsdr compared with the ar exhibits less deterioration when increasing lead time it is worthy to note that the hsdr method has a clear physical explanation related with the mechanism of hydrological process characterized by hydrological models to some extent the hsdr sdp can decompose the basin outlet discharge for error update in each sub basin the clear concept simple structure and stable performance of the hsdr make it a convenient and effective tool for real time flood forecasting the hsdr for error updating can better utilize real time observations for flood forecasting more attention will be paid to other variables updating by using the hsdr such as runoff and soil moisture it could enhance the hsdr performance and ultimately extend the understanding of error feedback in hydrologic process we will further examine the proposed method in different basins through various hydrological forecasting systems meanwhile quantifying the uncertainty of updated variables in conjunction with uncertainty estimation techniques would be a challenge in future works

4997,combined with human activities rainfall events have become an important factor affecting the urban ecological environment particularly in karst areas where the ecosystem is fragile and more affected by pollution due to the frequent water exchange to understand the fate of nitrogen in karst urban rivers samples were collected under various rainfall events classified in four different hydrological conditions the concentration of nitrogenous species water isotopes and nitrate dual isotopes were measured the results showed that nitrate was the primary inorganic nitrogen 70 in most of the samples the nitrate isotopic signature and hydrochemistry suggested that volatilization and denitrification enriched the isotopic composition during low flow conditions 20 0 8 0 while a high

even lead to rocky desertification jiang et al 2014 liu 2007 the frequent exchange of surface water and groundwater transport pollutants to the underground stream which will extend the effect over time and area once the karst aquifer is polluted it will be a threat to sustaining the development of social life and the economy lang et al 2006 this will be more serious in highly urbanized karstic networking rivers during the frequently extreme rainfall events combining a high intensity of pollutant export and rapid hydrological response to pollutant transport liu et al 2006 ming et al 2020 thus it is very valuable to elucidate the nitrogen transformation and influencing factors in this complex and fragile ecosystem urban runoff is imported by the formed surface runoff and flushed pollutants during rainfall events liu et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a this kind of runoff in a karst area can quickly transport water and pollutants into the river through the urban pipe network system and the karst aquifer network through karst fissures huang et al 2020 yang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b zhong et al 2018 subsequently pollutants are transported to the lower reaches of rivers or the underground hydrological system of cities causing groundwater nitrogen pollution furthermore high intensity anthropologic export and artificial facilitation in urban rivers can accelerate the nutrients biogeochemical processes liu et al 2018 huang et al 2017 however until now studies on nitrate pollution have been mainly conducted in karst agricultural areas and large rivers li et al 2019 yue et al 2019 whereas n fate in high intensity disturbance of urban rivers was rarely reported particularly in karst areas hale et al 2014 zhang et al 2020a potential nitrogen sources included atmospheric deposition and domestic wastewater in the urban area divers et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 while synthetic fertilizer and soil organic nitrogen may also contribute in the peri urban area owing to the isotopic fractionation and distinguishing the isotopic composition of varied sources the isotopic approach has been used to trace the nitrate sources nikolenko et al 2017 xue et al 2009 however the distribution of δ15n no3 values may overlap among different sources for example if nitrate derived from domestic sewage 8 25 δ15n no3 is higher than that from synthetic fertilizers 4 4 jiang et al 2009 li et al 2010 furthermore since the photochemical oxidation reactions are involved during nitrate production in atmospheric deposition δ18o no3 is higher than 60 kendall et al 2007 zeng et al 2019 thus coupling with the δ18o no3 the source of no3 from atmospheric deposition can separate to the nitrified nitrate xue et al 2009 the karstic urban area comprised natural conduit and artificial drainage pipe systems jiang et al 2014 mcgrane 2016 thus the fate of n during rainfall events in karstic urban rivers may be affected by anthropologic factors and display behaviors

of n characteristics nitrogenous species water chemistry water isotopes and nitrate dual isotopes were analyzed during various rainfall events or the hydrological condition of urban rivers nanming river sw china the objective of this study is to present the longitudinal variations under rainfall events to infer the dominant processes and the major sources of no3 and to determine the response of the source to the hydrology of the karstic urban river this will provide a scientific basis for the sustainable development of ecology of water quality in the urban karstic river ecosystem 2 study area and methods 2 1 study area guiyang the capital of guizhou province is characterized by diverse karst landforms and is a typical large city in the karst region with an urban population of about 3 5 million and an urban population density of approximately 7670 people km2 liu et al 2006 zhong et al 2018 the nanming river is the main river in the urban area of guiyang with a drainage area of approximately 1422 km2 fig 1 this river originates from huaxi town and flows through guiyang city from southwest to northeast fig 1 there are two tributaries the xiaoche river t1 and the shixi river t2 the xiaoche river originated from the aha reservoir which provides drinking water to the city and is less affected by human activity the shixi river flowing through the urban area of guiyang is severely affected by urban activity zhong et al 2018 the climate of the study area is subtropical monsoon with an average annual temperature of 16 c and precipitation of about 1200 mm with about 80 precipitation in the summer season liu et al 2006 xiao et al 2013 2 2 sampling campaigns to avoid the slight variability of hydrological conditions due to continuous rainfall the sampling period is selected from august to october which is in the late stage of the rainy season with occasional rainfall events during the sampling period the average temperature was 19 7 and the cumulative total rainfall from august to october was 283 4 mm zhong et al 2018 eight sampling campaigns s1 s8 were conducted based on rainfall events and hydrological condition changes sampling sites were distributed in the peri urban area in the upper reaches of the river m1 before the river flows into the urban area the urban area m2 m5 and the lower reaches of the river m6 m8 2 3 sampling and analyses water samples were collected at eight mainstream sites m1 to m8 and two tributary sites t1 and t2 over 10 h fig 1 to avoid any biological effect water samples were filtered through 0 22 µm filter paper

casciotti 2011 isotopic analysis of the n2o product was performed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer after purification using a trace gas pre concentrator unit mcilvin and casciotti 2011 for calibration four international nitrate usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea n3 and experimental reference materials were treated identically as the filtered water samples the analytical precision for the

processing and drawing use excel 2010 and origin 8 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 water isotopes in various rainfall conditions in karstic urban rivers fig 2 shows the rainfall variation during eight sampling campaigns corresponding to the variation of rainfall water isotopes of river samples also showed significant variation responding to hydrological conditions particularly in s6 the variation of water isotopes between different samplings suggested the water sources varied in response to rainfall condition the water isotopes in heavy rainfall during s6 can separate to seven others sampling campaigns indicating the high contribution from rainwater although the accumulated rainfall within three days during s7 is low the short time interval about five days implied an overlap effect between s7 and s6 this can be observed from the water isotopic signature which suggested a high rainwater contribution during s7 thus s7 may be affected by s6 this similar situation was also observed in s8 from water isotopes which were higher than samples in s6 and s7 but still lower than in the other five campaigns except for these three campaigns water isotopes of the other five sampling campaigns samples appeared more concentrated fig 3 however the accumulated rainfall during these five campaigns was varied particularly the accumulated rainfall for three days 20 mm with higher rainfall in s1and s4 than in s2 s3 and s5 based on water isotopes and the variation of antecedent or accumulated rainfall the hydrologic condition can be classified into four different hydrologic conditions low rainfall event s2 s3 and s5 moderate rainfall event s1 and s4 high rainfall event s6 and later of successive rainfall event s7 and s8 corresponding to low moderate high and moderately high flow conditions the deuterium excess d excess δd 8 δ18o h2o can indicate the contribution of evaporated moisture gat et al 1994 the mean of d excess value during four hydrology conditions was lower than 10 and the concomitant decrease in rainfall intensity ranging from 8 4 1 9 during s6 to 6 2 2 0 during low flow conditions indicating the effect of evaporation the high temperature during low flow conditions mean 23 8 has a more significant influence on the evaporation than in high flow conditions 12 5 additionally the spatial variability of water isotopes showed large variation after the mixing of tributaries t1 the ph values ranged from 6 8 to 8 4 89 samples between 7 5 and 8 0 which is weakly alkaline although altitude drop is less than 20 m within the study area an inflatable rubber dam was installed to enhance river air exchange huang et al 2017 dissolved oxygen ranged from 2 2 to 11 5 mg l and the average value of do concentration at each site was higher than 5 0 mg l which suggested that oxygen conditions are good for biological activities 3 2 temporal and spatial variation of nitrogen concentration in karst urban rivers in various rainfall conditions among all the main stream samples about 83 6 of samples contained no3 n accounting for more than 70 of the inorganic nitrogen in the samples most samples 80 had no3 n concentrations higher than 2 0 mg l table s1 which is similar to a previous study in this river liu et al 2006 the average values of no2 n and nh4 n in the four hydrologic conditions were between 0 32 and 0 69 mg l and 0 05 and 0 70 mg l respectively therefore no3 n is the main nitrogen containing inorganic compound in rivers fig s1 the average value of no3 n is 11 2 18 6 mg l n 8 in the main stream under high flow conditions reached the low average value of 4 9 2 7 mg l n 8 during the moderately high flow condition fig s3 din has the same pattern to no3 n under various flow conditions din and no3 n during high flow conditions were significantly greater than the other three conditions and indicated that urban surface runoff and drainage pipes may be a potential n source the no3 n value in the main stream is higher than that of two tributaries except for no3 n in the t2 water sample under low flow conditions s2 also no3 n at the urban tributary t2 is higher than the upper reaches tributary t1 this indicated that human interference during low flow condition is more significant in detail no3 n at m2 s3 and m8 s5 during low flow conditions were greater than 30 mg l while the maximum 56 9 mg l was observed at m8 during high flow conditions fig 4 however the short time interval and antecedently successive rainfall during s6 and s7 would result in the source being limited as the continuous flush effect would be more significant in an impervious urban area nitasha and sanjiv 2015 peter et al 2020 for example the low no3 n at mainstream sites particularly in the urban areas m2 m6 during moderate high flow conditions s7 were observed the responding no3 n to various flow conditions demonstrated that nitrogen sources in the studied urban area can mobilize nitrate during high flow conditions and counteract the dilution effect and present high no3 n compared to other urban rivers the average no3 n 6 6 mg l in the present study is similar to another high frequency study in germany where leaky infrastructure processes to the karst aquifer were observed grimmeisen et al 2016 but higher than other studies either in non karst urban river studies e g beijing tianjin divers et al 2013 peters et al 2019 yue et al 2010 zhang et al 2015a or other karst urban river studies zhang et al 2020a these high no3 n implied that a vast quantity of wastewater may contribute to and increase no3 n in the present study divers et al 2013 mcgrane 2016 3 3 temporal and spatial variation characteristics of nitrate isotopic composition in karst urban rivers under different rainfall conditions δ15n no3 ranged from 3 6 to 47 6 in approximately 80 of samples n 50 between 10 and 25 the δ15n no3 during high flow conditions showed great variation while little variation occurred during moderate flow conditions fig 4 moreover the high average value of δ15n no3 was observed during low flow conditions 20 0 8 0 moderate flow conditions and moderately high flow conditions have a similar mean value of 15 3 7 7 and 15 8 7 2 respectively which is lower than the high flow condition 18 6 11 4 δ18o no3 and have a wide range of 22 2 to 17 7 which is about 84 0 n 50 sample within 5 and 10 the variety of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the peri urban area was less than in the urban area and downstream the average value of δ15n no3 increased from the upper reaches to the urban area and then decreased in the lower reaches fig s4 compared with δ15n no3 the spatial variability of δ18o no3 value was marginal fig s4 the mean values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in this study are similar to those of the urban river of beijing liu et al 2018 but it varied in the large rivers e g the xijiang river li et al 2019 and the rhine river in germany johannsen et al 2008 indicating that high anthropologic n originated from the urban system additionally these nitrate isotopic signatures in the present study were significantly higher than a previous no rainfall event study in the surface water in guiyang liu et al 2006 which suggested that n transport has been accelerated during rainfall event in karst area zhang et al 2019 previous study in a karstic agricultural catchment showed that n sources during rainfall events varied significantly from 0 6 to 14 2 for δ15n no3 and 3 2 to 7 0 for δ18o no3 yue et al 2020 these varied isotopic signatures demonstrated that the dynamic n sources during rainfall events in urban systems showed more diversity than in other ecosystems e g agricultural and forest catchment 3 4 process of nitrogen transformation in karst rivers under different rainfall conditions the relatively high δ15n no3 suggested that the source with high nitrogen isotopic signature may contribute more during rainfall events in the present study additionally nitrogen transformations such as volatilization nitrification and denitrification may also affect nitrate isotopic composition kendall et al 2007 for example the equilibrium and kinetic fractionation during volatilization would result in an overall fractionation effect of 20 35 billy et al 2010 wells et al 2015 although δ15n nh4 was not measured and cannot evaluate the role of volatilization the volatilization affected by the alkaline ph 89 of samples between 7 5 and 8 0 and high temperature cannot be underestimated in the role of volatilization to δ15n no3 fig s2 it may be obvious in the enrichment between waste 7 0 3 2 liu et al 2006 and river samples 20 during low flow conditions with a mean t 23 8 the level of do saturation can be improved by the installed inflatable rubber dam owing to the enhanced river air exchange even in the low flow condition the excessive organic matter input during rainfall would utilize the do thereby accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and subsequent nitrification the negative relationship do and no2 r2 0 42 p less than 0 01 during rainfall events s6 s7 and s8 revealed that oxygen was utilized during the decomposition of organic matter and accumulated no2 in riverine systems during nitrification generally oxygen atoms of no3 formed by nitrification come from o2 in the atmosphere and the ratio of oxygen atoms in water soil water is 1 2 kendall et al 2007 then the calculated value of δ18o no3 by nitrification should range from 0 83 to 3 6 using δ18o h2o value 13 0 to 6 4 which is higher than half of the measured samples but lower than 20 of samples additionally nitrification and denitrification can result in obvious isotopic fractionation of 14 8 and 5 40 respectively kendall et al 2007 thus isotopic fractionation during nitrification may not affect the nitrate isotopic composition as low nh4 concentration during rainfall events that indicated complete nitrification studies found that exchange of oxygen atoms between no2 and h2o included kinetic and equilibrium isotopic fractionation and presented the above ratio to be greater than 1 2 even lower than the δ18o h2o boshers et al 2019 snider et al 2010 although there is no significant relationship between δ18o no3 value and the ratio of no2 din in all samples a negative relationship can be found during moderately high flow conditions particularly in s8 r2 0 8 p 0 01 the pulsed nitrification was observed under both the laboratory and field conditions as triggered by soil rewetting yu and elliott 2017 this demonstrated that mineralization of flushed sewage or soil occurred during transportation in the river channel and oxygen exchange during nitrification is more obvious after a rainfall event although the fluctuant of water level was not observed during rainfall events the obvious water isotope signature suggested in situ assimilation process could ignore due to the fast response to rainfal events in karst area zhang et al 2019 yue et al 2020 furthermore there is no longitudinal increase in nitrate dual isotopes but significantly high isotopic values were observed at discrete sites which indicated denitrification may occur in the local environment particularly during low flow conditions fig 4 subsequently this denitrification signature may be masked by the mixing processes with nitrate production by nitrification mayer et al 2002 overall the n transformations in this karst urban river during rainfall events appeared highly heterogeneous 3 5 nitrogen sources in karst urban rivers under various flow conditions the knowledge of the specific sources contributing can help to implement of source controlling müller et al 2020 the relatively high nitrate dual isotopes suggested that the source with high nitrogen isotopic signature e g domestic waste may contribute more during rainfall events in the present study the high cl can be used as an important indicator of urban human input and domestic sewage discharge liu et al 2006 widory et al 2005 cl and no3 n showed a gradual increase from the upper reaches to the lower reaches fig s3 in contrast to urban area sites cl at m1 and t1 were low indicating low inputs of wastewater however cl and no3 n increased more at the urban area sites m2 m5 owing to the increasing inputs of wastewater cl and no3 n in the lower reaches were slightly higher than urban area sites compared with t1 and t2 which also indicated more serious pollution generally nitrate derived from synthetic fertilizers has a high concentration and high no3 cl conversely the cl content is high and the no3 n cl ratio is low in domestic wastewater animal excrement and domestic sewage as highly organic matter liu et al 2006 ming et al 2020 widory et al 2005 as shown in fig 5 the sampling sites in this study were mainly affected by domestic wastewater in the case of moderate flow conditions and high flow conditions the no3 n cl and cl values of each sampling point have smaller changes than in low flow conditions this showed that the different rainfall conditions make the river water mix well especially in the case of high flow conditions fig 5b previous studies found that wet deposition during storm events can be up to 71 divers et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 however the no3 n in rainwater is typically less than 0 5 mg l in the karst area xiao et al 2013 zeng et al 2020 was lower than that in the mainstream and tributaries combining with the high δ15n and low δ18o no3 signature wet deposition was not the primary source in this urban river even in high flow conditions s6 the high δ15n no3 values fig 6 suggested nitrate derived from sewage which has high δ15n no3 values greater than 25 widory et al 2005 compared to the other study the high population density in the present study determined huge sewage derived sources particularly in urban areas although cropland was distributed on the upper reaches of the river there was no significant hydrological response observed in agricultural catchment yue et al 2018 thus the low wet deposition contribution and high sewage derived source contribution indicated the great human impact in the study area 3 6 response of nitrogen in karst urban rivers to rainfall impervious landscape and artificial drainage networks in the urban area expedited the mobilization of pollutants through increased surface runoff and hydraulic efficiency mcgrane 2016 müller et al 2020 as a vulnerable leaching urban runoff facilitates dramatic changes to the pathways and timing of nitrate transport additionally the frequent exchange of surface and subsurface flow paths in the karst area should increase the flux of contaminants transference into the receiving water considering various rainfall conditions it is notable that no3 n concentration showed increases first with the accumulated rainfall and reaches a certain peak and then decreases fig 7 a indicating a nitrate pattern dependent on the antecedent rainfall with the rainfall flushing effect nitrate mobilized accumulated particle matter on impervious architecture and sewage waste in the artificial drainage networks from the urban area particularly when experiencing a long period of dry conditions mcgrane 2016 yang and toor 2016 it can be observed the relationship between no3 n and accumulated rainfall within three days can fit by polynomial the increase no3 n accompanying the elevation accumulated rainfall 60 mm in this study demonstrated that rainwater flushed has significantly enhanced the urban river s n sources both in the urban area m5 and the peri urban area m1 however high accumulated rainfall more than 110 mm in this study showed the reduction of no3 n indicating sources controlling and diluting the effect during high flow conditions however this hydrological response was not observed on δ15n no3 e g the peri urban area m1 fig 7b the large variety of δ15n no3 at the urban area site during low flow conditions presented varied sources and transformation information e g denitrification whereas high rainfall derived more sources information 4 conclusion this study investigated the behaviour of nitrogen under various rainfall events in a karstic urban river water chemistry and nitrate concentration indicated n pollution was more severe during rainfall events no3 n is the main form of soluble inorganic nitrogen in the studied river additionally no3 n concentration showed response to accumulated rainfall within three days rising during rainfall below 60 mm and falling during high rainfall above 110 mm the isotopic signature suggested the primary n sources have high δ15n no3 values demonstrating sewage waste contribution particularly under high flow conditions moreover volatilization and denitrification were more likely to occur during low flow conditions and affect nitrate isotopic composition oxygen exchange during rapid nitrification was observed during high flow conditions and moderately high flow conditions overall n transformation during various hydrological condition showed more activation which produced nitrate and elevated the concentration even under high flow conditions more studied should understand which flow paths may transport urban pollutants during rainfall events karst urban river need effective management as the frequent exchange of the high intensity of anthropogenic

4997,combined with human activities rainfall events have become an important factor affecting the urban ecological environment particularly in karst areas where the ecosystem is fragile and more affected by pollution due to the frequent water exchange to understand the fate of nitrogen in karst urban rivers samples were collected under various rainfall events classified in four different hydrological conditions the concentration of nitrogenous species water isotopes and nitrate dual isotopes were measured the results showed that nitrate was the primary inorganic nitrogen 70 in most of

isotopic signature during high flow conditions suggested an anthropologic source e g domestic waste a response between accumulated rainfall and nitrate concentration in the studied urban karstic river

casciotti 2011 isotopic analysis of the n2o product was performed using an isotope ratio mass spectrometer after purification using a trace gas pre concentrator unit mcilvin and casciotti 2011 for calibration four international nitrate usgs 32 usgs 34 usgs 35 and iaea n3 and experimental reference materials were treated identically as the filtered water samples the analytical precision for the samples analyzed in duplicate was 0 3 for δ15n and 0 5 for δ18o of nitrate since some samples have low no3 concentration about 79 of the samples n 63 were measured δ15n and δ18o the samples used for

processing and drawing use excel 2010 and origin 8 0 software 3 results and discussion 3 1 water isotopes in various rainfall conditions in karstic urban rivers fig 2 shows the rainfall variation during eight sampling campaigns corresponding to the variation of rainfall water isotopes of river samples also showed significant variation responding to hydrological conditions particularly in s6 the variation of water isotopes between different samplings suggested the water sources varied in response to rainfall condition the water isotopes in heavy rainfall during s6 can separate to seven others sampling campaigns indicating the high contribution from rainwater although the accumulated rainfall within three days during s7 is low the short time interval about five days implied an overlap effect between s7 and s6 this can be observed from the water isotopic signature which suggested a high rainwater contribution during s7 thus s7 may be affected by s6 this similar situation was also observed in s8 from water isotopes which were higher than samples in s6 and s7 but still lower than in the other five campaigns except for these three campaigns water isotopes of the other five sampling campaigns samples appeared more concentrated fig 3 however the accumulated rainfall during these five campaigns was varied particularly the accumulated rainfall for three days 20 mm with higher rainfall in s1and s4 than in s2 s3 and s5 based on water isotopes and the variation of antecedent or accumulated rainfall the hydrologic condition can be classified into four different hydrologic conditions low rainfall event s2 s3 and s5 moderate rainfall event s1 and s4 high rainfall event s6 and later of successive rainfall event s7 and s8 corresponding to low moderate high and moderately high flow conditions the deuterium excess d excess δd 8 δ18o h2o can indicate the contribution of evaporated moisture gat et al 1994 the mean of d excess value during four hydrology conditions was lower than 10 and the concomitant decrease in rainfall intensity ranging from 8 4 1 9 during s6 to 6 2 2 0 during low flow conditions indicating the effect of evaporation the high temperature during low flow conditions mean 23 8 has a more significant influence on the evaporation than in high flow conditions 12 5 additionally the spatial variability of water isotopes showed large variation after the mixing of tributaries t1 the ph values ranged from 6 8 to 8 4 89 samples between 7 5 and 8 0 which is weakly alkaline although altitude drop is less than 20 m within the study area an inflatable rubber dam was installed to enhance river air exchange huang et al 2017 dissolved oxygen ranged from 2 2 to 11 5 mg l and the average value of do concentration at each site was higher than 5 0 mg l which suggested that oxygen conditions are good for biological activities 3 2 temporal and spatial variation of nitrogen concentration in karst urban rivers in various rainfall conditions among all the main stream samples about 83 6 of samples contained no3 n accounting for more than 70 of the inorganic nitrogen in the samples most samples 80 had no3 n concentrations higher than 2 0 mg l table s1 which is similar to a previous study in this river liu et al 2006 the average values of no2 n and nh4 n in the four hydrologic conditions were between 0 32 and 0 69 mg l and 0 05 and 0 70 mg l respectively therefore no3 n is the main nitrogen containing inorganic compound in rivers fig s1 the average value of no3 n is 11 2 18 6 mg l n 8 in the main stream under high flow conditions reached the low average value of 4 9 2 7 mg l n 8 during the moderately high flow condition fig s3 din has the same pattern to no3 n under various flow conditions din and no3 n during high flow conditions were significantly greater than the other three conditions and indicated that urban surface runoff and drainage pipes may be a potential n source the no3 n value in the main stream is higher than that of two tributaries except for no3 n in the t2 water sample under low flow conditions s2 also no3 n at the urban tributary t2 is higher than the upper reaches tributary t1 this indicated that human interference during low flow condition is more significant in detail no3 n at m2 s3 and m8 s5 during low flow conditions were greater than 30 mg l while the maximum 56 9 mg l was observed at m8 during high flow conditions fig 4 however the short time interval and antecedently successive rainfall during s6 and s7 would result in the source being limited as the continuous flush effect would be more significant in an impervious urban area nitasha and sanjiv 2015 peter et al 2020 for example the low no3 n at mainstream sites particularly in the urban areas m2 m6 during moderate high flow conditions s7 were observed the responding no3 n to various flow conditions demonstrated that nitrogen sources in the studied urban area can mobilize nitrate during high flow conditions and counteract the dilution effect and present high no3 n compared to other urban rivers the average no3 n 6 6 mg l in the present study is similar to another high frequency study in germany where leaky infrastructure processes to the karst aquifer were observed grimmeisen et al 2016 but higher than other studies either in non karst urban river studies e g beijing tianjin divers et al 2013 peters et al 2019 yue et al 2010 zhang et al 2015a or other karst urban river studies zhang et al 2020a these high no3 n implied that a vast quantity of wastewater may contribute to and increase no3 n in the present study divers et al 2013 mcgrane 2016 3 3 temporal and spatial variation characteristics of nitrate isotopic composition in karst urban rivers under different rainfall conditions δ15n no3 ranged from 3 6 to 47 6 in approximately 80 of samples n 50 between 10 and 25 the δ15n no3 during high flow conditions showed great variation while little variation occurred during moderate flow conditions fig 4 moreover the high average value of δ15n no3 was observed during low flow conditions 20 0 8 0 moderate flow conditions and moderately high flow conditions have a similar mean value of 15 3 7 7 and 15 8 7 2 respectively which is lower than the high flow condition 18 6 11 4 δ18o no3 and have a wide range of 22 2 to 17 7 which is about 84 0 n 50 sample within 5 and 10 the variety of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 values in the peri urban area was less than in the urban area and downstream the average value of δ15n no3 increased from the upper reaches to the urban area and then decreased in the lower reaches fig s4 compared with δ15n no3 the spatial variability of δ18o no3 value was marginal fig s4 the mean values of δ15n no3 and δ18o no3 in this study are similar to those of the urban river of beijing liu et al 2018 but it varied in the large rivers e g the xijiang river li et al 2019 and the rhine river in germany johannsen et al 2008 indicating that high anthropologic n originated from the urban system additionally these nitrate isotopic signatures in the present study were significantly higher than a previous no rainfall event study in the surface water in guiyang liu et al 2006 which suggested that n transport has been accelerated during rainfall event in karst area zhang et al 2019 previous study in a karstic agricultural catchment showed that n sources during rainfall events varied significantly from 0 6 to 14 2 for δ15n no3 and 3 2 to 7 0 for δ18o no3 yue et al 2020 these varied isotopic signatures demonstrated that the dynamic n sources during rainfall events in urban systems showed more diversity than in other ecosystems e g agricultural and forest catchment 3 4 process of nitrogen transformation in karst rivers under different rainfall conditions the relatively high δ15n no3 suggested that the source with high nitrogen isotopic signature may contribute more during rainfall events in the present study additionally nitrogen transformations such as volatilization nitrification and denitrification may also affect nitrate isotopic composition kendall et al 2007 for example the equilibrium and kinetic fractionation during volatilization would result in an overall fractionation effect of 20 35 billy et al 2010 wells et al 2015 although δ15n nh4 was not measured and cannot evaluate the role of volatilization the volatilization affected by the alkaline ph 89 of samples between 7 5 and 8 0 and high temperature cannot be underestimated in the role of volatilization to δ15n no3 fig s2 it may be obvious in the enrichment between waste 7 0 3 2 liu et al 2006 and river samples 20 during low flow conditions with a mean t 23 8 the level of do saturation can be improved by the installed inflatable rubber dam owing to the enhanced river air exchange even in the low flow condition the excessive organic matter input during rainfall would utilize the do thereby accelerating the decomposition of organic matter and subsequent nitrification the negative relationship do and no2 r2 0 42 p less than 0 01 during rainfall events s6 s7 and s8 revealed that oxygen was utilized during the decomposition of organic matter and accumulated no2 in riverine systems during nitrification generally oxygen atoms of no3 formed by nitrification come from o2 in the atmosphere and the ratio of oxygen atoms in water soil water is 1 2 kendall et al 2007 then the calculated value of δ18o no3 by nitrification should range from 0 83 to 3 6 using δ18o h2o value 13 0 to 6 4 which is higher than half of the measured samples but lower than 20 of samples additionally nitrification and denitrification can result in obvious isotopic fractionation of 14 8 and 5 40 respectively kendall et al 2007 thus isotopic fractionation during nitrification may not affect the nitrate isotopic composition as low nh4 concentration during rainfall events that indicated complete nitrification studies found that exchange of oxygen atoms between no2 and h2o included kinetic and equilibrium isotopic fractionation and presented the above ratio to be greater than 1 2 even lower than the δ18o h2o boshers et al 2019 snider et al 2010 although there is no significant relationship between δ18o no3 value and the ratio of no2 din in all samples a negative relationship can be found during moderately high flow conditions particularly in s8 r2 0 8 p 0 01 the pulsed nitrification was observed under both the laboratory and field conditions as triggered by soil rewetting yu and elliott 2017 this demonstrated that mineralization of flushed sewage or soil occurred during transportation in the river channel and oxygen exchange during nitrification is more obvious after a rainfall event although the fluctuant of water level was not observed during rainfall events the obvious water isotope signature suggested in situ assimilation process could ignore due to the fast response to rainfal events in karst area zhang et al 2019 yue et al 2020 furthermore there is no longitudinal increase in nitrate dual isotopes but significantly high isotopic values were observed at discrete sites which indicated denitrification may occur in the local environment particularly during low flow conditions fig 4 subsequently this denitrification signature may be masked by the mixing processes with nitrate production by nitrification mayer et al 2002 overall the n transformations in this karst urban river during rainfall events appeared highly heterogeneous 3 5 nitrogen sources in karst urban rivers under various flow conditions the knowledge of the specific sources contributing can help to implement of source controlling müller et al 2020 the relatively high nitrate dual isotopes suggested that the source with high nitrogen isotopic signature e g domestic waste may contribute more during rainfall events in the present study the high cl can be used as an important indicator of urban human input and domestic sewage discharge liu et al 2006 widory et al 2005 cl and no3 n showed a gradual increase from the upper reaches to the lower reaches fig s3 in contrast to urban area sites cl at m1 and t1 were low indicating low inputs of wastewater however cl and no3 n increased more at the urban area sites m2 m5 owing to the increasing inputs of wastewater cl and no3 n in the lower reaches were slightly higher than urban area sites compared with t1 and t2 which also indicated more serious pollution generally nitrate derived from synthetic fertilizers has a high concentration and high no3 cl conversely the cl content is high and the no3 n cl ratio is low in domestic wastewater animal excrement and domestic sewage as highly organic matter liu et al 2006 ming et al 2020 widory et al 2005 as shown in fig 5 the sampling sites in this study were mainly affected by domestic wastewater in the case of moderate flow conditions and high flow conditions the no3 n cl and cl values of each sampling point have smaller changes than in low flow conditions this showed that the different rainfall conditions make the river water mix well especially in the case of high flow conditions fig 5b previous studies found that wet deposition during storm events can be up to 71 divers et al 2013 yang and toor 2016 however the no3 n in rainwater is typically less than 0 5 mg l in the karst area xiao et al 2013 zeng et al 2020 was lower than that in the mainstream and tributaries combining with the high δ15n and low δ18o no3 signature wet deposition was not the primary source in this urban river even in high flow conditions s6 the high δ15n no3 values fig 6 suggested nitrate derived from sewage which has high δ15n no3 values greater than 25 widory et al 2005 compared to the other study the high population density in the present study determined huge sewage derived sources particularly in urban areas although cropland was distributed on the upper reaches of the river there was no significant hydrological response observed in agricultural catchment yue et al 2018 thus the low wet deposition contribution and high sewage derived source contribution indicated the great human impact in the study area 3 6 response of nitrogen in karst urban rivers to rainfall impervious landscape and artificial drainage networks in the urban area expedited the mobilization of pollutants through increased surface runoff and hydraulic efficiency mcgrane 2016 müller et al 2020 as a vulnerable leaching urban runoff facilitates dramatic changes to the pathways and timing of nitrate transport additionally the frequent exchange of surface and subsurface flow paths in the karst area should increase the flux of contaminants transference into the receiving water considering various rainfall conditions it is notable that no3 n concentration showed increases first with the accumulated rainfall and reaches a certain peak and then decreases fig 7 a indicating a nitrate pattern dependent on the antecedent rainfall with the rainfall flushing effect nitrate mobilized accumulated particle matter on impervious architecture and sewage waste in the artificial drainage networks from the urban area particularly when experiencing a long period of dry conditions mcgrane 2016 yang and toor 2016 it can be observed the relationship between no3 n and accumulated rainfall within three days can fit by polynomial the increase no3 n accompanying the elevation accumulated rainfall 60 mm in this study demonstrated that rainwater flushed has significantly enhanced the urban river s n sources both in the urban area m5 and the peri urban area m1 however high accumulated rainfall more than 110 mm in this study showed the reduction of no3 n indicating sources controlling and diluting the effect during high flow conditions however this hydrological response was not observed on δ15n no3 e g the peri urban area m1 fig 7b the large variety of δ15n no3 at the urban area site during low flow conditions presented varied sources and transformation information e g denitrification whereas high rainfall derived more sources information 4 conclusion this study investigated the behaviour of nitrogen under various rainfall events in a karstic urban river water chemistry and nitrate concentration indicated n pollution was more severe during rainfall events no3 n is the main form of soluble inorganic nitrogen in the studied river additionally no3 n concentration showed response to accumulated rainfall within three days rising during rainfall below 60 mm and falling during high rainfall above 110 mm the isotopic signature suggested the primary n sources have high δ15n no3 values demonstrating sewage waste contribution particularly under high flow conditions moreover volatilization and denitrification were more likely to occur during low flow conditions and affect nitrate isotopic composition oxygen exchange during rapid nitrification was observed during high flow conditions and moderately high flow conditions overall n transformation during various hydrological condition showed more activation which produced nitrate and elevated the concentration even under high flow conditions more studied should understand which flow paths may transport urban pollutants during rainfall events karst urban river need effective management as the frequent exchange of the high intensity of anthropogenic source by karst aquatic pathways particularly during rainfall events credit authorship contribution statement ping zhang data curation formal analysis writing original draft software fu jun yue

4998,flood risk assessment is an important task for disaster management activities in flood prone areas therefore it is crucial to develop accurate flood risk assessment maps in this study we proposed a flood risk assessment framework which combines flood susceptibility assessment and flood consequences human health and financial impact for developing a final flood risk assessment map using multi criteria decision analysis mcda method two hybrid artificial intelligence ai models namely abmdt adaboost dt and bdt bagging dt were developed with decision table dt as a base classifier for creating a flood susceptibility map we used 847 flood locations of major flooding events in the years 2007 2009 and 2013 in quang nam province of vietnam and 14 flood influencing factors of topography geology hydrology and environment to construct and validate the hybrid ai models various statistical measures were used to validate the models including the area under receiver operating characteristic roc curve called auc results show that all the proposed models performed well but the performance of the bdt model auc 0 96 is the best in comparison to other models abmdt auc 0 953 and single dt auc 0 929 therefore the flood susceptibility map produced by the bdt model was used to combine with a flood consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk assessment map for the study area the final flood risk map can provide a useful source for better flood hazard management of the study area and the proposed framework and models can be applied to other flood prone areas keywords flood risk assessment machine learning multi criteria decision analysis quang nam vietnam 1 introduction flood is one of the most devastating natural hazards affecting life damaging properties disrupting communication and causing death all over the world khosravi 2018 khosravi et al 2016 luu et al 2018 nardi et al 2006 rahmati et al 2016 floods affect the socio economic condition of the country degiorgis 2013 2012b tran et al 2009 van aalst and burton 2002 global climate change has recently increased the frequency and duration of precipitation and thus the incidence of flooding in the river basins and low lying areas bui et al 2019a nguyen et al 2018 climate change effects have also resulted in increasing flood incidents due to the increase in rainfall intensity and frequency bouwer et al 2010 in addition anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and land use pattern change have contributed to severe flooding incidents bubeck et al 2012 flood risk has been increasing in coastal and low lying areas due to migration of population and climate change effects nicholls et al 1999 nowadays flood risk assessment is gaining importance for proper flood management of an area manfreda and samela 2019 merz et al 2010 flood risk can be determined as a product of the probability and potential consequences of a flood event sayers et al 2002 flood risk can also be considered the probability of losses and includes three components of hazard exposure and vulnerability ronco 2014 winsemius et al 2013 the probability of a flood occurring at one location depends on geo morphological factors and geo environmental factors khosravi et al 2016 the potential consequences concern humans and exposed elements jato espino et al 2019 currently flood risk studies have also been developed at the interface between nature and society brown and damery 2002 many methods can be used to incorporate different indicators into an integrated tool for flood risk assessment and management in this regard multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods have been widely used for combining integrating and evaluating flood risk related factors ozturk and batuk 2011 applied analytic hierarchy process ahp which is one of the popular mcda methods for identifying the flood vulnerability of south marmara basin turkey and then integrated the risk assessment into a geographic information system gis framework kappes et al 2012 presented an indicator based framework for assessing vulnerability for natural hazards using mcda approach papathoma köhle 2016 used this approach to determine the debris flow hazard for south tyrol in which mcda approach was applied to assign the weights of vulnerability criteria toosi et al 2019 used the swat model to generate a runoff coefficient map and then combined flood hazard indexes using ahp method to create a flood hazard assessment map for mashhad plain basin iran however when there are a large amount of data and a large number of criteria need to be are analyzed for flood studies it is difficult to estimate which criteria are relevant or influential in decision making processes using mcdm methods this is one of the limiations of mcda approach where complex decisions are needed for the flood management ishizaka and labib 2009 therefore the artificial intelligence ai or machine learning ml methods can be integrated with mcda for the automatic estimation of weights of each criterion to avoid human bias in recent years many ml methods have been used to predict natural hazards in general and flood hazards in particular these methods include artificial neural networks ann falah 2019 lekkas et al 2004 rang et al 2006 support vector machines svm bafitlhile and li 2019 choubin 2019 shrifi garmdareh et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 random forest rf naghibi et al 2019 victoriano et al 2019 logistic regression lr nandi et al 2016 pradhan 2009 the performance of hybrid ml models is better to compare with individual models in many cases jaafari et al 2018 tien bui 2016 the development of new hybrid ml models is intended to further improve the predictive performance of the models bui et al 2019c bui and pham 2018 tien bui 2018 in this study the main objective was to develop a novel approach which is a combination of hybrid ml models and mcda technique for creating a flood risk assessment map for quang nam province which is one of the flood prone areas of vietnam with this aim we developed two hybrid ml models namely adaboost dt and bagging dt with decision table dt as a base classifier for flood susceptibility assessment and mapping one of the popular mcda methods named ahp was employed to create a flood consequences map which was then used to combine with the flood susceptibility map to make the final flood risk assessment map the main difference of this study with previous studies is that this is the first time the ai or ml models integrated with mcda for developing the flood risk framework and assessment in addition this integrated approach can provide a useful tool for flood risk assessment mapping which can be applied to decision making processes in flood risk management the model performance was evaluated with the standard statistical indices measures including area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve called auc weka and arcgis programs were used for data analysis and model development and visualization 2 study area quang nam province 14057 10 to 16003 50 northern latitude 107012 40 to 108044 20 eastern longitude is located in the central coastal region of vietnam covering about 1 057 474 ha area fig 1 this is a key economic region of central vietnam bordered in the north by danang city and in the south by dung quat economic zone the topography of the province is complex varying from high mountains in the west midland in the middle delta and coastal areas in the east two river basins of vu gia and thu bon flow through the province and form valleys and flood plains the climate in the region is a moderate tropical type with a dry season and a rainy season total annual rainfall ranges from 2000 mm to 4000 mm pham et al 2019c rainfall during september to december period accounts for 70 75 annual rainfall rainfall in mountainous areas is much higher than in the plains fig 3 b the rainy season coincides with the typhoon season so storms and tropical depressions often cause landslides and flash floods in mountainous districts of nam tra my bac tra my tay giang dong giang and nam giang and flooding in plain districts of dai loc dien ban duy xuyen and hoi an most of the area of the province is covered by forest fig 3 m however the forest area has been reduced in recent years due to agricultural expansion dam construction and commercial development meyfroidt et al 2013 anthropogenic activities and climate change effect have increased the risk of flooding in this province luu and von meding 2018 3 material and methods 3 1 conceptual framework flood risk can be defined as the combination of the probability of occurrence of a flood event and its associated negative consequences which may cover different types of impacts schanze 2006 the likelihood or susceptibility of a flood can be integrated with consequences in risk estimation woodruff 2005 the flood risk can be managed by reducing the consequences it may cause de moel 2015 therefore in this study we assessed flood risk by combining the flood susceptibility and its negative consequences as indicated in the following equation 1 floodrisk s u s c e p t i b i l i t y c o n s e q u e n c e s the potential impacts of flooding are often considered along with flood susceptibility in assessing flood risk merz 2014 the consequence indexes considered in this study include human health and financial implications the indicators are selected based on the critical analysis of past and present flood related data the description of flood consequences is depicted in fig 2 3 2 geospatial database 3 2 1 flood influencing factors physical anthropogenic and meteorological factors affect the occurrence of floods in any area in this study 14 flood influencing factors were selected based on the analysis of the topography geo environment conditions meteorology and anthropogenic activities considering the nature of flood occurrences of the study area and other published works costache 2019 hosseini 2019 wang 2019 topography and hydrology factors slope curvature curvature plan curvature profile flow accumulation elevation topographic wetness index twi sediment transport index sti stream power index spi river density and distance from rivers were extracted from aster digital elevation model https earthexplorer usgs gov lithology map was obtained from the geology institute vietnam land cover map was developed from google earth images and data of the department of natural resources and environment of quang nam province rainfall map was developed from the data of meteorology institute vietnam thematic maps of the flood influencing factors are presented in fig 4 in addition we carried out the frequency analysis to evaluate the probability of past and present flood occurrences on each class of the flood conditioning factors in frequency analysis the frequency ratio was calculated by dividing the percentage of past and present flood pixels by the percentage of the class pixels on each class of each factor map rahmati et al 2016 in each factor map the classes with higher frequency ratio values have a higher probability of flood occurrences than those with lower frequency ratio values siahkamari et al 2018 the results of the frequency analysis of these factors are presented in fig 5 3 2 2 flood consequences factors floods have many positive and negative consequences for the communities and natural environment albano et al 2014 positive consequences include replenishing nutrients in flood plain areas filling of the reservoirs recharging of the groundwater and removal of contaminants pollutants the negative consequences of flooding include disruption of life fatalities and health problems hajat 2005 disruption of communication destruction of crops and adverse financial impacts on societies thieken et al 2014 flood consequence indicators in the flood zone area vary from place to place depending on local conditions in this study we analyzed adverse flood consequences taking into account human health fig 6 and financial aspects fig 7 to assess flood risk 3 2 3 flood consequences on human health the flood consequences on human health are based on the population density available infrastructures and the medical capacity of the area scheuer et al 2011 population density is the most important indicator of flood consequences analysis since it directly involves humans grothmann and reusswig 2006 thus flood consequences would be greater for a large number of people at risk the poverty rate and flood risk are interrelated in vietnam tran et al 2009 a higher poverty rate receives a higher weight for flood consequences the mountainous areas often have a high poverty rate 40 in the present study the socio economic indicators including population density poverty rate and number of medical staff available in the study area were synthesized from the 2015 statistical yearbooks of 18 districts in quang nam province the road density indicator is derived from the intersecting transportation network and the commune boundary the well connected areas provide additional response support to community gain and hoque 2013 masuya et al 2015 the number of medical staff criterion affects the response activities during flood events scheuer et al 2011 3 2 4 flood consequences on financial impact the financial impact can be estimated based on the concentration of economic activities such as the density of industrial facilities and services in the research area jato espino et al 2019 the industrial facility density and service and commercial facility density data were synthesized from the 2015 statistical yearbooks of 18 districts in quang nam province in addition the land use categories indicator was also considered in flood consequences assessment jongman et al 2012 in the study area the potential impact of flooding is highest for homestead and built up areas as it is directly related to people the agricultural land indicator has the second highest impact because it affects the residents livelihood 3 3 methodology flowchart for flood risk assessment the methodology of the present study involves three main steps i flood susceptibility assessment ii flood consequences assessment and iii flood risk assessment the methodology flowchart is shown in fig 8 and the details of the three steps are presented in the following subsections 3 3 1 flood susceptibility assessment first preprocessing of input data to select relevant features for the modelling was done using relief f feature selection method which is a simple and effective approach of feature weight estimation a spatial geodatabase of flood susceptibility factors and flood locations was used to generate the training 70 flood locations and testing 30 flood locations datasets frequency ratio analysis was done to create the weights of the classes of the flood conditioning factors used in the modelling second training dataset was used to construct the susceptibility maps using hybrid ai techniques namely ensemble abmdt and bdt and single dt in the abmdt method adaboost ensemble was first used to generate the optimal training dataset which was then used for training the base classifier dt in bdt method bagging ensemble was first used to generate the optimal training dataset which was then used for training the base classifier dt third the validation of these models was done on both the training and testing datasets using various standard quantitative indices including auc fourth the results of these indices were evaluated for selecting the best method finally flood susceptibility maps were constructed using these models and the best flood susceptibility assessment map was then used to generate a final flood risk assessment map 3 3 2 flood inventory map flood inventory represents the spatial relationships between the history of flood and factors of physical and human geography such as geomorphology climate hydrology and human activities bui et al 2019b it plays an important role in modelling and generating flood susceptibility and risk maps the study area of quang nam province is affected by several flood events each year due to its geographic location the drainage basins of the area are steep slopes and short rivers so the runoff is substantial in the mountainous regions this causes rapidly flooding in low lying areas in this study the flood inventory map consists of 847 historical flooded locations which occurred in the year 2007 2009 and 2013 fig 1 the flooded locations were identified from the historical flood marks fig 3 at a flood mark location the information of code coordinates longitude and latitude address and flood depth were recorded the flood inventory data were collected from the quang nam provincial committee of natural disaster prevention and control the data was used for the development of flood susceptibility maps we also referenced the inundation maps data of previous studies by luu et al 2018 chau et al 2013 and ho and umitsu 2011 and generated the same number of non flood locations 3 3 3 flood consequences assessment in this step the maps of flood consequences related to human health and financial impact were combined to create the final flood consequences assessment map the weights of the layers were generated using the ahp method 3 3 4 flood risk assessment in the final step the best flood susceptibility assessment map in the first step was combined with the consequences assessment map to generate the final flood risk assessment map for the study area we used the weighted sum tool to integrate layers in gis application 3 4 methods used 3 4 1 decision table dt decision tables are classification models used for prediction kohavi 1997 it generates several training variables which made up the labelled instances the dt is invested for the majorities of class with a rules mapping it is made up of two components 1 the set of functionalities designated by the diagram and 2 the set of the majority of labelled instances kohavi 1997 each instance has a value for a feature and is labelled in the schema kohavi 1997 with an instance is not labelled i the labelled attributes to the instance classified by dt is calculated as follows if τ is the entire instance that is labelled in the corresponding dt with the given instance i where the instances in the schema request a match and all other functionality is ignored if τ 0 return the majority classes in dt otherwise return the majority classes in τ the values do not determine which calls the distinct values in the process if err h f presents the hypothesis errors h for the function f we estimate errors when using independent test data τ as in the following equation 2 err h τ 1 τ x i y i l h x i y i in this study the dt was trained with hyper parameters provided in table 1 3 4 2 adaboost adaboost algorithm is considered to be one of the popular methods that are used to solve binary classification math its algorithm is replaced in the multiclass without dividing it to several problems with two classes fan and wang 2011 in addition this algorithm combines with a weak classifier to build a powerful hybrid algorithm the weak classifications are assigned weights to improve the classifications of the previous incorrectly classified sampling the construction model is the decision tree model which is supported by the model coefficients in this study the adaboost was trained and constructed with hyper parameters provided in table 1 3 4 3 bagging bagging is considered to be one of the smooth machine learning methods proposed by breiman in 1996 breiman 1996 it is proposed to reduce variance without increasing too much bias error bagging method is a valuable tool for evaluating the natural disasters in general and the flood in particular it is related to the model prediction improvement capacity due to the capacity for sensitivity in small changes to training data in bagging the bootstrap technique is used to select the variables randomly with the replacement capacity to construct several samples to create the training data galar et al 2011 each of the subsets is prepared to build the decision tree which is synthesized in the final models class prediction of the new element comes with the majority voting strategy derived from the class prediction of the basic model in this study the bagging was trained and constructed with hyper parameters provided in table 1 3 4 4 relief f feature selection method the selection of influencing factors plays an essential role in the process of constructing the flood susceptibility model because all the features factors may not be relevant in modelling hong 2018 wang et al 2016 yariyan 2020a feature selection is considered to be one of the most critical issues in the sample determination process and this supported by machine learning focuses the algorithm on the factors most significant influence on the classification prediction van dao 2020 the relief f method is considered to be one of the most popular methods for performing this task this algorithm has the ability to not only support binary class problems but also to solve binary class problems urbanowicz et al 2018 this algorithm is based on the summaries of the weightings of the factors according to their suitability for the objective saha et al 2020 3 4 5 validation methods statistical measures used to validate the models include true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp false negative fn positive predictive value ppv negative predictive value npv sensitivity sst specificity spf accuracy acc kappa k root mean squared error rmse and reciever operating characteristic roc curve these methods were used to evaluate the performance of models pham et al 2019b for the development of reliable flood susceptibility maps in this study statistical measures ppv and npv are the proportion of pixels that are correctly classified as flood and non flood respectively sst and spf are the rates of the number of flood and non flood pixels acc is one of the most popular metrics that is used to assess the performance of models bennett 2013 janizadeh 2019 this measure is represented by the proportion of the number of pixel flood and non flood pixel cohen s kappa coefficient k is an efficient statistics measure that helps to measure random consensus among classification components it calculates the consensus between the two evaluations variables used to classify n objects into c mutually exclusive sets the value of kappa varies from 0 to 1 where value 1 indicates perfect model performance pham et al 2016 2018 rmse indicates the level of dispersion of predicted values from actual values the model is considered perfect when the rmse value is small roc is one of the most used measures by researchers to assess the predictive capacity and classification quality of the model gorsevski et al 2006 mohammady et al 2012 area under the roc curve auc is often used to quantitatively evaluate the predictive capability of the models value of auc equals to 1 indicates perfect model performance in addition the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to check the statistical differences between the flood models pham et al 2019a this algorithm has been applied widely to verify the statistical significance between models khosravi 2018 to apply this method two values p and z were used with the null hypothesis that the models were not statistically different at the level of 0 05 which was constructed if the z values are higher than the upper limit value 1 96 and lower limit value 1 96 as well as p 0 05 this assumption was rejected therefore the performance of the models is different in terms of statistics dietterich 1998 3 4 6 multi criteria decision analysis mcda mcda methods allow to work with quantitative variables and are applied to decision making processes huang et al 2011 several popular mcda methods used in flood risk assessment are analytical hierarchy process ahp saaty 2003 analytic network process anp saaty and vargas 2006 and ordered weighted averaging owa makropoulos and butler 2006 the integration of mcda methods with gis analytical techniques are used for spatial analysis of various assessments and decision problems malczewski 2006 weighted linear combination wlc method is often used to integrate mcda methods in gis environment malczewski 2000 in this study we used one of the most popular mcda methods namely ahp to generate weights for the indicators the wlc method was then used to incorporate the weighted indicator layers into a gis framework 4 results and analysis 4 1 flood susceptibility assessment map 4 1 1 important factors used for the flood models in the susceptibility modelling it is desirable to remove unnecessary or unimportant factors which might affect the accuracy of the prediction models therefore feature selection techniques are being used to validate and select the important factors for developing machine learning models hoa 2019 in this study relief f which is a popular feature selection method yang et al 2011 was applied in the model study table 2 the results suggest that elevation w 0 7235 rainfall w 0 6729 slope w 0 6069 are the most important influencing factors w 6 for the flood modelling in the study area this is consistent with other similar flood studies degiorgis 2012a garrote and bras 1995 hosseini 2020 shrestha 2014 4 1 2 validation of the models validation of the studied susceptibility models abmdt bdt and dt was carried out using various standard quantitative indices on both training and testing datasets table 3 and fig 9 in terms of training data the results show that the bdt model has a better value of npv 99 115 and sst 99 032 while the abmdt has a better value of ppv 92 183 spf 92 639 and acc 95 280 compared to the other models for validation data the bdt model has the best value of ppv 86 391 npv 99 408 sst 99 320 spf 87 958 and acc 92 899 compared to other models the best k value of 0 906 is for the abmdt model in terms of training data whereas the best k value for the bdt model is 0 858 in terms of testing data the abmdt model has the lowest value of rmse on training dataset 0 197 whereas the bdt model has the lowest rmse value on testing dataset 0 245 table 3 the results of the roc analysis show that the models of bdt and abmdt have better performance with auc 0 977 then the dt model 0 961 in terms of training data for validation data the bdt model has better performance with auc 0 96 followed by the abmdt with auc 0 953 and dt model with auc 0 929 respectively fig 9 wilcoxon signed rank test was carried out to evaluate the significance of the statistical differences of the model performance tables 4 and 5 it can be observed that on both training and testing datasets the z values of the comparative pairs are higher than the upper limit value 1 96 and lower limit value 1 96 and the p values are smaller than the threshold value of 0 05 therefore it can be stated that the differences in the performance of the models are statistical significance in this study 4 1 3 flood susceptibility mapping flood susceptibility indexes of the study area were generated during the training phase of the models these indexes were used for the construction and classification of flood susceptibility maps into five classes very low susceptibility low susceptibility moderate susceptibility high susceptibility and very high susceptibility using natural break classification method fig 10 it can be observed that for the bdt model 15 9 of the study area is located in the very low susceptibility area 45 94 in the low susceptibility area 19 8 in the moderate susceptibility area and 4 682 and 14 49 in the high susceptibility area and very high susceptibility area for the abmdt model 80 13 of the study area is in the very low susceptibility area 2 794 2 83 4 617 and9 626 is in the low moderate high and very high susceptibility areas respectively for the dt model 64 5 of the study area is located in the very low susceptibility area 11 09 5 421 4 045 and 14 94 are located in the low moderate high and very high susceptibility areas respectively fig 11 it is observed that high and very high susceptibility zones are located along rivers in floodplain areas it can be observed that the maps produced by the bdt model show similar results therefore it can be reasonably stated that the flood susceptibility map produced by the bdt model is the most reliable compared with other models thus it was used for developing flood risk map in this study 4 2 flood consequences assessment map in this study we used super decisions software to calculate ahp algorithms whitaker and adams 2005 and the weighted sum tool in arcgis software to integrate the weighted indicator layers into a gis framework the flood consequences on human health and financial impact were analyzed as described in the conceptual framework ahp works by setting priorities for multiple criteria evaluated by experts to derive the best decision saaty 1990 the weights of the criteria in the ahp method are based on subjective assessment of some experts godfrey et al 2015 kienberger et al 2009 kokangül et al 2017 moghadas et al 2019 or based on the author experience assessment dewan 2013 kandilioti and makropoulos 2012 li et al 2013 in the present study we used the author experience based evaluation we also refer to the related studies using ahp to evaluate flood risk criteria dewan 2013 godfrey et al 2015 kienberger et al 2009 kokangül et al 2017 moghadas et al 2019 velasquez and hester 2013 the consequences on human health are assessed by the combination of population density poverty rate road density and number of medical staff fig 12 a the consequences on financial impact are evaluated by considering three indicators of industrial facility density service and commercial density and land use categories fig 12 b the weights of criteria and sub criteria are presented in table 6 we used the integrated ahp wlc to combine indicators in the gis environment the weighted sum tool in arcgis software was used to overlay the weighted indicators weighted in table 6 the final flood consequence map is displayed in fig 12 c 4 3 flood risk assessment map flood risk was assessed in this study by combining the hybrid machine learning bdtmodel based flood susceptibility map and the flood consequences map the flood risk assessment map was created by overlaying the flood susceptibility map and flood consequences map using weighted sum technique in gis environment fig 13 the risk scores were normalized to a range of 0 1 out of the 1 056 609 ha total area of the province 915 264 ha 86 62 is in very low risk areas 54 132 ha 5 12 in low risk areas 48 989 ha 4 64 in medium risk areas 29 308 ha 2 77 in high risk areas and 8 916 ha 0 84 in extremely high risk areas 5 discussion flood is one of the most destructive natural hazards in vietnam requiring systematic study to prevent loss of life and destruction of property for sustainable development therefore developing flood risk maps is a necessary step to help decision makers in flood risk management kourgialas and karatzas 2011 even though various methods and approaches have been proposed and applied to assess flood risk however the complex geo morphological conditions and dynamic human activities which cause changes in the morphology and destruction of forests pose difficulties in predicting flood risks accurately zahar et al 2008 for this reason various algorithms were developed and applied for the flood risk assessment and development of accurate predictive models in this study two advanced hybrid models bdt and abmdt and single dt model were validated and compared to select the best model and map which was integrated with the mcda ahp to develop flood risk map of the quang nam province vietnam validation results show that all developed models bdt abmdt and dt performed well for flood susceptibility assessing and modelling it is reasonable as the dt model is an effective popular machine learning algorithm to solve the classification problem using transforming the data on the table its advantages are i the dt model requires less effort for the data preprocessing process and ii it does not require data standardization which is very easy to understand and intuitive the dt algorithm is sometimes more complicated compared to the other algorithms and takes time to form the prediction model in this study the results also show that the bdt model is the best compared to other models for flood susceptibility mapping in the study area this is appropriate because the bdt model used bagging ensemble which is an excellent ensemble tool to improve the accuracy of individual classification prediction and the radial basis function kernel used in bagging ensemble can enhance the stability of the dt model simultaneously the bootstrap sampling technique used in the bagging model was used to reduce the sensitivity of single classification to noise in training data sets pham and prakash 2019 the model variance is reduced which can improve the accuracy of the individual model like dt breiman 1996 the advantage of the bagging model is presented in the change from the basic classification generalization error to the generalization error calculated on the smaller training data therefore it can be used for the classification which has the learning curves of reduced thai pham 2019 thus the bdt is observed as the best model for flood susceptibility modelling in this study compared with other models abmdt and dt however it is not suitable for linear classifications because of its classifications in addition it cannot be adapted for small or very large training data pham and prakash 2019 skurichina and duin 2002 this finding of this study is also in comparison with other published works arabameri et al 2020 chen 2019 yariyan 2020 in this study flood susceptibility map was combined with the flood consequences assessment map using ahp and wlc techniques to develop a flood risk map whereas the flood susceptibility map was generated by the best hybrid ml model bdt flood consequences reflect the impacts of human health and financial impacts winsemius et al 2013 we devised criteria for human health impact including population density road density poverty rate and healthcare facility and criteria for financial impact including industrial facility density service and commercial facility density and land use categories in literature some studies have additionally focused on flood risk assessment in terms of combining flood vulnerability and flood hazards such as scheuer et al 2011 masuya 2014 and lee et al 2013 several studies analyzed flood risk in the combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability foudi et al 2015 winsemius et al 2013 some recent studies focused on the consequences of flood risk since the consequences reflect the potential impacts of flood hazard albano et al 2014 jato espino et al 2019 in this study we assessed flood risk by combining flood susceptibility and flood consequences which is a suitable approach for flood risk assessment in quang nam province vietnam finally mcda is used to incorporate the flood susceptibility and consequences components in flood risk modelling mcda methods are often used in the risk analysis due to several advantages such as criteria and sub criteria systematization ishizaka and labib 2009 suitability for gis integration malczewski 2006 and consistency in judgment koczkodaj 2017 the flood risk assessment map shows high flood risk zones locations which are required to be managed on a priority basis in general the integration of a hybrid intelligence model for flood susceptibility map and mcda for flood consequences map is a good approach for developing a reliable flood risk map in data scarce areas also in addition when we compared the flood risk assessment map of this study with the quang nam inundation map of chau et al 2013 and luu et al 2018 it is observed that the high flood risk areas are located close to and along rivers that are in and around floodplain areas the result is compatible with previous studies such as ho and umitsu 2011 chau et al 2013 and luu et al 2018 the flooding occurs in the low lying areas of vu gia thu bon river basin and affects districts of dai loc hoi an dien ban duy xuyen nong son que son and tam ky 6 concluding remarks in this study we developed a soft computing based flook risk framework in which the flood risk map was generated by combing a flood susceptibility map and a flood consequences map the flood susceptibility map was created using a hybrid ai model bdt and the flood consequences map was created by using ahp technique the case study was quang nam province vietnam validation results show that all the proposed models performed well for constructing flood susceptibility map however the performance of the bdt model auc 0 96 is the best in comparison to other models namely abmdt auc 0 953 and dt auc 0 929 thus the flood susceptibility map produced by bdt is the best map which was combined with a consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk map of the study area in general the ai or ml integrated with mcda approach is a suitable framework and approach for developing a reliable flood risk map that can be used and applied in other flood prone areas considering local geo environmental conditions advantage of this approach is that it does not require time series meteorological and streamflow data or updated river cross section data which are not readily available in many data scarce areas however this study has two main limitations first we can not analyze the frequency of flood events in the flood susceptibility mapping since ai or ml models use flood and non flood locations as a dependent variable and flood influencing factors as predictors second the proposed integrated approach needs to be validated in other flood prone areas of vietnam declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgment this research is funded by vietnam national foundation for science and technology development nafosted under grant number 105 08 2019 03 
4998,flood risk assessment is an important task for disaster management activities in flood prone areas therefore it is crucial to develop accurate flood risk assessment maps in this study we proposed a flood risk assessment framework which combines flood susceptibility assessment and flood consequences human health and financial impact for developing a final flood risk assessment map using multi criteria decision analysis mcda method two hybrid artificial intelligence ai models namely abmdt adaboost dt and bdt bagging dt were developed with decision table dt as a base classifier for creating a flood susceptibility map we used 847 flood locations of major flooding events in the years 2007 2009 and 2013 in quang nam province of vietnam and 14 flood influencing factors of topography geology hydrology and environment to construct and validate the hybrid ai models various statistical measures were used to validate the models including the area under receiver operating characteristic roc curve called auc results show that all the proposed models performed well but the performance of the bdt model auc 0 96 is the best in comparison to other models abmdt auc 0 953 and single dt auc 0 929 therefore the flood susceptibility map produced by the bdt model was used to combine with a flood consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk assessment map for the study area the final flood risk map can provide a useful source for better flood hazard management of the study area and the proposed framework and models can be applied to other flood prone areas keywords flood risk assessment machine learning multi criteria decision analysis quang nam vietnam 1 introduction flood is one of the most devastating natural hazards affecting life damaging properties disrupting communication and causing death all over the world khosravi 2018 khosravi et al 2016 luu et al 2018 nardi et al 2006 rahmati et al 2016 floods affect the socio economic condition of the country degiorgis 2013 2012b tran et al 2009 van aalst and burton 2002 global climate change has recently increased the frequency and duration of precipitation and thus the incidence of flooding in the river basins and low lying areas bui et al 2019a nguyen et al 2018 climate change effects have also resulted in increasing flood incidents due to the increase in rainfall intensity and frequency bouwer et al 2010 in addition anthropogenic activities such as deforestation and land use pattern change have contributed to severe flooding incidents bubeck et al 2012 flood risk has been increasing in coastal and low lying areas due to migration of population and climate change effects nicholls et al 1999 nowadays flood risk assessment is gaining importance for proper flood management of an area manfreda and samela 2019 merz et al 2010 flood risk can be determined as a product of the probability and potential consequences of a flood event sayers et al 2002 flood risk can also be considered the probability of losses and includes three components of hazard exposure and vulnerability ronco 2014 winsemius et al 2013 the probability of a flood occurring at one location depends on geo morphological factors and geo environmental factors khosravi et al 2016 the potential consequences concern humans and exposed elements jato espino et al 2019 currently flood risk studies have also been developed at the interface between nature and society brown and damery 2002 many methods can be used to incorporate different indicators into an integrated tool for flood risk assessment and management in this regard multi criteria decision analysis mcda methods have been widely used for combining integrating and evaluating flood risk related factors ozturk and batuk 2011 applied analytic hierarchy process ahp which is one of the popular mcda methods for identifying the flood vulnerability of south marmara basin turkey and then integrated the risk assessment into a geographic information system gis framework kappes et al 2012 presented an indicator based framework for assessing vulnerability for natural hazards using mcda approach papathoma köhle 2016 used this approach to determine the debris flow hazard for south tyrol in which mcda approach was applied to assign the weights of vulnerability criteria toosi et al 2019 used the swat model to generate a runoff coefficient map and then combined flood hazard indexes using ahp method to create a flood hazard assessment map for mashhad plain basin iran however when there are a large amount of data and a large number of criteria need to be are analyzed for flood studies it is difficult to estimate which criteria are relevant or influential in decision making processes using mcdm methods this is one of the limiations of mcda approach where complex decisions are needed for the flood management ishizaka and labib 2009 therefore the artificial intelligence ai or machine learning ml methods can be integrated with mcda for the automatic estimation of weights of each criterion to avoid human bias in recent years many ml methods have been used to predict natural hazards in general and flood hazards in particular these methods include artificial neural networks ann falah 2019 lekkas et al 2004 rang et al 2006 support vector machines svm bafitlhile and li 2019 choubin 2019 shrifi garmdareh et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 random forest rf naghibi et al 2019 victoriano et al 2019 logistic regression lr nandi et al 2016 pradhan 2009 the performance of hybrid ml models is better to compare with individual models in many cases jaafari et al 2018 tien bui 2016 the development of new hybrid ml models is intended to further improve the predictive performance of the models bui et al 2019c bui and pham 2018 tien bui 2018 in this study the main objective was to develop a novel approach which is a combination of hybrid ml models and mcda technique for creating a flood risk assessment map for quang nam province which is one of the flood prone areas of vietnam with this aim we developed two hybrid ml models namely adaboost dt and bagging dt with decision table dt as a base classifier for flood susceptibility assessment and mapping one of the popular mcda methods named ahp was employed to create a flood consequences map which was then used to combine with the flood susceptibility map to make the final flood risk assessment map the main difference of this study with previous studies is that this is the first time the ai or ml models integrated with mcda for developing the flood risk framework and assessment in addition this integrated approach can provide a useful tool for flood risk assessment mapping which can be applied to decision making processes in flood risk management the model performance was evaluated with the standard statistical indices measures including area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve called auc weka and arcgis programs were used for data analysis and model development and visualization 2 study area quang nam province 14057 10 to 16003 50 northern latitude 107012 40 to 108044 20 eastern longitude is located in the central coastal region of vietnam covering about 1 057 474 ha area fig 1 this is a key economic region of central vietnam bordered in the north by danang city and in the south by dung quat economic zone the topography of the province is complex varying from high mountains in the west midland in the middle delta and coastal areas in the east two river basins of vu gia and thu bon flow through the province and form valleys and flood plains the climate in the region is a moderate tropical type with a dry season and a rainy season total annual rainfall ranges from 2000 mm to 4000 mm pham et al 2019c rainfall during september to december period accounts for 70 75 annual rainfall rainfall in mountainous areas is much higher than in the plains fig 3 b the rainy season coincides with the typhoon season so storms and tropical depressions often cause landslides and flash floods in mountainous districts of nam tra my bac tra my tay giang dong giang and nam giang and flooding in plain districts of dai loc dien ban duy xuyen and hoi an most of the area of the province is covered by forest fig 3 m however the forest area has been reduced in recent years due to agricultural expansion dam construction and commercial development meyfroidt et al 2013 anthropogenic activities and climate change effect have increased the risk of flooding in this province luu and von meding 2018 3 material and methods 3 1 conceptual framework flood risk can be defined as the combination of the probability of occurrence of a flood event and its associated negative consequences which may cover different types of impacts schanze 2006 the likelihood or susceptibility of a flood can be integrated with consequences in risk estimation woodruff 2005 the flood risk can be managed by reducing the consequences it may cause de moel 2015 therefore in this study we assessed flood risk by combining the flood susceptibility and its negative consequences as indicated in the following equation 1 floodrisk s u s c e p t i b i l i t y c o n s e q u e n c e s the potential impacts of flooding are often considered along with flood susceptibility in assessing flood risk merz 2014 the consequence indexes considered in this study include human health and financial implications the indicators are selected based on the critical analysis of past and present flood related data the description of flood consequences is depicted in fig 2 3 2 geospatial database 3 2 1 flood influencing factors physical anthropogenic and meteorological factors affect the occurrence of floods in any area in this study 14 flood influencing factors were selected based on the analysis of the topography geo environment conditions meteorology and anthropogenic activities considering the nature of flood occurrences of the study area and other published works costache 2019 hosseini 2019 wang 2019 topography and hydrology factors slope curvature curvature plan curvature profile flow accumulation elevation topographic wetness index twi sediment transport index sti stream power index spi river density and distance from rivers were extracted from aster digital elevation model https earthexplorer usgs gov lithology map was obtained from the geology institute vietnam land cover map was developed from google earth images and data of the department of natural resources and environment of quang nam province rainfall map was developed from the data of meteorology institute vietnam thematic maps of the flood influencing factors are presented in fig 4 in addition we carried out the frequency analysis to evaluate the probability of past and present flood occurrences on each class of the flood conditioning factors in frequency analysis the frequency ratio was calculated by dividing the percentage of past and present flood pixels by the percentage of the class pixels on each class of each factor map rahmati et al 2016 in each factor map the classes with higher frequency ratio values have a higher probability of flood occurrences than those with lower frequency ratio values siahkamari et al 2018 the results of the frequency analysis of these factors are presented in fig 5 3 2 2 flood consequences factors floods have many positive and negative consequences for the communities and natural environment albano et al 2014 positive consequences include replenishing nutrients in flood plain areas filling of the reservoirs recharging of the groundwater and removal of contaminants pollutants the negative consequences of flooding include disruption of life fatalities and health problems hajat 2005 disruption of communication destruction of crops and adverse financial impacts on societies thieken et al 2014 flood consequence indicators in the flood zone area vary from place to place depending on local conditions in this study we analyzed adverse flood consequences taking into account human health fig 6 and financial aspects fig 7 to assess flood risk 3 2 3 flood consequences on human health the flood consequences on human health are based on the population density available infrastructures and the medical capacity of the area scheuer et al 2011 population density is the most important indicator of flood consequences analysis since it directly involves humans grothmann and reusswig 2006 thus flood consequences would be greater for a large number of people at risk the poverty rate and flood risk are interrelated in vietnam tran et al 2009 a higher poverty rate receives a higher weight for flood consequences the mountainous areas often have a high poverty rate 40 in the present study the socio economic indicators including population density poverty rate and number of medical staff available in the study area were synthesized from the 2015 statistical yearbooks of 18 districts in quang nam province the road density indicator is derived from the intersecting transportation network and the commune boundary the well connected areas provide additional response support to community gain and hoque 2013 masuya et al 2015 the number of medical staff criterion affects the response activities during flood events scheuer et al 2011 3 2 4 flood consequences on financial impact the financial impact can be estimated based on the concentration of economic activities such as the density of industrial facilities and services in the research area jato espino et al 2019 the industrial facility density and service and commercial facility density data were synthesized from the 2015 statistical yearbooks of 18 districts in quang nam province in addition the land use categories indicator was also considered in flood consequences assessment jongman et al 2012 in the study area the potential impact of flooding is highest for homestead and built up areas as it is directly related to people the agricultural land indicator has the second highest impact because it affects the residents livelihood 3 3 methodology flowchart for flood risk assessment the methodology of the present study involves three main steps i flood susceptibility assessment ii flood consequences assessment and iii flood risk assessment the methodology flowchart is shown in fig 8 and the details of the three steps are presented in the following subsections 3 3 1 flood susceptibility assessment first preprocessing of input data to select relevant features for the modelling was done using relief f feature selection method which is a simple and effective approach of feature weight estimation a spatial geodatabase of flood susceptibility factors and flood locations was used to generate the training 70 flood locations and testing 30 flood locations datasets frequency ratio analysis was done to create the weights of the classes of the flood conditioning factors used in the modelling second training dataset was used to construct the susceptibility maps using hybrid ai techniques namely ensemble abmdt and bdt and single dt in the abmdt method adaboost ensemble was first used to generate the optimal training dataset which was then used for training the base classifier dt in bdt method bagging ensemble was first used to generate the optimal training dataset which was then used for training the base classifier dt third the validation of these models was done on both the training and testing datasets using various standard quantitative indices including auc fourth the results of these indices were evaluated for selecting the best method finally flood susceptibility maps were constructed using these models and the best flood susceptibility assessment map was then used to generate a final flood risk assessment map 3 3 2 flood inventory map flood inventory represents the spatial relationships between the history of flood and factors of physical and human geography such as geomorphology climate hydrology and human activities bui et al 2019b it plays an important role in modelling and generating flood susceptibility and risk maps the study area of quang nam province is affected by several flood events each year due to its geographic location the drainage basins of the area are steep slopes and short rivers so the runoff is substantial in the mountainous regions this causes rapidly flooding in low lying areas in this study the flood inventory map consists of 847 historical flooded locations which occurred in the year 2007 2009 and 2013 fig 1 the flooded locations were identified from the historical flood marks fig 3 at a flood mark location the information of code coordinates longitude and latitude address and flood depth were recorded the flood inventory data were collected from the quang nam provincial committee of natural disaster prevention and control the data was used for the development of flood susceptibility maps we also referenced the inundation maps data of previous studies by luu et al 2018 chau et al 2013 and ho and umitsu 2011 and generated the same number of non flood locations 3 3 3 flood consequences assessment in this step the maps of flood consequences related to human health and financial impact were combined to create the final flood consequences assessment map the weights of the layers were generated using the ahp method 3 3 4 flood risk assessment in the final step the best flood susceptibility assessment map in the first step was combined with the consequences assessment map to generate the final flood risk assessment map for the study area we used the weighted sum tool to integrate layers in gis application 3 4 methods used 3 4 1 decision table dt decision tables are classification models used for prediction kohavi 1997 it generates several training variables which made up the labelled instances the dt is invested for the majorities of class with a rules mapping it is made up of two components 1 the set of functionalities designated by the diagram and 2 the set of the majority of labelled instances kohavi 1997 each instance has a value for a feature and is labelled in the schema kohavi 1997 with an instance is not labelled i the labelled attributes to the instance classified by dt is calculated as follows if τ is the entire instance that is labelled in the corresponding dt with the given instance i where the instances in the schema request a match and all other functionality is ignored if τ 0 return the majority classes in dt otherwise return the majority classes in τ the values do not determine which calls the distinct values in the process if err h f presents the hypothesis errors h for the function f we estimate errors when using independent test data τ as in the following equation 2 err h τ 1 τ x i y i l h x i y i in this study the dt was trained with hyper parameters provided in table 1 3 4 2 adaboost adaboost algorithm is considered to be one of the popular methods that are used to solve binary classification math its algorithm is replaced in the multiclass without dividing it to several problems with two classes fan and wang 2011 in addition this algorithm combines with a weak classifier to build a powerful hybrid algorithm the weak classifications are assigned weights to improve the classifications of the previous incorrectly classified sampling the construction model is the decision tree model which is supported by the model coefficients in this study the adaboost was trained and constructed with hyper parameters provided in table 1 3 4 3 bagging bagging is considered to be one of the smooth machine learning methods proposed by breiman in 1996 breiman 1996 it is proposed to reduce variance without increasing too much bias error bagging method is a valuable tool for evaluating the natural disasters in general and the flood in particular it is related to the model prediction improvement capacity due to the capacity for sensitivity in small changes to training data in bagging the bootstrap technique is used to select the variables randomly with the replacement capacity to construct several samples to create the training data galar et al 2011 each of the subsets is prepared to build the decision tree which is synthesized in the final models class prediction of the new element comes with the majority voting strategy derived from the class prediction of the basic model in this study the bagging was trained and constructed with hyper parameters provided in table 1 3 4 4 relief f feature selection method the selection of influencing factors plays an essential role in the process of constructing the flood susceptibility model because all the features factors may not be relevant in modelling hong 2018 wang et al 2016 yariyan 2020a feature selection is considered to be one of the most critical issues in the sample determination process and this supported by machine learning focuses the algorithm on the factors most significant influence on the classification prediction van dao 2020 the relief f method is considered to be one of the most popular methods for performing this task this algorithm has the ability to not only support binary class problems but also to solve binary class problems urbanowicz et al 2018 this algorithm is based on the summaries of the weightings of the factors according to their suitability for the objective saha et al 2020 3 4 5 validation methods statistical measures used to validate the models include true positive tp true negative tn false positive fp false negative fn positive predictive value ppv negative predictive value npv sensitivity sst specificity spf accuracy acc kappa k root mean squared error rmse and reciever operating characteristic roc curve these methods were used to evaluate the performance of models pham et al 2019b for the development of reliable flood susceptibility maps in this study statistical measures ppv and npv are the proportion of pixels that are correctly classified as flood and non flood respectively sst and spf are the rates of the number of flood and non flood pixels acc is one of the most popular metrics that is used to assess the performance of models bennett 2013 janizadeh 2019 this measure is represented by the proportion of the number of pixel flood and non flood pixel cohen s kappa coefficient k is an efficient statistics measure that helps to measure random consensus among classification components it calculates the consensus between the two evaluations variables used to classify n objects into c mutually exclusive sets the value of kappa varies from 0 to 1 where value 1 indicates perfect model performance pham et al 2016 2018 rmse indicates the level of dispersion of predicted values from actual values the model is considered perfect when the rmse value is small roc is one of the most used measures by researchers to assess the predictive capacity and classification quality of the model gorsevski et al 2006 mohammady et al 2012 area under the roc curve auc is often used to quantitatively evaluate the predictive capability of the models value of auc equals to 1 indicates perfect model performance in addition the wilcoxon signed rank test was used to check the statistical differences between the flood models pham et al 2019a this algorithm has been applied widely to verify the statistical significance between models khosravi 2018 to apply this method two values p and z were used with the null hypothesis that the models were not statistically different at the level of 0 05 which was constructed if the z values are higher than the upper limit value 1 96 and lower limit value 1 96 as well as p 0 05 this assumption was rejected therefore the performance of the models is different in terms of statistics dietterich 1998 3 4 6 multi criteria decision analysis mcda mcda methods allow to work with quantitative variables and are applied to decision making processes huang et al 2011 several popular mcda methods used in flood risk assessment are analytical hierarchy process ahp saaty 2003 analytic network process anp saaty and vargas 2006 and ordered weighted averaging owa makropoulos and butler 2006 the integration of mcda methods with gis analytical techniques are used for spatial analysis of various assessments and decision problems malczewski 2006 weighted linear combination wlc method is often used to integrate mcda methods in gis environment malczewski 2000 in this study we used one of the most popular mcda methods namely ahp to generate weights for the indicators the wlc method was then used to incorporate the weighted indicator layers into a gis framework 4 results and analysis 4 1 flood susceptibility assessment map 4 1 1 important factors used for the flood models in the susceptibility modelling it is desirable to remove unnecessary or unimportant factors which might affect the accuracy of the prediction models therefore feature selection techniques are being used to validate and select the important factors for developing machine learning models hoa 2019 in this study relief f which is a popular feature selection method yang et al 2011 was applied in the model study table 2 the results suggest that elevation w 0 7235 rainfall w 0 6729 slope w 0 6069 are the most important influencing factors w 6 for the flood modelling in the study area this is consistent with other similar flood studies degiorgis 2012a garrote and bras 1995 hosseini 2020 shrestha 2014 4 1 2 validation of the models validation of the studied susceptibility models abmdt bdt and dt was carried out using various standard quantitative indices on both training and testing datasets table 3 and fig 9 in terms of training data the results show that the bdt model has a better value of npv 99 115 and sst 99 032 while the abmdt has a better value of ppv 92 183 spf 92 639 and acc 95 280 compared to the other models for validation data the bdt model has the best value of ppv 86 391 npv 99 408 sst 99 320 spf 87 958 and acc 92 899 compared to other models the best k value of 0 906 is for the abmdt model in terms of training data whereas the best k value for the bdt model is 0 858 in terms of testing data the abmdt model has the lowest value of rmse on training dataset 0 197 whereas the bdt model has the lowest rmse value on testing dataset 0 245 table 3 the results of the roc analysis show that the models of bdt and abmdt have better performance with auc 0 977 then the dt model 0 961 in terms of training data for validation data the bdt model has better performance with auc 0 96 followed by the abmdt with auc 0 953 and dt model with auc 0 929 respectively fig 9 wilcoxon signed rank test was carried out to evaluate the significance of the statistical differences of the model performance tables 4 and 5 it can be observed that on both training and testing datasets the z values of the comparative pairs are higher than the upper limit value 1 96 and lower limit value 1 96 and the p values are smaller than the threshold value of 0 05 therefore it can be stated that the differences in the performance of the models are statistical significance in this study 4 1 3 flood susceptibility mapping flood susceptibility indexes of the study area were generated during the training phase of the models these indexes were used for the construction and classification of flood susceptibility maps into five classes very low susceptibility low susceptibility moderate susceptibility high susceptibility and very high susceptibility using natural break classification method fig 10 it can be observed that for the bdt model 15 9 of the study area is located in the very low susceptibility area 45 94 in the low susceptibility area 19 8 in the moderate susceptibility area and 4 682 and 14 49 in the high susceptibility area and very high susceptibility area for the abmdt model 80 13 of the study area is in the very low susceptibility area 2 794 2 83 4 617 and9 626 is in the low moderate high and very high susceptibility areas respectively for the dt model 64 5 of the study area is located in the very low susceptibility area 11 09 5 421 4 045 and 14 94 are located in the low moderate high and very high susceptibility areas respectively fig 11 it is observed that high and very high susceptibility zones are located along rivers in floodplain areas it can be observed that the maps produced by the bdt model show similar results therefore it can be reasonably stated that the flood susceptibility map produced by the bdt model is the most reliable compared with other models thus it was used for developing flood risk map in this study 4 2 flood consequences assessment map in this study we used super decisions software to calculate ahp algorithms whitaker and adams 2005 and the weighted sum tool in arcgis software to integrate the weighted indicator layers into a gis framework the flood consequences on human health and financial impact were analyzed as described in the conceptual framework ahp works by setting priorities for multiple criteria evaluated by experts to derive the best decision saaty 1990 the weights of the criteria in the ahp method are based on subjective assessment of some experts godfrey et al 2015 kienberger et al 2009 kokangül et al 2017 moghadas et al 2019 or based on the author experience assessment dewan 2013 kandilioti and makropoulos 2012 li et al 2013 in the present study we used the author experience based evaluation we also refer to the related studies using ahp to evaluate flood risk criteria dewan 2013 godfrey et al 2015 kienberger et al 2009 kokangül et al 2017 moghadas et al 2019 velasquez and hester 2013 the consequences on human health are assessed by the combination of population density poverty rate road density and number of medical staff fig 12 a the consequences on financial impact are evaluated by considering three indicators of industrial facility density service and commercial density and land use categories fig 12 b the weights of criteria and sub criteria are presented in table 6 we used the integrated ahp wlc to combine indicators in the gis environment the weighted sum tool in arcgis software was used to overlay the weighted indicators weighted in table 6 the final flood consequence map is displayed in fig 12 c 4 3 flood risk assessment map flood risk was assessed in this study by combining the hybrid machine learning bdtmodel based flood susceptibility map and the flood consequences map the flood risk assessment map was created by overlaying the flood susceptibility map and flood consequences map using weighted sum technique in gis environment fig 13 the risk scores were normalized to a range of 0 1 out of the 1 056 609 ha total area of the province 915 264 ha 86 62 is in very low risk areas 54 132 ha 5 12 in low risk areas 48 989 ha 4 64 in medium risk areas 29 308 ha 2 77 in high risk areas and 8 916 ha 0 84 in extremely high risk areas 5 discussion flood is one of the most destructive natural hazards in vietnam requiring systematic study to prevent loss of life and destruction of property for sustainable development therefore developing flood risk maps is a necessary step to help decision makers in flood risk management kourgialas and karatzas 2011 even though various methods and approaches have been proposed and applied to assess flood risk however the complex geo morphological conditions and dynamic human activities which cause changes in the morphology and destruction of forests pose difficulties in predicting flood risks accurately zahar et al 2008 for this reason various algorithms were developed and applied for the flood risk assessment and development of accurate predictive models in this study two advanced hybrid models bdt and abmdt and single dt model were validated and compared to select the best model and map which was integrated with the mcda ahp to develop flood risk map of the quang nam province vietnam validation results show that all developed models bdt abmdt and dt performed well for flood susceptibility assessing and modelling it is reasonable as the dt model is an effective popular machine learning algorithm to solve the classification problem using transforming the data on the table its advantages are i the dt model requires less effort for the data preprocessing process and ii it does not require data standardization which is very easy to understand and intuitive the dt algorithm is sometimes more complicated compared to the other algorithms and takes time to form the prediction model in this study the results also show that the bdt model is the best compared to other models for flood susceptibility mapping in the study area this is appropriate because the bdt model used bagging ensemble which is an excellent ensemble tool to improve the accuracy of individual classification prediction and the radial basis function kernel used in bagging ensemble can enhance the stability of the dt model simultaneously the bootstrap sampling technique used in the bagging model was used to reduce the sensitivity of single classification to noise in training data sets pham and prakash 2019 the model variance is reduced which can improve the accuracy of the individual model like dt breiman 1996 the advantage of the bagging model is presented in the change from the basic classification generalization error to the generalization error calculated on the smaller training data therefore it can be used for the classification which has the learning curves of reduced thai pham 2019 thus the bdt is observed as the best model for flood susceptibility modelling in this study compared with other models abmdt and dt however it is not suitable for linear classifications because of its classifications in addition it cannot be adapted for small or very large training data pham and prakash 2019 skurichina and duin 2002 this finding of this study is also in comparison with other published works arabameri et al 2020 chen 2019 yariyan 2020 in this study flood susceptibility map was combined with the flood consequences assessment map using ahp and wlc techniques to develop a flood risk map whereas the flood susceptibility map was generated by the best hybrid ml model bdt flood consequences reflect the impacts of human health and financial impacts winsemius et al 2013 we devised criteria for human health impact including population density road density poverty rate and healthcare facility and criteria for financial impact including industrial facility density service and commercial facility density and land use categories in literature some studies have additionally focused on flood risk assessment in terms of combining flood vulnerability and flood hazards such as scheuer et al 2011 masuya 2014 and lee et al 2013 several studies analyzed flood risk in the combination of hazard exposure and vulnerability foudi et al 2015 winsemius et al 2013 some recent studies focused on the consequences of flood risk since the consequences reflect the potential impacts of flood hazard albano et al 2014 jato espino et al 2019 in this study we assessed flood risk by combining flood susceptibility and flood consequences which is a suitable approach for flood risk assessment in quang nam province vietnam finally mcda is used to incorporate the flood susceptibility and consequences components in flood risk modelling mcda methods are often used in the risk analysis due to several advantages such as criteria and sub criteria systematization ishizaka and labib 2009 suitability for gis integration malczewski 2006 and consistency in judgment koczkodaj 2017 the flood risk assessment map shows high flood risk zones locations which are required to be managed on a priority basis in general the integration of a hybrid intelligence model for flood susceptibility map and mcda for flood consequences map is a good approach for developing a reliable flood risk map in data scarce areas also in addition when we compared the flood risk assessment map of this study with the quang nam inundation map of chau et al 2013 and luu et al 2018 it is observed that the high flood risk areas are located close to and along rivers that are in and around floodplain areas the result is compatible with previous studies such as ho and umitsu 2011 chau et al 2013 and luu et al 2018 the flooding occurs in the low lying areas of vu gia thu bon river basin and affects districts of dai loc hoi an dien ban duy xuyen nong son que son and tam ky 6 concluding remarks in this study we developed a soft computing based flook risk framework in which the flood risk map was generated by combing a flood susceptibility map and a flood consequences map the flood susceptibility map was created using a hybrid ai model bdt and the flood consequences map was created by using ahp technique the case study was quang nam province vietnam validation results show that all the proposed models performed well for constructing flood susceptibility map however the performance of the bdt model auc 0 96 is the best in comparison to other models namely abmdt auc 0 953 and dt auc 0 929 thus the flood susceptibility map produced by bdt is the best map which was combined with a consequences map to develop a reliable flood risk map of the study area in general the ai or ml integrated with mcda approach is a suitable framework and approach for developing a reliable flood risk map that can be used and applied in other flood prone areas considering local geo environmental conditions advantage of this approach is that it does not require time series meteorological and streamflow data or updated river cross section data which are not readily available in many data scarce areas however this study has two main limitations first we can not analyze the frequency of flood events in the flood susceptibility mapping since ai or ml models use flood and non flood locations as a dependent variable and flood influencing factors as predictors second the proposed integrated approach needs to be validated in other flood prone areas of vietnam declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or

4999,the assessment of nutrients delivered to aquatic ecosystems is important for water quality controls mainly due to the complex terrains and subsurface hydrological systems in karst regions it is challenging to understand nutrient delivery pathways and quantify contributions of various sources to surface waterbodies in karst basins e g via the use of mechanistic models to resolve this issue a statistical water quality model i e the spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes sparrow model was tested to estimate the mean annual transport concentration and yield of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n contributed by natural and human sources in the wujiang river basin wrb in southwest china where the nutrient inputs and pathways have been significantly altered by anthropogenic activities overall the modelling results explained about 86 of the variability in the observed mean annual nh4 n fluxes attesting the applicability of the sparrow model for estimating nh4 n transport at mean annual time scales in karst basins moreover the results indicated that the anthropogenic sources i e fertilizer livestock manure and waste water were the main origins of nh4 n accounting for a total load of 66 8 in waterbodies in addition the leakage of nh4 n into groundwater from the karst area was evaluated leading to a reduction of nh4 n delivery to surface waterbodies for about 36 9 with a range from 31 3 to 52 2 in the seven main subbasins in the wrb the damming effect of the constructed reservoirs on the nh4 n delivery differed noticeably with the lowest reduction rate 2 4 in the suofengying reservoir and the highest rate 79 1 in the hongfenghu reservoir it was found that the interception efficiency of lake type reservoirs was generally higher than that of river type reservoirs in the wrb the results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of the sparrow model for evaluating nutrient transport and pathways in karst regions which can provide critical information for better management to control nutrients in those regions keywords water quality karst the sparrow model ammonium nitrogen the wujiang river basin 1 introduction nutrient availability is one of the key factors for controlling water quality in aquatic ecosystems excessive nutrients in aquatic systems can affect ecosystem integrity human health drinking water supplies and local amenities abbaspour et al 2007 perrin et al 2014 therefore it is important to understand the pathways through which nutrients of various natural and anthropogenic sources enter aquatic ecosystems although numerous studies have showed the impacts of environmental factors such as climate topography soil and vegetation on nutrient transport pathways kyllmar et al 2006 qin et al 2010 it is still a grand challenge to reliably estimate nutrient transport in large basins with complex river networks which is further complicated by variations in landscapes and removal processes chen et al 2019 karst regions are of hydrological ecological and socioeconomic significance with unique topography and subsurface structures han et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 which cover 10 of the earth surface and provide drinking water to 25 of the world population kalhor et al 2019 however intensive human activities in those regions such as agriculture and urbanization have significantly changed the nutrient inputs and pathways from natural conditions li et al 2020 moreover with the demands for water resources allocation and flood control a large portion of rivers in karst regions in southwest china have been impounded and their hydrological continuity has been altered li et al 2016 the dams can affect local biogeochemical cycles in many different ways for example numerous studies focused on the interception effect of reservoirs on nutrient transport seitzinger et al 2002 wang et al 2010 as the interception by dams can considerably reduce the delivery flux and promote the accumulation of nutrients in reservoirs harrison et al 2009 these changes can further break the balance of local ecosystems for instance the excess nutrients might increase the risk of algal bloom and deteriorate aquatic habitats w wang et al 2019 process based mechanistic models have been widely used in evaluating nutrient transport in non karst basins which vary considerably in model structures and governing equations used to depict the pathways and interactions of nutrients with surrounding environments singh et al 2005 hashemi et al 2016 however intensive data requirements of process based models e g land use types soil parameters čerkasova et al 2018 for simulating nutrient transport generally limit the application of those models in karst basins primarily owing to their complex subsurface systems that are composed of karst fissures pipelines and caves jiang et al 2014 these subsurface features can promote the leakage of surface water to groundwater and thus exert significant impacts on nutrient transport tooth and fairchild 2003 song et al 2019 therefore the development of suitable models other than process based models for karst regions has attracted much attention in scientific communities over the past several decades hartmann et al 2014 amin et al 2016 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n is an important nutrient that commonly exists in products from human activities like fertilizer livestock excrement and waste water most nh4 n is fixed through microorganisms and the haber bosch process of which 80 is used as agricultural fertilizer and 20 as feedstock for industrial processes fowler et al 2013 additionally nh4 n can be decomposed from organic matter through ammonification with high activities nh4 n can be transformed to nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 nitrogen through nitrification and to nitrogen n2 through anammox reactions or be assimilated and converted to organic nitrogen by plants and bacteria xia et al 2018 as nh4 n can tremendously affect local water quality peterson et al 2001 it is of great importance to estimate the sources and transport pathways of nh4 n for water quality management however as mentioned before it is extremely difficult for process based models to simulate the transport of nh4 n at regional scales in karst regions with limited observational data and high uncertainties in model parameterizations malagò et al 2016 hartmann et al 2014 to this end statistic models may provide alternatives for assessing nutrient transport in karst regions as they allow extracting information from available data with minimum assumptions and thus are more appropriate for hydrological systems with unknown nutrient flow pathways li et al 2015 here the spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes sparrow model was used in this study which is a statistical water quality model designed for basin scale studies on nutrient transport smith et al 1997 the sparrow model integrates the information on nutrient sources and landscape properties to quantify nutrient transport the model has been extensively used in non karst regions in canada china japan new zealand spain and the u s with satisfactory performance results smith et al 1997 alexander et al 2002 2007 aguilera et al 2012 wellen et al 2012 duan et al 2015 li et al 2015 furthermore the model performed well in assessing nutrient transport in large scale reservoirs brown et al 2011 morales marín et al 2017 as well as in simulating scenarios with changing nutrient sources or landscape conditions garcia et al 2011 alshawaf et al 2016 in spite of its wide applications the applicability of the sparrow model in karst regions has not been tested which might provide an additional avenue for modelling nutrient transport in karst regions with complex terrains and subsurface systems as the first attempt the main objectives of this study were to 1 test the applicability of the sparrow model in karst regions and 2 quantify the nh4 n sources via natural and anthropogenic inputs and assess their transport processes affected by various natural and anthropogenic factors particularly the impacts of karst geology and reservoirs on the regional nh4 n transport to this end the wujiang river basin wrb a large karst basin located in southwest china was selected where the nutrient inputs and pathways have been significantly altered by anthropogenic activities in recent years based on the model results an assessment for different management strategies was also made it was expected that the sparrow model could assist with policy decision support for better management in controlling nh4 n in karst regions 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the wrb is located in guizhou province in southwest china fig 1 it is the one of the largest tributaries in the yangtze river basin with a drainage area of 66 807 km2 the wrb lies in a subtropical monsoon climate zone with a mean annual temperature of 12 3 c where the respective highest and lowest temperature is in july 26 c on average and january 3 5 c the mean annual precipitation p is around 1000 mm with 75 of p occurring in summer months the main land use types in the wrb are cultivated land grass land and forest land due to the mountainous terrains the cultivated lands are mainly distributed in topographic depressions and valleys while grass lands are scattered along hillsides for grazing the forests are dominated by coniferous and deciduous trees han et al 2014 the urban population in guizhou province is only about 35 of the total population with the population density decreasing from southwest to northeast about 70 of the wrb belongs to karst landscapes fig 2 which are characterized by thin soil layers underlain by carbonate rocks and complicated groundwater systems in the past several decades intensive human activities e g deforestation and overgrazing have led to significant soil erosion and rock desertification which subsequently caused serious environmental hazards such as landslides and floods yuan 1997 the rock desertification in the karst area has been recognized as a major hindrance for local agricultural development li et al 2020 and also poses tremendous effects on hydrologic processes particularly on runoff generation processes for instance the loss of soil and vegetation in karst fractures increased the water leakage to groundwater systems and decreased the resistance to overland flow in areas with high relief jiang et al 2014 there are seven main subbasins in the wrb according to the tributary areas fig 1 including the sancha river scr the liuchong river lcr the yachi river ycr the maotiao river mtr the qingshui river qsr the xiang river xr and the wujiang mainstream wjm subbasins the scr and lcr subbasins represent the upstream area the ycr mtr qsr and xr subbasins represent the midstream area and the wjm subbasin belongs to the downstream area the main stream has a mean annual water discharge of 5 34 1010 m3 which accounts for approximately 47 of the total surface water runoff in guizhou province huang et al 2017 the abundant waterflow and large altitude drop make the wrb ideal for exploiting hydropower which led to the construction of several large scale reservoirs along the rivers in the wrb liu et al 2011 b wang et al 2019 these reservoirs are for multiple purposes including hydropower generation agricultural irrigation human and animal water consumption and flood risk management feng et al 2009 2 2 description of the sparrow model the statistical sparrow model was developed by the usgs which combines water quality observations with landscape and nutrient information to estimate annual averaged nutrient loads exported from land surface to waterbodies this model requires less data than numerical mechanistic models and also overcomes the shortcomings of traditional regression based statistical models by including mass balance constrained components e g flow pathways and decay processes non linear interactions of nutrients with landscapes and spatially distributed basin attributes alexander et al 2000 2002 the model is generally applied in large scale basins due to the use of statistic approaches in the model it performs well in identifying nutrient sources analyzing environmental factors and evaluating water quality schwarz et al 2006 to be self contained a brief description of the sparrow model is provided here and the detailed information can be found elsewhere in the literature schwarz et al 2006 the estimated load of nutrients is computed by the following equation 1 where f i represents the estimated load leaving the reach i the first term a at the right side of eq 1 is the amount of flux that is delivered to the downstream reach i from the adjacent upstream reach j if measured data are available in the upstream reach j f j is set to be equal to measured fluxes as f j m otherwise f j is given by estimated fluxes in the model the parameter δ i is the fraction of the upstream flux delivered to reach i and set to 1 if there are no diversions the lumped term a z i s z i r θ s θ r is the delivery function for streams and reservoirs representing attenuation processes along the water pathway the same for a z i s z i r θ s θ r in the term b this function defines the fraction of the flux in reach i that is delivered to the downstream node i e i 1 by the following two equations based on the reach types i e stream or reservoir 2 a z i s θ s exp c 1 c s θ sc t c i s 3 a z i r θ r 1 1 θ r q i r 1 the factor a is a function of stream or reservoir characteristics denoted by the vectors z i s i e t c i s in this study represents the mean travel time as the quotient of the stream length to the mean velocity of the flow along the water pathway and z i r i e q i r in this study represents the areal hydraulic load as the quotient of the outflow discharge to the water area of the reservoir with θ s and θ r being the corresponding coefficient vectors the notation c s in eq 2 is the number of stream classes defined by the intervals of mean streamflow the second lumped term b is the amount of the flux that is originated from the subbasin i directly transported to reach i the parameter s n i is the source n in the subbasin i contributed to reach i with the corresponding coefficient α n the term d n z i d θ d represents the net impact of the environment factor z i d on nutrient transport in subbasin i with the corresponding coefficient θ d described by the following equation 4 d n z i d θ d exp m 1 m d ω nm z m i d θ dm the notation md is the number of environment factors and ω nm is an indicator with a value of 1 or 0 for whether the environment factor m affects source n all the coefficients in the above equations are calibrated by a non linear least square method between the observation and prediction in this study the model performance was evaluated by several indexes the significance level of the variables p value the coefficient of determination r2 root mean square error rmse the error in model predictions the spatial distribution of residuals the difference between prediction and observation and robustness of coefficients bootstrap estimation 2 3 data preparation in order to run the sparrow model for the time period from 2010 to 2012 several types of data were required including hydrological stream networks water quality and flow rate records nutrient exports from different sources and environment settings of the basin schwarz et al 2006 2 3 1 stream network and flow data in this study a digital elevation model dem of a spatial resolution of 30 m from the geospatial data cloud site http www gscloud cn was used to derive the stream network in the wrb using arcgis version 10 2 see the supplementary materials there were 220 reaches delineated in the wrb with 12 reservoirs fig 3 due to the lack of flow data at some reaches the annual streamflow rates at those reaches were estimated by the budyko model zhang et al 2004 through annual p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 in the following equation 5 q p 1 1 α e 0 1 1 α 1 α e 0 the annual p data were obtained from the resource and environment data cloud platform redcp http www resdc cn and the annual e 0 data were retrieved from the modis16a3 dataset https lpdaac usgs gov the parameter α in eq 5 was calibrated at 30 hydrological stations in the wrb with flow records from 2010 to 2012 fig 4 then the model was applied to predict the annual streamflow rates of unmonitored reaches which was then combined with the manning equation to estimate the mean flow velocity based on statistical approaches schulze et al 2005 2 3 2 nh4 n load flux there were 16 monitoring stations with monthly nh4 n concentration data and 13 stations with yearly averaged nh4 n concentration data during 2010 2012 from the hydrology and water resources bureau of guizhou province the mean annual load of 2010 to 2012 was estimated by the following equation 6 load c i q i the c i represents the mean annual concentration of nh4 n at 29 sites and the q i is the mean annual streamflow rate computed in section 2 3 1 see fig s1 for the comparison of monthly based and yearly based mean annual load estimation in the supplementary materials the loads of nh4 n were used for the model calibration 2 3 3 nh4 n sources the nh4 n in the wrb was mostly from fertilizer livestock manure waste water and natural organic matter li et al 2013 li and ji 2016 the mostly used nitrogen fertilizer in the wrb was urea which contains two amino groups in one molecule nh2 2co the nh4 n input from the fertilizer application to the land surface was estimated from the county based yearbook around 2010 while the nh4 n input from livestock manures to the land surface was estimated from the dataset of the first china pollution census the atmospheric deposition of nh4 n was neglected in this study as the simulation results in l zhang et al 2018 indicated that the nh4 n deposition in the wrb was 4 kg ha 1 year 1 which was much less than the loads from fertilizer 36 kg ha 1 year 1 and manure 25 kg ha 1 year 1 the land use types i e cultivated land grass land and forest land data were obtained from the redcp were used as surrogates for non point sources i e the nh4 n from agriculture grazing and nature respectively additionally the population data from the redcp were used as the surrogate for anthropogenic nh4 n sources for example the loads from sewage industrial waste water all the above mentioned data were compiled for the 220 subbasins in the supplementary materials figs s2 s8 2 3 4 land to water delivery factors to consider the impacts of environmental factors on the delivery of nh4 n from land to waterbodies several variables of climate and landscape were included in this study these variables have been widely recognized as important factors for controlling the transport of nutrients for example p could promote the delivery of nutrients through runoff generation morales marín et al 2017 while high soil permeability could promote infiltration and remove nutrients from soil robertson and saad 2011 specifically p air temperature and soil texture datasets were compiled from the redcp the stream density and slope datasets were extracted from the dem data the soil permeability was estimated from the rosseta model according to the soil texture y zhang et al 2018 to examine the karstification impact on the nh4 n transport the carbonate rock distribution was extracted from the hydrogeological map from the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences http www karst cgs gov cn these variables were allocated to the 220 subbasins figs s9 s14 in the supplementary materials and then input and tested in the model the typical karst characteristics of fissure and pipeline are mainly developed in the pure carbonate area and the corresponding storage capacity could increase the transit times lauber and goldscheider 2014 zhang et al 2020a in addition several studies have found that there was a large amount of surface nutrients leaked to groundwater in karst regions under laboratory or field conditions wei et al 2011 peng et al 2019 therefore the leaked nh4 n in carbonate aquifers could be stored and converted to other nitrogen forms e g to no3 n through nitrification and or n2 through anammox before being delivered to surface waters zhang et al 2020b however with the complex terrains and subsurface structures it was hard to obtain detailed hydrogeological data in the wrb region thus the distribution of the pure carbonate area fig 2 was used to represent the net effect from karstification on the nh4 n transport 2 4 model setup and calibration the sparrow model parameters were calibrated through a non linear least square regression method schwarz et al 2006 different combinations of nh4 n sources and environmental factors were tested based on the assessment indexes used in this study e g p value and r2 and the best specification was chosen for the wrb in this study 8 variables were selected from the 16 variables listed in table 1 for nh4 n sources the population and forest land were chosen to represent anthropogenic e g fertilizer manure waste sewage and industrial water and natural e g nh4 n decomposed from organic matter in soil and defoliation sources respectively see correlation analysis in the supplementary materials the climate in the wrb is of a sub humid type with mean annual p ranging roughly from 800 mm year to 1200 mm year the abundant p leads to large surface runoff and infiltration thus delivering a significant amount of nh4 n into adjacent waterbodies and groundwater in addition a significant portion of the wrb is covered by carbonate rocks with the high solubility of carbonate rocks there are generally well developed groundwater systems underlain the carbonate areas which may have a profound impact on the transport of nh4 n for the nh4 n decay processes in waterbodies the model took the characteristics of stream and reservoir into consideration in order to quantify the theoretical maximum reduction in the nh4 n transport associated with the carbonate area the predicted load was compared with a hypothetical scenario without the impact of the carbonate area therefore the difference between these two scenarios could indicate the reduction proportion of nh4 n by the leakage effect due to carbonate rocks it should be noted that the estimation was based on the simplification that possible changes associated with the carbonate area were not considered in the hypothetical scenario i e the simulated processes such as runoff generation might be changed when the carbonate area was excluded as for the evaluation of the nh4 n loads intercepted by the reservoir the difference between the input and output loads of the reservoir was estimated based on the model simulation the input loads into the reservoir were the sum of the loads from upstream external sources and adjacent areas internal sources the output loads were that delivered to the adjacent downstream reach of the reservoir the interception efficiency was then defined as the quotient of interception loads to input loads 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation the simulation results from the sparrow model in the wrb explained about 86 of the variability in the log transformed i e for better illustration of the values in different orders of magnitude mean annual nh4 n loads fig 5a the rmse value of the model results 0 74 and the bootstrap coefficients of variables also showed good robustness of the model table 2 the p values for the source variables e g population and carbonate area were 0 05 the decay of nh4 n in streams showed a p value of 0 053 while the variables of p forest land and reservoir decay did not show good correlations note that except for the significance level the interpretability of model results is another important metric for assessing model performances zhou et al 2018 in this study the population distribution and forest land represented the nh4 n from anthropogenic and natural sources respectively with the low surface runoff coefficient and widely distributed carbonate areas in karst regions p tended to promote surface nh4 n infiltration into groundwater peng et al 2019 and the long transit times could promote nh4 n in carbonate aquifers to be stored and converted to other nitrogen forms zhang et al 2020b whereas biogeochemical processes e g nitrification assimilation and deposition in streams and reservoirs were related to decay processes in the model i e the instream loss in table 2 was depicted by stream velocity and length in eq 2 and the reservoir attenuation was depicted by water area and discharge in eq 3 these variables were all physically important for interpreting the transport of nh4 n several reasons might lead to the insignificance of the variables such as insufficient observations for model calibrations spatial heterogeneities of model variables and uncertainties of measured data schwarz et al 2006 the spatial distribution of the log transformed residuals is presented in fig 5b which provides information as to whether the model overestimated or underestimated nh4 n loads compared to observations fig 5b indicates that the model tended to underestimate the load for headwaters likely due to the uncertainties in predicted streamflow in headwaters i e the comparatively larger deviation for low streamflow in fig 4 overall the positive and negative residuals were uniformly distributed across the wrb rather than centered in a particular area suggesting that the model had been adequately specified mcmahon et al 2003 3 2 source contribution load flux and concentration prediction for nh4 n the model estimated the contributions of nh4 n loads into waterbodies from both anthropogenic and natural sources for the 220 subbasins in the wrb with the respective average contribution of 66 8 and 33 2 the source contributions for the seven main subbasins are presented in fig 6a which shows that nh4 n was mainly derived from anthropogenic sources in the upstream and midstream subbasins 70 these subbasins cover most of the urban areas in the wrb where industrial and municipal sewage provided large quantities of nh4 n in addition the percentage of cultivated and grass lands was also relatively high in the upstream and midstream areas leading to intensive fertilizer use and manure from grazing in contrast forest lands were centered in the downstream area i e wjm where the contributions of nh4 n from natural and anthropogenic sources were approximately equal another reason for the relatively lower anthropogenic contribution in the wjm was the lack of large cities which gave little industrial or sewage wastewater to waterbodies the three year averaged nh4 n loads i e 2010 2012 through the 220 reaches are displayed in fig 6b the load from each reach was contributed by local and adjacent upstream sources with the accumulation of nh4 n along the stream higher loads were expected in the downstream area moreover among the 12 reservoirs located along the tributaries and main stream the interception efficiency of nh4 n varied noticeably more discussion in section 3 3 the decay processes of nh4 n in streams might be owing to the algae absorption and nitrification wang et al 2002 by comparison the decreased delivery flux in reaches closer to the basin outlet could be owing to less loads delivered from tributaries nearby since the sparrow model was implemented with first order decay rates in streams i e the decay rate is proportional to the nh4 n flux the amount of nh4 n that decayed in downstream reaches with higher nh4 n fluxes was larger and the reduction in nh4 n fluxes was thus more pronounced for reaches adjacent to urban areas especially to the cities of guiyang and zunyi higher loads might be owing to the large amount of industrial and municipal wastewater lang et al 2006 li et al 2010 to assess nh4 n yields the load of locally delivered nh4 n per square kilometer was estimated for each of the 220 subbasins to represent the spatial variations in the nh4 n yield intensity fig 6c overall the yield intensity tended to be higher in the upstream and midstream areas while it was lower in the downstream area which concurred with the distribution pattern of population e g the population density decreased from southwest to northeast also note that the area around the cities tended to yield more nh4 n owing to the inputs from industry and municipal sewage hence the results indicated that the anthropogenic nh4 n sources exerted a larger impact on the nh4 n transport in the wrb based on the transport load and streamflow data the three year averaged concentration of nh4 n from 2010 to 2012 was shown in fig 6d the reaches with higher nh4 n concentrations were mainly located near headwater and city areas especially around guiyang and zunyi with the highest values in the wrb as for headwater reaches higher nh4 n concentrations might be caused by lower streamflow rates and thus less dilution e g no upstream water input according to the national environmental quality standards for surface water https www mee gov cn the proportion of reaches with nh4 n concentrations less than that of level iii 1 mg l was 82 7 13 6 for level iv 1 to 1 5 mg l and v 1 5 to 2 mg l and the rest higher than level v 2 mg l note that among the reaches with nh4 n concentrations 1 mg l headwaters accounted for 65 8 which underscored the importance of headwaters in affecting the water quality of the wrb fig 6e presents the proportion of the nh4 n load from the 220 reaches that was delivered to the basin outlet with the long distance transport and interception of the reservoirs in the upstream and midstream areas there was a large amount of the nh4 n load decayed in waterbodies and only a small portion was delivered to the outlet by contrast a higher proportion of the nh4 n load delivered to the outlet was from the downstream area based on the delivery proportion map the contributions of the nh4 n load from the 220 reaches to the outlet are shown in fig 6f further highlighting the importance of transport distances in affecting the nh4 n transport at basin scales overall 2 8 of the nh4 n load delivered to the outlet was from the upstream area 21 1 from the midstream area and 76 1 from the downstream area fig 6g 3 3 factors controlling nh4 n transport 3 3 1 leakage effect in the karst area in this study the parameter of the carbonate area was negative in the model table 2 indicating that the carbonate area was negatively related to the amount of nh4 n transported to streams part of the reason was that the groundwater systems could act as a net sink for nh4 n by increasing residence times of nh4 n and degrading nh4 n through biogeochemical processes zhang et al 2020b and thus reduce the load from land surface to surface waterbodies the distribution of carbonate areas is shown in fig 2 and the proportion of pure carbonate areas in the seven subbasins ranged from 42 7 to 61 9 the estimation of leakage effect on the nh4 n transport was based on the comparison between two scenarios as mentioned in section 2 4 overall the transport reduction in nh4 n due to the leakage effect was about 36 9 for the wrb for the seven main subbasins the reduction rate ranged from 31 3 to 52 2 which was generally higher in areas with larger carbonate coverage fig 7 for example the highest reduction was found in the qsr with the largest carbonate coverage although the carbonate coverage in the mtr was close to that for the qsr the reduction differed noticeably between the two subbasins possible reasons could be attributed to a the qsr was more adjacent to the guiyang city and therefore received more anthropogenic loads that were leaked into groundwater b there were two large reservoirs i e hfh and bhh located in the mtr with higher interception efficiencies for the nh4 n transport see the next section for detailed discussions decreasing the reduction from leakage and c the spatial distributions of the carbonate area and p intensity were different between the two subbasins which might lead to different combined effects on surface nh4 n transport as p could tremendously promote infiltration and leakage of nh4 n to groundwater in carbonate areas moreover the higher reduction rate in the xr might be also owing to its adjacency to the zunyi city for the other four subbasins scr lcr ycr and wjm the reduction rates were lower due to their relatively low carbonate coverage due to the well developed groundwater systems in the wrb the leakage of surface water had a significant impact on the nh4 n transport which made the groundwater systems in the karst area more vulnerable to nutrient inputs and thus the deterioration of water quality doerfliger et al 1999 for example in the areas adjacent to guiyang and zunyi no3 n and nh4 n were found in groundwater owing to human activities from fertilizer usage and industrial and sewage wastewater discharges lang et al 2006 li et al 2010 liu et al 2006 3 3 2 reservoir interception twelve reservoirs were located in the main stream and tributaries of the wrb the reservoirs not only were important in regional water resources management but also had large impacts on regional ecology the parameters used in the estimation of the reservoir interception were summarized in table 3 the definition of each parameter was given in section 2 4 the hjd reservoir had the largest interception load 699 tons year 1 with an interception efficiency of 46 1 which could be attributed to the following three characteristics a the water depth was low which could promote the exchange of nh4 n between surface water and sediments wang et al 2002 b the hjd reservoir resided in the upstream area meaning relatively lower streamflow rates and thus higher residence times of nh4 n in the reservoir and c the water area of the hjd reservoir was relatively large 41 85 km2 making nh4 n prone to escape via the water atmosphere interface these conditions are conducive to related biogeochemical processes such as nitrification algae absorption and sedimentation zhang et al 2009 in contrast for the wjd reservoir with a water area of 40 35 km2 which was located in the midstream with more input loads from upstream rivers the interception efficiency was only 20 3 most likely owing to its higher streamflow rates the results indicated that only four reservoirs hfh hjd bhh and pz had the interception efficiency of 40 while the interception efficiency of the other eight reservoirs ranged from 2 4 to 25 3 by comparing these two groups high efficiency group and low efficiency group as shown in fig 8 for a demonstration purpose it is clear that the reservoirs of the high efficiency group were mostly located in the upstream of either the wrb or the tributaries suggesting longer residence times of nh4 n in those reservoirs for the removal of nh4 n in addition these reservoirs generally had larger or more lake type water areas which were conducive to the biogeochemical processes of nh4 n as explained previously morales marín et al 2017 for the reservoirs that resembled river type shapes e g wjd high streamflow rates most likely led to the lower interception efficiencies of nh4 n besides their shorter residence times the narrow shapes of those reservoirs were not conducive to the nh4 n decay processes due to comparatively smaller surface water areas in short the results revealed that the interception efficiency of lake type reservoirs was generally higher than that of river type reservoirs in the wrb which is critical for understanding the damming effect on biogeochemical processes in karst regions li et al 2020 3 4 management strategy optimization the sparrow model has been extended to include a web based decision support system for managing water quality in the contiguous u s booth et al 2011 based on scenario simulations e g changes in land use and or fertilizer usage amount the model can be used to evaluate the impact of different management strategies on nutrient transport within the wrb 82 7 of the reaches showed nh4 n concentrations at level iii 1 mg l however for the scr ycr qsr and xr subbasins the proportion of reaches with nh4 n concentrations 1 mg l was considerably higher 37 5 24 1 25 and 26 7 respectively generally those reaches with high nh4 n concentrations were distributed in the headwater areas or the areas adjacent to cities as for the target of 80 of reaches with the nh4 n concentrations 1 mg l level iii in the seven subbasins the optimized management should be focused on the scr ycr qsr and xr subbasins since natural inputs of nh4 n were mainly from the decomposition of soil organic matter and thus difficult to be constrained the management control was implemented by simulating different scenarios of anthropogenic inputs to provide useful information for watershed management and policy making 3 scenarios including the decreases of 10 20 and 30 in anthropogenic sources were simulated and the associated water quality improvement is shown in fig 9 for lcr and ycr when the anthropogenic inputs were decreased by 30 and 10 respectively the water quality control target was achieved whereas it failed to reach the same target in qsr and xr even with the 30 reduction in anthropogenic inputs the likely reason was the large amount of nh4 n input to the qsr and xr reaches from the city areas therefore further optimizations e g moving industry to the area away from cities or decentralizing population in urban areas are needed for better management of nh4 n to reach the set control targets for qsr and xr 4 conclusions in this study a water quality model sparrow was constructed for the wujiang river basin the model estimated the mean annual transport concentration and yield of nh4 n from 2010 to 2012 the impacts of two important factors on nh4 n transport including the leakage effect due to the carbonate area and the interception effect from reservoirs were analyzed according to the model results water quality improvement strategies were recommended the conclusions of this study were as follows 1 anthropogenic sources were the main origin of nh4 n in the wujiang river basin in the upstream and midstream areas anthropogenic sources contributed 70 of nh4 n to waterbodies while the contributions from anthropogenic and natural sources were equally important in the downstream area 2 the leakage of surface water could make reduction in the transport of nh4 n for about 36 9 with a range from 31 3 to 52 2 in the seven main subbasins generally the leakage effect was more significant in subbasins with higher carbonate area coverage 3 the interception efficiency differed among the 12 reservoirs in the wujiang river basin the flow rate and water area of reservoirs were the primary factors affecting the interception efficiency 4 as for the target of 80 reaches to reach water quality of level iii the sancha river and yachi river subbasins needed a reduction of 30 and 10 in nh4 n from anthropogenic sources respectively however for the xiang river and qingshui river subbasins a further reduction was required to reach the target of 80 credit authorship contribution statement yibin dai conceptualization methodology writing original

4999,the assessment of nutrients delivered to aquatic ecosystems is important for water quality controls mainly due to the complex terrains and subsurface hydrological systems in karst regions it is challenging to understand nutrient delivery pathways and quantify contributions of various sources to surface waterbodies in karst basins e g via the use of mechanistic models to resolve this issue a statistical water quality model i e the spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes sparrow model was tested to estimate the mean annual transport concentration and yield of ammonium nitrogen nh4 n contributed by natural and human sources in the wujiang river basin wrb in southwest china where the nutrient inputs and pathways have been significantly altered by anthropogenic activities overall the modelling results explained about 86 of the variability in the observed mean annual nh4 n fluxes attesting the applicability of the sparrow model for estimating nh4 n transport at mean annual time scales in karst basins moreover the results indicated that the anthropogenic sources i e fertilizer livestock manure and waste water were the main origins of nh4 n accounting for a total load of 66 8 in waterbodies in addition the leakage of nh4 n into groundwater from the karst area was evaluated leading to a reduction of nh4 n delivery to surface waterbodies for about 36 9 with a range from 31 3 to 52 2 in the seven main subbasins in the wrb the damming effect of the constructed reservoirs on the nh4 n delivery differed noticeably with the lowest reduction rate 2 4 in the suofengying reservoir and the highest rate 79 1 in the hongfenghu reservoir it was found that the interception efficiency of lake type reservoirs was generally higher than that of river type reservoirs in the wrb the results of this study demonstrate the usefulness of the sparrow model for evaluating nutrient transport and pathways in karst regions which can provide critical information for better management to control nutrients in those regions keywords water quality karst the sparrow model ammonium nitrogen the wujiang river basin 1 introduction nutrient availability is one of the key factors for controlling water quality in aquatic ecosystems excessive nutrients in aquatic systems can affect ecosystem integrity human health drinking water supplies and local amenities abbaspour et al 2007 perrin et al 2014 therefore it is important to understand the pathways through which nutrients of various natural and anthropogenic sources enter aquatic ecosystems although numerous studies have showed the impacts of environmental factors such as climate topography soil and vegetation on nutrient transport pathways kyllmar et al 2006 qin et al 2010 it is still a grand challenge to reliably estimate nutrient transport in large basins with complex river networks which is further complicated by variations in landscapes and removal processes chen et al 2019 karst regions are of hydrological ecological and socioeconomic significance with unique topography and subsurface structures han et al 2014 jiang et al 2014 which cover 10 of the earth surface and provide drinking water to 25 of the world population kalhor et al 2019 however intensive human activities in those regions such as agriculture and urbanization have significantly changed the nutrient inputs and pathways from natural conditions li et al 2020 moreover with the demands for water resources allocation and flood control a large portion of rivers in karst regions in southwest china have been impounded and their hydrological continuity has been altered li et al 2016 the dams can affect local biogeochemical cycles in many different ways for example numerous studies focused on the interception effect of reservoirs on nutrient transport seitzinger et al 2002 wang et al 2010 as the interception by dams can considerably reduce the delivery flux and promote the accumulation of nutrients in reservoirs harrison et al 2009 these changes can further break the balance of local ecosystems for instance the excess nutrients might increase the risk of algal bloom and deteriorate aquatic habitats w wang et al 2019 process based mechanistic models have been widely used in evaluating nutrient transport in non karst basins which vary considerably in model structures and governing equations used to depict the pathways and interactions of nutrients with surrounding environments singh et al 2005 hashemi et al 2016 however intensive data requirements of process based models e g land use types soil parameters čerkasova et al 2018 for simulating nutrient transport generally limit the application of those models in karst basins primarily owing to their complex subsurface systems that are composed of karst fissures pipelines and caves jiang et al 2014 these subsurface features can promote the leakage of surface water to groundwater and thus exert significant impacts on nutrient transport tooth and fairchild 2003 song et al 2019 therefore the development of suitable models other than process based models for karst regions has attracted much attention in scientific communities over the past several decades hartmann et al 2014 amin et al 2016 ammonium nitrogen nh4 n is an important nutrient that commonly exists in products from human activities like fertilizer livestock excrement and waste water most nh4 n is fixed through microorganisms and the haber bosch process of which 80 is used as agricultural fertilizer and 20 as feedstock for industrial processes fowler et al 2013 additionally nh4 n can be decomposed from organic matter through ammonification with high activities nh4 n can be transformed to nitrite no2 and nitrate no3 nitrogen through nitrification and to nitrogen n2 through anammox reactions or be assimilated and converted to organic nitrogen by plants and bacteria xia et al 2018 as nh4 n can tremendously affect local water quality peterson et al 2001 it is of great importance to estimate the sources and transport pathways of nh4 n for water quality management however as mentioned before it is extremely difficult for process based models to simulate the transport of nh4 n at regional scales in karst regions with limited observational data and high uncertainties in model parameterizations malagò et al 2016 hartmann et al 2014 to this end statistic models may provide alternatives for assessing nutrient transport in karst regions as they allow extracting information from available data with minimum assumptions and thus are more appropriate for hydrological systems with unknown nutrient flow pathways li et al 2015 here the spatially referenced regression on watershed attributes sparrow model was used in this study which is a statistical water quality model designed for basin scale studies on nutrient transport smith et al 1997 the sparrow model integrates the information on nutrient sources and landscape properties to quantify nutrient transport the model has been extensively used in non karst regions in canada china japan new zealand spain and the u s with satisfactory performance results smith et al 1997 alexander et al 2002 2007 aguilera et al 2012 wellen et al 2012 duan et al 2015 li et al 2015 furthermore the model performed well in assessing nutrient transport in large scale reservoirs brown et al 2011 morales marín et al 2017 as well as in simulating scenarios with changing nutrient sources or landscape conditions garcia et al 2011 alshawaf et al 2016 in spite of its wide applications the applicability of the sparrow model in karst regions has not been tested which might provide an additional avenue for modelling nutrient transport in karst regions with complex terrains and subsurface systems as the first attempt the main objectives of this study were to 1 test the applicability of the sparrow model in karst regions and 2 quantify the nh4 n sources via natural and anthropogenic inputs and assess their transport processes affected by various natural and anthropogenic factors particularly the impacts of karst geology and reservoirs on the regional nh4 n transport to this end the wujiang river basin wrb a large karst basin located in southwest china was selected where the nutrient inputs and pathways have been significantly altered by anthropogenic activities in recent years based on the model results an assessment for different management strategies was also made it was expected that the sparrow model could assist with policy decision support for better management in controlling nh4 n in karst regions 2 data and methodology 2 1 study area the wrb is located in guizhou province in southwest china fig 1 it is the one of the largest tributaries in the yangtze river basin with a drainage area of 66 807 km2 the wrb lies in a subtropical monsoon climate zone with a mean annual temperature of 12 3 c where the respective highest and lowest temperature is in july 26 c on average and january 3 5 c the mean annual precipitation p is around 1000 mm with 75 of p occurring in summer months the main land use types in the wrb are cultivated land grass land and forest land due to the mountainous terrains the cultivated lands are mainly distributed in topographic depressions and valleys while grass lands are scattered along hillsides for grazing the forests are dominated by coniferous and deciduous trees han et al 2014 the urban population in guizhou province is only about 35 of the total population with the population density decreasing from southwest to northeast about 70 of the wrb belongs to karst landscapes fig 2 which are characterized by thin soil layers underlain by carbonate rocks and complicated groundwater systems in the past several decades intensive human activities e g deforestation and overgrazing have led to significant soil erosion and rock desertification which subsequently caused serious environmental hazards such as landslides and floods yuan 1997 the rock desertification in the karst area has been recognized as a major hindrance for local agricultural development li et al 2020 and also poses tremendous effects on hydrologic processes particularly on runoff generation processes for instance the loss of soil and vegetation in karst fractures increased the water leakage to groundwater systems and decreased the resistance to overland flow in areas with high relief jiang et al 2014 there are seven main subbasins in the wrb according to the tributary areas fig 1 including the sancha river scr the liuchong river lcr the yachi river ycr the maotiao river mtr the qingshui river qsr the xiang river xr and the wujiang mainstream wjm subbasins the scr and lcr subbasins represent the upstream area the ycr mtr qsr and xr subbasins represent the midstream area and the wjm subbasin belongs to the downstream area the main stream has a mean annual water discharge of 5 34 1010 m3 which accounts for approximately 47 of the total surface water runoff in guizhou province huang et al 2017 the abundant waterflow and large altitude drop make the wrb ideal for exploiting hydropower which led to the construction of several large scale reservoirs along the rivers in the wrb liu et al 2011 b wang et al 2019 these reservoirs are for multiple purposes including hydropower generation agricultural irrigation human and animal water consumption and flood risk management feng et al 2009 2 2 description of the sparrow model the statistical sparrow model was developed by the usgs which combines water quality observations with landscape and nutrient information to estimate annual averaged nutrient loads exported from land surface to waterbodies this model requires less data than numerical mechanistic models and also overcomes the shortcomings of traditional regression based statistical models by including mass balance constrained components e g flow pathways and decay processes non linear interactions of nutrients with landscapes and spatially distributed basin attributes alexander et al 2000 2002 the model is generally applied in large scale basins due to the use of statistic approaches in the model it performs well in identifying nutrient sources analyzing environmental factors and evaluating water quality schwarz et al 2006 to be self contained a brief description of the sparrow model is provided here and the detailed information can be found elsewhere in the literature schwarz et al 2006 the estimated load of nutrients is computed by the following equation 1 where f i represents the estimated load leaving the reach i the first term a at the right side of eq 1 is the amount of flux that is delivered to the downstream reach i from the adjacent upstream reach j if measured data are available in the upstream reach j f j is set to be equal to measured fluxes as f j m otherwise f j is given by estimated fluxes in the model the parameter δ i is the fraction of the upstream flux delivered to reach i and set to 1 if there are no diversions the lumped term a z i s z i r θ s θ r is the delivery function for streams and reservoirs representing attenuation processes along the water pathway the same for a z i s z i r θ s θ r in the term b this function defines the fraction of the flux in reach i that is delivered to the downstream node i e i 1 by the following two

bootstrap estimation 2 3 data preparation in order to run the sparrow model for the time period from 2010 to 2012 several types of data were required including hydrological stream networks water quality and flow rate records nutrient exports from different sources and environment settings of the basin schwarz et al 2006 2 3 1 stream network and flow data in this study a digital elevation model dem of a spatial resolution of 30 m from the geospatial data cloud site http www gscloud cn was used to derive the stream network in the wrb using arcgis version 10 2 see the supplementary materials there were 220 reaches delineated in the wrb with 12 reservoirs fig 3 due to the lack of flow data at some reaches the annual streamflow rates at those reaches were estimated by the budyko model zhang et al 2004 through annual p and potential evapotranspiration e 0 in the following equation 5 q p 1 1 α e 0 1 1 α 1 α e 0 the annual p data were obtained from the resource and environment data cloud platform redcp http www resdc cn and the annual e 0 data were retrieved from the modis16a3 dataset https lpdaac usgs gov the parameter α in eq 5 was calibrated at 30 hydrological stations in the wrb with flow records from 2010 to 2012 fig 4 then the model was applied to predict the annual streamflow rates of unmonitored reaches which was then combined with the manning equation to estimate the mean flow velocity based on statistical approaches schulze et al 2005 2 3 2 nh4 n load flux there were 16 monitoring stations with monthly nh4 n concentration data and 13 stations with yearly averaged nh4 n concentration data during 2010 2012 from the hydrology and water resources bureau of guizhou province the mean annual load of 2010 to 2012 was estimated by the following equation 6 load c i q i the c i represents the mean annual concentration of nh4 n at 29 sites and the q i is the mean annual streamflow rate computed in section 2 3 1 see fig s1 for the comparison of monthly based and yearly based mean annual load estimation in the supplementary materials the loads of nh4 n were used for the model calibration 2 3 3 nh4 n sources the nh4 n in the wrb was mostly from fertilizer livestock manure waste water and natural organic matter li et al 2013 li and ji 2016 the mostly used nitrogen fertilizer in the wrb was urea which contains two amino groups in one molecule nh2 2co the nh4 n input from the fertilizer application to the land surface was estimated from the county based yearbook around 2010 while the nh4 n input from livestock manures to the land surface was estimated from the dataset of the first china pollution census the atmospheric deposition of nh4 n was neglected in this study as the simulation results in l zhang et al 2018 indicated that the nh4 n deposition in the wrb was 4 kg ha 1 year 1 which was much less than the loads from fertilizer 36 kg ha 1 year 1 and manure 25 kg ha 1 year 1 the land use types i e cultivated land grass land and forest land data were obtained from the redcp were used as surrogates for non point sources i e the nh4 n from agriculture grazing and nature respectively additionally the population data from the redcp were used as the surrogate for anthropogenic nh4 n sources for example the loads from sewage industrial waste water all the above mentioned data were compiled for the 220 subbasins in the supplementary materials figs s2 s8 2 3 4 land to water delivery factors to consider the impacts of environmental factors on the delivery of nh4 n from land to waterbodies several variables of climate and landscape were included in this study these variables have been widely recognized as important factors for controlling the transport of nutrients for example p could promote the delivery of nutrients through runoff generation morales marín et al 2017 while high soil permeability could promote infiltration and remove nutrients from soil robertson and saad 2011 specifically p air temperature and soil texture datasets were compiled from the redcp the stream density and slope datasets were extracted from the dem data the soil permeability was estimated from the rosseta model according to the soil texture y zhang et al 2018 to examine the karstification impact on the nh4 n transport the carbonate rock distribution was extracted from the hydrogeological map from the institute of karst geology chinese academy of geological sciences http www karst cgs gov cn these variables were allocated to the 220 subbasins figs s9 s14 in the supplementary materials and then input and tested in the model the typical karst characteristics of fissure and pipeline are mainly developed in the pure carbonate area and the corresponding storage capacity could increase the transit times lauber and goldscheider 2014 zhang et al 2020a in addition several studies have found that there was a large amount of surface nutrients leaked to groundwater in karst regions under laboratory or field conditions wei et al 2011 peng et al 2019 therefore the leaked nh4 n in carbonate aquifers could be stored and converted to other nitrogen forms e g to no3 n through nitrification and or n2 through anammox before being delivered to surface waters zhang et al 2020b however with the complex terrains and subsurface structures it was hard to obtain detailed hydrogeological data in the wrb region thus the distribution of the pure carbonate area fig 2 was used to represent the net effect from karstification on the nh4 n transport 2 4 model setup and calibration the sparrow model parameters were calibrated through a non linear least square regression method schwarz et al 2006 different combinations of nh4 n sources and environmental factors were tested based on the assessment indexes used in this study e g p value and r2 and the best specification was chosen for the wrb in this study 8 variables were selected from the 16 variables listed in table 1 for nh4 n sources the population and forest land were chosen to represent anthropogenic e g fertilizer manure waste sewage and industrial water and natural e g nh4 n decomposed from organic matter in soil and defoliation sources respectively see correlation analysis in the supplementary materials the climate in the wrb is of a sub humid type with mean annual p ranging roughly from 800 mm year to 1200 mm year the abundant p leads to large surface runoff and infiltration thus delivering a significant amount of nh4 n into adjacent waterbodies and groundwater in addition a significant portion of the wrb is covered by carbonate rocks with the high solubility of carbonate rocks there are generally well developed groundwater systems underlain the carbonate areas which may have a profound impact on the transport of nh4 n for the nh4 n decay processes in waterbodies the model took the characteristics of stream and reservoir into consideration in order to quantify the theoretical maximum reduction in the nh4 n transport associated with the carbonate area the predicted load was compared with a hypothetical scenario without the impact of the carbonate area therefore the difference between these two scenarios could indicate the reduction proportion of nh4 n by the leakage effect due to carbonate rocks it should be noted that the estimation was based on the simplification that possible changes associated with the carbonate area were not considered in the hypothetical scenario i e the simulated processes such as runoff generation might be changed when the carbonate area was excluded as for the evaluation of the nh4 n loads intercepted by the reservoir the difference between the input and output loads of the reservoir was estimated based on the model simulation the input loads into the reservoir were the sum of the loads from upstream external sources and adjacent areas internal sources the output loads were that delivered to the adjacent downstream reach of the reservoir the interception efficiency was then defined as the quotient of interception loads to input loads 3 results and discussion 3 1 model evaluation the simulation results from the sparrow model in the wrb explained about 86 of the variability in the log transformed i e for better illustration of the values in different orders of magnitude mean annual nh4 n loads fig 5a the rmse value of the model results 0 74 and the bootstrap coefficients of variables also showed good robustness of the model table 2 the p values for the source variables e g population and carbonate area were 0 05 the decay of nh4 n in streams showed a p value of 0 053 while the variables of p forest land and reservoir decay did not show good correlations note that except for the significance level the interpretability of model results is another important metric for assessing model performances zhou et al 2018 in this study the population distribution and forest land represented the nh4 n from anthropogenic and natural sources respectively with the low surface runoff coefficient and widely distributed carbonate areas in karst regions p tended to promote surface nh4 n infiltration into groundwater peng et al 2019 and the long transit times could promote nh4 n in carbonate aquifers to be stored and converted to other nitrogen forms zhang et al 2020b whereas biogeochemical processes e g nitrification assimilation and deposition in streams and reservoirs were related to decay processes in the model i e the instream loss in table 2 was depicted by stream velocity and length in eq 2 and the reservoir attenuation was depicted by water area and discharge in eq 3 these variables were all physically important for interpreting the transport of nh4 n several reasons might lead to the insignificance of the variables such as insufficient observations for model calibrations spatial heterogeneities of model variables and uncertainties of measured data schwarz et al 2006 the spatial distribution of the log transformed residuals is presented in fig 5b which provides information as to whether the model overestimated or underestimated nh4 n loads compared to observations fig 5b indicates that the model tended to underestimate the load for headwaters likely due to the uncertainties in predicted streamflow in headwaters i e the comparatively larger deviation for low streamflow in fig 4 overall the positive and negative residuals were uniformly distributed across the wrb rather than centered in a particular area suggesting that the model had been adequately specified mcmahon et al 2003 3 2 source contribution load flux and concentration prediction for nh4 n the model estimated the contributions of nh4 n loads into waterbodies from both anthropogenic and natural sources for the 220 subbasins in the wrb with the respective average contribution of 66 8 and 33 2 the source contributions for the seven main subbasins are presented in fig 6a which shows that nh4 n was mainly derived from anthropogenic sources in the upstream and midstream subbasins 70 these subbasins cover most of the urban areas in the wrb where industrial and municipal sewage provided large quantities of nh4 n in addition the percentage of cultivated and grass lands was also relatively high in the upstream and midstream areas leading to intensive fertilizer use and manure from grazing in contrast forest lands were centered in the downstream area i e wjm where the contributions of nh4 n from natural and anthropogenic sources were approximately equal another reason for the relatively lower anthropogenic contribution in the wjm was the lack of large cities which gave little industrial or sewage wastewater to waterbodies the three year averaged nh4 n loads i e 2010 2012 through the 220 reaches are displayed in fig 6b the load from each reach was contributed by local and adjacent upstream sources with the accumulation of nh4 n along the stream higher loads were expected in the downstream area moreover among the 12 reservoirs located along the tributaries and main stream the interception efficiency of nh4 n varied noticeably more discussion in section 3 3 the decay processes of nh4 n in streams might be owing to the algae absorption and nitrification wang et al 2002 by comparison the decreased delivery flux in reaches closer to the basin outlet could be owing to less loads delivered from tributaries nearby since the sparrow model was implemented with first order decay rates in streams i e the decay rate is proportional to the nh4 n flux the amount of nh4 n that decayed in downstream reaches with higher nh4 n fluxes was larger and the reduction in nh4 n fluxes was thus more pronounced for reaches adjacent to urban areas especially to the cities of guiyang and zunyi higher loads might be owing to the large amount of industrial and municipal wastewater lang et al 2006 li et al 2010 to assess nh4 n yields the load of locally delivered nh4 n per square kilometer was estimated for each of the 220 subbasins to represent the spatial variations in the nh4 n yield intensity fig 6c overall the yield intensity tended to be higher in the upstream and midstream areas while it was lower in the downstream area which concurred with the distribution pattern of population e g the population density decreased from southwest to northeast also note that the area around the cities tended to yield more nh4 n owing to the inputs from industry and municipal sewage hence the results indicated that the anthropogenic nh4 n sources exerted a larger impact on the nh4 n transport in the wrb based on the transport load and streamflow data the three year averaged concentration of nh4 n from 2010 to 2012 was shown in fig 6d the reaches with higher nh4 n concentrations were mainly located near headwater and city areas especially around guiyang and zunyi with the highest values in the wrb as for headwater reaches higher nh4 n concentrations might be caused by lower streamflow rates and thus less dilution e g no upstream water input according to the national environmental quality standards for surface water https www mee gov cn the proportion of reaches with nh4 n concentrations less than that of level iii 1 mg l was 82 7 13 6 for level iv 1 to 1 5 mg l and v 1 5 to 2 mg l and the rest higher than level v 2 mg l note that among the reaches with nh4 n concentrations 1 mg l headwaters accounted for 65 8 which underscored the importance of headwaters in affecting the water quality of the wrb fig 6e presents the proportion of the nh4 n load from the 220 reaches that was delivered to the basin outlet with the long distance transport and interception of the reservoirs in the upstream and midstream areas there was a large amount of the nh4 n load decayed in waterbodies and only a small portion was delivered to the outlet by contrast a higher proportion of the nh4 n load delivered to the outlet was from the downstream area based on the delivery proportion map the contributions of the nh4 n load from the 220 reaches to the outlet are shown in fig 6f further highlighting the importance of transport distances in affecting the nh4 n transport at basin scales overall 2 8 of the nh4 n load delivered to the outlet was from the upstream area 21 1 from the midstream area and 76 1 from the downstream area fig 6g 3 3 factors controlling nh4 n transport 3 3 1 leakage effect in the karst area in this study the parameter of the carbonate area was negative in the model table 2 indicating that the carbonate area was negatively related to the amount of nh4 n transported to streams part of the reason was that the groundwater systems could act as a net sink for nh4 n by increasing residence times of nh4 n and degrading nh4 n through biogeochemical processes zhang et al 2020b and thus reduce the load from land surface to surface waterbodies the distribution of carbonate areas is shown in fig 2 and the proportion of pure carbonate areas in the seven subbasins ranged from 42 7 to 61 9 the estimation of leakage effect on the nh4 n transport was based on the comparison between two scenarios as mentioned in section 2 4 overall the transport reduction in nh4 n due to the leakage effect was about 36 9 for the wrb for the seven main subbasins the reduction rate ranged from 31 3 to 52 2 which was generally higher in areas with larger carbonate coverage fig 7 for example the highest reduction was found in the qsr with the largest carbonate coverage although the carbonate coverage in the mtr was close to that for the qsr the reduction differed noticeably between the two subbasins possible reasons could be attributed to a the qsr was more adjacent to the guiyang city and therefore received more anthropogenic loads that were leaked into groundwater b there were two large reservoirs i e hfh and bhh located in the mtr with higher interception efficiencies for the nh4 n transport see the next section for detailed discussions decreasing the reduction from leakage and c the spatial distributions of the carbonate area and p intensity were different between the two subbasins which might lead to different combined effects on surface nh4 n transport as p could tremendously promote infiltration and leakage of nh4 n to groundwater in carbonate areas moreover the higher reduction rate in the xr might be also owing to its adjacency to the zunyi city for the other four subbasins scr lcr ycr and wjm the reduction rates were lower due to their relatively low carbonate coverage due to the well developed groundwater systems in the wrb the leakage of surface water had a significant impact on the nh4 n transport which made the groundwater systems in the karst area more vulnerable to nutrient inputs and thus the deterioration of water quality doerfliger et al 1999 for example in the areas adjacent to guiyang and zunyi no3 n and nh4 n were found in groundwater owing to human activities from fertilizer usage and industrial and sewage wastewater discharges lang et al 2006 li et al 2010 liu et al 2006 3 3 2 reservoir interception twelve reservoirs were located in the main stream and tributaries of the wrb the reservoirs not only were important in regional water resources management but also had large impacts on regional ecology the parameters used in the estimation of the reservoir interception were summarized in table 3 the definition of each parameter was given in section 2 4 the hjd reservoir had the largest interception load 699 tons year 1 with an interception efficiency of 46 1 which could be attributed to the following three characteristics a the water depth was low which could promote the exchange of nh4 n between surface water and sediments wang et al 2002 b the hjd reservoir resided in the upstream area meaning relatively lower streamflow rates and thus higher residence times of nh4 n in the reservoir and c the water area of the hjd reservoir was relatively large 41 85 km2 making nh4 n prone to escape via the water atmosphere interface these conditions are conducive to related biogeochemical processes such as nitrification algae absorption and sedimentation zhang et al 2009 in contrast for the wjd reservoir with a water area of 40 35 km2 which was located in the midstream with more input loads from upstream rivers the interception efficiency was only 20 3 most likely owing to its higher streamflow rates the results indicated that only four reservoirs hfh hjd bhh and pz had the interception efficiency of 40 while the interception efficiency of the other eight reservoirs ranged from 2 4 to 25 3 by comparing these two groups high efficiency group and low efficiency group as shown in fig 8 for a demonstration purpose it is clear that the reservoirs of the high efficiency group were mostly located in the upstream of either the wrb or the tributaries suggesting longer residence times of nh4 n in those reservoirs for the removal of nh4 n in addition these reservoirs generally had larger or more lake type water areas which were conducive to the biogeochemical processes of nh4 n as explained previously morales marín et al 2017 for the reservoirs that resembled river type shapes e g wjd high streamflow rates most likely led to the lower interception efficiencies of nh4 n besides their shorter residence times the narrow shapes of those reservoirs were not conducive to the nh4 n decay processes due to comparatively smaller surface water areas in short the results revealed that the interception efficiency of lake type reservoirs was generally higher than that of river type reservoirs in the wrb which is critical for understanding the damming effect on biogeochemical processes in karst regions li et al 2020 3 4 management strategy optimization the sparrow model has been extended to include a web based decision support system for managing water quality in the contiguous u s booth et al 2011 based on scenario simulations e g changes in land use and or fertilizer usage amount the model can be used to evaluate the impact of different management strategies on nutrient transport within the wrb 82 7 of the reaches showed nh4 n concentrations at level iii 1 mg l however for the scr ycr qsr and xr subbasins the proportion of reaches with nh4 n concentrations 1 mg l was considerably higher 37 5 24 1 25 and 26 7 respectively generally those reaches with high nh4 n concentrations were distributed in the headwater areas or the areas adjacent to cities as for the target of 80 of reaches with the nh4 n concentrations 1 mg l level iii in the seven subbasins the optimized management should be focused on the scr ycr qsr and xr subbasins since natural inputs of nh4 n were mainly from the decomposition of soil organic matter and thus difficult to be constrained the management control was implemented by simulating different scenarios of anthropogenic inputs to provide useful information for watershed management and policy making 3 scenarios including the decreases of 10 20 and 30 in anthropogenic sources were simulated and the associated water quality improvement is shown in fig 9 for lcr and ycr when the anthropogenic inputs were decreased by 30 and 10 respectively the water quality control target was achieved whereas it failed to reach the same target in qsr and xr even with the 30 reduction in anthropogenic inputs the likely reason was the large amount of nh4 n input to the qsr and xr reaches from the city areas therefore further optimizations e g moving industry to the area away from cities or decentralizing population in urban areas are needed for better management of nh4 n to reach the set control targets for qsr and xr 4 conclusions in this study a water quality model sparrow was constructed for the wujiang river basin the model estimated the mean annual transport concentration and yield of nh4 n from 2010 to 2012 the impacts of two important factors on nh4 n transport including the leakage effect due to the carbonate area and the interception effect from reservoirs were analyzed according to the model results water quality improvement strategies were recommended the conclusions of this study were as follows 1 anthropogenic sources were the main origin of nh4 n in the wujiang river basin in the upstream and midstream areas anthropogenic sources contributed 70 of nh4 n to waterbodies while the contributions from anthropogenic and natural sources were equally important in the downstream area 2 the leakage of surface water could make reduction in the transport of nh4 n for about 36 9 with a range from 31 3 to 52 2 in the seven main subbasins generally the leakage effect was more significant in subbasins with higher carbonate area coverage 3 the interception efficiency differed among the 12 reservoirs in the wujiang river basin the flow rate and water area of reservoirs were the primary factors affecting the interception efficiency 4 as for the target of 80 reaches to reach water quality of level iii the sancha river and yachi river subbasins needed a reduction of 30 and 10 in nh4 n from anthropogenic sources respectively however for the xiang river and qingshui river subbasins a further reduction was required to reach the target of 80 credit authorship contribution statement yibin dai conceptualization methodology writing original
