21720,the resistance and ship generated waves of two inland vessels in the fully confined waterway are investigated based on numerical simulations the simulation results are validated using towing tank experiments the influences of the channel dimension water depth ship draught and velocity are studied specially the ship resistance is characterized as a function of the blockage ratio and the theory of the linear ship wakes is corrected using the ship draught these results are expected to predict the ship hydrodynamics in the restricted waterway and reveal the acting mechanism of the confinement effect on a certain level keywords confined waterway resistance ship generated waves inland vessel 1 introduction inland waterway transport is viewed as one of the most important means for the freightage in rivers and canals in early times experienced navigators found that the vessel undergoes speed loss and decline of maneuverability when sailing in the confined waterway which increases the fuel consumption and risk of collision with channel bank bottom the ittc international towing tank conference has suggested to investigate the ship maneuverability in confined waters in 1963 since then fujino 1968 vantorre 1994 edstrand and norrbin 1978 marchal et al 1996 hsiung and gui 1988 jian kang 1994 and hoolt 1969 etc studied the confinement and shallow water effect eda 1971 examined the dynamic behaviour of ships in various channels directional stability off centreline course operation and squat calculations are applied to indicate the relationship between channel dimensions and acceptable ship size yavin et al 1995 studied the ship maneuverability in finite depth water in the vicinity of an obstacle using a stochastic control approach based on the resistance experiments in shallow water qian 1990 optimized the relationship between ships and waterways with regard to ship principal dimensions waterway parameters main engine power and designed ship speed which greatly improved the performance of inland vessels vermeer 1977 presented a simple calculation method according to the conventional strip theory to calculate the ship motions in shallow water waves with special regard to under keel clearance fujino 1970 examined the stability of a ship in narrow and shallow channel by an application of the automatic steering to propose the most suitable control strategy the thrive of this area is actually until the year 2000 as shown in the statistics of fig 1 which are counted every five years in this figure the conditions where the water is restricted such as ship bank bottom interaction ship ship interaction ship bridge interaction etc are all classified into this topic among these works ghent university is probably the most active which emphasizes on the experimental aspect vantorre 2003 many empirical formulations were proposed by regression analysis from either experiments simulations or theoretical analysis vantorre et al 2003 varyani et al 2002 briggs 2006 marchal et al 1996 dunker et al 2002 lataire et al 2012 kazerooni and seif 2014 debaillon 2010 skupień and prokopowicz 2014 liu et al 2016 haisuo and guanqun 2009

2009 varyani et al 2002 kobylinski 2011 in recent years because of the development of numerical simulations cfd computational fluid dynamics techniques have grown and become nearly competitive with experiments regarding both the computational cost and precision jachowski 2008 mucha et al 2014 zhou and zou 2013 du et al 2018b zhou et al 2015 terziev et al 2018 zou and larsson 2013 linde et al 2016 senthil prakash and chandra 2013 pacuraru and domnisoru 2017 hoa et al 2019 landsburg et al 2005 nakisa et al 2014 janardhanan and krishnankutty 2010 krishna and krishnankutty 2009 mucha et al 2018 zhou et al 2012 hong et al 2002 liu et al 2016 ji et al 2012 simulated the waves generated by the passing of convoys in a restricted waterway by solving the 3 d navier stokes equations along with the standard k ϵ model to predict the relationship between these geometrical and kinematic parameters and the amplitude of ship generated waves as well as the water plane drawdown tezdogan et al 2016 carried out simulations with different ship draughts at various speeds to predict the ship squat and resistance linde et al 2016 proposed a three dimensional numerical model based on the quasi newton method to predict ship resistance and sinkage of an inland vessel sailing in restricted waterways zou et al 2011 utilized a rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solver and a potential flow method to investigate the bank effects on a tanker moving straight ahead at low speed in a canal characterized by surface piercing banks lo et al 2009 performed a series of simulations using commercial cfd software to examine the effects of the vessel speed and distance to bank on the magnitude and time based variation of the yaw angle and sway force it was found that even when a vessel advances at a very low speed it experiences a significant bank effect when operating in close vicinity to the bank hong et al 2005 carried out a numerical investigation of the breaking phenomena of a ship s waves in restricted waterways this phenomenon was discussed to understand the mechanism of wave breaking in relation to the change in water depth along a waterway terziev et al 2018 performed a numerical study on a container ship in shallow waters for varying channel cross sections and ship speeds using cfd the slender body theory and various empirical methods to quantify the effect of a step in the channel topography on ship sinkage trim and resistance mucha et al 2017 established a novel test case representative of modern inland waterway ships with main particulars and appendages for propulsion and maneuvering results of resistance and propulsion model tests in shallow water condition were discussed for the study of the confinement effect researchers normally concentrate on the resistance ship generated waves squat and maneuverability because of the altering of the flow field the accelerated fluids lead to the increase of hydrodynamic forces on the vessel a vessel may experience a speed loss of 30 in shallow water and up to 60 in confined area tezdogan et al 2016 barrass and derrett 2011 ship generated waves is another important topic in this area when a ship moves along the water surface pressure variations at the air water interface produce a series of waves including the divergent waves and transverse waves known as the kelvin wake in shallow and moderate water depths subcritical f r h 1 and supercritical f r h 1 conditions exist compared with open water where f r h is the depth based froude number wakes for subcritical flows are made up of transverse waves and divergent waves while wakes for supercritical flows contain divergent waves only soomere 2009 pethiyagoda et al 2018 in fully confined waters both the lateral and vertical directions are restricted the ship generated waves will be reflected and refracted after interacting with the banks and the reflected waves will propagate and superpose with the original ones creating a more complex wave pattern in the waterway ji et al 2013 kaidi et al 2017 the vessel will also experience trim and sinkage increase leading to the decrease of the distance between the keel and the channel bottom which is known as the squat this phenomenon is critical and may cause the collision and even grounding in shallow waters delefortrie et al 2010 terziev et al 2018 gourlay 2003 jachowski 2008 the maneuvering in restricted areas also becomes more difficult the turning radius may be increased to 2 3 times compared with open water liu et al 2015 lee et al 2005 koh and yasukawa 2012 this work investigates the influences of the channel dimension water depth ship draught and speed on the inland vessels the resistance ship generated waves and kelvin wave angle in confined waters will be characterized as functions of these parameters which are expected to reveal a part of the acting mechanism of the confinement effect of the restricted waterway 2 theoretical background 2 1 confinement effect of the waterway when a vessel is navigated in waters with limited width and depth the flow around the vessel will be altered by the restricted space normally the flow in the vicinity will be accelerated causing a strong return current and depression of water level according to the bernoulli s principle the accelerated fluid velocity could result in a pressure decrease the vessel experiences resistance increase and drops of speed and propulsion efficiency compared with open water leading to higher propulsion power and fuel consumption important thresholds of the confinement effect are denoted in table 1 three parameters are significant for various conditions where h w t d is for the influence of the channel bottom b c b s for the banks and a c a s for the fully confined area where the bank and bottom are both limited a s and a c are the cross sections of the vessel and waterway h w and t d are the water depth and ship draught b c and b s are the channel width and ship breadth the condition when h w t d 1 5 is normally called shallow water three flow regimes can be identified referring the vessel speed subcritical critical f r h 1 and supercritical fig 2 regime the phenomena of the three regimes are different in the subcritical condition the ship advancement pushes away the water at the bow and leaves a void at the stern creating a high and a low pressure region respectively the return current under the ship decreases the pressure resulting in a downward force on the hull and the so called squat appears the generated ship waves are able to overtake the downstream flow and travel in an upstream direction on the contrary in the supercritical condition the vessel will rise and the surface waves cannot travel upstream however it has been confirmed that there exists a limiting speed that self propelled vessels cannot exceed in the restricted waterway regardless of the power supplied known as the schijf limiting speed schijf 1949 1 f r h s c h i j f 8 cos 3 π 3 arccos 1 a s a c 3 the resistance in open shallow and fully confined waters are different whose typical curves can be observed in fig 2 for the case of shallow water no lateral restriction exists only the undulatory effect caused by the bottom takes place the key parameter is h w t d table 1 there exists a critical speed f r h 1 where the ship resistance increases dramatically around the critical speed the ship motions are unsteady when in confined water where the width is also restricted the hydraulic effect appears besides the undulatory effect the ratio a c a s table 1 dominates the resistance change with a subcritical and a supercritical speed pompée 2015 constantine 1960 2 subcritical f r h s u b 2 sin a r c s i n 1 m b 3 1 5 3 supercritical f r h s u p e r 2 sin π a r c s i n 1 m b 3 1 5 where m b a s a c is the blockage ratio as a result a transcritical region between the subcritical and the supercritical points exist for the confined water a weight factor has been defined by norrbin 1976 aiming at proposing an analytical model of the bank effect and it is further developed by lataire and vantorre 2008 of the ghent university into a mathematical model for calculating the increase of the ship resistance induced by the banks taking into account the relative position of the banks to the ship and the entire geometry of the cross section the weight factor of the confinement effect is defined using a decreasing exponential function lataire et al 2015 4 ω w e ξ y y y i n f l ξ z z t d where y i n f l b s 5 f r h 5 is the horizontal reach of the bank effect lataire and vantorre 2008 h t d and b s are the water depth ship draught and beam respectively ξ y and ξ z are regression coefficients obtained from experimental data the distribution of the weight factor can be observed in fig 3 the weight factor is a value between 0 and 1 which indicates the importance of a water particle for the bank effects induced on a ship lataire et al 2015 a water particle closer to the vessel will have a value closer to 1 the weight factor will tend to zero once the water particle is far away from the ship in all directions to make the confinement effect come into effect the weight factor need to be integrated over the cross section as follows 5 χ s 0 h 0 y s e α y y y d α z z t d y d z 6 χ p 0 h 0 y p e α y y y d α z z t d y d z where s and p denote the starboard and port sides of the vessel 2 2 theoretical analysis of linear ship wakes a moving object at the free surface will generate waves which can be decomposed into primary and secondary waves the primary waves follow the bernoulli equation the flows at the bow and stern decelerate and create high pressure regions the surface elevation corresponds with the pressure distribution yielding wave crests at the ship ends and a long wave trough along the middle this shape is speed independent the wave height depends quadratically on the speed bertram 2012 the secondary wave pattern also known as the kelvin wave pattern consists of transverse and divergent waves fig 4 many former studies investigated a moving pressure source at the water surface the actual ship waves are formed by the interference of these simple elements the wave system interference of a typical hull form is shown in fig 4 two waves starting with a crest are formed at the bow and stern there may exist other waves formed by the shoulders of the ship the sum of these wave profiles together with the primary wave pattern forms the actual ship generated waves a ship sails in water of finite depth follows the dispersion relation 7 ω g k w tanh k w h w where ω g k w and h w are the wave frequency gravity acceleration wave number and water depth respectively in deep water the water depth h w and the famous linear dispersion relation ω g k w is obtained the phase and group velocities can then be written as 8 c f ω k w g tanh k w h w k w 9 c g ω k w 1 2 g k w tanh k w h w g tanh k w h w g k w h w 1 tanh 2 k w h w by implementing the mathematical relations 10 cosh 2 k w h w sinh 2 k w h w 1 11 sinh 2 k w h w 2 sinh k w h w cosh k w h w the ratio of the phase velocity to the group velocity can be calculated as 12 c f c g 2 1 k w h w 1 tanh k w h w tanh k w h w 2 1 2 k w h w sinh 1 2 k w h w referring the geometrical schema in fig 5 a ship sails from a to b crossing the distance v t g however the wave energy only reaches c with the group velocity c g thereby crossing the distance c g t g in water of finite depth and deep water these waves actually fill a circle centred at o with a diameter v t g c g c f 1 we can then geometrically calculate the angle of the kelvin wedge as 13 sin α k v c g c f 1 t g 2 v t g v c g c f 1 t g 2 1 2 c g 1 c f 1 by incorporating eq 12 the final expression can be obtained soomere 2009 14 sin α k 1 2 k w h w sinh 1 2 k w h w 3 2 k w h w sinh 1 2 k w h w in deep water h w sin α k 1 3 then α k 19 47 this angle is independent of the hull shape ship waves in shallow and fully confined water areas are different but tightly connected the influence of water depth dominates the generated wave pattern as a function of the depth froude number fig 6 in shallow water traditional kelvin wave patterns can be observed at the subcritical region as the ship speed approaches the critical speed the wave angle approaches 90 i e the ship waves propagate parallel to the sailing line at the supercritical region the transverse waves are left behind and only divergent waves are present under this condition pethiyagoda et al 2018 the bow waves fold backwards to the ship with respect to the froude number as 15 α k a r c s i n 1 f r h the wave angle changing with the froude number is shown in fig 6 the blue line follows eq 14 and the brown follows 15 in a fully confined waterway the wave angle follows that in the shallow water however the waves will be reflected by the side wall 3 numerical and experimental details 3 1 governing equations during the numerical simulations the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are solved jasak 1996 rusche 2003 16 u 0 17 ρ u t ρ u u p μ e f f u ρ g f σ where u ρ and p are the velocity density and pressure of the fluid μ e f f ρ ν ν t is the effective dynamic viscosity where the eddy viscosity ν t is calculated from the s s t k ω turbulence model here to account for the two phases of air and

water u r u w u a is the relative velocity between the two phases the vof model actually treats the two phases as one through the use of phase fraction therefore the fluid density dynamic viscosity

surface tension coefficient and the curvature of the free surface 3 2 computational models and configurations the ship models convoy used in the simulations are shown in fig 7 the convoys are commonly used during the inland transport in europe which consist of 1 pusher and several barges they are promising in increasing the payload by at least 20 and decreasing the cost by at least 30 for the european inland waterway transport system inbat european commission directorate general for research 2020 eurostat 2015 the body lines of the barge and the pusher are shown in figs 8 and 9 and the geometrical parameters of the vessels are shown in table 2 a model with the scale ratio 1 25 is selected during the simulations the bank slope is 2 1 to resemble the real waterways the computational domain is designed with two ship lengths upstream and three downstream from the ends of the bow and stern respectively the top boundary is placed one ship height from the top of the vessel the positions of other boundaries are determined by the dimension of the waterway the testing configurations can be found in the cross section view in fig 10 and table 3 where three channel bottom widths three water depths two ship draughts and several velocities are designed to account for various channel and transport conditions the two different draughts are specially designed for the empty and loaded conditions the weights of the pusher for the two different draughts are 54 77 and 144 11 kg while those of the barge are 102 81 and 265 22 kg the testing velocities are in the range of 0 1 m s which means that all our tests are within the subcritical and critical regions fig 2 the schijf limiting speed v s subcritical velocity v c s u b and confinement parameters h w t d a c a s b c b s are calculated for reference in table 3 the schijf limiting speed is for self propelled ships since the ship models in our tests are towed some cases exceed this limit the parameter h w t d is within 3 6 a c a s 4 263 44 211 and b c b s 2 305 7 368 which show that our tests cover a wide range of confinement conditions mesh details can be seen in fig 11 where the hull and free surface are refined and the boundary layer meshes are added near the hull surface the channel bottom is set to wall boundary condition the mesh information for water depth h w 0 24 m is shown in table 3 the incompressible multiphase solver in openfoam was used in our simulations the sst k ω turbulence model is used as denoted before the time derivative term is discretized using the implicit euler scheme the convection term in the momentum equation is discretized with second order linear upwind scheme and the convection term in the vof equation is discretized with second order tvd total variation diminishing scheme with van leer s flux limiter second order central differencing scheme with non orthogonal correction is used for the discretization of the diffusion term five outer corrections and two pressure corrections are adopted for the velocity pressure coupling iterations all equations are solved to the tolerance of o 8 jasak et al 2019 vukčević et al 2017 verification validation v v studies have been carried out in advance using the standard hull forms kcs and kvlcc2 without trim and sinkage mesh convergence study with three mesh resolutions and time step convergence study with four time steps were done to select appropriate mesh generation strategy and time step the resistance was also validated with the ittc benchmarks hexahedral mesh with local refinement near the hull the free surface and the wave angle region was designed the sst k ω model with wall function was used during the simulations boundary layer meshes were thus added near the hull surface making the non dimensional wall distance y about 60 a time step of 1 1 0 3 s was selected after bargaining between the computational speed and precision detailed convergence studies can be found in our earlier work du et al 2018a the simulations used 50 processors and took at most 42 cpu hours to finish 3 3 experimental setups the experiments were carried out corresponding with the simulations in the towing tank of the university of liège anast laboratory fig 12 the basin has been adapted with an aluminium bottom and pvc banks to account for the confinement condition the same convoy models with the scale ratio 1 25 were tested as the simulations fig 7 the barge and pusher were connected rigidly as shown in fig 12 b a six component dynamometer balance was used to measure the forces and moments on the vessel trim and sinkage were also recorded during the tests a flowmeter fixed on the carriage can detect the velocity of the vessel at different conditions as shown in figs 10 and 12 the bank with a slope 2 1 was designed three water depths three channel widths and two draughts were tested with various vessel speeds table 3 the system was calibrated before the experiments with the reported uncertainty 8 for the force 5 for the sinkage and 5 for the trim more details about the experiments can be found in linde et al 2016 and kaidi et al 2017 4 results and discussions 4 1 ship resistance the resistance results of the convoy 1 and 2 influenced by the channel width water depth and ship draught are processed and shown in figs 13 15 respectively the resistance of the convoy 2 is obviously larger because of an extra barge overall the numerical simulations agree well with the experiments the largest error between the two is about 8 it can be seen that the cases with smaller water depth narrower channel width and larger ship draught have higher advancing resistance since they are more confined in the waterway in confined waters return flows appear around the hull because of the limited space according to the bernoulli s principle the pressure in the vicinity drops and the flow will be accelerated stronger confinement effect will be induced on the vessel which leads to higher resistance the influence of the confinement effect is more evident for high ship velocity which can be observed from the resistance difference at each velocity value this effect is specially marked in fig 15 where the resistance difference is indicated between two different draught values with a larger velocity the resistance difference is also larger which means that a small increase of the draught can induce a high resistance increase when the vessel is fast this effects can also be observed for the channel width and water depth in figs 13 and 14 what channel width water depth and ship draught actually change is the confinement level this means that when the vessel is navigated with a higher speed the resistance becomes more sensitive to the confinement effect of the waterway the ratio between the two resistance values at a certain velocity is about the same value as the ratio between the draughts 0 1 0 04 0 25 this agrees with the traditional viewpoint that the resistance scales with l s t d where l s is the ship length t d is the draught the ship resistance is plotted against the blockage ratio m b a s a c in fig 16 for the same velocity ship resistance shows linear relationship with the blockage ratio and the curve seems to have a larger slope with a higher ship speed this again proves that a ship with higher speed is more sensitive to the confinement change of the waterway even for the same ship its performance changes when the draught is different in fig 17 the resistance changes more intensively with a larger draught value therefore when the ship is navigated in a confined waterway its performance should be reevaluated with different loadings the fitting coefficients of figs 16 and 17 are calculated in table 4 the values of the slope c a quantitatively demonstrates the above statements as a result special attentions should be paid to high loading large size and strong confinement conditions since the ship experiences large resistance and becomes sensitive and difficult to maneuver 4 2 ship generated waves the ship generated waves are analysed for various channel widths and draught conditions with the velocity 0 91 m s as shown in figs 18 and 19 the kelvin wave patterns generated by the bow and stern can be clearly observed the kelvin wedges are denoted with solid lines in the figures which represent the propagating directions of the ship waves several characteristic positions are marked for clarity for the convoy 1 fig 18 which consists of 1 pusher and 1 barge the reflection of the barge waves are evident at position a the bow waves of the barge are reflected by the channel wall and superpose with the downstream waves for the case with the channel width w b 2 88 m the waves of the barge propagate with a long distance and even exceed the waves of the pusher the reflected waves of the barge superpose with that of the pusher which prevent the reflection of the pusher waves at the banks however when the channel width w b 1 44 m and 0 72 m the barge waves are reflected at a relatively front position the wave interferences still happen but are not able to prevent the wave reflections of the pusher it can be seen that the positions of the wave reflection and interference appear earlier upstream with a smaller channel width under this condition the waves are reflected and interfered several times and result in a very complicated wave pattern at last because of the existence of another barge of the convoy 2 the interfering region of the waves increases and the wave pattern becomes more complex fig 19 the generated waves of the bow and stern of the pusher and barges superpose together in the confined waterway two apparent regions of the wave interference are marked with ellipses in each case since the wave interference happens more frequently the resulted waves become more disordered at further downstream especially near the pusher to quantitatively demonstrate the wave change the wave elevations at a specific position are extracted for comparison fig 20 shows the wave elevations at the lateral position y 0 3 m near the convoys regardless of the draught value the overall wave profiles are similar the ship generated waves drop beneath the initial free surface water level increases at the bow and maintains a long wave along the hull a maximum wave elevation can be observed at the bow and stern position the free surface in the middle of the barges and pusher maintains a low level the cases with a larger draught seem to have more intense wave changes and the channel confinement further amplifies this effect when the channel width is smaller the ship generated waves become higher at the bow and lower along the hull the ship waves are more complicated for the convoy 2 since the vessel is longer and more waves are superposed 4 3 wave angle characterizations the wave angle in the confined waterway was characterized in this section the wave angle formed by the highest peaks was measured these highest peaks were fitted with the least square approximation pethiyagoda et al 2014 the wave angles when v 0 91 m s are demonstrated in fig 21 which seem irrelevant with the channel width this means that the wave angle is only influenced by the water depth the banks can reflect the ship waves but not change the angle of the wedge in eq 14 it can be seen that the wave angle is only affected by the water depth the theoretical value of the wave angle is marked as α 1 the dotted line in fig 21 a and the point in b however this value clearly does not correspond with the simulation results which are influenced by the draught in our tests it can be observed that the vessel with a larger draught has a greater wave angle in figs 18 and 19 the wave reflections does appear earlier in the channel when the draught is larger and create more interferences in the downstream to account for the draught the original depth froude number is suggested to modify using the ship draught h t h w t d 23 f r h t v g h t with this modification the equations for the curve in fig 21 b are changed to 24 sin α k 1 2 k w h t sinh 1 2 k w h t 3 2 k w h t sinh 1 2 k w h t 25 α k a r c s i n 1 f r h t k w h t relates with f r h t as 26 tanh k w h t k w h t 3 2 k w h t sinh 1 2 k w h t f r h t 2 the new predicted values of the wave angle based on the modified water depth are denoted as α 2 and α 3 in fig 21 the two values agree better with the simulation results which proves the above deduction this modification is reasonable since the early theory predicts the wave angle at the free surface but the real ship penetrates into the water with a certain depth which must have influences on the wave generation and propagation the wave lengths corresponding with the two modified wave angles α 2 and α 3 are 0 0531 and 0 0390 m while the wave periods are 0 0583 and 0 0429 s 5 conclusions this paper investigated the ship hydrodynamics including the advancing resistance ship generated waves and kelvin wave angle in the fully confined waterway using numerical simulation techniques two inland convoys which consist of a pusher and one two barges commonly used in the inland transport in europe were tested by both towing tanks tests and cfd techniques regarding the cfd simulations an incompressible multiphase solver in the open source code openfoam was selected where the ship was fixed i e without trim and sinkage two convoy models three water depths two draughts three channel widths and various speeds were taken into account to cover a wide range of real conditions the experiments were carried out in the anast laboratory of the university of liège more complicated cases with trim and sinkage were tested to validate the numerical simulations by theoretically analyse the confinement effect and the linear wave theory the related parameters and their properties were concluded based on these theories the advancing resistance and ship generated waves of the two inland vessels were analysed and characterized the influences of the channel dimension water depth and ship draught on the resistance were analysed the simulation results agreed well with the experimental data even without trim and sinkage which seem not great enough to evidently influence the forces on the scaled model of the inland vessel also the trim and sinkage are relatively difficult to predict since they are easily covered by the experimental and numerical uncertainties according to our tests the ship resistance is reasonably increased with a higher confinement level i e smaller channel widths water depths and larger draughts to characterize the effect of the restriction of the channel the resistance was further analysed as a function of the blockage ratio according to the results the resistance was found to depend linearly on the blockage ratio more importantly the vessel was found to be more unstable and sensitive to the confinement effect when maneuvering with a high speed and loading condition which should be paid attention to in real situations the wave pattern becomes more complicated when the vessel is maneuvered in the confined waterway the propagation of the waves is limited by the channel banks and bottom reflections and refractions occur near the wall the pressure of the flow in the vicinity between the vessel and the wall drops and the fluids will be accelerated in that area the return current and the depression of the water level become more intensive compared with that in open water the reflected waves will superpose with the original waves and create very complicated wave patterns in the restricted waterway since the convoys in our tests consist of the barges and pusher the superposed waves of each component become more complex this complex wave pattern in the fully confined waterway was successfully captured in our simulations where the wave reflections and interferences were clearly observed regardless of the draught and channel width the overall wave pattern remains similar except the wave contours the wave elevation at specific positions were also extracted and analysed to quantitatively characterize the wave properties it was found that higher confinement i e large draughts and small channel width and water depths contribute to the wave elevation and the wave crests normally appear at the bow and stern positions of the vessels the wave angles formed by the highest peaks were also extracted and measured in this work the wave angle was found to change with different draught conditions which were not taken into account in the conventional theory of linear ship wakes a corrected version of the theory using the ship draught was proposed and validated using our simulation results in our opinion to more accurately predict the wave angle the draught should be taken into consideration in various conditions our work mainly concerns the advancing resistance the wave pattern of the inland convoy and the wave angle in the fully confined waterway these results reveal the acting mechanism of the confinement effect on the ship hydrodynamics on a certain level the revealings and characterizations are

which greatly improved the performance of inland vessels vermeer 1977 presented a simple calculation method according to the conventional strip theory to calculate the ship motions in shallow water waves with special regard to under keel clearance fujino 1970 examined the stability of a ship in narrow and shallow channel by an application of the automatic steering to propose the most suitable control strategy the thrive of this area is actually until the year 2000 as shown in the statistics of fig 1 which are counted every five years in this figure the conditions where the water is restricted such as ship bank bottom interaction ship ship interaction ship bridge interaction etc are all classified into this topic among these works ghent university is probably the most active which emphasizes on the experimental aspect vantorre 2003 many empirical formulations were proposed by regression analysis from either experiments simulations or theoretical analysis vantorre et al

2009 varyani et al 2002 kobylinski 2011 in recent years because of the development of numerical simulations cfd computational fluid dynamics techniques have grown and become nearly competitive with experiments regarding both the computational cost and precision jachowski 2008 mucha et al 2014 zhou and zou 2013 du et al 2018b zhou et al 2015 terziev et al 2018 zou and larsson 2013 linde et al

2018 zhou et al 2012 hong et al 2002 liu et al 2016 ji et al 2012 simulated the waves generated by the passing of convoys in a restricted waterway by solving the 3 d navier stokes equations along with the standard k ϵ model to predict the relationship between these geometrical and kinematic parameters and the amplitude of ship generated waves as well as the water plane drawdown tezdogan et al 2016 carried out simulations with different ship draughts at various speeds to predict the ship squat and resistance linde et al 2016 proposed a three dimensional numerical model based on the quasi newton method to predict ship resistance and sinkage of an inland vessel sailing in restricted waterways zou et al 2011 utilized a rans reynolds averaged navier stokes solver and a potential flow method to investigate the bank effects on a tanker moving straight ahead at low speed in a canal characterized by surface piercing banks lo et al 2009 performed a series of simulations using commercial cfd software to examine the effects of the vessel speed and distance to bank on the magnitude and time based variation of the yaw angle and sway force it was found that even when a vessel advances at a very low speed it experiences a significant bank effect when operating in close vicinity to the bank hong et al 2005 carried out a numerical investigation of the breaking phenomena of a ship s waves

and maneuvering results of resistance and propulsion model tests in shallow water condition were discussed for the study of the confinement effect researchers normally concentrate on the resistance ship generated waves squat and maneuverability because of the altering of the flow field the accelerated fluids lead to the increase of hydrodynamic forces on the vessel a vessel may experience a speed loss of 30 in shallow water and up to 60 in confined area tezdogan et al 2016 barrass and derrett 2011 ship generated waves is another important topic in this area when a ship moves along the water surface pressure variations at the air water interface produce a series of waves including the divergent waves and transverse waves known as the kelvin wake in shallow and moderate water depths subcritical f r h 1 and supercritical f r h 1 conditions exist compared with open water where f r h is the depth based froude number wakes for subcritical flows are made up of transverse waves and divergent waves while wakes for supercritical flows contain divergent waves only soomere 2009 pethiyagoda et al 2018 in fully confined waters both the lateral and vertical directions are restricted the ship generated waves will be reflected and refracted after interacting with the banks and the reflected waves will propagate and superpose with the original ones creating a more complex wave pattern in the waterway ji et al 2013 kaidi et al 2017 the vessel will also experience trim and sinkage increase leading to the decrease of the distance between the keel and the channel bottom which is known as the squat this phenomenon is critical and may cause the collision and even grounding in shallow waters delefortrie et al 2010 terziev et al 2018 gourlay 2003 jachowski 2008 the maneuvering in restricted areas also becomes more difficult the turning radius may be increased to 2 3 times compared with open water liu et al 2015 lee et al 2005 koh and yasukawa 2012 this work investigates the influences of the channel dimension water depth ship draught and speed on the inland vessels the resistance ship generated waves and kelvin wave angle in confined waters will be characterized as functions of these parameters which are expected to reveal a part of the acting mechanism of the confinement effect of the restricted waterway 2 theoretical background 2 1 confinement effect of the waterway when a vessel is navigated in waters with limited width and depth the flow around the vessel will be altered by the restricted space normally the flow in the vicinity will be accelerated causing a strong return current and depression of water level according to the bernoulli s principle the accelerated fluid velocity could result in a pressure decrease the vessel experiences resistance increase and drops of speed and propulsion efficiency compared with open water leading to higher propulsion power and fuel consumption important thresholds of the confinement effect are denoted in table 1 three parameters are significant for various conditions where h w t d is for the influence of the channel bottom b c b s for the banks and a c a s for the fully confined area where the bank and bottom are both limited a s and a c are the cross sections of the vessel and waterway h w and t d are the water depth and ship draught b c and b s are the channel width and ship breadth the condition when h w t d 1 5 is normally called shallow water three flow regimes can be identified referring the vessel speed subcritical critical f r h 1 and supercritical fig 2 regime the phenomena of the three regimes are different in the subcritical condition the ship advancement pushes away the water at the bow and leaves a void at the stern creating a high and a low pressure region respectively the return current under the ship decreases the pressure resulting in a downward force on the hull and the so called squat appears the generated ship waves are able to overtake the downstream flow and travel in an upstream direction on the contrary in the supercritical condition the vessel will rise and the surface waves cannot travel upstream however it has been confirmed that there exists a limiting speed that self propelled vessels cannot exceed in the restricted waterway regardless of the power supplied known as the schijf limiting speed schijf 1949 1 f r h s c h i j f 8 cos 3 π 3 arccos 1 a s a c 3 the resistance in open shallow and fully confined waters are different whose typical curves can be observed in fig 2 for the case of shallow water no lateral restriction exists only the undulatory effect caused by the bottom takes place the key parameter is h w t d table 1 there exists a critical speed f r h 1 where the ship resistance increases dramatically around the critical speed the ship motions are unsteady when in confined water where the width is also restricted the hydraulic effect appears besides the undulatory effect the ratio a c a s table 1 dominates the resistance change with a subcritical and a supercritical speed pompée 2015 constantine 1960 2 subcritical f r h s u b 2 sin a r c s i n 1 m b 3 1 5 3 supercritical f r h s u p e r 2 sin π a r c s i n 1 m b 3 1 5 where m b a s a c is the blockage ratio as a result a transcritical region between the subcritical and the supercritical points exist for the confined water a weight factor has been defined by norrbin 1976 aiming at proposing an analytical model of the bank effect and it is further developed by lataire and vantorre 2008 of the ghent university into a mathematical model for calculating the increase of the ship resistance induced by the banks taking into account the relative position of the banks to the ship and the entire geometry of the cross section the weight factor of the confinement effect is defined using a decreasing exponential function lataire et al 2015 4 ω w e ξ y y y i n f l ξ z z t d where y i n f l b s 5 f r h 5 is the horizontal reach of the bank effect lataire and vantorre 2008 h t d and b s are the water depth ship draught and beam respectively ξ y and ξ z are regression coefficients obtained from experimental data the distribution of the weight factor can be observed in fig 3 the weight factor is a value between 0 and 1 which indicates the importance of a water particle for the bank effects induced on a ship lataire et al 2015 a water particle closer to the vessel will have a value closer to 1 the weight factor will tend to zero once the water particle is far away from the ship in all directions to make the confinement effect come into effect the weight factor need to be integrated over the cross section as follows 5 χ s 0 h 0 y s e α y y y d α z z t d y d z 6 χ p 0 h 0 y p e α y y y d α z z t d y d z where s and p denote the starboard and port sides of the vessel 2 2 theoretical analysis of linear ship wakes a moving object at the free surface will generate waves which can be decomposed into primary and secondary waves the primary waves follow the bernoulli equation the flows at the bow and stern decelerate and create high pressure regions the surface elevation corresponds with the pressure distribution yielding wave crests at the ship ends and a long wave trough along the middle this shape is speed independent the wave height depends quadratically on the speed bertram 2012 the secondary wave pattern also known as the kelvin wave pattern consists of transverse and divergent waves fig 4 many former studies investigated a moving pressure source at the water surface the actual ship waves are formed by the interference of these simple elements the wave system interference of a typical hull form is shown in fig 4 two waves starting with a crest are formed at the bow and stern there may exist other waves formed by the shoulders of the ship the sum of these wave profiles together with the primary wave pattern forms the actual ship generated waves a ship sails in water of finite depth follows the dispersion relation 7 ω g k w tanh k w h w where ω g k w and h w are the wave frequency gravity acceleration wave number and water depth respectively in deep water the water depth h w and the famous linear dispersion relation ω g k w is obtained the phase and group velocities can then be written as 8 c f ω k w g tanh k w h w k w 9 c g ω k w 1 2 g k w tanh k w h w g tanh k w h w g k w h w 1 tanh 2 k w h w by implementing the mathematical relations 10 cosh 2 k w h w sinh 2 k w h w 1 11 sinh 2 k w h w 2 sinh k w h w cosh k w h w the ratio of the phase velocity to the group velocity can be calculated as 12 c f c g 2 1 k w h w 1 tanh k w h w tanh k w h w 2 1 2 k w h w sinh 1 2 k w h w referring the geometrical schema in fig 5 a ship sails from a to b crossing the distance v t g however the wave energy only reaches c with the group velocity c g thereby crossing the distance c g t g in water of finite depth and deep water these waves actually fill a circle centred at o with a diameter v t g c g c f 1 we can then geometrically calculate the angle of the kelvin wedge as 13 sin α k v c g c f 1 t g 2 v t g v c g c f 1 t g 2 1 2 c g 1 c f 1 by incorporating eq 12 the final expression can be obtained soomere 2009 14 sin α k 1 2 k w h w sinh 1 2 k w h w 3 2 k w h w sinh 1 2 k w h w in deep water h w sin α k 1 3 then α k 19 47 this angle is independent of the hull shape ship waves in shallow and fully confined water areas are different but tightly connected the influence of water depth dominates the generated wave pattern as a function of the depth froude number fig 6 in shallow water traditional kelvin wave patterns can be observed at the subcritical region as the ship speed approaches the critical speed the wave angle approaches 90 i e the ship waves propagate parallel to the sailing line at the supercritical region the transverse waves are left behind and only divergent waves are present under this condition pethiyagoda et al 2018 the bow waves fold backwards to the ship with respect to the froude number as 15 α k a r c s i n 1 f r h the wave angle changing with the froude number is shown in fig 6 the blue line follows eq 14 and the brown follows 15 in a fully confined waterway the wave angle follows that in the shallow water however the waves will be reflected by the side wall 3 numerical and experimental details 3 1 governing equations during the numerical simulations the rans reynolds averaged navier stokes equations are solved jasak 1996 rusche 2003 16 u 0 17 ρ u t ρ u u p μ e f f u ρ g f σ where u ρ and p are the velocity density and

used during the inland transport in europe which consist of 1 pusher and several barges they are promising in increasing the payload by at least 20 and decreasing the cost by at least 30 for the european inland waterway transport system inbat european commission directorate general for research 2020 eurostat 2015 the body lines of the barge and the pusher are shown in figs 8 and 9 and the geometrical parameters of the vessels are shown in table 2 a model with the scale ratio 1 25 is selected during the simulations the bank slope is 2 1 to resemble the real waterways the computational domain is designed with two ship lengths upstream and three downstream from the ends of the bow and stern respectively the top boundary is placed one ship height from the top of the vessel the positions of other boundaries are determined by the dimension of the waterway the testing configurations can be found in the cross section view in fig 10 and table 3 where three channel bottom widths three water depths two ship draughts and several velocities are designed to account for various channel and transport conditions the two different draughts are specially designed for the empty and loaded conditions the weights of the pusher for the two different draughts are 54 77 and 144 11 kg while those of the barge are 102 81 and 265 22 kg the testing velocities are in the range of 0 1 m s which means that all our tests are within the subcritical and critical regions fig 2 the schijf limiting speed v s subcritical velocity v c s u b and confinement parameters h w t d a c a s b c b s are calculated for reference in table 3 the schijf limiting speed is for self propelled ships since the ship models in our tests are towed some cases exceed this limit the parameter h w t d is within 3 6 a c a s 4 263 44 211 and b c b s 2 305 7 368 which show that our tests cover a wide range of confinement conditions mesh details can be seen in fig 11 where the hull and free surface are refined and the boundary layer meshes are added near the hull surface the channel bottom is set to wall boundary condition the mesh information for water depth h w 0 24 m is shown in table 3 the incompressible multiphase solver in openfoam was used in our simulations the sst k ω turbulence model is used as denoted before the time derivative term is discretized using the implicit euler scheme the convection term in the momentum equation is discretized with second order linear upwind scheme and the convection term in the vof equation is discretized with second order tvd total variation diminishing scheme with van leer s flux limiter second order central differencing scheme with non orthogonal correction is used for the discretization of the diffusion term five outer corrections and two pressure corrections are adopted for the velocity pressure coupling iterations all equations are solved to the tolerance of o 8 jasak et al 2019 vukčević et al 2017 verification validation v v studies have been carried out in advance using the standard hull forms kcs and kvlcc2 without trim and sinkage mesh convergence study with three mesh resolutions and time step convergence study with four time steps were done to select appropriate mesh generation strategy and time step the resistance was also validated with the ittc benchmarks hexahedral mesh with local refinement near the hull the free surface and the wave angle region was designed the sst k ω model with wall function was used during the simulations boundary layer meshes were thus added near the hull surface making the non dimensional wall distance y about 60 a time step of 1 1 0 3 s was selected after bargaining between the computational speed and precision detailed convergence studies can be found in our earlier work du et al 2018a the simulations used 50 processors and took at most 42 cpu hours to finish 3 3 experimental setups the experiments were carried out corresponding with the simulations in the towing tank of the university of liège anast laboratory fig 12 the basin has been adapted with an aluminium bottom and pvc banks to account for the confinement condition the same convoy models with the scale ratio 1 25 were tested as the simulations fig 7 the barge and pusher were connected rigidly as shown in fig 12 b a six component dynamometer balance was used to measure the forces and moments on the vessel trim and sinkage were also recorded during the tests a flowmeter fixed on the carriage can detect the velocity of the vessel at different conditions as shown in figs 10 and 12 the bank with a slope 2 1 was designed three water depths three channel widths and two draughts were tested with various vessel speeds table 3 the system was calibrated before the experiments with the reported uncertainty 8 for the force 5 for the sinkage and 5 for the trim more details about the experiments can be found in linde et al 2016 and kaidi et al 2017 4 results and discussions 4 1 ship resistance the resistance results of the convoy 1 and 2 influenced by the channel width water depth and ship draught are processed and shown in figs 13 15 respectively the resistance of the convoy 2 is obviously larger because of an extra barge overall the numerical simulations agree well with the experiments the largest error between the two is about 8 it can be seen that the cases with smaller water depth narrower channel width and larger ship draught have higher advancing resistance since they are more confined in the waterway in confined waters return flows appear around the hull because of the limited space according to the bernoulli s principle the pressure in the vicinity drops and the flow will be accelerated stronger confinement effect will be induced on the vessel which leads to higher resistance the influence of the confinement effect is more evident for high ship velocity which can be observed from the resistance difference at each velocity value this effect is specially marked in fig 15 where the resistance difference is indicated between two different draught values with a larger velocity the resistance difference is also larger which means that a small increase of the draught can induce a high resistance increase when the vessel is fast this effects can also be observed for the channel width and water depth in figs 13 and 14 what channel width water depth and ship draught actually change is the confinement level this means that when the vessel is navigated with a higher speed the resistance becomes more sensitive to the confinement effect of the waterway the ratio between the two resistance values at a certain velocity is about the same value as the ratio between the draughts 0 1 0 04 0 25 this agrees with the traditional viewpoint that the resistance scales with l s t d where l s is the ship length t d is the draught the ship resistance is plotted against the blockage ratio m b a s a c in fig 16 for the same velocity ship resistance shows linear relationship with the blockage ratio and the curve seems to have a larger slope with a higher ship speed this again proves that a ship with higher speed is more sensitive to the confinement change of the waterway even for the same ship its performance changes when the draught is different in fig 17 the resistance changes more intensively with a larger draught value therefore when the ship is navigated in a confined waterway its performance should be reevaluated with different loadings the fitting coefficients of figs 16 and 17 are calculated in table 4 the values of the slope c a quantitatively demonstrates the above statements as a result special attentions should be paid to high loading large size and strong confinement conditions since the ship experiences large resistance and becomes sensitive and difficult to maneuver 4 2 ship generated waves the ship generated waves are analysed for various channel widths and draught conditions with the velocity 0 91 m s as shown in figs 18 and 19 the kelvin wave patterns generated by the bow and stern can be clearly observed the kelvin wedges are denoted with solid lines in the figures which represent the propagating directions of the ship waves several characteristic positions are marked for clarity for the convoy 1 fig 18 which consists of 1 pusher and 1 barge the reflection of the barge waves are evident at position a the bow waves of the barge are reflected by the channel wall and superpose with the downstream waves for the case with the channel width w b 2 88 m the waves of the barge propagate with a long distance and even exceed the waves of the pusher the reflected waves of the barge superpose with that of the pusher which prevent the reflection of the pusher waves at the banks however when the channel width w b 1 44 m and 0 72 m the barge waves are reflected at a relatively front position the wave interferences still happen but are not able to prevent the wave reflections of the pusher it can be seen that the positions of the wave reflection and interference appear earlier upstream with a smaller channel width under this condition the waves are reflected and interfered several times and result in a very complicated wave pattern at last because of the existence of another barge of the convoy 2 the interfering region of the waves increases and the wave pattern becomes more complex fig 19 the generated waves of the bow and stern of the pusher and barges superpose together in the confined waterway two apparent regions of the wave interference are marked with ellipses in each case since the wave interference happens more frequently the resulted waves become more disordered at further downstream especially near the pusher to quantitatively demonstrate the wave change the wave elevations at a specific position are extracted for comparison fig 20 shows the wave elevations at the lateral position y 0 3 m near the convoys regardless of the draught value the overall wave profiles are similar the ship generated waves drop beneath the initial free surface water level increases at the bow and maintains a long wave along the hull a maximum wave elevation can be observed at the bow and stern position the free surface in the middle of the barges and pusher maintains a low level the cases with a larger draught seem to have more intense wave changes and the channel confinement further amplifies this effect when the channel width is smaller the ship generated waves become higher at the bow and lower along the hull the ship waves are more complicated for the convoy 2 since the vessel is longer and more waves are superposed 4 3 wave angle characterizations the wave angle in the confined waterway was characterized in this section the wave angle formed by the highest peaks was measured these highest peaks were fitted with the least square approximation pethiyagoda et al 2014 the wave angles when v 0 91 m s are demonstrated in fig 21 which seem irrelevant with the channel width this means that the wave angle is only influenced by the water depth the banks can reflect the ship waves but not change the angle of the wedge in eq 14 it can be seen that the wave angle is only affected by the water depth the theoretical value of the wave angle is marked as α 1 the dotted line in fig 21 a and the point in b however this value clearly does not correspond with the simulation results which are influenced by the draught in our tests it can be observed that the vessel with a larger draught has a greater wave angle in figs 18 and 19 the wave reflections does appear earlier in the channel when the draught is larger and create more interferences in the downstream to account for the draught the original depth froude number is suggested to modify using the ship draught h t h w t d 23 f r h t v g h t with this modification the equations for the curve in fig 21 b are changed to 24 sin α k 1 2 k w h t sinh 1 2 k w h t 3 2 k w h t sinh 1 2 k w h t 25 α k a r c s i n 1 f r h t k w h t relates with f r h t as 26 tanh k w h t k w h t 3 2 k w h t sinh 1 2 k w h t f r h t 2 the new predicted values of the wave angle based on the modified water depth are denoted as α 2 and α 3 in fig 21 the two values agree better with the simulation results which proves the above deduction this modification is reasonable since the early theory predicts the wave angle at the free surface but the real ship penetrates into the water with a certain depth which must have influences on the wave generation and propagation the wave lengths corresponding with the two modified wave angles α 2 and α 3 are 0 0531 and 0 0390 m while the wave periods are 0 0583 and 0 0429 s 5 conclusions this paper investigated the ship hydrodynamics including the advancing resistance ship generated waves and kelvin wave angle in the fully confined waterway using numerical simulation techniques two inland convoys which consist of a pusher and one two barges commonly used in the inland transport in europe were tested by both towing tanks tests and cfd techniques regarding the cfd simulations an incompressible multiphase solver in the open source code openfoam was selected where the ship was fixed i e without trim and sinkage two convoy models three water depths two draughts three channel widths and various speeds were taken into account to cover a wide range of real conditions the experiments were carried out in the anast laboratory of the university of liège more complicated cases with trim and sinkage were tested to validate the numerical simulations by theoretically analyse the confinement effect and the linear wave theory the related parameters and their properties were concluded based on these theories the advancing resistance and ship generated waves of the two inland vessels were analysed and characterized the influences of the channel dimension water depth and ship draught on the resistance were analysed the simulation results agreed well with the experimental data even without trim and sinkage which seem not great enough to evidently influence the forces on the scaled model of the inland vessel also the trim and sinkage are relatively difficult to predict since they are easily covered by the experimental and numerical uncertainties according to our tests the ship resistance is reasonably increased with a higher confinement level i e smaller channel widths water depths and larger draughts to characterize the effect of the restriction of the channel the resistance was further analysed as a function of the blockage ratio according to the results the resistance was found to depend linearly on the blockage ratio more importantly the vessel was found to be more unstable and sensitive to the confinement effect when maneuvering with a high speed and loading condition which should be paid attention to in real situations the wave pattern becomes more complicated when the vessel is maneuvered in the confined waterway the propagation of the waves is limited by the channel banks and bottom reflections and refractions occur near the wall the pressure of the flow in the vicinity between the vessel and the wall drops and the fluids will be accelerated in that area the return current and the depression of the water level become more intensive compared with that in open water the reflected waves will superpose with the original waves and create very complicated wave patterns in the restricted waterway since the convoys in our tests consist of the barges and pusher the superposed waves of each component become more complex this complex wave pattern in the fully confined waterway was successfully captured in our simulations where the wave reflections and interferences were clearly observed regardless of the draught and channel width the overall wave pattern remains similar except the wave contours the wave elevation at specific positions were also extracted and analysed to quantitatively characterize the wave properties it was found that higher confinement i e large draughts and small channel width and water depths contribute to the wave elevation and the wave crests normally appear at the bow and stern positions of the vessels the wave angles formed by the highest peaks were also extracted and measured in this work the wave angle was found to change with different draught conditions which were not taken into account in the conventional theory of linear ship wakes a corrected version of the theory using the ship draught was proposed and validated using our simulation results in our opinion to more accurately predict the wave angle the draught should be taken into consideration in various conditions our work mainly concerns the advancing resistance the wave pattern of the inland convoy and the wave angle in the fully confined waterway these results reveal the acting mechanism of the confinement effect on the ship hydrodynamics on a certain level the revealings and characterizations are promising for predicting the ship resistance and wave pattern in the restricted waterway credit authorship contribution statement p du conceptualization formal analysis funding acquisition

n a j cos 2 π f j t ε j where a j 2 s f j δ f s is the wave spectrum or wave envelope spectrum f j is the wave frequency of the jth component δf is the frequency interval ε j is the random phase and then the phase function varying with the time is calculated through the hilbert transform as presented in eq 8 8 ϕ t arctan η t η t where η t is the hilbert transform of η t the wave envelope is obtained through eq 9 9 a 1 t η a t a 1 where a 1 is the mean value of wave envelope and calculated as 10 a 1 π m 0 2 1 2 then based on the wave spectrum and the phase function a wave train with the prescribed groupiness factors is calculated by eq 11 11 η 1 t a 1 t cos ϕ t secondly based on the obtained wave train under wave groups assume that the wave train can be also written as follows 12 η t

a i cos θ i d i a i sin θ i and there is 14 a i c i 2 d i 2 15 θ i arctan d i c i then calculate c i and d i to obtain the amplitude a i and the phase θ i corresponding to the frequency ω i for the ith wave component in this study employing the fourier series expansion liang et al 2010 liu and zhang 2015 the coefficients c i and d i can be derived by 16 c i 2 m n 1 m η t n cos ω i t n d i 2 m n 1 m η t n sin ω i t n where ω i i ω n n i 0 1 2 n ω n is the nyquist frequency ω n π δ t t n n δ t δ t is the time step m 2 n thus the amplitude a i and the phase θ i can be calculated by eqs 14 and

height is 2 16 m and the significant wave period is 6 0 s the wave envelope spectrums with different groupiness factors are shown in figs 2 and 3 it is found that the increase of the group factor of height results in a more significant peak value and a larger area of the wave envelope spectrum and a larger group length factor leads to a slightly smaller peak period of the wave envelope spectrum with the same wave spectrum the time histories of wave elevation for different groupiness factors are shown in figs 4 and 5 the results indicate that with the increase of the group factor of height the crest of wave elevation increases significantly fig 6 presents the statistical properties of wave elevation under wave groups including the maximum wave height h max the average of one tenth wave height h 1 10 the significant wave height h 1 3 and the significant wave period t 1 3 the results indicate that the statistics of wave height increase greatly with the increase of the wave group factor of height however the significant wave period is not sensitive to the wave group factor of height in addition the statistics of wave height vary slightly and the significant wave period decreases with the increase of the group length factor 3 modeling of fish cage and mooring system in this paper a fish cage with the grid mooring system in the water depth of 20 m is presented in fig 7 and the detailed material parameters are listed in table 1 the net forms a safe area to keep the fish live around a certain range as shown in fig 7 the float collar is used to provide the buoyancy force and the sinkers are used as the weighted system to avoid the high reduction of net volume under the environmental loading different from the conventional mooring system the fish cage is often moored by a submerged grid configuration the mooring line is composed of fiber rope and shackle chains the tension force of fiber rope can be calculated by t 381ε 1 132 where ε is the ratio of the elongation of fiber rope to the initial length of fiber rope the diameter of shackle chains is 16 mm and the fatigue damage of shackle chains in mooring line under wave groups is considered ma et al 2013 weller et al 2015 dynamic analysis for fish cage system in time domain is performed to obtain the tension response of mooring line through applying the lumped mass method and rigid body kinematics principle which was proposed by xu et al 2013 3 1 wave load since the scattering effect of the element is neglected as the element can be considered as a small body in comparison to the characteristic wave length morison equation is employed to calculate the hydrodynamic force on the fish cage and mooring system for the net and mooring lines the divided elements in mass spring model are shown in fig 8 then the calculation of the external forces on each element is conducted distributing the external forces evenly to the corresponding nodes the load on the lumped mass nodes is obtained for the float collar an element in the coordinate system is presented in fig 9 and the total force on float collar is calculated by the sum of the force on all the elements considering the relative motion of the fish cage system the modified morison equation can be utilized to estimate the wave loads and the formation is shown in eq 20 20 f 1 2 c d ρ a u r u r ρ v 0 a c m ρ v 0 a r in eq 20 u and r are the fluid particle velocity and the element velocity respectively a and r are the fluid particle acceleration and the element acceleration ρ is the water density v 0 a are the water

drag coefficients for the element v r η is the normal fluid velocity relative to the element and μ ρ are the viscosity and density of water respectively 3 2 motion equation for the net and mooring line the motion equation of the lumping mass point referring to newton s second law is written as 23 m r f t r r r f d f i b w f t in which m is the mass of mass point r r and r are the motion velocity and acceleration vector of mass point respectively f t x x x is the total external force vector of mass point including the hydrodynamic force f d f i buoyancy force b gravitational force w and the tension f t from the connected springs for the float collar the translations and rotations in the six degree of freedom directions are included using the rigid body principle the total external force of the float collar can be calculated from the summation of the external force acting on each element for the translations of the float collar the motion equations in fixed coordinate system as shown in fig 9 are expressed as 24 m c x i 1 n f x i m c y i 1 n f y i m c z i 1 n f z i in which m c is the mass x y z is the vector of the mass center acceleration n is the number of the elements f x i f y i f z i is the vector of the external force for the ith element and for the rotations using euler equations for rigid body dynamics the motion equations in body coordinate system

and the moment vector along the principle axes x y z at each time step the hydrodynamic forces and buoyant force are calculated and the motion equation is solved by runge kutta verner fifth order and sixth order method after obtaining the response of fish cage and mooring system the terms in the motion equations for the next time step are updated taking into account the new position of the fish cage system 4 fatigue damage assessment of mooring line to calculate the long term fatigue damage of mooring line table 2 lists the wave scatter diagram for the long term environmental conditions beels et al 2007 for case study in this study s n curve approach is used in practical engineering fatigue design usually a single slope s n curve is used and written as 26 n s m k in which n is the number of cycles of stress range s to failure k is the intercept parameter of s n curve k 6 0 1010 for shackle chains m is the slope of s n curve m 3 0 dnv os e301 2013 and ns 9415 2009 and the rainflow counting method can be employed to obtain the stress range for each short term sea state based on the miner s rule the accumulated fatigue damage d i for the duration t l in the ith short term sea state is calculated by 27 d i j 1 n i t l 1 n s i j where n i t l is the number of stress cycles in total time t l for ith sea state n s ij is the number of cycles to failure at stress range s ij substituting eq 26 into eq 27 the formulation of the accumulated fatigue damage d i is 28 d i j 1 n i t l s i j m 1 k then considering the probability of occurrence of the short term sea states the long term fatigue damage d can be written as 29 d i 1 n s p i d i in which p i is the occurrence probability of the ith short term sea state ns is the number of the short term sea states 5 results and discussion in this study the wave groups based on the wave envelope spectrum are numerically simulated and the hydrodynamic response of fish cage and mooring system under the environmental loads of wave groups is obtained three hour duration of the individual sea states is used for fatigue assessment of mooring line the sensitivity of the tension response stress range and fatigue damage of mooring line to the wave groupiness factors is investigated and for different wave groupiness factors the short term and long term fatigue damage of mooring line for fish cage is calculated 5 1 mooring line tension since the wave elevation with different groupiness factors is completely different it is essential to demonstrate the sensitivity of the mooring line tension for fish cage to the wave groupiness factors figs 10 and 11 present the time histories of tension response of mooring line for wave case 25 with different group factors of height and group length factors respectively the results indicate that the crest of mooring tension significantly increases with the increase of the group factor of height in wave groups in order to clearly present the difference of the mooring line tension for the variation of wave groupiness factors the statistical analysis is conducted and the results are shown in fig 12 the statistics of the mooring line tension include the maximum tension response f max the average of one tenth local peaks of mooring tension f 1 10 and the average of one third local peaks of mooring tension f 1 3 with the increase of the group factor of height the tension statistics f max f 1 10 and f 1 3 increase significantly this demonstrates that the mooring line tension is very sensitive to the group factor of height in wave groups in addition f max increases slightly with the increase of the wave group length factor and f 1 10 and f 1 3 vary insignificantly for different group length factors therefore the mooring line tension is much more sensitive to the group factor of height than the group length factor to further evaluate the effect of the intensity of wave groups it is necessary to investigate the stress range distribution of mooring line for fish cage for different wave groupiness factors 5 2 stress range histogram and fatigue damage plot adopting the rainflow counting method for the individual sea states the stress range of mooring line under wave groups can be calculated figs 13 and 14 show the stress range histogram of mooring line for fish cage with the variation of the group factors of height and group length factors respectively it can be found that the stress range distribution becomes more flat and covers a wider interval for a larger group factor of height and with the increase of the wave group factor of height the number of observation for a large stress range increases the results also indicate that the stress range distribution tends to have a heavier tail for a larger group factor of height and the high wave groups will cause a more significant maximum stress range of mooring line in addition as seen in fig 14 the variation of the group length factors has insignificant influence on the main body of the stress range histogram however the increase of the group length factor results in a boarder range of stress range distribution thus the stress range distribution of mooring line is very sensitive to the wave groupiness factors in order to evaluate the fatigue damage distribution of mooring line along the stress range under wave groups figs 15 and 16 show the fatigue damage plot of mooring line for different wave groupiness factors the results indicate that the effect of the small stress range part on the fatigue damage plot of mooring line is insignificant and the jaggedness of the fatigue damage plot at the large stress range part occurs this can be attributed to the small number of observation of stress range and the significant fatigue damage for each observation it can be found that with the increase of the group factor of height the fatigue damage plot of mooring line covers a much wider stress range interval which is consistent with the results of the stress range distribution and the largest fatigue damage occurs at a larger stress range for a larger group factor of height therefore the variation of the wave group factors of height has a non negligible influence on the fatigue damage plot of mooring line in addition there is an insignificant difference of the characteristics of the fatigue damage plot of mooring line for different group length factors 5 3 short term fatigue damage of mooring line the dynamic analysis of mooring line for fish cage under wave groups for a wave scatter diagram is conducted then the short term fatigue damage of mooring line under wave groups can be obtained using the miner s rule in this section the sensitivity of the short term fatigue damage of mooring line to the wave groupiness factors is investigated figs 17 and 18 present the short term fatigue damage of mooring line l 10 for the individual sea states with the variation of the wave groupiness factors it can be seen that the sensitivity of the short term fatigue damage of mooring line to the group length factor can be negligible however the variation of the group factors of height greatly affects the short term fatigue damage of mooring line and the results also indicate that a larger group factor of height in wave groups results in a more significant short term fatigue damage of mooring line the difference of the short term fatigue damage for different wave groupiness factors varies greatly for the individual sea states when the group factor of height varies from 0 39 to 0 93 the maximum relative difference of the short term fatigue damage can be up to 153 thus it is beneficial to carefully take the variation of the wave group factors of height into consideration to conduct the fatigue design of mooring line for offshore fish cage 5 4 long term fatigue damage of mooring line through weighting the short term fatigue damage with the occurrence probability of the corresponding wave state the long term fatigue damage of mooring line for fish cage under wave groups can be predicted table 3 shows the long term fatigue damage of the l 10 line for fish cage for different groupiness factors the results indicate that the variation of the group length factors in wave groups has a slight influence on the long term fatigue damage of mooring line however the long term fatigue damage of mooring line is very sensitive to the group factor of height it may be due to the high sensitivity of the wave envelope spectrum to the group factor of height and when the group factor of height varies from 0 39 to 0 93 the long term fatigue damage of mooring line can increase up to 123 this means that the long term fatigue damage under wave groups with a small group factor of height may be highly underestimated which is dangerous for the fatigue design of mooring line thus it is necessary to pay more attention on the variation of the group factors of height for the calculation of the long term fatigue damage of mooring line for practical engineering fatigue design of the mooring system of offshore structures 6 conclusions in this paper numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of mooring line for fish cage under wave groups then the long term fatigue damage of mooring line for fish cage system under wave groups is predicted and the influence of different wave groupiness factors including the group factor of height and the group length factor on the fatigue damage of mooring line is investigated some conclusions are summarized as follows the variation of the groupiness factors in wave groups has a significant influence on the characteristics of the mooring line tension for fish cage and a larger wave groupiness factor will lead to a border range of the stress range distribution and the fatigue damage plot of mooring line in addition the largest fatigue damage at the fatigue damage plot of mooring line occurs at a larger stress range for a larger group factor of height more importantly the short term and long term fatigue damage of mooring line is significantly sensitive to the group factor of height however the sensitivity of the fatigue damage of mooring line to the group length factor is insignificant the high wave groups will affect the long term fatigue damage of mooring line and the fatigue life of mooring system for fish cage in the future work it is worth investigating the influence of the intensity of wave groups on the extreme tension of mooring lines in the realistic seas for the safety of offshore structures credit

water particle velocity in the horizontal and vertical direction under wave groups is calculated as 18 u x z t i 1 n a i ω i cosh k i z h sinh k i h cos k i x ω i t θ i 19 w x z t i 1 n a i ω i sinh k i z h sinh k i h sin k i x ω i t θ i as such the wave elevation and water particles velocities in the whole flow field under wave groups can be obtained for a case study when the significant wave height is 2 16 m and the significant wave period is 6 0 s the wave envelope spectrums with different groupiness factors are shown in figs 2 and 3 it is found that the increase of the group factor of height results in a more significant peak value and a larger area of the wave envelope spectrum and a larger group length factor leads to a slightly smaller peak period of the wave envelope spectrum with the same wave spectrum the time histories of wave elevation for different groupiness factors are shown in figs 4 and 5 the results indicate that with the increase of the group factor of height the crest of wave elevation increases significantly fig 6 presents the statistical properties of wave elevation under wave groups including the maximum wave height h max the average of one tenth wave height h 1 10 the significant wave height h 1 3 and the significant wave period t 1 3 the results indicate that the statistics of wave height increase greatly with the increase of the wave group factor of height however the significant wave period is not sensitive to the wave group factor of height in addition the statistics of wave height vary slightly and the significant wave period decreases with the increase of the group length factor 3 modeling of fish cage and mooring system in this paper a fish cage with the grid mooring system in the water depth of 20 m is presented in fig 7 and the detailed material parameters are listed in table 1 the net forms a safe area to keep the fish live around a certain range as shown in fig 7 the float collar is used to provide the buoyancy force and the sinkers are used as the weighted system to avoid the high reduction of net volume under the environmental loading different from the conventional mooring system the fish cage is often moored by a submerged grid configuration the mooring line is composed of fiber rope and shackle chains the tension force of fiber rope can be calculated by t 381ε 1 132 where ε is the ratio of the elongation of fiber rope to the initial length of fiber rope the diameter of shackle chains is 16 mm and the fatigue damage of shackle chains in mooring line under wave groups is considered ma et al 2013 weller et al 2015 dynamic analysis for fish cage system in time domain is performed to obtain the tension response of mooring line through applying the lumped mass method and rigid body kinematics principle which was proposed by xu et al 2013 3 1 wave load since the scattering effect of the element is neglected as the element can be considered as a small body in comparison to the characteristic wave length morison equation is employed to calculate the hydrodynamic force on the fish cage and mooring system for the net and mooring lines the divided elements in mass spring model are shown in fig 8 then the calculation of the external forces on each element is conducted distributing the external forces evenly to the corresponding nodes the load on the lumped mass nodes is obtained for the float collar an element in the coordinate system is presented in fig 9 and the total force on float collar is calculated by the sum of the force on all the elements considering the relative motion of the fish cage system the modified morison equation can be utilized to estimate the wave loads and the formation is shown in eq 20 20 f 1 2 c d ρ a u r u r ρ v 0 a c m ρ v 0 a r in eq 20 u and r are the fluid particle velocity and the element velocity respectively a and r are the fluid particle acceleration and the element acceleration ρ is the water density v 0 a are the water

drag coefficients for the element v r η is the normal fluid velocity relative to the element and μ ρ are the viscosity and density of water respectively 3 2 motion equation for the net and mooring line the motion equation of the lumping mass point referring to newton s second law is written as 23 m r f t r r r f d f i b w f t in which m is the mass of mass point r r and r are the motion velocity and acceleration vector of mass point respectively f t x x x is the total external force vector of mass point including the hydrodynamic force f d f i buoyancy force b gravitational force w and the tension f t from the connected springs for the float collar the translations and rotations in the six degree of freedom directions are included using the rigid body principle the total external force of the float collar can be calculated from the summation of the external force acting on each element for the translations of the float collar the motion equations in fixed coordinate system as shown in fig 9 are expressed as 24 m c x i 1 n f x i m c y i 1 n f y i m c z i 1 n f z i in which m c is the mass x y z is the vector of the mass center acceleration n is the number of the elements f x i f y i f z i is the vector of the external force for the ith element and for the rotations using euler equations for rigid body dynamics the motion equations in body coordinate system are written as 25 i x ω x t i z i y ω z ω y m x i y ω y t i x i z ω x ω z m y i z ω z t i y i x ω x ω y m z in which i x i y i z ω x ω y ω z and m x m y m z are the inertia moment the angular velocity and the moment vector along the principle axes x y z at each time step the hydrodynamic forces and buoyant force are calculated and the motion equation is solved by runge kutta verner fifth order and sixth order method after obtaining the response of fish cage and mooring system the terms in the motion equations for the next time step are updated taking into account the new position of the fish cage system 4 fatigue damage assessment of mooring line to calculate the long term fatigue damage of mooring line table 2 lists the wave scatter diagram for the long term environmental conditions beels et al 2007 for case study in this study s n curve approach is used in practical engineering fatigue design usually a single slope s n curve is used and written as 26 n s m k in which n is the number of cycles of stress range s to failure k is the intercept parameter of s n curve k 6 0 1010 for shackle chains m is the slope of s n curve m 3 0 dnv os e301 2013 and ns 9415 2009 and the rainflow counting method can be employed to obtain the stress range for each short term sea state based on the miner s rule the accumulated fatigue damage d i for the duration t l in the ith short term sea state is calculated by 27 d i j 1 n i t l 1 n s i j where n i t l is the number of stress cycles in total time t l for ith sea state n s ij is the number of cycles to failure at stress range s ij substituting eq 26 into eq 27 the formulation of the accumulated fatigue damage d i is 28 d i j 1 n i t l s i j m 1 k then considering the probability of occurrence of the short term sea states the long term fatigue damage d can be written as 29 d i 1 n s p i d i in which p i is the occurrence probability of the ith short term sea state ns is the number of the short term sea states 5 results and discussion in this study the wave groups based on the wave envelope spectrum are numerically simulated and the hydrodynamic response of fish cage and mooring system under the environmental loads of wave groups is obtained three hour duration of the individual sea states is used for fatigue assessment of mooring line the sensitivity of the tension response stress range and fatigue damage of mooring line to the wave groupiness factors is investigated and for different wave groupiness factors the short term and long term fatigue damage of mooring line for fish cage is calculated 5 1 mooring line tension since the wave elevation with different groupiness factors is completely different it is essential to demonstrate the sensitivity of the mooring line tension for fish cage to the wave groupiness factors figs 10 and 11 present the time histories of tension response of mooring line for wave case 25 with different group factors of height and group length factors respectively the results indicate that the crest of mooring tension significantly increases with the increase of the group factor of height in wave groups in order to clearly present the difference of the mooring line tension for the variation of wave groupiness factors the statistical analysis is conducted and the results are shown in fig 12 the statistics of the mooring line tension include the maximum tension response f max the average of one tenth local peaks of mooring tension f 1 10 and the average of one third local peaks of mooring tension f 1 3 with the increase of the group factor of height the tension statistics f max f 1 10 and f 1 3 increase significantly this demonstrates that the mooring line tension is very sensitive to the group factor of height in wave groups in addition f max increases slightly with the increase of the wave group length factor and f 1 10 and f 1 3 vary insignificantly for different group length factors therefore the mooring line tension is much more sensitive to the group factor of height than the group length factor to further evaluate the effect of the intensity of wave groups it is necessary to investigate the stress range distribution of mooring line for fish cage for different wave groupiness factors 5 2 stress range histogram and fatigue damage plot adopting the rainflow counting method for the individual sea states the stress range of mooring line under wave groups can be calculated figs 13 and 14 show the stress range histogram of mooring line for fish cage with the variation of the group factors of height and group length factors respectively it can be found that the stress range distribution becomes more flat and covers a wider interval for a larger group factor of height and with the increase of the wave group factor of height the number of observation for a large stress range increases the results also indicate that the stress range distribution tends to have a heavier tail for a larger group factor of height and the high wave groups will cause a more significant maximum stress range of mooring line in addition as seen in fig 14 the variation of the group length factors has insignificant influence on the main body of the stress range histogram however the increase of the group length factor results in a boarder range of stress range distribution thus the stress range distribution of mooring line is very sensitive to the wave groupiness factors in order to evaluate the fatigue damage distribution of mooring line along the stress range under wave groups figs 15 and 16 show the fatigue damage plot of mooring line for different wave groupiness factors the results indicate that the effect of the small stress range part on the fatigue damage plot of mooring line is insignificant and the jaggedness of the fatigue damage plot at the large stress range part occurs this can be attributed to the small number of observation of stress range and the significant fatigue damage for each observation it can be found that with the increase of the group factor of height the fatigue damage plot of mooring line covers a much wider stress range interval which is consistent with the results of the stress range distribution and the largest fatigue damage occurs at a larger stress range for a larger group factor of height therefore the variation of the wave group factors of height has a non negligible influence on the fatigue damage plot of mooring line in addition there is an insignificant difference of the characteristics of the fatigue damage plot of mooring line for different group length factors 5 3 short term fatigue damage of mooring line the dynamic analysis of mooring line for fish cage under wave groups for a wave scatter diagram is conducted then the short term fatigue damage of mooring line under wave groups can be obtained using the miner s rule in this section the sensitivity of the short term fatigue damage of mooring line to the wave groupiness factors is investigated figs 17 and 18 present the short term fatigue damage of mooring line l 10 for the individual sea states with the variation of the wave groupiness factors it can be seen that the sensitivity of the short term fatigue damage of mooring line to the group length factor can be negligible however the variation of the group factors of height greatly affects the short term fatigue damage of mooring line and the results also indicate that a larger group factor of height in wave groups results in a more significant short term fatigue damage of mooring line the difference of the short term fatigue damage for different wave groupiness factors varies greatly for the individual sea states when the group factor of height varies from 0 39 to 0 93 the maximum relative difference of the short term fatigue damage can be up to 153 thus it is beneficial to carefully take the variation of the wave group factors of height into consideration to conduct the fatigue design of mooring line for offshore fish cage 5 4 long term fatigue damage of mooring line through weighting the short term fatigue damage with the occurrence probability of the corresponding wave state the long term fatigue damage of mooring line for fish cage under wave groups can be predicted table 3 shows the long term fatigue damage of the l 10 line for fish cage for different groupiness factors the results indicate that the variation of the group length factors in wave groups has a slight influence on the long term fatigue damage of mooring line however the long term fatigue damage of mooring line is very sensitive to the group factor of height it may be due to the high sensitivity of the wave envelope spectrum to the group factor of height and when the group factor of height varies from 0 39 to 0 93 the long term fatigue damage of mooring line can increase up to 123 this means that the long term fatigue damage under wave groups with a small group factor of height may be highly underestimated which is dangerous for the fatigue design of mooring line thus it is necessary to pay more attention on the variation of the group factors of height for the calculation of the long term fatigue damage of mooring line for practical engineering fatigue design of the mooring system of offshore structures 6 conclusions in this paper numerical simulations were conducted to investigate the hydrodynamic performance of mooring line for fish cage under wave groups then the long term fatigue damage of mooring line for fish cage system under wave groups is predicted and the influence of different wave groupiness factors including the group factor of height and the group length factor on the fatigue damage of mooring line is investigated some conclusions are summarized as follows the variation of the groupiness factors in wave groups has a significant influence on the characteristics of the mooring line tension for fish cage and a larger wave groupiness factor will lead to a border range of the stress range distribution and the fatigue damage plot of mooring line in addition the largest fatigue damage at the fatigue damage plot of mooring line occurs at a larger stress range for a larger group factor of height more importantly the short term and long term fatigue damage of mooring line is significantly sensitive to the group factor of height however the sensitivity of the fatigue damage of mooring line to the group length factor is insignificant the high wave groups will affect the long term fatigue damage of mooring line and the fatigue life of mooring system for fish cage in the future work it is worth investigating the influence of the intensity of wave groups on the extreme tension of mooring lines in the realistic seas for the safety of offshore structures credit

21722,a methodology for directly establishing the forces and moments on a maneuvering body based on the instantaneous state of the vehicle is demonstrated both classical and modern design of experiments were used to develop experimental design regions consisting of different combinations of inflow conditions data was generated using computational fluid dynamic simulations which were performed on darpa suboff and the virginia tech ellipsoid model at the parameters prescribed by the designed experiments nonlinear polynomial regression modeling and artificial neural network modeling were used to develop prediction models for the normal and side force coefficients of both geometries with functional dependence on the inflow conditions the prediction models were compared to published experimental data which showed excellent agreement within the experimental design region the classical and modern approaches were also compared to each other and various strengths and applicability were illustrated nonlinear polynomial regression modeling and classical design of experiments proved to be very insightful by elucidating which inflow parameters and inflow parameter interactions were significant to the prediction model artificial neural network modeling coupled with modern design of experiments was shown to be more accurate however gave no insight to the

commercial and defense sectors accurate prediction modeling can lead to computationally inexpensive meta models which fully characterize the geometric body in question ultimately these meta models can be used for geometric or other forms of goal oriented optimization such as drag reduction at minimal to no cost prediction modeling can also be applied to determining the maneuvering characteristics of aero hydrodynamic vehicles traditional maneuvering models use a series of coefficients based on taylor series expansion of the forces and moments to describe the motion of the vehicle the accuracy of these models is based on the number of coefficients used to describe the motion designers tend to limit motion to a single plane which reduces the number of coefficients required but these techniques fail to capture nonlinear effects due to motion in multiple planes in order to more accurately capture these nonlinear effects additional coefficients are required which significantly increases the number of experiments that must be run to establish these coefficients racine and paterson 2005 explored methods to reduce the number of coefficients required to accurately model the motion of a vehicle by determining the relative importance of each term terms that were considered less significant were dropped from the equations of motion however the final model produced mixed results when compared with experimental data simonsen et al 2012 also explored the use of simulated planar motion mechanism pmm tests where the minimum number of pmm tests required to provide sufficient accuracy was determined it was found that the number of pmm tests could be reduced by 30 without significant loss of accuracy the test matrix reduction however could not be accomplished in a systematic manner as the maneuvering model would easily become unstable and diverge a significant understanding of the vehicle s maneuvering characteristics was required prior to reduction of the test matrix to ensure stability would be maintained reducing this method s attractiveness for concept design hess 2002 demonstrated the power of recursive neural networks rnn for application to maneuvering prediction during the office of naval research maneuvering challenge where the rnn out performed models using lifting line theory modified potential flow and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans the challenge in the application of this rnn is it used 78 time accurate experimental data sets to train generation of this data would be cost and time prohibitive for ship design applications using physical experiments even considering the significant advances in computational fluid dynamics cfd and available computational resources generation of this type of data set is currently computationally prohibitive the question therefor remains of how to optimally gain insightful information with regard to characterization while keeping the computational cost relatively low the solution to this conundrum is through the use of design of experiments doe this paper aims to explore various statistical sampling methods inherent to doe which are somewhat specific to two different modeling techniques to be compared polynomial regression and artificial neural network modeling these two modeling techniques will be used to develop nonlinear relationships between normal force coefficient c z and side force coefficient c y as respective functions of the inflow conditions angle of attack α and side slip angle β this method allows the forces and moments to be established for a 6 degree of freedom 6 dof simulation directly based on the state of the vehicle in lieu of small angle limited linear derivatives the method is demonstrated here using two different geometries the darpa suboff model and the virginia tech scalene ellipsoid model the two different modeling techniques will be validated using experimental data for the two geometries published byroddy 1990 andgranlund 2009 for the darpa suboff model and the ellipsoid model respectively 2 design of experiments doe can be thought of as a process for planning an experiment so that appropriate data can be collected and analyzed by statistical methods resulting in valid and objective conclusions montgomery 2017 box et al 1978 doe is typically used in systems comprised of multiple inputs when a nonlinear functional relationship between the quantities of interest such as force and moment coefficients and the regressors or inputs and their interactions is required doe can be broken up into two categories classical and modern a brief comparison of which is given in table1 2 1 classical doe classical doe sampling methods are generally coupled with preliminary least squares regression modeling the analysis of variance anova significance testing and regression model reduction regressors such as the main effects from the inputs the effect of input interactions and the effect of various higher order terms are included in preliminary least squares regression models before significance testing is performed to determine which effects are inconsequential to the regression model insignificant terms are removed from the model and added to the error estimate of the model in this fashion nonlinear polynomial regression models can be created and refined to yield sought after functional relationships between outputs and regressors classical doe sampling methods were originally developed for use in physical experiments yondo et al 2018 and have been used with great success for complex aerospace and motorsport vehicle characterization applications murphy and landman 2015 doane and landman 2012 landman et al 2002 as well for suspension system design mohsen et al 2015 and instrumentation calibration reinholtz et al 2012 these sampling methods assume stochasticism or the presence of random pure error inherent to the physical experiment which is normally distributed n 0 σ 2 the presence of this pure error and its normality are key main assumptions used in anova which decouples the total variability in the response or functional output from least squares regression and tests the significance of the regressors to the meta model by comparing a measure of their variability their individual mean squares to the mean square error m s e of the regression model which serves as a measure of the stochasticism inherent to the experiment with the presence of this inherent error design points are chosen in a combinatorial fashion a priori which exploit aggressive regressor spacing allowing for a decreased number of samples typically factorial type designs and central composite designs ccd are used in classical doe with many alterations and augmentations possible which allow for the accommodation of testing limitations or the optimization of the experimental design augmentation usually concerns the addition of samples to the design space in order to enhance the predictive capabilities of the resultant regression model or to fulfill some alphabetic optimality criteria d optimality which is often used focuses on good model parameter estimation allowing for superior regressor screening capabilities myers et al 2016 i optimality works to reduce the average scaled prediction variance allowing for optimal predictive capabilities within the design space there are other alphabetic optimality criteria as well that will not be addressed in this paper but if interested can be found inmontgomery 2017 andmyers et al 2016 2 2 modern doe contrary to classical doe modern doe deals almost exclusively with computer based experiments these types of experiments are deterministic meaning that there is no measure of the inherent stochasticism the error is typically associated with grid discretization error round off error numerical convergence error etc meaning that for a fixed number of iterations a replicated computer experiment should yield the same results because of this there is no reference quantity with which to perform significance testing so other methods for statistical empirical modeling must be used which require different experimental sampling techniques various alphabetically optimal designs may be used like with classical doe however space filling designs are predominantly used there are several different space filling designs such as the uniform design ud latin hyper cube design sphere packing design etc which in general spread the design points out nearly evenly or uniformly throughout the region of experimentation adhering to some measure of uniformity determined by the design being used myers et al 2016 the purpose of this uniform sampling is to acquire data in a manner that will represent the entire experimental domain while minimizing the difference of the overall mean between the meta model and the experimental data fang et al 2005 these space filling designs often require more runs than typical classical doe designs such as factorial experiments since the experimental design points are placed at interior points rather than at the outer limits of the experimental domain alphabetic optimal designs are somewhat of a hybrid between classical and modern doe designs since they place points both on the exterior of the design space in a factorial fashion as well as on the interior to adhere to some optimality criterion there are many modeling techniques used with modern doe polynomial regression is often used however contrary to its use with classical doe anova may not be used due to the lack of an inherent stochasticism estimate and other forms of significance testing are needed for factor screening since the modeling procedure for modern doe does not involve anova it is more of an interpolation problem fang et al 2005 this broader interpolation problem lends itself to the application of machine learning ml algorithms such as bayesian estimation decision trees artificial neural networks ann etc all of which approach the general data interpolation problem somewhat abstractly in that they define the functional relationship between input and output in a black box mannerism without giving much insight as to which input factors are significant to the problem the ml modeling technique of particular interest to this research is the ann which will be discussed in subsequent sections the reader is referred todaronch et al 2017 cleaver et al 2016 montevechi et al 2007 and nazalla et al 2006 for various modern doe and modeling techniques as applied to the simulation of aerospace vehicles and manufacturing processes respectively 3 geometric configurations this research not only looks to compare different modeling techniques coupled with their respective sampling methodologies but it also aims to determine if there are any limitations imposed on the experimental design region by the cfd processes used to validate both the capabilities of the cfd solver and the meta models results are compared with the experimental data of the darpa suboff and the virginia tech scalene ellipsoid model the suboff geometry roddy 1990 was used in a bare hull configuration for simplicity and will generalize typical submersible bodies of revolution bor the scalene ellipsoid generalizes non bodies of revolution nbor and its asymmetric geometry will induce flow physics of greater complexity its geometric parameters were taken fromgranlund 2009 andsomero 2010 the coordinate system used for both geometries was located at each geometry s center of gravity and was such that the positive x direction faced upwind the positive y direction faced starboard and the positive z direction pointed downward 4 cfd solver hpcmp createtmsh navyfoam was used throughout the scope of this work navyfoam is a cfd solver that was developed under the dod high performance computing modernization program s hpcmp computational research and engineering acquisition tools and environments createtm ship s hydrodynamics project navyfoam builds upon the computational framework of the open source cfd tool kit openfoam by implementing a large number of new features and capabilities including new top level solvers for single and multi phase flows libraries of new numerical schemes and algorithms advanced physical models and custom postprocessing utilities here the single phase incompressible flow solver sransfoam is used to solve the equations for the conservation of mass and momentum given as 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p ν e f f u t u where ν e f f ν ν t ν is the kinematic viscosity ν t is the turbulent eddy viscosity and the superscript t in t represents the matrix transpose the navier stokes solvers in navyfoam employ a cell centered finite volume method based on a multidimensional linear reconstruction scheme that permits use of arbitrary polyhedrals kim et al 2017 one of the features in navyfoam which was taken advantage of in this work is the inclusion of wilcox s updated 2006 k ω turbulence model this updated two equation turbulence closure model used in reynolds averaged simulations has been proven to resolve separated flows more efficiently than its preceding rendition wilcox et al 2006 wilcox 2008 5 technical procedure 5 1 mesh generation 5 1 1 surface mesh generation the surface mesh for the darpa suboff model and the ellipsoid were both created such that adequate cell coverage spanned the entirety of each model both surface meshes were triangulated and unstructured the darpa suboff model had variable surface mesh density whereas the ellipsoid had a constant density the darpa suboff surface mesh had diminishing cell sizes with a maximum cell size δ x of 0 01 m along the parallel mid body or non dimensionalized by body length δ s 0 0024 the stern was separated into three sections with the approximate separation located at geometric slope changes along the surface in the downwind direction each of these sections decreased in cell size by a factor of 1 5 sequentially starting from the parallel mid body while maintaining one to one cell connectivity between sections the surface mesh on the bow section was 1 5 times smaller than the parallel mid body the ellipsoid geometry s surface mesh had a constant mesh density with an approximate δ s 0 0044 5 1 2 volume mesh generation the volume meshes for both the darpa suboff model and the ellipsoid shown in figs 1 and 2 were created as hex dominant volume meshes with several levels of refinement from the far field the outer limits imposed on the volume mesh for both geometries were as follows 3 body lengths in the downwind direction 2 5 body lengths in the upwind direction and 2 body lengths port starboard of both geometries the maximum cell length along the outer region was approximately δ s 0 2 refinement regions were added around the anticipated region of the wake for at least 1 full body length as well as around both geometries the wake refinement regions were 7 levels 8 volumetrically each level of refinement greater than the outer region δ s and the geometry refinement regions were 6 levels of refinement greater the addition of these two refinement regions served the purpose of increasing the flow field resolution in regions of particular interest to this study since forces integrated over the geometries are of utmost importance accurate modeling of the flow field around the hull and in the wake region is necessary fig 2 depicts the two refinement regions around the darpa suboff model the first layer of cells adjacent to the geometries was sized to accommodate a y distance of approximately 60 for the reynolds number re specific to each geometry the reynolds numbers were set to match those given in the published experimental data and will be addressed in subsequent sections roddy 1990 granlund 2009 5 2 cfd implementation validation prior to comparing doe sampling methodologies and modeling techniques cfd validation was necessary to determine the accuracy of the numerical techniques implemented and their ability to properly simulate the physical flow phenomena surrounding each geometry this was done by running simulations where only one of the two inflow variables was modified in an effort to replicate the experimental results since the darpa suboff model is axisymmetric only one of the input parameters will be used whereas the nbor nature of the scalene ellipsoid will require that both inflow parameters be investigated individually for the incompressible flow about our two geometries a steady state solution was contrived the laplacian terms associated with the diffusion of momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent specific dissipation were discretized spatially using second order linear interpolation schemes first order spatial upwind discretization was applied to the divergence schemes associated with the convection of the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent specific dissipation the convective momentum on the other hand was spatially discretized using a blend between a second order linear interpolation scheme and a first order spatial upwind scheme the matrix representation of the discretized set of linear algebraic equations for the momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent specific dissipation is preconditioned using a symmetric diagonal incomplete cholesky method and solved with a preconditioned bi conjugate gradient scheme pbicg the poisson s equations for the pressure and pressure correction derived from the momentum equations and utilized by the semi implicit method for pressure linked equation simple algorithm were preconditioned using an asymmetric diagonal incomplete cholesky method and solved with a preconditioned conjugate gradient scheme pcg solution tolerances were specified such that iteration would ensue until the residuals associated with the turbulence closure equations were reduced by 6 orders of magnitude and the residuals associated with the pressure pressure correction and momentum equations were reduced by 7 orders of magnitude these convergence criteria were satisfied before the simple method s outer loop began the next iteration under relaxation was also specified to promote the stability of the iterative process and two non orthogonal correctors were utilized due to the non orthogonality associated with the unstructured meshes used 5 2 1 prescribed simulation parameters to accurately replicate the incompressible flow around the geometries in question dynamic similarity was maintained by prescribing values of reynolds number that matched those of the published experiments for darpa suboff r e 1447 1 0 6 and for the scalene ellipsoid r e 4 5 1 0 6 roddy 1990 granlund 2009 inflow velocity magnitudes and kinematic viscosities were modified to accommodate these reynolds numbers for all inflow conditions throughout the simulations conducted in this research to determine what the proper inflow conditions should be in the body fixed reference frame coordinate system described in section3 it was necessary to transform the velocity components from the inertial reference frame using the euler rotation angles given ineq 3 bossert et al 2003 3 u b cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 cos θ 0 sin θ 0 1 0 sin θ 0 cos θ 1 0 0 0 cos ϕ sin ϕ 0 sin ϕ cos ϕ u i where ψ is the yaw angle θ is the pitch angle and ϕ is the roll angle utilizing the coordinate transformation given ineq 3 velocity conditions were calculated and imposed at the inlet and the far field sides while a zero gradient condition was given at the outlet the geometric surfaces were given a no slip velocity condition the pressure was given a gauge value of zero at the outlet a zero gradient pressure condition was imposed along all other domain boundaries as well as along the geometric surfaces since the k ω turbulence model was used the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent specific dissipation ω were prescribed to 3 75 1 0 5 m 2 s 2 and 1000 s 1 respectively at the inlet zero gradient turbulence conditions were given at the far field sides and the outlet for the cfd validation α values of 0 3 5 7 5 8 10 and 13 were simulated and compared with the experimental results for the darpa suboff geometry for the scalene ellipsoid model α and β were each treated individually while holding the other parameter constant values of 0 3 5 8 and 10 for α and 0 3 5 8 10 13 and 15 for β were simulated and compared with experimental results the inflow velocities corresponding to these angles and for combinations of angles in subsequent sections were all transformed from the inertial frame of reference to the body fixed frame using eq 3 5 2 2 cfd validation the numerical methods outlined previously were executed in navyfoam for each geometry which produced good agreement with the published experimental results roddy 1990 granlund 2009 and will be compared in this section the darpa suboff model was simulated at α values ranging from 0 to 13 and the results for c z are shown in fig 3 where force is non dimensionalized by l 2 as 4 c z z 1 2 ρ u 2 l 2 it should be noted that the force coefficient data for all experiments conducted in the scope of this research were averaged over the last 200 iterations since the geometry was axisymmetric the results were extended to negative α values by mirroring the results about the x and y axes to aid in the visualization of the result comparison analysis of c y was not needed due to the symmetry the percentage errors between the fine mesh cfd results and the published experimental results were calculated with their averaged value being 5 18 the same comparison was done with the virginia tech scalene ellipsoid results however since it is a nbor the lateral direction was also analyzed the results are plotted in figs 4 5 and 6 since there were discrepancies in the c y data the yaw moment coefficient c n has also been plotted in fig 6 the percentage differences averaged over the aforementioned discrete data points for c z and c n were 5 67 and 2 17 respectively 5 3 doe and modeling procedure accurate results have been shown achievable for angles up to at least to 13 15 in both α and β respectively for the purpose of this research the region of interest was chosen to be between 8 and 8 for both α and β to provide the ability to evaluate model performance in prediction beyond the range of data included 5 3 1 classical doe implementation typically there is a sequential nature involved with classical doe methodology after the region of experimentation has been defined a two level factorial experiment is first generated to allow for factor screening or significance testing this involves the generation of a preliminary least squares regression fit to the data this regression model takes the generic form ofeq 5 which is defined as a multiple linear regression model myers et al 2016 5 y i ξ 0 j 1 k ξ j x i j ε i f o r i 1 2 n where ξ 0 is the model intercept ξ j are regression coefficients and ε i are sum of squares of the error the standard procedure decomposes the error in the regression model into two parts a contribution from the variability in each individual regressor and the contribution from the stochasticism inherent to the experiment these contributions are namely the mean square of each regressor and the m s e respectively the anova process then determines the significance of inputs and multi input interactions to the regression model by performing an f test which compares the error estimate of the regressors to the error estimate of the stochasticism insignificant terms are dropped from the model and added to the estimate of the pure error once it is known which terms are insignificant sequential experimentation can be done without these terms occasionally reducing the number of experimental runs to be conducted if a factor is eliminated completely from the experiment most sequential experimentation with a two level factorial experiment involve the augmentation of the experimental design space with the addition of axial points and center points as shown in fig 7 allowing for the estimation of quadratic curvature a design of this form is typically called a central composite design ccd axial points are generally spaced such that certain properties of the experimental design space are achieved such as rotatability significance testing is performed again with this new design space to determine which higher order terms and interactions are significant to the new second order regression model which takes the general form ofeq 6 myers et al 2016 the final polynomial regression model will be a direct consequence of the significance testing of regressors toeq 6 6 y ξ 0 j 1 k ξ j x j i j 2 k ξ i j x i x j j 1 k ξ j j x j 2 ε to perform the standard approach outlined above certain assumptions must be satisfied which define characteristics of the experimental data the first assumption concerns the normality of the experimental data and of the error requiring that they both conform to a gaussian distribution the second assumption is that the data have no time dependence this ensures that the stochasticism in the experiment is not due to a process error such as hysteresis wind tunnel warm up error or other time dependent forms of error the last assumption is that the data and the stochastic error both have constant variance with these three assumptions met the residuals or discrete differences between the experimental data and the regression model prediction of the experimental data should be completely structure less allowing for the m s e to be used as a measurement statistic for anova since the form of the polynomial regression can be assumed to be cubic for both the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid as suggested byroddy 1990 andgranlund 2009 an experimental design was chosen which included axial and center points to determine the curvature of the responses c z and c y which were functions of α and β a face centered design fcd was used with axial points located along the faces of the experimental region the general form of a cubic regression model in two factors has 10 model terms which is equivalent to the number of experimental design points indicating saturation to address this six additional model points were chosen in an i optimal fashion to reduce the average scaled prediction variance throughout the region of experimentation two of the points involved with this augmentation were center runs to help stabilize the prediction variance and provide additional degrees of freedom for pure error estimation myers et al 2016 this 16 point design space in two factors produced the randomly ordered experimental design depicted in fig 8 and tabulated in table2 since the regression model form has already been determined to be cubic the preliminary model with which to perform significance testing takes the form ofeq 7 for both c z and c y for both geometries 7 y ξ 0 ξ 1 α ξ 2 β ξ 12 α β ξ 11 α 2 ξ 22 β 2 ξ 112 α 2 β ξ 122 α β 2 ξ 111 α 3 ξ 222 β 3 the normal probability plots for c z of the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid and c y of the scalene ellipsoid are shown in figs 9 11 the results of which show that the normality assumption is violated for the c z of suboff this means that anova cannot be performed without data manipulation due to the deterministic nature of the experiment the residuals of the scalene ellipsoid aside from a few outliers seem to trend towards normality without any significant defects in behavior it should be noted that these normal probability plots are preliminary and correspond to residuals from the full regression model eq 7 they are used simply to determine the general trend in data and outliers will be addressed in subsequent sections once anova is performed the normal probability plots of the reduced models will be analyzed and detailed in section6 the residuals vs the predicted responses for the c z of the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid and the c y of the ellipsoid are plotted in figs 12 and 13 to determine if there is any structure to the residuals aside from the obvious symmetry of the residuals there appears to be no real structure to the residuals the lines in figs 12 and 13 are indicative of 2 and 3 residual standard deviations respectively since none of the residual values lie outside of these standard deviation boundaries it is safe to assume that the residuals conform to a gaussian distribution and are unstructured with a mean of 0 an analysis of the time history of the residuals is not necessary since each simulation was run independently of one another what this preliminary residual analysis suggests is that the cfd data for the darpa suboff model adheres to two of our three assumptions necessary for anova and the data for the scalene ellipsoid adheres to all three of our assumptions it is believed that the unsteadiness associated with the bluff bodied nature of the scalene ellipsoid is the proprietor of the variance in the cfd data not only is the ellipsoid a complex geometry over which to resolve the flow field but the reynolds number is low reducing the nearfield flow stability all of these indicate that the problem is truly an unsteady one and yet it was solved using a steady state solution a look at the cfd force or moment coefficients at an experimental center point shows the pure error associated with noise caused by unsteadiness these values plotted against the iteration number are shown in fig 14 and indicate that the steady state simulation of a truly unsteady flow problem not only has very similar behavioral trends as a wind tunnel test but also has a similar variance stringer 2017 the lines plotted in fig 14 take on the same meaning as in figs 12 and 13 indicating that the pure error of an individual run also has constant variance and is structure less a look at the c z residuals of the darpa suboff model in fig 14 suggests that there is not enough error present for significance testing the flow field of the darpa suboff was less complex than the ellipsoid because it was axisymmetric with a tapered stern it was also run at a higher reynolds number promoting flow field stability and numerical convergence becoming more deterministic in nature than the ellipsoid simulations because of this and because of the lack of normality of the residuals fig 9 a normally distributed pure error n 0 σ 2 5 1 0 5 calculated from wind tunnel testing data at α 0 tabulated bystringer 2017 was added to the 16 experimental runs this pure error typically associated with wind tunnel tests was added to the data in an effort to provide stochasticism as a measurement statistic for significance testing another look at the normal probability plot of the residuals using the darpa suboff data with injected error fig 15 shows that the normality assumption of anova has now been met therefore anova will be done for both the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid with the inherent stochasticism being solely a measurement of flow unsteadiness either from the numerical simulation for the ellipsoid or from typical wind tunnel testing error added to the suboff data if a regressor is shown to be significant by comparing it to the unsteadiness it will not be excluded from the regression model taking the mean over 200 iterations will be thought of as equivalent to time averaging wind tunnel test data for the ellipsoid the same was done to the darpa suboff test data prior to adding actual wind tunnel testing error significance testing and model reduction were performed on the c z data for both the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid as well as for the c y data for the ellipsoid the results are detailed in section6 5 4 modern doe implementation a modern doe approach has also been explored since these types of experimental designs are tailored towards computer based experiments cfd was used throughout the entirety of this experiment which is typically deterministic in nature and was shown in the previous section the same number of experimental design points was used for the modern doe approach as for the classical approach to more directly compare the two design spaces and a uniform design space was chosen based upon the limited number of runs the meta model selection ann and the desired outcome optimal prediction capability the uniform design ud places points in a fashion that minimizes some measure of non uniformity in this case the centered l 2 discrepancy between the design points and a theoretical uniform distribution hickernell 1998 the design is shown in fig 16 and tabulated in table3 the uniformly placed points are meant to minimize the difference between the overall mean eq 8 and the sample mean eq 9 throughout the entirety of the design space fang et al 2005 8 e y f x d x 9 y d n 1 n i 1 n f x i many of the modeling procedures used with modern doe techniques work in an iterative fashion adjusting or training model parameters by looping over the collected data until some goodness of fit measurement is sufficiently minimized typically these goodness of fit measures are called penalty functions the most common of which being the quadratic loss function or the sum of the squared difference between the collected data and the data predicted by an arbitrary model the minimization of this function is a problem in convex optimization and typically machine learning ml algorithms are implemented to solve this minimization problem the overall goal is to not only minimize this function and provide the best fit of the meta model to the collected data but also to be able to extend the meta model to arbitrary data within the design region not collected in the experiment the ability of the meta model to conform to both the training data and the validation data is the over arching problem especially for prediction modeling an artificial neural network ann was chosen as the meta model to fit the data more specifically a single layer perception slp the slp aims at replicating the architecture of the neurons in the human brain set up in layers as shown in fig 17 each layer consists of a number of activation functions or neurons aligned in parallel all of the neurons of a particular layer are activated in unison with different multiplicative weights along the connections between neurons inputs and outputs the slp architecture used throughout the modern doe modeling procedure contained one hidden layer consisting of 5 hyperbolic tangent activation functions each activation function can be thought of as a hyperplane with values between 1 and 1 following the nonlinear form of the hyperbolic tangent function alpaydin 2014 these activation functions are necessary to introduce nonlinearity to the ann enabling it to effectively model complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs sharma 2017 walia 2017 the number and type of activation functions used are heuristically determined and it should be noted that anns of different architectures and consisting of different activation functions were investigated but showed significant bias or over fitting to the simulated results the chosen slp architecture was determined to be optimal for this research the input layer contains the values for α and β at each design point which are passed through the slp randomly and the multiplicative weights along the connections are modified until the quadratic loss function is minimized in a feed forward gradient descent training manner due to the limited number of design points a k fold method was used for validating the slp where the data was divided into 3 subsets each subset was used to validate the model fit after training and the kth model with the best fit was selected as the final model statistical analysis of the collected data is not necessary for a ml approach because input significance is inconsequential to most ml modeling procedures therefore no insight is gained about which inputs or input interactions are significant to the ann rather than excluding insignificant terms the ann works with combinations of highly nonlinear mixtures of inputs determined by the number of hidden layers the number of activation functions in each layer and the form of the activation function specified by the engineer or researcher based on these specifications an ann effectively takes on a black box form to accurately map the inputs to the outputs throughout the experimental design region in a way that generalizes to arbitrary data inside this design region the specific anns created to model the previously defined outputs for the darpa suboff and the scalene ellipsoid models will be analyzed in section6 6 results and discussion 6 1 classical doe results significance testing was carried out against the inherent stochasticism due to unsteadiness for the scalene ellipsoid and against the injected error for the darpa suboff model this involved an f test on each factor against the error in the preliminary regression models at a 6 5 level of significance insignificant terms were dropped from the preliminary models and newer more accurate regression models for each output quantity of interest were fashioned the final form of the regression model for c z of the darpa suboff model as a cubic function of α β and various interaction terms is shown byeq 10 likewise the final regression models of c z and c y for the scalene ellipsoid are shown by eqs 11 and 12 respectively 10 c z s o 1 0025 1 0 5 9 70794 1 0 5 α 4 23273 1 0 7 β 4 74999 1 0 8 α β 7 51526 1 0 8 α 2 4 42186 1 0 7 β 2 1 49511 1 0 6 α β 2 1 63054 1 0 6 α 3 11 c z e l 6 56441 1 0 5 7 89135 1 0 4

2 1 31612 1 0 6 β 2 6 9502 1 0 7 α 2 β 1 68044 1 0 6 β 3 the pure quadratic terms α 2 and β 2 as well as the second order interaction term α β for both c z and c y were found to be insignificant to the models however were included to maintain term hierarchy this is a common practice associated with anova and was done because higher order terms α 3 and α β 2 for c z and β 3 and α 2 β for c y were found to be significant to the models a residual analysis was performed on these new regression models to determine if our three assumptions of anova were maintained through the significance testing the normal probability plot of c z for both the suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid are shown in figs 18 and 19 and the normal probability plot of c y for the ellipsoid is shown in fig 20 all of which validate the normality assumption figs 21 and 22 show the residuals plotted against the predicted values to determine whether the variance is constant and structure less based off these plots it can be ascertained that all assumptions of anova have been validated the third assumption is inherent to the experimental procedure since all cfd runs were conducted separately it is intuitive that the run order has no effect on the residuals there were a few points on the two standard deviation limit in figs 21 and 22 but are inconsequential to this analysis and are not considered outliers with the residual analysis producing satisfactory statistical results which validated that the anova assumptions were not violated the regression models can confidently be assumed to adequately represent the data in a statistical sense regression model fit statistics were calculated for all three regression models and are shown in table4 the adjusted r 2 was used to show the amount of reduction in the variability of the experimental data points by using the regression models montgomery 2017 higher values indicate a better representation of the experimental data by the regression model it is scaled to the number of regressors making it an unbiased estimate which will not inflate with the number of model terms contrary to the unadjusted r 2 as it can be seen from table4 all three regression models represent the experimental data quite well a look at the predicted r 2 values indicate the predictive capabilities of the regression model in the experimental design region accounting for the variability in predicting new data points within the experimental domain montgomery 2017 the predicted r 2 values are calculated using a leave one out method where a data point is excluded from the data set used to fit the model this model is then used to predict the data point left out and the error is determined this is done for all possible subsets and these errors are added together the values for c z for both the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid model indicate that the regression models eqs 10 and 11 account for over 99 of the variability in predicting new observations eq 12 however only accounts for approximately 80 of the variability in predicting new observations as opposed to the 98 of the variability in the original experimental data the c z regression models for both geometries eqs 10 and 11 were used to predict responses at α values both in the experimental domain and outside of the experimental domain to determine the regression model s extrapolation capabilities the parameter β was held constant at 0 to perform a direct comparison to the published data and to the cfd validation points from section5 2 2 the range of α was chosen to be from 16 to 16 with 1 increments and the results of this analysis have been plotted in figs 23 and 24 the same was done foreq 12 however α was held constant and β ranged from 16 to 16 in increments of 1 as shown in fig 25 it should be reiterated that the experimental domain ranges from 8 to 8 meaning that eqs 10 and 11 not only show exemplary prediction performance within the experimental domain but these regression models can also be used outside of the experimental domain and will extrapolate well up to approximately 13 for darpa suboff and 16 for the scalene ellipsoid fig 25 not only shows ambiguity between the regression model fit and the cfd data but also between the regression model fit and the data published bygranlund 2009 which was noted in section5 2 2 the regression model was not made to fit the published data however it was made to fit the cfd data obtained from simulating the design points in table2 with that it can be said thateq 12 does represent the cfd data to some level of accuracy within the experimental domain but does not extrapolate well and has opposite curvature to that of the cfd validation points and to the published data beyond the extents of the experimental domain response surfaces within the experimental region for the three regression models eqs 10 12 were also created and are shown in figs 26 28 these response surfaces aid in the visualization of the effects on the response from varying both α and β the main purpose of this research was to analyze and compare modeling procedures with their respective experimental design spaces and not necessarily to perform a proper fluid dynamic study so the results of the response surface will only briefly be mentioned figs 26 and 27 show that for both geometries β acts to parabolically augment the normal force at α angles greater or less than zero as the total angle of incidence is increased the side force of the ellipsoid is shown to exhibit a similar behavior in fig 28 this effect can be seen more in depth for c z of the suboff model in fig 29 comparing figs 26 and 27 shows that the normal force augmentation from β is less for the ellipsoid than it is for suboff fig 28 shows that α has a very similar effect on the side force as β does on the normal force further for the ellipsoid the rolling moment coefficient should also be investigated for a proper fluid dynamic study 6 2 modern doe results a similar study was conducted on the anns that were fit to the experimental data using the procedure outlined in section4 d these ann s are shown by eqs 13 15 since the ann structure depends on activation functions significance testing was not necessary for model formulation 13 c z s o 6 6140 34 240 v 1 15 480 v 2 2 6978 v 3 10 571 v 4 70 852 v 5 v 1 tanh 0 047591 0 003124 α 0 0032646 β v

much insight into which effects are actually significant to the response looking at the fit statistics for each ann in table5 not only indicates that eqs 13 15 represent the experimental data quite well but it also indicates that these ann s have good prediction capabilities within the experimental region these results are further validated by figs 30 32 which use the anns eqs 13 15 to predict responses for the same input parameters as for figs 23 25 fig 30 verifies the model fit ofeq 13 and also shows that it can extrapolate outside of the experimental design region quite well this ann is very comparable in accuracy to its regression model counterpart eq 10 figs 31 and 32 however show that although the ann s fit with good accuracy compared with the experimental data points they cannot be extrapolated outside of the experimental domain fig 32 shows that the ann for c y actually has better accuracy than its regression model counterpart within the experimental domain the ann was modeled to fit the cfd simulation data at the design points in table3 which it does quite well the normal force augmenting effects of β for suboff can again be seen in the response surface shown in fig 33 in comparison to the regression model counterpart in fig 26 the ann seems to over exaggerate these effects for negative angles fig 34 shows that the normal force augmenting effects of β are actually skewed towards one side which can be thought of as a slight misprediction since the geometry is symmetric the response surfaces for eqs 14 and 15 have also been plotted in figs 35 and 36 for comparison purposes the response surface for c z of the ellipsoid shows that there is also an over exaggeration of the normal force augmentation due to β skewed towards negative α values the response surface for c y shows that the ann lacks symmetric behavior in both α and β which is incorrect it is difficult to definitively make a statement pertaining to predictions of c y for both the regression model and the ann eqs 12 and 15 respectively this is due to the issue of small numbers with the response c y being an order of magnitude less than c z values and only one order of magnitude larger than the residuals it is believed that there is not enough variance in the data for general trends to be predicted which is somewhat alluded to by the lower predicted r 2 value of the regression model eq 12 in table4 although the ann eq 15 does a better job fitting the data and predicting the experimental design points noted by a high predicted r 2 it essentially interpolates the experimental design points and does not follow any particular trend inherent to the underlying physics as noted by fig 36 the regression model eq 12 on the other hand exhibits symmetric side force augmentation from α as expected 7 conclusions throughout this work two modeling techniques nonlinear polynomial regression modeling and artificial neural network modeling coupled with doe techniques commonly used by each respective modeling procedure have been analyzed and compared both classical and modern doe were used to develop experimental design regions consisting of different combinations of inflow conditions namely α and β nonlinear polynomial regression modeling and artificial neural network modeling were employed to map these inputs to the normal force and side force coefficients c z and c y of the darpa suboff model and the virginia tech scalene ellipsoid model navyfoam was used to perform cfd simulations on both geometries at the combinatorial inflow conditions prescribed by each experimental design region significance testing and model reduction produced the final nonlinear polynomial regression model forms based upon the experimental design region created using classical doe an ann was also fit to the cfd data produced by simulating points in the design space created using modern doe fit statistics were calculated which showed that both the regression models and the anns fit the experimental data quite well however the ann outperformed the regression model for c y of the ellipsoid response surfaces were also generated to visualize general response trends at combinatorial inflow conditions which indicated that β had an augmenting effect on the normal force coefficient for both geometries and α had an augmenting effect on the side force coefficient of the ellipsoid both modeling techniques were shown to each have their own advantages classical doe coupled with anova and regression modeling adequately modeled the data with more rigorously spaced experimental design points regression modeling also gave much more insight into the physical flow phenomena signifying which inflow parameters and parameter interactions were insignificant to the regression model the ann modeling technique was shown to be more accurate with respect to the experimental design points this is in part due to the uniform distribution of the design points inherent to the ud and the highly nonlinear structure of the ann these modern doe methods and modeling procedures associated with them are generally considered interpolation methods giving no insight to the underlying physics for this reason they are typically used for purely deterministic problems and more data points enhance their prediction capabilities in general classical doe methodology coupled with anova and regression modeling is preferred by the author in cases where the number of design points is limited but this methodology may not be used unless the assumptions inherent to anova are validated steps may be taken to inject stochasticism in a typically deterministic procedure however must be done so with care as to not over inflate the variance the added error must also be consistent with the physical phenomena being simulated in this case wind tunnel testing error was added to the darpa suboff data since the cfd is simulating and being compared with wind water tunnel testing data the artificial neural network has proven its capabilities in this paper by exemplifying excellent accuracy with respect to the experimental design points only 16 points were used to provide a more direct comparison to classic doe methodology however more points can be added to the ud which would decrease the overall error between the meta model and the experimental data thus increasing the prediction accuracy over the experimental design space if the number of experimental design points is not limited ann s may be used to produce better accuracy of the design region

21722,a methodology for directly establishing the forces and moments on a maneuvering body based on the instantaneous state of the vehicle is demonstrated both classical and modern design of experiments were used to develop experimental design regions consisting of different combinations of inflow conditions data was generated using computational fluid dynamic simulations which were performed on darpa suboff and the virginia tech ellipsoid model at the parameters prescribed by the designed experiments nonlinear polynomial regression modeling and artificial neural network modeling were used to develop prediction models for the normal and side force coefficients of both geometries with functional dependence on the inflow conditions the prediction models were compared to published experimental data which showed excellent agreement within the experimental design region the classical and modern approaches were also compared to each other and various strengths and applicability were illustrated nonlinear polynomial regression modeling and classical design of experiments proved to be very insightful by elucidating which inflow parameters and inflow parameter interactions were significant to the prediction model artificial neural network modeling coupled with modern design of experiments was shown to be more accurate however gave no insight to the

commercial and defense sectors accurate prediction modeling can lead to computationally inexpensive meta models which fully characterize the geometric body in question ultimately these meta models can be used for geometric or other forms of goal oriented optimization such as drag reduction at minimal to no cost prediction modeling can also be applied to determining the maneuvering characteristics of aero hydrodynamic vehicles traditional maneuvering models use a series of coefficients based on taylor series expansion of the forces and moments to describe the motion of the vehicle the accuracy of these models is based on the number of coefficients used to describe the motion designers tend to limit motion to a single plane which reduces the number of coefficients required but these techniques fail to capture nonlinear effects due to motion in multiple planes in order to more accurately capture these nonlinear effects additional coefficients are required which significantly increases the number of experiments that must be run to establish these coefficients racine and paterson 2005 explored methods to reduce the number of coefficients required to accurately model the motion of a vehicle by determining the relative importance of each term terms that were considered less significant were dropped from the equations of motion however the final model produced mixed results when compared with experimental data simonsen et al 2012 also explored the use of simulated planar motion mechanism pmm tests where the minimum number of pmm tests required to provide sufficient accuracy was determined it was found that the number of pmm tests could be reduced by 30 without significant loss of accuracy the test matrix reduction however could not be accomplished in a systematic manner as the maneuvering model would easily become unstable and diverge a significant understanding of the vehicle s maneuvering characteristics was required prior to reduction of the test matrix to ensure stability would be maintained reducing this method s attractiveness for concept design hess 2002 demonstrated the power of recursive neural networks rnn for application to maneuvering prediction during the office of naval research maneuvering challenge where the rnn out performed models using lifting line theory modified potential flow and unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes urans the challenge in the application of this rnn is it used 78 time accurate experimental data sets to train generation of this data would be cost and time prohibitive for ship design applications using physical experiments even considering the significant advances in computational fluid dynamics cfd and available computational resources generation of this type of data set is currently computationally prohibitive the question therefor remains of how to optimally gain insightful information with regard to characterization while keeping the computational cost relatively low the solution to this conundrum is through the use of design of experiments doe this paper aims to explore various statistical sampling methods inherent to doe which are somewhat specific to two different modeling techniques to be compared polynomial regression and artificial neural network modeling these two modeling techniques will be used to develop nonlinear relationships between normal force coefficient c z and side force coefficient c y as respective functions of the inflow conditions angle of attack α and side slip angle β this method allows the forces and moments to be established for a 6 degree of freedom 6 dof simulation directly based on the state of the vehicle in lieu of small angle limited linear derivatives the method is demonstrated here using two different geometries the darpa suboff model and the virginia tech scalene ellipsoid model the two different modeling techniques will be validated using experimental data for the two geometries published byroddy 1990 andgranlund 2009 for the darpa suboff model and the ellipsoid model respectively 2 design of experiments doe can be thought of as a process for planning an experiment so that appropriate data can be collected and analyzed by statistical methods resulting in valid and objective conclusions montgomery 2017 box et al 1978 doe is typically used in systems comprised of multiple inputs when a nonlinear functional relationship between the quantities of interest such as force and moment coefficients and the regressors or inputs and their interactions is required doe can be broken up into two categories classical and modern a brief comparison of which is given in table1 2 1 classical doe classical doe sampling methods are generally coupled with preliminary least squares regression modeling the analysis of variance anova significance testing and regression model reduction regressors such as the main effects from the inputs the effect of input interactions and the effect of various higher order terms are included in preliminary least squares regression models before significance testing is performed to determine which effects are inconsequential to the regression model insignificant terms are removed from the model and added to the error estimate of the model in this fashion nonlinear polynomial regression models can be created and refined to yield sought after functional relationships between outputs and regressors classical doe sampling methods were originally developed for use in physical experiments yondo et al 2018 and have been used with great success for complex aerospace and motorsport vehicle characterization applications murphy and landman 2015 doane and landman 2012 landman et al 2002 as well for suspension system design mohsen et al 2015 and instrumentation calibration reinholtz et al 2012 these sampling methods assume stochasticism or the presence of random pure error inherent to the physical experiment which is normally distributed n 0 σ 2 the presence of this pure error and its normality are key main assumptions used in anova which decouples the total variability in the response or functional output from least squares regression and tests the significance of the regressors to the meta model by comparing a measure of their variability their individual mean squares to the mean square error m s e of the regression model which serves as a measure of the stochasticism inherent to the experiment with the presence of this inherent error design points are chosen in a combinatorial fashion a priori which exploit aggressive regressor spacing allowing for a decreased number of samples typically factorial type designs and central composite designs ccd are used in classical doe with many alterations and augmentations possible which allow for the accommodation of testing limitations or the optimization of the experimental design augmentation usually concerns the addition of samples to the design space in order to enhance the predictive capabilities of the resultant regression model or to fulfill some alphabetic optimality criteria d optimality which is often used focuses on good model parameter estimation allowing for superior regressor screening capabilities myers et al 2016 i optimality works to reduce the average scaled prediction variance allowing for optimal predictive capabilities within the design space there are other alphabetic optimality criteria as well that will not be addressed in this paper but if interested can be found inmontgomery 2017 andmyers et al 2016 2 2 modern doe contrary to classical doe modern doe deals almost exclusively with computer based experiments these types of experiments are deterministic meaning that there is no measure of the inherent stochasticism the error is typically associated with grid discretization error round off error numerical convergence error etc meaning that for a fixed number of iterations a replicated computer experiment should yield the same results because of this there is no reference quantity with which to perform significance testing so other methods for statistical empirical modeling must be used which require different experimental sampling techniques various alphabetically optimal designs may be used like with classical doe however space filling designs are predominantly used there are several different space filling designs such as the uniform design ud latin hyper cube design sphere packing design etc which in general spread the design points out nearly evenly or uniformly throughout the region of experimentation adhering to some measure of uniformity determined by the design being used myers et al 2016 the purpose of this uniform sampling is to acquire data in a manner that will represent the entire experimental domain while minimizing the difference of the overall mean between the meta model and the experimental data fang et al 2005 these space filling designs often require more runs than typical classical doe designs such as factorial experiments since the experimental design points are placed at interior points rather than at the outer limits of the experimental domain alphabetic optimal designs are somewhat of a hybrid between classical and modern doe designs since they place points both on the exterior of the design space in a factorial fashion as well as on the interior to adhere to some optimality criterion there are many modeling techniques used with modern doe polynomial regression is often used however contrary to its use with classical doe anova may not be used due to the lack of an inherent stochasticism estimate and other forms of significance testing are needed for factor screening since the modeling procedure for modern doe does not involve anova it is more of an interpolation problem fang et al 2005 this broader interpolation problem lends itself to the application of machine learning ml algorithms such as bayesian estimation decision trees artificial neural networks ann etc all of which approach the general data interpolation problem somewhat abstractly in that they define the functional relationship between input and output in a black box mannerism without giving much insight as to which input factors are significant to the problem the ml modeling technique of particular interest to this research is the ann which will be discussed in subsequent sections the reader is referred todaronch et al 2017 cleaver et al 2016 montevechi et al 2007 and nazalla et al 2006 for various modern doe and modeling techniques as applied to the simulation of aerospace vehicles and manufacturing processes respectively 3 geometric configurations this research not only looks to compare different modeling techniques coupled with their respective sampling methodologies but it also aims to determine if there are any limitations imposed on the experimental design region by the cfd processes used to validate both the capabilities of the cfd solver and the meta models results are compared with the experimental data of the darpa suboff and the virginia tech scalene ellipsoid model the suboff geometry roddy 1990 was used in a bare hull configuration for simplicity and will generalize typical submersible bodies of revolution bor the scalene ellipsoid generalizes non bodies of revolution nbor and its asymmetric geometry will induce flow physics of greater complexity its geometric parameters were taken fromgranlund 2009 andsomero 2010 the coordinate system used for both geometries was located at each geometry s center of gravity and was such that the positive x direction faced upwind the positive y direction faced starboard and the positive z direction pointed downward 4 cfd solver hpcmp createtmsh navyfoam was used throughout the scope of this work navyfoam is a cfd solver that was developed under the dod high performance computing modernization program s hpcmp computational research and engineering acquisition tools and environments createtm ship s hydrodynamics project navyfoam builds upon the computational framework of the open source cfd tool kit openfoam by implementing a large number of new features and capabilities including new top level solvers for single and multi phase flows libraries of new numerical schemes and algorithms advanced physical models and custom postprocessing utilities here the single phase incompressible flow solver sransfoam is used to solve the equations for the conservation of mass and momentum given as 1 u 0 2 u t u u 1 ρ p ν e f f u t u where ν e f f ν ν t ν is the kinematic viscosity ν t is the turbulent eddy viscosity and the superscript t in t represents the matrix transpose the navier stokes solvers in navyfoam employ a cell centered finite volume method based on a multidimensional linear reconstruction scheme that permits use of arbitrary polyhedrals kim et al 2017 one of the features in navyfoam which was taken advantage of in this work is the inclusion of wilcox s updated 2006 k ω turbulence model this updated two equation turbulence closure model used in reynolds averaged simulations has been proven to resolve separated flows more efficiently than its preceding rendition wilcox et al 2006 wilcox 2008 5 technical procedure 5 1 mesh generation 5 1 1 surface mesh generation the surface mesh for the darpa suboff model and the ellipsoid were both created such that adequate cell coverage spanned the entirety of each model both surface meshes were triangulated and unstructured the darpa suboff model had variable surface mesh density whereas the ellipsoid had a constant density the darpa suboff surface mesh had diminishing cell sizes with a maximum cell size δ x of 0 01 m along the parallel mid body or non dimensionalized by body length δ s 0 0024 the stern was separated into three sections with the approximate separation located at geometric slope changes along the surface in the downwind direction each of these sections decreased in cell size by a factor of 1 5 sequentially starting from the parallel mid body while maintaining one to one cell connectivity between sections the surface mesh on the bow section was 1 5 times smaller than the parallel mid body the ellipsoid geometry s surface mesh had a constant mesh density with an approximate δ s 0 0044 5 1 2 volume mesh generation the volume meshes for both the darpa suboff model and the ellipsoid shown in figs 1 and 2 were created as hex dominant volume meshes with several levels of refinement from the far field the outer limits imposed on the volume mesh for both geometries were as follows 3 body lengths in the downwind direction 2 5 body lengths in the upwind direction and 2 body lengths port starboard of both geometries the maximum cell length along the outer region was approximately δ s 0 2 refinement regions were added around the anticipated region of the wake for at least 1 full body length as well as around both geometries the wake refinement regions were 7 levels 8 volumetrically each level of refinement greater than the outer region δ s and the geometry refinement regions were 6 levels of refinement greater the addition of these two refinement regions served the purpose of increasing the flow field resolution in regions of particular interest to this study since forces integrated over the geometries are of utmost importance accurate modeling of the flow field around the hull and in the wake region is necessary fig 2 depicts the two refinement regions around the darpa suboff model the first layer of cells adjacent to the geometries was sized to accommodate a y distance of approximately 60 for the reynolds number re specific to each geometry the reynolds numbers were set to match those given in the published experimental data and will be addressed in subsequent sections roddy 1990 granlund 2009 5 2 cfd implementation validation prior to comparing doe sampling methodologies and modeling techniques cfd validation was necessary to determine the accuracy of the numerical techniques implemented and their ability to properly simulate the physical flow phenomena surrounding each geometry this was done by running simulations where only one of the two inflow variables was modified in an effort to replicate the experimental results since the darpa suboff model is axisymmetric only one of the input parameters will be used whereas the nbor nature of the scalene ellipsoid will require that both inflow parameters be investigated individually for the incompressible flow about our two geometries a steady state solution was contrived the laplacian terms associated with the diffusion of momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent specific dissipation were discretized spatially using second order linear interpolation schemes first order spatial upwind discretization was applied to the divergence schemes associated with the convection of the turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent specific dissipation the convective momentum on the other hand was spatially discretized using a blend between a second order linear interpolation scheme and a first order spatial upwind scheme the matrix representation of the discretized set of linear algebraic equations for the momentum turbulent kinetic energy and turbulent specific dissipation is preconditioned using a symmetric diagonal incomplete cholesky method and solved with a preconditioned bi conjugate gradient scheme pbicg the poisson s equations for the pressure and pressure correction derived from the momentum equations and utilized by the semi implicit method for pressure linked equation simple algorithm were preconditioned using an asymmetric diagonal incomplete cholesky method and solved with a preconditioned conjugate gradient scheme pcg solution tolerances were specified such that iteration would ensue until the residuals associated with the turbulence closure equations were reduced by 6 orders of magnitude and the residuals associated with the pressure pressure correction and momentum equations were reduced by 7 orders of magnitude these convergence criteria were satisfied before the simple method s outer loop began the next iteration under relaxation was also specified to promote the stability of the iterative process and two non orthogonal correctors were utilized due to the non orthogonality associated with the unstructured meshes used 5 2 1 prescribed simulation parameters to accurately replicate the incompressible flow around the geometries in question dynamic similarity was maintained by prescribing values of reynolds number that matched those of the published experiments for darpa suboff r e 1447 1 0 6 and for the scalene ellipsoid r e 4 5 1 0 6 roddy 1990 granlund 2009 inflow velocity magnitudes and kinematic viscosities were modified to accommodate these reynolds numbers for all inflow conditions throughout the simulations conducted in this research to determine what the proper inflow conditions should be in the body fixed reference frame coordinate system described in section3 it was necessary to transform the velocity components from the inertial reference frame using the euler rotation angles given ineq 3 bossert et al 2003 3 u b cos ψ sin ψ 0 sin ψ cos ψ 0 0 0 1 cos θ 0 sin θ 0 1 0 sin θ 0 cos θ 1 0 0 0 cos ϕ sin ϕ 0 sin ϕ cos ϕ u i where ψ is the yaw angle θ is the pitch angle and ϕ is the roll angle utilizing the coordinate transformation given ineq 3 velocity conditions were calculated and imposed at the inlet and the far field sides while a zero gradient condition was given at the outlet the geometric surfaces were given a no slip velocity condition the pressure was given a gauge value of zero at the outlet a zero gradient pressure condition was imposed along all other domain boundaries as well as along the geometric surfaces since the k ω turbulence model was used the turbulent kinetic energy k and the turbulent specific dissipation ω were prescribed to 3 75 1 0 5 m 2 s 2 and 1000 s 1 respectively at the inlet zero gradient turbulence conditions were given at the far field sides and the outlet for the cfd validation α values of 0 3 5 7 5 8 10 and 13 were simulated and compared with the experimental results for the darpa suboff geometry for the scalene ellipsoid model α and β were each treated individually while holding the other parameter constant values of 0 3 5 8 and 10 for α and 0 3 5 8 10 13 and 15 for β were simulated and compared with experimental results the inflow velocities corresponding to these angles and for combinations of angles in subsequent sections were all transformed from the inertial frame of reference to the body fixed frame using eq 3 5 2 2 cfd validation the numerical methods outlined previously were executed in navyfoam for each geometry which produced good agreement with the published experimental results roddy 1990 granlund 2009 and will be compared in this section the darpa suboff model was simulated at α values ranging from 0 to 13 and the results for c z are shown in fig 3 where force is non dimensionalized by l 2 as 4 c z z 1 2 ρ u 2 l 2 it should be noted that the force coefficient data for all experiments conducted in the scope of this research were averaged over the last 200 iterations since the geometry was axisymmetric the results were extended to negative α values by mirroring the results about the x and y axes to aid in the visualization of the result comparison analysis of c y was not needed due to the symmetry the percentage errors between the fine mesh cfd results and the published experimental results were calculated with their averaged value being 5 18 the same comparison was done with the virginia tech scalene ellipsoid results however since it is a nbor the lateral direction was also analyzed the results are plotted in figs 4 5 and 6 since there were discrepancies in the c y data the yaw moment coefficient c n has also been plotted in fig 6 the percentage differences averaged over the aforementioned discrete data points for c z and c n were 5 67 and 2 17 respectively 5 3 doe and modeling procedure accurate results have been shown achievable for angles up to at least to 13 15 in both α and β respectively for the purpose of this research the region of interest was chosen to be between 8 and 8 for both α and β to provide the ability to evaluate model performance in prediction beyond the range of data included 5 3 1 classical doe implementation typically there is a sequential nature involved with classical doe methodology after the region of experimentation has been defined a two level factorial experiment is first generated to allow for factor screening or significance testing this involves the generation of a preliminary least squares regression fit to the data this regression model takes the generic form ofeq 5 which is defined as a multiple linear regression model myers et al 2016 5 y i ξ 0 j 1 k ξ j x i j ε i f o r i 1 2 n where ξ 0 is the model intercept ξ j are regression coefficients and ε i are sum of squares of the error the standard procedure decomposes the error in the regression model into two parts a contribution from the variability in each individual regressor and the contribution from the stochasticism inherent to the experiment these contributions are namely the mean square of each regressor and the m s e respectively the anova process then determines the significance of inputs and multi input interactions to the regression model by performing an f test which compares the error estimate of the regressors to the error estimate of the stochasticism insignificant terms are dropped from the model and added to the estimate of the pure error once it is known which terms are insignificant sequential experimentation can be done without these terms occasionally reducing the number of experimental runs to be conducted if a factor is eliminated completely from the experiment most sequential experimentation with a two level factorial experiment involve the augmentation of the experimental design space with the addition of axial points and center points as shown in fig 7 allowing for the estimation of quadratic curvature a design of this form is typically called a central composite design ccd axial points are generally spaced such that certain properties of the experimental design space are achieved such as rotatability significance testing is performed again with this new design space to determine which higher order terms and interactions are significant to the new second order regression model which takes the general form ofeq 6 myers et al 2016 the final polynomial regression model will be a direct consequence of the significance testing of regressors toeq 6 6 y ξ 0 j 1 k ξ j x j i j 2 k ξ i j x i x j j 1 k ξ j j x j 2 ε to perform the standard approach outlined above certain assumptions must be satisfied which define characteristics of the experimental data the first assumption concerns the normality of the experimental data and of the error requiring that they both conform to a gaussian distribution the second assumption is that the data have no time dependence this ensures that the stochasticism in the experiment is not due to a process error such as hysteresis wind tunnel warm up error or other time dependent forms of error the last assumption is that the data and the stochastic error both have constant variance with these three assumptions met the residuals or discrete differences between the experimental data and the regression model prediction of the experimental data should be completely structure less allowing for the m s e to be used as a measurement statistic for anova since the form of the polynomial regression can be assumed to be cubic for both the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid as suggested byroddy 1990 andgranlund 2009 an experimental design was chosen which included axial and center points to determine the curvature of the responses c z and c y which were functions of α and β a face centered design fcd was used with axial points located along the faces of the experimental region the general form of a cubic regression model in two factors has 10 model terms which is equivalent to the number of experimental design points indicating saturation to address this six additional model points were chosen in an i optimal fashion to reduce the average scaled prediction variance throughout the region of experimentation two of the points involved with this augmentation were center runs to help stabilize the prediction variance and provide additional degrees of freedom for pure error estimation myers et al 2016 this 16 point design space in two factors produced the randomly ordered experimental design depicted in fig 8 and tabulated in table2 since the regression model form has already been determined to be cubic the preliminary model with which to perform significance testing takes the form ofeq 7 for both c z and c y for both geometries 7 y ξ 0 ξ 1 α ξ 2 β ξ 12 α β ξ 11 α 2 ξ 22 β 2 ξ 112 α 2 β ξ 122 α β 2 ξ 111 α 3 ξ 222 β 3 the normal probability plots for c z of the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid and c y of the scalene ellipsoid are shown in figs 9 11 the results of which show that the normality assumption is violated for the c z of suboff this means that anova cannot be performed without data manipulation due to the deterministic nature of the experiment the residuals of the scalene ellipsoid aside from a few outliers seem to trend towards normality without any significant defects in behavior it should be noted that these normal probability plots are preliminary and correspond to residuals from the full regression model eq 7 they are used simply to determine the general trend in data and outliers will be addressed in subsequent sections once anova is performed the normal probability plots of the reduced models will be analyzed and detailed in section6 the residuals vs the predicted responses for the c z of the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid and the c y of the ellipsoid are plotted in figs 12 and 13 to determine if there is any structure to the residuals aside from the obvious symmetry of the residuals there appears to be no real structure to the residuals the lines in figs 12 and 13 are indicative of 2 and 3 residual standard deviations respectively since none of the residual values lie outside of these standard deviation boundaries it is safe to assume that the residuals conform to a gaussian distribution and are unstructured with a mean of 0 an analysis of the time history of the residuals is not necessary since each simulation was run independently of one another what this preliminary residual analysis suggests is that the cfd data for the darpa suboff model adheres to two of our three assumptions necessary for anova and the data for the scalene ellipsoid adheres to all three of our assumptions it is believed that the unsteadiness associated with the bluff bodied nature of the scalene ellipsoid is the proprietor of the variance in the cfd data not only is the ellipsoid a complex geometry over which to resolve the flow field but the reynolds number is low reducing the nearfield flow stability all of these indicate that the problem is truly an unsteady one and yet it was solved using a steady state solution a look at the cfd force or moment coefficients at an experimental center point shows the pure error associated with noise caused by unsteadiness these values plotted against the iteration number are shown in fig 14 and indicate that the steady state simulation of a truly unsteady flow problem not only has very similar behavioral trends as a wind tunnel test but also has a similar variance stringer 2017 the lines plotted in fig 14 take on the same meaning as in figs 12 and 13 indicating that the pure error of an individual run also has constant variance and is structure less a look at the c z residuals of the darpa suboff model in fig 14 suggests that there is not enough error present for significance testing the flow field of the darpa suboff was less complex than the ellipsoid because it was axisymmetric with a tapered stern it was also run at a higher reynolds number promoting flow field stability and numerical convergence becoming more deterministic in nature than the ellipsoid simulations because of this and because of the lack of normality of the residuals fig 9 a normally distributed pure error n 0 σ 2 5 1 0 5 calculated from wind tunnel testing data at α 0 tabulated bystringer 2017 was added to the 16 experimental runs this pure error typically associated with wind tunnel tests was added to the data in an effort to provide stochasticism as a measurement statistic for significance testing another look at the normal probability plot of the residuals using the darpa suboff data with injected error fig 15 shows that the normality assumption of anova has now been met therefore anova will be done for both the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid with the inherent stochasticism being solely a measurement of flow unsteadiness either from the numerical simulation for the ellipsoid or from typical wind tunnel testing error added to the suboff data if a regressor is shown to be significant by comparing it to the unsteadiness it will not be excluded from the regression model taking the mean over 200 iterations will be thought of as equivalent to time averaging wind tunnel test data for the ellipsoid the same was done to the darpa suboff test data prior to adding actual wind tunnel testing error significance testing and model reduction were performed on the c z data for both the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid as well as for the c y data for the ellipsoid the results are detailed in section6 5 4 modern doe implementation a modern doe approach has also been explored since these types of experimental designs are tailored towards computer based experiments cfd was used throughout the entirety of this experiment which is typically deterministic in nature and was shown in the previous section the same number of experimental design points was used for the modern doe approach as for the classical approach to more directly compare the two design spaces and a uniform design space was chosen based upon the limited number of runs the meta model selection ann and the desired outcome optimal prediction capability the uniform design ud places points in a fashion that minimizes some measure of non uniformity in this case the centered l 2 discrepancy between the design points and a theoretical uniform distribution hickernell 1998 the design is shown in fig 16 and tabulated in table3 the uniformly placed points are meant to minimize the difference between the overall mean eq 8 and the sample mean eq 9 throughout the entirety of the design space fang et al 2005 8 e y f x d x 9 y d n 1 n i 1 n f x i many of the modeling procedures used with modern doe techniques work in an iterative fashion adjusting or training model parameters by looping over the collected data until some goodness of fit measurement is sufficiently minimized typically these goodness of fit measures are called penalty functions the most common of which being the quadratic loss function or the sum of the squared difference between the collected data and the data predicted by an arbitrary model the minimization of this function is a problem in convex optimization and typically machine learning ml algorithms are implemented to solve this minimization problem the overall goal is to not only minimize this function and provide the best fit of the meta model to the collected data but also to be able to extend the meta model to arbitrary data within the design region not collected in the experiment the ability of the meta model to conform to both the training data and the validation data is the over arching problem especially for prediction modeling an artificial neural network ann was chosen as the meta model to fit the data more specifically a single layer perception slp the slp aims at replicating the architecture of the neurons in the human brain set up in layers as shown in fig 17 each layer consists of a number of activation functions or neurons aligned in parallel all of the neurons of a particular layer are activated in unison with different multiplicative weights along the connections between neurons inputs and outputs the slp architecture used throughout the modern doe modeling procedure contained one hidden layer consisting of 5 hyperbolic tangent activation functions each activation function can be thought of as a hyperplane with values between 1 and 1 following the nonlinear form of the hyperbolic tangent function alpaydin 2014 these activation functions are necessary to introduce nonlinearity to the ann enabling it to effectively model complex nonlinear relationships between inputs and outputs sharma 2017 walia 2017 the number and type of activation functions used are heuristically determined and it should be noted that anns of different architectures and consisting of different activation functions were investigated but showed significant bias or over fitting to the simulated results the chosen slp architecture was determined to be optimal for this research the input layer contains the values for α and β at each design point which are passed through the slp randomly and the multiplicative weights along the connections are modified until the quadratic loss function is minimized in a feed forward gradient descent training manner due to the limited number of design points a k fold method was used for validating the slp where the data was divided into 3 subsets each subset was used to validate the model fit after training and the kth model with the best fit was selected as the final model statistical analysis of the collected data is not necessary for a ml approach because input significance is inconsequential to most ml modeling procedures therefore no insight is gained about which inputs or input interactions are significant to the ann rather than excluding insignificant terms the ann works with combinations of highly nonlinear mixtures of inputs determined by the number of hidden layers the number of activation functions in each layer and the form of the activation function specified by the engineer or researcher based on these specifications an ann effectively takes on a black box form to accurately map the inputs to the outputs throughout the experimental design region in a way that generalizes to arbitrary data inside this design region the specific anns created to model the previously defined outputs for the darpa suboff and the scalene ellipsoid models will be analyzed in section6 6 results and discussion 6 1 classical doe results significance testing was carried out against the inherent stochasticism due to unsteadiness for the scalene ellipsoid and against the injected error for the darpa suboff model this involved an f test on each factor against the error in the preliminary regression models at a 6 5 level of significance insignificant terms were dropped from the preliminary models and newer more accurate regression models for each output quantity of interest were fashioned the final form of the regression model for c z of the darpa suboff model as a cubic function of α β and various interaction terms is shown byeq 10 likewise the final regression models of c z and c y for the scalene ellipsoid are shown by eqs 11 and 12 respectively 10 c z s o 1 0025 1 0 5 9 70794 1 0 5 α 4 23273 1 0 7 β 4 74999 1 0 8 α β 7 51526 1 0 8 α 2 4 42186 1 0 7 β 2 1 49511 1 0 6 α β 2 1 63054 1 0 6 α 3 11 c z e l 6 56441 1 0 5 7 89135 1 0 4

2 1 31612 1 0 6 β 2 6 9502 1 0 7 α 2 β 1 68044 1 0 6 β 3 the pure quadratic terms α 2 and β 2 as well as the second order interaction term α β for both c z and c y were found to be insignificant to the models however were included to maintain term hierarchy this is a common practice associated with anova and was done because higher order terms α 3 and α β 2 for c z and β 3 and α 2 β for c y were found to be significant to the models a residual analysis was performed on these new regression models to determine if our three assumptions of anova were maintained through the significance testing the normal probability plot of c z for both the suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid are shown in figs 18 and 19 and the normal probability plot of c y for the ellipsoid is shown in fig 20 all of which validate the normality assumption figs 21 and 22 show the residuals plotted against the predicted values to determine whether the variance is constant and structure less based off these plots it can be ascertained that all assumptions of anova have been validated the third assumption is inherent to the experimental procedure since all cfd runs were conducted separately it is intuitive that the run order has no effect on the residuals there were a few points on the two standard deviation limit in figs 21 and 22 but are inconsequential to this analysis and are not considered outliers with the residual analysis producing satisfactory statistical results which validated that the anova assumptions were not violated the regression models can confidently be assumed to adequately represent the data in a statistical sense regression model fit statistics were calculated for all three regression models and are shown in table4 the adjusted r 2 was used to show the amount of reduction in the variability of the experimental data points by using the regression models montgomery 2017 higher values indicate a better representation of the experimental data by the regression model it is scaled to the number of regressors making it an unbiased estimate which will not inflate with the number of model terms contrary to the unadjusted r 2 as it can be seen from table4 all three regression models represent the experimental data quite well a look at the predicted r 2 values indicate the predictive capabilities of the regression model in the experimental design region accounting for the variability in predicting new data points within the experimental domain montgomery 2017 the predicted r 2 values are calculated using a leave one out method where a data point is excluded from the data set used to fit the model this model is then used to predict the data point left out and the error is determined this is done for all possible subsets and these errors are added together the values for c z for both the darpa suboff model and the scalene ellipsoid model indicate that the regression models eqs 10 and 11 account for over 99 of the variability in predicting new observations eq 12 however only accounts for approximately 80 of the variability in predicting new observations as opposed to the 98 of the variability in the original experimental data the c z regression models for both geometries eqs 10 and 11 were used to predict responses at α values both in the experimental domain and outside of the experimental domain to determine the regression model s extrapolation capabilities the parameter β was held constant at 0 to perform a direct comparison to the published data and to the cfd validation points from section5 2 2 the range of α was chosen to be from 16 to 16 with 1 increments and the results of this analysis have been plotted in figs 23 and 24 the same was done foreq 12 however α was held constant and β ranged from 16 to 16 in increments of 1 as shown in fig 25 it should be reiterated that the experimental domain ranges from 8 to 8 meaning that eqs 10 and 11 not only show exemplary prediction performance within the experimental domain but these regression models can also be used outside of the experimental domain and will extrapolate well up to approximately 13 for darpa suboff and 16 for the scalene ellipsoid fig 25 not only shows ambiguity between the regression model fit and the cfd data but also between the regression model fit and the data published bygranlund 2009 which was noted in section5 2 2 the regression model was not made to fit the published data however it was made to fit the cfd data obtained from simulating the design points in table2 with that it can be said thateq 12 does represent the cfd data to some level of accuracy within the experimental domain but does not extrapolate well and has opposite curvature to that of the cfd validation points and to the published data beyond the extents of the experimental domain response surfaces within the experimental region for the three regression models eqs 10 12 were also created and are shown in figs 26 28 these response surfaces aid in the visualization of the effects on the response from varying both α and β the main purpose of this research was to analyze and compare modeling procedures with their respective experimental design spaces and not necessarily to perform a proper fluid dynamic study so the results of the response surface will only briefly be mentioned figs 26 and 27 show that for both geometries β acts to parabolically augment the normal force at α angles greater or less than zero as the total angle of incidence is increased the side force of the ellipsoid is shown to exhibit a similar behavior in fig 28 this effect can be seen more in depth for c z of the suboff model in fig 29 comparing figs 26 and 27 shows that the normal force augmentation from β is less for the ellipsoid than it is for suboff fig 28 shows that α has a very similar effect on the side force as β does on the normal force further for the ellipsoid the rolling moment coefficient should also be investigated for a proper fluid dynamic study 6 2 modern doe results a similar study was conducted on the anns that were fit to the experimental data using the procedure outlined in section4 d these ann s are shown by eqs 13 15 since the ann structure depends on activation functions significance testing was not necessary for model formulation 13 c z s o 6 6140 34 240 v 1 15 480 v 2 2 6978 v 3 10 571 v 4 70 852 v 5 v 1 tanh 0 047591 0 003124 α 0 0032646 β v

much insight into which effects are actually significant to the response looking at the fit statistics for each ann in table5 not only indicates that eqs 13 15 represent the experimental data quite well but it also indicates that these ann s have good prediction capabilities within the experimental region these results are further validated by figs 30 32 which use the anns eqs 13 15 to predict responses for the same input parameters as for figs 23 25 fig 30 verifies the model fit ofeq 13 and also shows that it can extrapolate outside of the experimental design region quite well this ann is very comparable in accuracy to its regression model counterpart eq 10 figs 31 and 32 however show that although the ann s fit with good accuracy compared with the experimental data points they cannot be extrapolated outside of the experimental domain fig 32 shows that the ann for c y actually has better accuracy than its regression model counterpart within the experimental domain the ann was modeled to fit the cfd simulation data at the design points in table3 which it does quite well the normal force augmenting effects of β for suboff can again be seen in the response surface shown in fig 33 in comparison to the regression model counterpart in fig 26 the ann seems to over exaggerate these effects for negative angles fig 34 shows that the normal force augmenting effects of β are actually skewed towards one side which can be thought of as a slight misprediction since the geometry is symmetric the response surfaces for eqs 14 and 15 have also been plotted in figs 35 and 36 for comparison purposes the response surface for c z of the ellipsoid shows that there is also an over exaggeration of the normal force augmentation due to β skewed towards negative α values the response surface for c y shows that the ann lacks symmetric behavior in both α and β which is incorrect it is difficult to definitively make a statement pertaining to predictions of c y for both the regression model and the ann eqs 12 and 15 respectively this is due to the issue of small numbers with the response c y being an order of magnitude less than c z values and only one order of magnitude larger than the residuals it is believed that there is not enough variance in the data for general trends to be predicted which is somewhat alluded to by the lower predicted r 2 value of the regression model eq 12 in table4 although the ann eq 15 does a better job fitting the data and predicting the experimental design points noted by a high predicted r 2 it essentially interpolates the experimental design points and does not follow any particular trend inherent to the underlying physics as noted by fig 36 the regression model eq 12 on the other hand exhibits symmetric side force augmentation from α as expected 7 conclusions throughout this work two modeling techniques nonlinear polynomial regression modeling and artificial neural network modeling coupled with doe techniques commonly used by each respective modeling procedure have been analyzed and compared both classical and modern doe were used to develop experimental design regions consisting of different combinations of inflow conditions namely α and β nonlinear polynomial regression modeling and artificial neural network modeling were employed to map these inputs to the normal force and side force coefficients c z and c y of the darpa suboff model and the virginia tech scalene ellipsoid model navyfoam was used to perform cfd simulations on both geometries at the combinatorial inflow conditions prescribed by each experimental design region significance testing and model reduction produced the final nonlinear polynomial regression model forms based upon the experimental design region created using classical doe an ann was also fit to the cfd data produced by simulating points in the design space created using modern doe fit statistics were calculated which showed that both the regression models and the anns fit the experimental data quite well however the ann outperformed the regression model for c y of the ellipsoid response surfaces were also generated to visualize general response trends at combinatorial inflow conditions which indicated that β had an augmenting effect on the normal force coefficient for both geometries and α had an augmenting effect on the side force coefficient of the ellipsoid both modeling techniques were shown to each have their own advantages classical doe coupled with anova and regression modeling adequately modeled the data with more rigorously spaced experimental design points regression modeling also gave much more insight into the physical flow phenomena signifying which inflow parameters and parameter interactions were insignificant to the regression model the ann modeling technique was shown to be more accurate with respect to the experimental design points this is in part due to the uniform distribution of the design points inherent to the ud and the highly nonlinear structure of the ann these modern doe methods and modeling procedures associated with them are generally considered interpolation methods giving no insight to the underlying physics for this reason they are typically used for purely deterministic problems and more data points enhance their prediction capabilities in general classical doe methodology coupled with anova and regression modeling is preferred by the author in cases where the number of design points is limited but this methodology may not be used unless the assumptions inherent to anova are validated steps may be taken to inject stochasticism in a typically deterministic procedure however must be done so with care as to not over inflate the variance the added error must also be consistent with the physical phenomena being simulated in this case wind tunnel testing error was added to the darpa suboff data since the cfd is simulating and being compared with wind water tunnel testing data the artificial neural network has proven its capabilities in this paper by exemplifying excellent accuracy with respect to the experimental design points only 16 points were used to provide a more direct comparison to classic doe methodology however more points can be added to the ud which would decrease the overall error between the meta model and the experimental data thus increasing the prediction accuracy over the experimental design space if the number of experimental design points is not limited ann s may be used to produce better accuracy of the design region

21723,the features of hydrodynamic coefficients including drag and added mass coefficients on a flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes in an oscillatory flow are studied experimentally the experiment of a flexible straked pipe was conducted in an oscillatory flow with the keulegan carpenter kc number varying from 9 to 165 and the maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 8 strain response in both in line and cross flow directions are measured by fiber bragg grating sensors using displacement reconstruction and inverse analysis methods displacement response and hydrodynamic force of the straked pipe are identified then through the least squares method corresponding drag and added mass coefficients are extracted the asymmetric features at the acceleration and deceleration stages of hydrodynamic force on a flexible pipe in the in line direction under oscillatory flow are first observed compared with a bare pipe helical strakes can effectively reduce the higher frequency fluctuating force and enhance the wake effects the hydrodynamic coefficients on the straked pipe are significantly magnified in the case of a relatively small kc number the maximum mean drag coefficients can reach approximately 10 the presented work suggests that the risk of helical strakes application should be fully evaluated through flexible pipe experiments in both steady flow and unsteady flow keywords vortex induced vibration hydrodynamic coefficient helical strakes flexible pipe oscillatory flow 1 introduction as natural gas and oil production extends to deep and ultra deep water areas risers are becoming increasingly slender under the ocean currents vortices are periodically generated and alternately shed from the sides of these very slender risers resulting in a corresponding periodic excitation force when the frequency of this force is near one of natural frequencies of a flexible riser a significant vibration will occur this is termed as vortex induced vibration viv blevins and saunders 1977 this periodic vibration has been proven to be the main reason for the fatigue damage of risers therefore researchers in both industry and academia have done many works to find effective ways to suppress viv at present there are two main methods to suppress viv of the riser active and passive control the main difference between them is that active control requires external power he et al 2000 jeon et al 2004 williams and zhao 1989 while passive control does not the latter is more widely used and has been previously studied by many researchers due to its easier manufacture allen et al 2006 bearman et al 1985 galvao et al 2008 gao et al 2015 2016 trim et al 2005 vandiver et al 2006 among the various forms of passive control helical strakes are the most widely used apparatuses in practical projects although helical strakes serve as an effective viv suppression device by altering the separation characteristics over the cross section and spanwise direction of the riser they can also cause a significant magnification in drag and added mass force api 1998 these two force components can induce relatively larger deformations and stresses which affect the structural strength and fatigue life of the riser sumer and fredsøe 1988 thus it is catching more and more attention in engineering applications whether helical strakes will cause some adverse effect on the riser it is necessary to investigate the magnified effects of drag and added mass coefficients on straked riser when evaluating the viv suppression efficiency of helical strakes to investigate this amplification of drag force in in line il direction korkischko et al 2007 presented mean drag coefficients of rigid cylinders with different helical strakes and an expected magnification is observed through towing experiments the drawback is that this test of stationary rigid cylinder has not considered the influences of viv response on drag quen et al 2014 presents experiments of flexible straked pipes with pitches equal to 5 d 10 d and 15 d and heights equal to 0 05 d 0 10 d and 0 15 d under uniform flow unexpectedly based on drag force measured at both ends a phenomenon that bare cylinders possess higher drag coefficients than the straked pipes is found which is contrary to beliefs reported by api 1998 api 1998 ren et al 2019b first identified drag force and coefficients at each section of a flexible straked pipe with different pitches and heights in uniform flow through the inverse analysis method the mean drag coefficients of straked pipe are found to be closely related to the geometry of strakes and not necessarily larger than the bare pipe drag amplification of bare pipe caused by viv response through broadening incoming flow area can be as large as helical strakes induced by increasing hydrodynamic diameter and altering the wake these studies indicate that the application of helical strakes may not adversely affect the riser in a real sea state riser inevitably encounters the action of wave and vessel motions this wave and wave induced periodic motion of a platform always result in a relatively equivalent oscillatory flow around risers recent experimental study found that the oscillatory flow induced by the vessel motion can also excite the viv at the sag bend of steel catenary riser wang et al 2015 2017 so called vessel motion induced viv vmi viv pesce et al 2017 vmi viv can cause serious fatigue damage to risers wang et al 2014 to suppress vmi viv cheng et al 2016 and constantinides et al 2016 presented a similar experiments of a steel lazy wave riser fitted with helical strakes with a pitch of 15 d and a height of 0 25 d where d is the diameter of the bare riser however viv still occur for the straked pipe and its suppression efficiency is not as good as that in the steady flow aiming at this phenomenon ren et al 2019a conducted a straked pipe with the same pitch of 15 d and height of 0 25 d in an equivalent oscillatory flow by forcing the model to oscillate in still water with different periods and amplitudes a surprising result is that the suppression efficiency can be reduced to 50 in an oscillatory flow under small keulegan carpenter kc number the characteristics of helical strake in the oscillatory flow attracted the attention the combination of more obvious viv phenomenon and helical strakes may lead to more pronounced amplified effects on hydrodynamic coefficients this will bring more concerns about these adverse effects of helical strakes in application thus further research is required to reveal the hydrodynamic coefficients features of the straked flexible pipes undergoing viv in an oscillatory flow in this paper the remainder is organized as follows section 2 presents the viv model tests for a straked pipe in an equivalent oscillatory flow it should be noted that the straked pipe model has the same pitch of 15 d and height of 0 25 d as ren et al 2019a the kc numbers varied between 9 and 165 and the maximum reduced velocities ranged from 4 to 8 in section 3 the identification methods of hydrodynamic force and coefficients on helical strakes in the il direction are firstly proposed the features of hydrodynamic force and coefficients under different maximum reduced velocities and kc numbers are presented in section 4 finally investigated conclusions

primarily two horizontal and vertical linear motion tracks and a flexible pipe model were mounted under the bottom of a measuring bridge of ocean basin as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 two force sensors are placed at two ends of the pipe model through universal joints a tensioner connected to the force sensor was fixed to the slider of the vertical track two endplates were used to reduce the disturbance of the supporting frame to the equivalent oscillatory flow field in our experiments a pretension force of 500n was selected and applied to the flexible pipe through tensioner which consists of a lead screw and a spring when the screw is tightened the spring is compressed and applies the force on screw which is connected with force sensor and the flexible pipe as shown in fig 2 thus the pretension force along the axis of flexible pipe was loaded for the pretension force the two justifications should be considered 1 avoiding significant deformation caused by the gravity of the flexible pipe 2 ensuring that the expected motion under the different maximum reduced velocity and kc numbers can be achieved within the allowable range of experimental apparatus to check these two points the finite element model was built according to the parameters list in table 1 through ansys software the maximum deformation y d at the middle point of flexible pipe in the still water was calculated and about 0 038m and we think this small deformation can be allowed beyond that the maximum range of force transducer f max is 1000n and the viv and drag force will cause the amplification of tension force to ensure that the force sensor has a certain safety the pretension force f t0 of 500n is finally selected all the aspects meet the above two requirements the flexible pipe was made up of a polypropylene random pipe that is filled with copper cable inside silicone gel was placed between different layers to prevent relative slippage the helical strakes were tied to the flexible pipe the main properties of the test model are listed in table 1 the geometric sketch of helical strakes in this experimental study is shown in fig 3 the height h and pitch p are respectively 0 25 d 15 d the start number of this helical strake is 3 four groups of fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors were installed to measure the strain responses in both the cross flow cf and il directions each of the fbg groups cf a cf c il b and il d had ten measurement points along the pipe separated by 0 36 m as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 4 2 2 test matrix to investigate drag and added mass coefficients on the flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes in an oscillatory flow the model was forced to oscillate in harmonic motions under various combinations of amplitude and period in the horizontal direction the instantaneous displacement x t and velocity of the forced motion u t can be expressed as follows 1 x t a m sin 2 π t t 2 u t a m 2 π t cos 2 π t t where a m and t are oscillation amplitude and period respectively the drag and added mass coefficient are related to the viv response the kc number and the maximum reduced velocity vr are considered as two main parameters that determine the viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder under oscillatory flow fu et al 2014 sumer and fredsøe 1988 as well as the hydrodynamic coefficient the kc number and vr can be presented as eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 k c 2 π a m d 4 v r 2 π a m t f 10 d where f 10 denotes the first natural frequency of the test model in still water f 10 1 8 hz is used here considering that the first natural mode is the potential excitation mode for all the test cases which can be calculated by eq 5 5 f n 0 n 2 l f t 0 m n 2 π 2 l 2 e i m m m s 1 4 π d 2 ρ c m c m 1 0 n 1 2 where f t0 is the pretension force m s is the mass of straked pipe per unit length in still water l and d are the length and diameter of flexible pipe respectively ei is the bending stiffness of pipe ρ is the density of water ρ 1000 kg m3 the added mass coefficient is chosen as c m 1 0 notably the added mass may deviate from the value of 1 0 in still water and the forced oscillation periods will change with the kc number at the same maximum reduced velocity in addition it should be noted that the diameter values are all kept the same as that of bare pipe all of test cases were divided into four groups with different maximum reduced velocities as presented in table 2 the corresponding maximum reynolds number remax has also been listed in this table which can be calculated by eq 6 6 re max u m d υ where u m is the forced motion velocity amplitude ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient in our experiment the ambient temperature is maintained near 15 c and ν is therefore approximately 1 14 10 6 m2 s 1 the maximum reduced velocity varied from 4 to 8 remax located in the region of approximately 5 103 to 1 104 each test group had test cases with a kc number ranging from 9 to 165 under the same amplitude of the forced motion velocity the same cases were also conducted for a bare pipe the effects of helical strakes on hydrodynamic coefficients will be easily revealed through above cases with and without helical strakes 3 basic theory 3 1 preprocessing for the convenience of description the coordinate system is defined as o xyz the origin is at one end point of the pipe and the z axis x axis and y axis are along the axis of the pipe the il direction and the cf direction respectively as shown in fig 5 at the start of experiments a constant pre tension of 500n was exerted at the flexible pipe ends however the pre tension periodically varied with pipe oscillation thus the measured strain included three components the initial axial strain caused by pre tension the varying axial strain caused by varying tension and the bending strain caused by oscillatory flow thus the bending strain ε il z t caused by the hydrodynamic force in the il direction can be calculated by eq 7 7 ε i l z t ε i l b z t ε i l d z t 2 where ε il b z t and ε il d z t are the original strain time histories at the z location sampled by il b and il d measurement points respectively the pure viv strain at the z location ε cf z t can be also calculated using the same methods then a band pass filter was utilized to eliminate the higher frequency noise in the il direction and to remove corresponding higher frequency noise and effects of pendulum motion caused by forced motion in the cf direction the cutoff frequencies of the band pass filter were 0 hz and 15 hz for the il direction and 2 5f o f o is the forced oscillation frequency and 15 hz for the cf direction 3 2 displacement reconstruction the displacement reconstruction method is a basic tool for the viv study lie and kaasen 2006 ren et al 2019a song et al 2017 according to the euler bernoulli beam theory displacement response of a flexible pipe under the external load can be expressed as the sum of the mode shapes multiplied by the generalized coordinate values in each step taking the response in the il direction as an example the displacement response x z t can be expressed as 8 x z t i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where p i t is the ith generalized coordinate displacement values at time t ϕ i z is the displacement at the position z in the ith modal shape based on small deformation assumption the curvature κ z t can be expressed as 9 κ z t 2 x z t z 2 i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where ϕ i is the ith modal shape of the curvature according to the geometric relationship between the curvature and strain the strain can be calculated by 10 ε i l z t κ z t r r i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where r denotes the radius of the flexible pipe model at the z position in this model modal shapes of the displacement are sinusoidal which can be expressed as 11 ϕ i z sin i π z l i 1 2 from eq 9 the modal shapes of the curvature are also sinusoidal after obtaining the modal shape of the displacement and curvature the generalized coordinates can be obtained from eq 10 then the displacement response in the il direction can be calculated by eq 8 using the same method as previously mentioned the displacement response of the cf direction can be also obtained 3 3 inverse identification of hydrodynamic forces and coefficients according to the governing equation of a tensioned euler bernoulli beam in the il direction the hydrodynamic force can be inversely identified as presented by 12 f z t m s 2 x z t t 2 c x z t t f t t 2 x z t z 2 e i 4 x z t z 4 where m s is mass of straked pipe per unit length in air c is damping coefficient of the pipe c 4 π ζ m s f 10 f t t is the time varying axial tension force ei is the bending stiffness f z t is the hydrodynamic force at the z position of t time in the il direction 2 x z t t 2 and x z t t represent respectively the acceleration and velocity response in the il direction which are calculated using the central difference method of the first and second order partial derivatives with respect to t 2 x z t z 2 and 4 x z t z 4 are respectively the second and fourth order spatial derivatives of the displacement in the il direction which are also calculated by the central difference method of second and fourth order partial derivatives with respect to z according the morison equation morison et al 1950 1953 the total force in the il direction can be decomposed into two components i e the drag force related to the square of velocity and the inertial force proportional to the acceleration which can be expressed as 13 f z t 1 2 ρ d c d z u t x z t t u t x z t t c m z ρ π d 2 l 4 u t t 2 x z t t 2 where f z t represents the predicted force by morison formula at the z position of the t time c d z and c m z are the drag and added mass coefficients at z position respectively ρ is the density of water ρ 1000 kg m3 for convenience in description it is assumed that 14 c 1 z t 1 2 ρ d u t x z t t u t x z t t c 2 z t ρ π d 2 l 4 u t t 2 x z t t 2 then eq 13 can be simplified as 15 f z t c d z c 1 z t c m z c 2 z t the least squares method is utilized to fit the drag and added mass coefficients in the il direction c d z and c m z can be obtained by minimizing the sum of the squared difference j c d z c m z between the predicted and identified force which can be expressed as 16 c ˆ d z c ˆ m z argmin j c d z c m z w h e r e j c d z c m z i 1 n f z t f z t 2 where n is the sample number to minimize the difference between the identified value and the predicted value of the hydrodynamic force the following eq 17 should be satisfied 17 j c d z c m z c d z 0 j c d z c m z c m z 0 transforming eq 17 into matrix form 18 h h t c d z c m z h f where 19 h c 1 z t 1 c 1 z t 2 c 1 z t n c 2 z t 1 c 2 z t 2 c 2 z t n f f z t 1 f z t 2 f z t n then the drag and added mass coefficients can be expressed as 20 c d z c m z h h t 1 h f in this paper more than 20 oscillation periods are used to reconstruct the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients 4 results and discussions 4 1 viv responses of the flexible pipe based on the displacement reconstruction method the displacement responses of the bare and straked pipe in both cf and il direction are obtained as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the depth of color represents the magnitude of displacement response the viv responses of straked and bare pipe in the cf direction were all observed more obvious higher frequency components of the displacement responses that is viv in the il direction were found in bare pipe to further investigate the statistical differences in the displacements of bare and straked pipe the root mean square rms of the displacement responses were defined as 21 y r m s z 1 n i 1 n y 2 z t i 22 x r m s z 1 n i 1 n x 2 z t i where y rms z and x rms z are the rms value of displacement response at the position z in cf and il directions respectively y z t i and x z t i are the displacement response at the position z and time t i in cf and il directions respectively it should be noted that displacement responses at statistically steady state are used to compute rms values which does not include the response time history of initial and ending parts for statistical analysis using the same methods the rms values of strain response in cf and il directions ε cf rms ε il rms can also be obtained fig 10 shows the distribution of rms values of displacement and strain response along the flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 for kc 30 as shown in fig 10 a and b the blue solid line and red dash line represent the displacement response of bare and straked pipe respectively the vortex induced vibration in the cf direction of the straked pipe is obviously smaller than that of the bare pipe while displacement response in the il direction of the straked pipe is larger than that of bare one it indicates that helical strakes can suppress the viv in cf direction but will magnify the drag force in an oscillatory flow at vr 6 and kc 30 to verify the displacement reconstruction method the bending strain responses of the bare and straked pipe were recalculated through eq 10 based on the generalized coordinate displacement value and modal shape of the curvature as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the blue solid and red dash line represent respectively the measured and calculated values the rms values of calculated bending strain is compared with the measured one as presented in fig 10 c and 10 d blue solid line and red dash line represent respectively the calculated bending strain of the bare and straked pipe the blue squares and red circles represent corresponding measured bending strains from figs 8 fig 9 fig 10 c and fig 10 d the calculated values are in a good agreement with the measured one along the flexible pipe in both cf and il direction which demonstrates the validity of displacement reconstruction method for the flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow fig 11 and fig 12 show the results for the cases vr 6 under a small kc number kc 30 and a large kc number kc 95 respectively each figure contains four subplots showing time history of the viv response and time varying frequency at the 5th gauge point of straked pipe in the cf direction subfigures a of figs 11 and 12 are the calculated time varying shedding frequency f st which is calculated by 23 f s t t s t u t d where st refers to the strouhal number st 0 2 f st is the calculated vortex shedding frequency subfigures b of figs 11 and 12 are the viv displacement response which is reconstructed by utilizing the modal superposition method as described in section 3 2 subfigures c of figs 11 and 12 show the time history of the modal weight p t of displacements subfigures d of figs 11 and 12 are the wavelet analysis of the strain signal the depth of the color indicates the concentration level of the strain components subfigures e of figs 11 and 12 present the time varying natural frequency and viv response dominant frequency the blue dash and red solid lines represent the first and second order eigen frequency while the black line refers to the dominant frequency it should be noted that the first and second order eigen frequency f 1 f 2 have considered the measured time varying tension f t t and assuming the added mass coefficient c m to be equal to 1 which can be calculated by 24 f n t n 2 l f t t m n 2 π 2 l 2 e i m m m s 1 4 π d 2 ρ c m c m 1 0 n 1 2 as presented in fig 11 calculated shedding frequency varies from 0 to 2hz viv displacement amplitude in the cf direction is less modulated and the maximum value reaches 0 25 d at kc 30 as shown in fig 11 d and fig 11 e viv response is always dominated by the 1st natural mode under larger kc number kc 95 as shown in fig 12 a strong amplitude modulation appears and the maximum value of viv displacement is less than 0 1 d an obvious viv developing process including building up lock in and dying out can be observed these response features of straked pipe in an oscillatory are similar to that of the bare one fu et al 2014 fig 13 shows the maximum displacement standard deviation of the viv of bare and straked pipes the blue squares and red circles represent the displacement response of the bare and straked pipe respectively although helical strakes can effectively suppress viv response the suppression efficiency η calculated by eq 25 at a small kc number is not very ideal as that at larger kc number ren et al 2019a 25 η y max y s max y max 100 y max and y s max are the maximum root mean square values of the displacement for a bare and straked pipe which can be obtained by eqs 26 and 27 respectively 26 y max max y r m s b z 27 y s max max y r m s s z where y rms b z and y rms s z are the rms value of displacement response of the bare and straked pipe at the position z in the cf direction respectively recently researchers chaplin et al 2005 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 have found that the drag forces and coefficients in the il direction were greatly affected by the viv response through the experiments of a flexible pipe in uniform flow the distinctive features of viv response between the small and large kc numbers may lead to different performance of hydrodynamic force and coefficients in the il direction which requires further investigation 4 2 hydrodynamic force distribution based on measured strains in the il direction the displacement responses and hydrodynamic forces in the il direction can be calculated to verify this hydrodynamic force identification method a finite element model of flexible pipe with the same parameters as those shown in table 1 was built by ansys strain response in the il direction was calculated by applying the same time history of identified hydrodynamic force on the flexible pipe fig 14 shows the time history of measured and calculated strain at the position of the 5th gauge point in the il direction under vr 6 for kc 30 and 121 compared with the measured strain the calculated values are in a good agreement with the measured one this consistency demonstrates the validity of this hydrodynamic identification method for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow using the hydrodynamic force identification method proposed in section 3 3 force at each cross section along the flexible pipe under different reduced velocities and kc numbers can be obtained fig 15 fig 18 show the time histories of forced motion velocity displacement response in the cf direction and hydrodynamic force in the il direction at the 5th gauge point and spatiotemporal distribution of hydrodynamic force for bare and straked pipe under vr 6 0 each figure has four subplots figures a of figs 15 18 show time history of forced motion velocity figures b of figs 15 18 illustrate time history of displacement response at the 5th gauge point in cf direction hilbert transform method bracewell 1978 is used to obtain amplitude envelope of viv displacement response figures c of figs 15 18 are the time history of hydrodynamic force at the cross section of the 5th gauge point in il direction figures c of figs 15 18 represent spatiotemporal distribution of hydrodynamic force in the il direction the gradient of the color represents the magnitude of the force the waveforms in figure a c and d of figs 15 18 can be clearly observed in an oscillatory flow a period of the oscillation motion contains acceleration and deceleration phases under the small kc number kc 30 as shown in fig 15 b viv displacement response of the straked pipe at acceleration stages is not symmetric with that at deceleration stages the amplitude value in acceleration phase at half a maximum forced motion velocity i is about 0 11 d and this value in deceleration phase ii becomes 0 20 d the former response is smaller than the latter as called hysteresis fu et al 2014 however their hydrodynamic forces behave different features although the asymmetric feature of displacement response is also observed in hydrodynamic force the force in acceleration phase is larger than that in deceleration phase as shown in fig 10 c force is about 3 3 n m in acceleration phase at the point iii while about 1 4 n m in deceleration phase at point iv the same phenomena can also be observed in bare pipe as presents in fig 17 fig 17 b shows that the viv response reaches 0 40 d at the point i and 0 67 d at the point ii correspondingly the forces are 1 8 n m 0 n m at the points iii and iv respectively the main reasons for this interesting phenomenon will be further analyzed below compared with the straked pipe the higher frequency components of hydrodynamic force on the bare pipe fluctuates more obviously it indicates that helical strake can effectively reduce this higher frequency force fluctuation the reasons can be attributed to the suppression effects of helical strakes on viv response in the cf direction this is consistent with results derived from experiments in uniform flow api 1998 ren et al 2019b under large kc number kc 121 viv response cannot be induced by the disorder and weak vortex due to the vortex breaking effects of helical strakes ren et al 2019a as shown in fig 17 a the viv developing process cannot be clearly observed at this case the response amplitudes at points i and ii are 0 03 d and 0 014 d respectively the viv response hysteresis is not obvious under this kc number the force at points iii and iv are 1 9 n m and 0 8 n m for the bare pipe viv developing process and hysteresis can be clearly seen at kc 121 as shown in fig 18 b the viv response amplitudes at points i and ii are 0 25 d and 0 53 d respectively corresponding forces at points iii and iv are 1 3 n m and 1 0 n m similar with the case of small kc number fluctuation of hydrodynamic force on the bare pipe is more obvious than the straked pipe these observations indicate that the asymmetric features of viv response and hydrodynamic force are the main phenomena for both bare and straked pipes to further illustrate these features more clearly y d f versus instantaneous reduced velocity u f 1 d are plotted in fig 19 and fig 20 the red and green solid lines represent corresponding response and force at acceleration and deceleration stages respectively differences between the red and green lines in both figs 19 and 20 indicate that both the straked and bare pipe in oscillatory flow for these kc numbers have different viv response features at acceleration and deceleration stages i e hysteresis phenomenon fu et al 2014 this is caused by the lag between vortex shedding and instantaneous reduced velocity the vortex shedding doesn t change immediately with forced motion velocity altering fu et al 2018 however at large kc number forced motion period and displacement become longer and larger the vortex will be breaking by helical strakes when kc number reaches a certain large value vortex induced vibration is difficult to be excited both development process and hysteresis of vortex induced vibration are difficult to be clearly observed different from viv response with instantaneous reduced velocity the force in acceleration phase are larger than that in deceleration phase it is not consistent with the belief that the larger viv response will lead to larger drag force based on the experimental results of flexible pipe in steady flow chaplin et al 2005 ren et al 2019b vandiver 1985 these unexpected results may be closely related to the interaction between the fluids derived forth and the backward motion of the flexible pipe fig 21 presents the sketch of this interaction in the deceleration phase the pipe drives the attached water to the right when pipe accelerates back to the left it will encounter former water body moving to the right this makes the effective velocity in acceleration phase faster than that in deceleration phase resulting in corresponding former hydrodynamic force is larger than the latter one this is called wake effects williamson 2006 although helical strakes reduced higher frequency hydrodynamic force fluctuation through suppressing viv response the asymmetric features of the force cannot be avoided more insightful experiments and cfd simulations would be carried out in the near future to further investigate this interesting phenomenon 4 3 drag and added mass coefficients after obtaining displacement response and hydrodynamic force in the il direction the drag coefficient c d z and added mass coefficient c m z at each node of bare and straked pipe can be identified through the proposed method in section 3 3 fig 22 illustrates the distribution of drag coefficients along bare and straked pipes under v r 6 0 for kc 30 and 121 fig 22 a shows drag coefficients of the straked pipe are larger than that of the bare pipe c d are around 2 3 and 3 2 for the bare and straked pipes respectively although the viv response of the straked pipe is not as significant as that of the bare one magnification effects of helical strake on drag coefficients can be clearly found with kc number increasing from 30 to 121 all c d of both the straked and bare pipes are all approaching asymptotically to 1 90 compared with the typical value c d 1 2 derived from the towing test of stationary rigid cylinder blevins and saunders 1977 drag of both the bare and straked pipes are all amplified however the reasons of drag amplification mechanism are different in an oscillatory flow for the bare pipe drag force is amplified by viv response for the straked pipe it is caused by an increased hydrodynamic diameter and altered wake ren et al 2019b unexpectedly two drag coefficients of the bare and straked pipes under a larger kc number are at the same level it can be also concluded that the magnified effects on drag by increasing hydrodynamic diameter for the straked pipe is not always necessarily greater than that of viv response in the cf direction for the bare pipe in oscillatory flow with a larger kc number fig 23 presents the distribution of added mass coefficients along the bare and straked pipes c m of the straked pipe is obviously larger than that of bare pipe in all cases it is consistent with the results of api 1998 api 1998 to validate the reliability of identified coefficients the coefficients are used to calculate the corresponding hydrodynamic forces fig 24 shows the time history of measured and calculated hydrodynamic force on straked pipe in the il direction in the case of vr 6 0 for kc 30 the blue solid line and red dash line represent the measured and calculated force respectively a good agreement is seen between these two values at different positions along the flexible pipe this demonstrates that the identified coefficients are correct to further reveal the effects of helical strake on force coefficients in the il direction the mean coefficients are introduced here the mean drag coefficients c d and mean added mass coefficients c m are defined as 28 c d 1 l 0 l c d z d z 29 c m 1 l 0 l c m z d z where l is the length of the flexible pipe model through eqs 28 and 29 mean drag and added mass coefficients under different kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities are summarized in fig 25 and fig 28 as shown in fig 25 the red circle and blue rectangle symbols represent the mean drag coefficients on the straked and bare pipe respectively it shows that drag coefficients on both the bare and straked pipes under small kc number are magnified while distributions of mean drag coefficient are stable with kc number under larger kc number more in detail under small kc number the amplified phenomena of drag coefficients on the straked pipe are more significant than the bare one fig 25 a presents mean drag coefficients of the straked pipe reach 4 1 while 3 3 for bare pipe under vr 4 0 and kc 13 as reduced velocities increases to 6 and 8 c d of staked pipe can be amplified to approximately 5 8 and 8 8 as illustrated in fig 25 b and c under kc 13 and 9 respectively under larger kc number the mean drag coefficients are approaching to 1 8 and 1 5 for bare and staked pipe as shown in fig 25 a under vr 4 0 respectively and c d stabilize at 1 9 and 2 0 for both the bare and straked pipes as vr increases to 6 0 and 8 0 as shown in fig 25 b and c respectively the mean drag coefficients for both bare and straked pipe increase with maximum reduced velocities under a larger kc number to further reveal the reasons behinds the above features of mean drag coefficients and investigate the effects of helical strakes and viv responses on drag coefficients viv displacement amplitudes are summarized in fig 26 under vr 4 0 the response of bare one is only excited under small kc number and correspondingly magnification of drag coefficients can be also seen as kc number increases viv decreases to stable value which is less than 0 1 d meanwhile mean drag coefficients decrease from 3 3 at kc 13 to a smaller asymptotic value 1 5 at larger kc number these two value trends have good consistency as a result drag amplification can be attributed to the viv response as the results reported by vandiver et al 1985 according to experiments of a flexible pipe in steady flow compared with the bare pipe viv responses of the straked pipe are sufficiently suppressed while amplification of drag coefficients of the straked pipe can be still seen at the same magnitude with the bare one under a small kc number the magnification of drag on straked pipe is even slightly obvious the downward trend can also be seen in mean drag coefficients with kc number therefore it can be easily inferred that drag magnification of the straked pipe in an oscillatory flow is not caused by viv response in the cf direction the main reasons can be attributed to the wake effect as previously mentioned in the case of a small kc number the forced oscillation period is shorter and the forced oscillation amplitude is smaller the time of the pipe in the wake is more pronounced the effective velocity will be larger than the actually forced oscillation velocity in most time of the whole oscillation period when the kc number increase the wake effects will be weakened thus although there is no obvious viv response the drag coefficients of the straked pipe are significantly magnified at small kc number and decrease to the asymptotic value at a larger kc number beyond that slightly larger coefficients observed on straked pipe can be attributed to this hydrodynamic diameter increased due to covered helical strakes as maximum reduced velocities increase to 6 and 8 viv of bare pipe is significantly excited in the case of all kc numbers maximum viv displacement amplitudes increase with maximum reduced velocities mean values of viv displacement amplitudes are around 0 15 d 0 35 d and 0 45 d for vr 4 6 and 8 respectively correspondingly increased trends of c d are also seen this is consistent with the belief that larger viv response leads to lager drag force by broadening incoming flow area as previously described however the considerable viv of straked pipe only occurs in the case of small kc number kc is around 30 we surprisingly find that the maximum drag coefficients of straked pipe do not appear when viv responses reach their maximum value although the viv response at kc 20 is smaller than that at kc around 30 c d of the former one is significantly larger than the latter so viv response of the straked pipe is not a direct reason for the drag magnification under small kc number another factors as wake effect and increasing hydrodynamic diameter by helical strakes may play the dominant role it also indicates that drag magnification of helical strakes caused by wake effects is more significant than viv in the case of small kc number compared with the bare pipe even though obvious viv of the bare pipe is excited the drag coefficients of the bare pipe are not at the same magnitude as those of straked pipe this means the effects of wake on the straked pipe is more intensive than the bare pipe and further indicates that the helical strakes can enhance the effects of wake to better understand the enhanced effects of helical strakes on flow wake the sketches are shown in fig 27 due to the viscosity of fluid water attached to a flexible pipe are driven by the movement of pipe when the pipe decelerates and moves in the opposite direction the movement direction of water body cannot change immediately resulting in the effective velocity greater than the actual velocity as shown in fig 27 a different from bare pipe helical stakes tied on flexible pipe make the attached water hardly escape this allows a larger volume of added fluid to be fully accelerated and finally enhanced the above effects of wake as presented in fig 27 b under vr 6 and 8 in the case of larger kc number two drag coefficients are the same it means the amplification of drag coefficient caused by viv for the bare pipe is equal to that by increasing hydrodynamic diameter and enhanced effects of flow wake for the straked pipe in the case of larger kc number in an oscillatory flow fig 28 shows the distribution of added mass coefficients versus kc number under different maximum reduced velocities for the bare pipe there are no obvious differences in the added mass coefficients among various maximum reduced velocities the values of c m for the bare pipe are approaching asymptotically to approximately 0 8 while the distributions of mean added mass of streaked one under different maximum reduced velocities are more discrete and obviously amplified the mean added mass of straked pipe is around 0 8 2 0 and 3 0 under vr 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 respectively the magnification of added mass coefficients can be also attributed to helical strakes impeding the detachment of attaching water the larger added mass coefficients indicate that much more water attached to the straked pipe under lower reduced velocity the force oscillation period is too long and attached water can easily detach from helical strakes however when oscillation period becomes shorter and the maximum reduced velocities increase to 6 0 and 8 0 it will be more difficult for attached water to escape thus the added mass coefficients increase with vr these results are consistent with the above explanations of the enhanced effects of helical strakes on wake as previously mentioned in the past research the vortex induced vibration suppression efficiency of the helical strakes 15 d in pitch and 0 25 d in height was tested in a rigid cylinder experiments under steady flow by schaudt et al 2008 obtaining at least 94 reduction moreover the drag coefficients are found to be approximately 1 5 in the steady flow which is not very amplified by helical strakes it means the 15d 0 25d helical strakes can serve as an ideal suppression device of the viv in the steady flow however through above observed results in the present work the application of helical strakes may cause great concern in an oscillatory flow such a large coefficient of straked pipe under small kc number in an oscillatory flow is previously unimaginable in riser design when using the helical strakes to suppress viv issue beyond that the suppression efficiency of helical strakes is not ideal as that in steady flow under small kc number kc around 30 as shown in fig 26 therefore lower suppression efficiency and severe drag magnification effects of helical strakes may have an extremely adverse influence on riser this may lead to serious potential engineering safety problems and must be taken into consideration in real project it suggests that suppression efficiency and drag amplification for helical strakes with other pitches and heights should be evaluated through flexible pipe experiments not only in a steady flow but also in an oscillatory flow 5 conclusions in this paper magnification of hydrodynamic coefficients of a straked pipe in an oscillatory flow including drag and added mass coefficients are experimentally investigated the maximum reduced velocities range from 4 to 8 and the kc numbers vary between 9 and 165 the hydrodynamic force and coefficients on helical strakes are first revealed by using inverse analysis and the least squares method the features of hydrodynamic force in deceleration and acceleration phase are presented in detail distribution of corresponding mean coefficients versus kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities are summarized compared with a bare pipe effects of helical strakes covering on flexible pipe on hydrodynamic coefficients are further investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 asymmetric features of hydrodynamic force caused by wake effects are first observed in both bare and straked pipes moreover helical strakes can effectively reduce higher frequency hydrodynamic force fluctuation through suppressing viv response 2 under large kc number the drag coefficients of the straked pipe are at the same level as the bare one while added mass coefficients of the former one are larger than that of the latter one magnified effects on drag by increasing hydrodynamic diameter for straked pipe are not always necessarily greater than that of viv response in the cf direction for the bare pipe in an oscillatory flow 3 under small kc number significantly amplification was found in the straked pipe the maximum value of c d can reach approximately 10 enhanced effects on the wake and increasing hydrodynamic diameters by helical strakes are main potential reasons 4 lower suppression efficiency and severe drag magnification effects of helical strakes under small kc number may have an extremely adverse influence on riser it may lead to serious potential engineering safety problems and must be taken into consideration in a real project credit authorship contribution statement haojie ren writing original draft investigation formal

21723,the features of hydrodynamic coefficients including drag and added mass coefficients on a flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes in an oscillatory flow are studied experimentally the experiment of a flexible straked pipe was conducted in an oscillatory flow with the keulegan carpenter kc number varying from 9 to 165 and the maximum reduced velocities ranging from 4 to 8 strain response in both in line and cross flow directions are measured by fiber bragg grating sensors using displacement reconstruction and inverse analysis methods displacement response and hydrodynamic force of the straked pipe are identified then through the least squares method corresponding drag and added mass coefficients are extracted the asymmetric features at the acceleration and deceleration stages of hydrodynamic force on a flexible pipe in the in line direction under oscillatory flow are first observed compared with a bare pipe helical strakes can effectively reduce the higher frequency fluctuating force and enhance the wake effects the hydrodynamic coefficients on the straked pipe are significantly magnified in the case of a relatively small kc number the maximum mean drag coefficients can reach approximately 10 the presented work suggests that the risk of helical strakes application should be fully evaluated through flexible pipe experiments in both steady flow and unsteady flow keywords vortex induced vibration hydrodynamic coefficient helical strakes flexible pipe oscillatory flow 1 introduction as natural gas and oil production extends to deep and ultra deep water areas risers are becoming increasingly slender under the ocean currents vortices are periodically generated and alternately shed from the sides of these very slender risers resulting in a corresponding periodic excitation force when the frequency of this force is near one of natural frequencies of a flexible riser a significant vibration will occur this is termed as vortex induced vibration viv blevins and saunders 1977 this periodic vibration has been proven to be the main reason for the fatigue damage of risers therefore researchers in both industry and academia have done many works to find effective ways to suppress viv at present there are two main methods to suppress viv of the riser active and passive control the main difference between them is that active control requires external power he et al 2000 jeon et al 2004 williams and zhao 1989 while passive control does not the latter is more widely used and has been previously studied by many researchers due to its easier manufacture allen et al 2006 bearman et al 1985 galvao et al 2008 gao et al 2015 2016 trim et al 2005 vandiver et al 2006 among the various forms of passive control helical strakes are the most widely used apparatuses in practical projects although helical strakes serve as an effective viv suppression device by altering the separation characteristics over the cross section and spanwise direction of the riser they can also cause a significant magnification in drag and added mass force api 1998 these two force components can induce relatively larger deformations and stresses which affect the structural strength and fatigue life of the riser sumer and fredsøe 1988 thus it is catching more and more attention in engineering applications whether helical strakes will cause some adverse effect on the riser it is necessary to investigate the magnified effects of drag and added mass coefficients on straked riser when evaluating the viv suppression efficiency of helical strakes to investigate this amplification of drag force in in line il direction korkischko et al 2007 presented mean drag coefficients of rigid cylinders with different helical strakes and an expected magnification is observed through towing experiments the drawback is that this test of stationary rigid cylinder has not considered the influences of viv response on drag quen et al 2014 presents experiments of flexible straked pipes with pitches equal to 5 d 10 d and 15 d and heights equal to 0 05 d 0 10 d and 0 15 d under uniform flow unexpectedly based on drag force measured at both ends a phenomenon that bare cylinders possess higher drag coefficients than the straked pipes is found which is contrary to beliefs reported by api 1998 api 1998 ren et al 2019b first identified drag force and coefficients at each section of a flexible straked pipe with different pitches and heights in uniform flow through the inverse analysis method the mean drag coefficients of straked pipe are found to be closely related to the geometry of strakes and not necessarily larger than the bare pipe drag amplification of bare pipe caused by viv response through broadening incoming flow area can be as large as helical strakes induced by increasing hydrodynamic diameter and altering the wake these studies indicate that the application of helical strakes may not adversely affect the riser in a real sea state riser inevitably encounters the action of wave and vessel motions this wave and wave induced periodic motion of a platform always result in a relatively equivalent oscillatory flow around risers recent experimental study found that the oscillatory flow induced by the vessel motion can also excite the viv at the sag bend of steel catenary riser wang et al 2015 2017 so called vessel motion induced viv vmi viv pesce et al 2017 vmi viv can cause serious fatigue damage to risers wang et al 2014 to suppress vmi viv cheng et al 2016 and constantinides et al 2016 presented a similar experiments of a steel lazy wave riser fitted with helical strakes with a pitch of 15 d and a height of 0 25 d where d is the diameter of the bare riser however viv still occur for the straked pipe and its suppression efficiency is not as good as that in the steady flow aiming at this phenomenon ren et al 2019a conducted a straked pipe with the same pitch of 15 d and height of 0 25 d in an equivalent oscillatory flow by forcing the model to oscillate in still water with different periods and amplitudes a surprising result is that the suppression efficiency can be reduced to 50 in an oscillatory flow under small keulegan carpenter kc number the characteristics of helical strake in the oscillatory flow attracted the attention the combination of more obvious viv phenomenon and helical strakes may lead to more pronounced amplified effects on hydrodynamic coefficients this will bring more concerns about these adverse effects of helical strakes in application thus further research is required to reveal the hydrodynamic coefficients features of the straked flexible pipes undergoing viv in an oscillatory flow in this paper the remainder is organized as follows section 2 presents the viv model tests for a straked pipe in an equivalent oscillatory flow it should be noted that the straked pipe model has the same pitch of 15 d and height of 0 25 d as ren et al 2019a the kc numbers varied between 9 and 165 and the maximum reduced velocities ranged from 4 to 8 in section 3 the identification methods of hydrodynamic force and coefficients on helical strakes in the il direction are firstly proposed the features of hydrodynamic force and coefficients under different maximum reduced velocities and kc numbers are presented in section 4 finally investigated conclusions

primarily two horizontal and vertical linear motion tracks and a flexible pipe model were mounted under the bottom of a measuring bridge of ocean basin as shown in fig 1 and fig 2 two force sensors are placed at two ends of the pipe model through universal joints a tensioner connected to the force sensor was fixed to the slider of the vertical track two endplates were used to reduce the disturbance of the supporting frame to the equivalent oscillatory flow field in our experiments a pretension force of 500n was selected and applied to the flexible pipe through tensioner which consists of a lead screw and a spring when the screw is tightened the spring is compressed and applies the force on screw which is connected with force sensor and the flexible pipe as shown in fig 2 thus the pretension force along the axis of flexible pipe was loaded for the pretension force the two justifications should be considered 1 avoiding significant deformation caused by the gravity of the flexible pipe 2 ensuring that the expected motion under the different maximum reduced velocity and kc numbers can be achieved within the allowable range of experimental apparatus to check these two points the finite element model was built according to the parameters list in table 1 through ansys software the maximum deformation y d at the middle point of flexible pipe in the still water was calculated and about 0 038m and we think this small deformation can be allowed beyond that the maximum range of force transducer f max is 1000n and the viv and drag force will cause the amplification of tension force to ensure that the force sensor has a certain safety the pretension force f t0 of 500n is finally selected all the aspects meet the above two requirements the flexible pipe was made up of a polypropylene random pipe that is filled with copper cable inside silicone gel was placed between different layers to prevent relative slippage the helical strakes were tied to the flexible pipe the main properties of the test model are listed in table 1 the geometric sketch of helical strakes in this experimental study is shown in fig 3 the height h and pitch p are respectively 0 25 d 15 d the start number of this helical strake is 3 four groups of fiber bragg grating fbg strain sensors were installed to measure the strain responses in both the cross flow cf and il directions each of the fbg groups cf a cf c il b and il d had ten measurement points along the pipe separated by 0 36 m as shown in the schematic diagram in fig 4 2 2 test matrix to investigate drag and added mass coefficients on the flexible pipe fitted with helical strakes in an oscillatory flow the model was forced to oscillate in harmonic motions under various combinations of amplitude and period in the horizontal direction the instantaneous displacement x t and velocity of the forced motion u t can be expressed as follows 1 x t a m sin 2 π t t 2 u t a m 2 π t cos 2 π t t where a m and t are oscillation amplitude and period respectively the drag and added mass coefficient are related to the viv response the kc number and the maximum reduced velocity vr are considered as two main parameters that determine the viv characteristics of a flexible cylinder under oscillatory flow fu et al 2014 sumer and fredsøe 1988 as well as the hydrodynamic coefficient the kc number and vr can be presented as eq 3 and eq 4 respectively 3 k c 2 π a m d 4 v r 2 π a m t f 10 d where f 10 denotes the first natural frequency of the test model in still water f 10 1 8 hz is used here considering that the first natural mode is the potential excitation mode for all the test cases which can be calculated by eq 5 5 f n 0 n 2 l f t 0 m n 2 π 2 l 2 e i m m m s 1 4 π d 2 ρ c m c m 1 0 n 1 2 where f t0 is the pretension force m s is the mass of straked pipe per unit length in still water l and d are the length and diameter of flexible pipe respectively ei is the bending stiffness of pipe ρ is the density of water ρ 1000 kg m3 the added mass coefficient is chosen as c m 1 0 notably the added mass may deviate from the value of 1 0 in still water and the forced oscillation periods will change with the kc number at the same maximum reduced velocity in addition it should be noted that the diameter values are all kept the same as that of bare pipe all of test cases were divided into four groups with different maximum reduced velocities as presented in table 2 the corresponding maximum reynolds number remax has also been listed in this table which can be calculated by eq 6 6 re max u m d υ where u m is the forced motion velocity amplitude ν is the kinematic viscosity coefficient in our experiment the ambient temperature is maintained near 15 c and ν is therefore approximately 1 14 10 6 m2 s 1 the maximum reduced velocity varied from 4 to 8 remax located in the region of approximately 5 103 to 1 104 each test group had test cases with a kc number ranging from 9 to 165 under the same amplitude of the forced motion velocity the same cases were also conducted for a bare pipe the effects of helical strakes on hydrodynamic coefficients will be easily revealed through above cases with and without helical strakes 3 basic theory 3 1 preprocessing for the convenience of description the coordinate system is defined as o xyz the origin is at one end point of the pipe and the z axis x axis and y axis are along the axis of the pipe the il direction and the cf direction respectively as shown in fig 5 at the start of experiments a constant pre tension of 500n was exerted at the flexible pipe ends however the pre tension periodically varied with pipe oscillation thus the measured strain included three components the initial axial strain caused by pre tension the varying axial strain caused by varying tension and the bending strain caused by oscillatory flow thus the bending strain ε il z t caused by the hydrodynamic force in the il direction can be calculated by eq 7 7 ε i l z t ε i l b z t ε i l d z t 2 where ε il b z t and ε il d z t are the original strain time histories at the z location sampled by il b and il d measurement points respectively the pure viv strain at the z location ε cf z t can be also calculated using the same methods then a band pass filter was utilized to eliminate the higher frequency noise in the il direction and to remove corresponding higher frequency noise and effects of pendulum motion caused by forced motion in the cf direction the cutoff frequencies of the band pass filter were 0 hz and 15 hz for the il direction and 2 5f o f o is the forced oscillation frequency and 15 hz for the cf direction 3 2 displacement reconstruction the displacement reconstruction method is a basic tool for the viv study lie and kaasen 2006 ren et al 2019a song et al 2017 according to the euler bernoulli beam theory displacement response of a flexible pipe under the external load can be expressed as the sum of the mode shapes multiplied by the generalized coordinate values in each step taking the response in the il direction as an example the displacement response x z t can be expressed as 8 x z t i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where p i t is the ith generalized coordinate displacement values at time t ϕ i z is the displacement at the position z in the ith modal shape based on small deformation assumption the curvature κ z t can be expressed as 9 κ z t 2 x z t z 2 i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where ϕ i is the ith modal shape of the curvature according to the geometric relationship between the curvature and strain the strain can be calculated by 10 ε i l z t κ z t r r i 1 n p i t ϕ i z z 0 l where r denotes the radius of the flexible pipe model at the z position in this model modal shapes of the displacement are sinusoidal which can be expressed as 11 ϕ i z sin i π z l i 1 2 from eq 9 the modal shapes of the curvature are also sinusoidal after obtaining the modal shape of the displacement and curvature the generalized coordinates can be obtained from eq 10 then the displacement response in the il direction can be calculated by eq 8 using the same method as previously mentioned the displacement response of the cf direction can be also obtained 3 3 inverse identification of hydrodynamic forces and coefficients according to the governing equation of a tensioned euler bernoulli beam in the il direction the hydrodynamic force can be inversely identified as presented by 12 f z t m s 2 x z t t 2 c x z t t f t t 2 x z t z 2 e i 4 x z t z 4 where m s is mass of straked pipe per unit length in air c is damping coefficient of the pipe c 4 π ζ m s f 10 f t t is the time varying axial tension force ei is the bending stiffness f z t is the hydrodynamic force at the z position of t time in the il direction 2 x z t t 2 and x z t t represent respectively the acceleration and velocity response in the il direction which are calculated using the central difference method of the first and second order partial derivatives with respect to t 2 x z t z 2 and 4 x z t z 4 are respectively the second and fourth order spatial derivatives of the displacement in the il direction which are also calculated by the central difference method of second and fourth order partial derivatives with respect to z according the morison equation morison et al 1950 1953 the total force in the il direction can be decomposed into two components i e the drag force related to the square of velocity and the inertial force proportional to the acceleration which can be expressed as 13 f z t 1 2 ρ d c d z u t x z t t u t x z t t c m z ρ π d 2 l 4 u t t 2 x z t t 2 where f z t represents the predicted force by morison formula at the z position of the t time c d z and c m z are the drag and added mass coefficients at z position respectively ρ is the density of water ρ 1000 kg m3 for convenience in description it is assumed that 14 c 1 z t 1 2 ρ d u t x z t t u t x z t t c 2 z t ρ π d 2 l 4 u t t 2 x z t t 2 then eq 13 can be simplified as 15 f z t c d z c 1 z t c m z c 2 z t the least squares method is utilized to fit the drag and added mass coefficients in the il direction c d z and c m z can be obtained by minimizing the sum of the squared difference j c d z c m z between the predicted and identified force which can be expressed as 16 c ˆ d z c ˆ m z argmin j c d z c m z w h e r e j c d z c m z i 1 n f z t f z t 2 where n is the sample number to minimize the difference between the identified value and the predicted value of the hydrodynamic force the following eq 17 should be satisfied 17 j c d z c m z c d z 0 j c d z c m z c m z 0 transforming eq 17 into matrix form 18 h h t c d z c m z h f where 19 h c 1 z t 1 c 1 z t 2 c 1 z t n c 2 z t 1 c 2 z t 2 c 2 z t n f f z t 1 f z t 2 f z t n then the drag and added mass coefficients can be expressed as 20 c d z c m z h h t 1 h f in this paper more than 20 oscillation periods are used to reconstruct the hydrodynamic forces and coefficients 4 results and discussions 4 1 viv responses of the flexible pipe based on the displacement reconstruction method the displacement responses of the bare and straked pipe in both cf and il direction are obtained as shown in fig 6 and fig 7 respectively the depth of color represents the magnitude of displacement response the viv responses of straked and bare pipe in the cf direction were all observed more obvious higher frequency components of the displacement responses that is viv in the il direction were found in bare pipe to further investigate the statistical differences in the displacements of bare and straked pipe the root mean square rms of the displacement responses were defined as 21 y r m s z 1 n i 1 n y 2 z t i 22 x r m s z 1 n i 1 n x 2 z t i where y rms z and x rms z are the rms value of displacement response at the position z in cf and il directions respectively y z t i and x z t i are the displacement response at the position z and time t i in cf and il directions respectively it should be noted that displacement responses at statistically steady state are used to compute rms values which does not include the response time history of initial and ending parts for statistical analysis using the same methods the rms values of strain response in cf and il directions ε cf rms ε il rms can also be obtained fig 10 shows the distribution of rms values of displacement and strain response along the flexible pipe in the case of vr 6 for kc 30 as shown in fig 10 a and b the blue solid line and red dash line represent the displacement response of bare and straked pipe respectively the vortex induced vibration in the cf direction of the straked pipe is obviously smaller than that of the bare pipe while displacement response in the il direction of the straked pipe is larger than that of bare one it indicates that helical strakes can suppress the viv in cf direction but will magnify the drag force in an oscillatory flow at vr 6 and kc 30 to verify the displacement reconstruction method the bending strain responses of the bare and straked pipe were recalculated through eq 10 based on the generalized coordinate displacement value and modal shape of the curvature as shown in fig 8 and fig 9 respectively the blue solid and red dash line represent respectively the measured and calculated values the rms values of calculated bending strain is compared with the measured one as presented in fig 10 c and 10 d blue solid line and red dash line represent respectively the calculated bending strain of the bare and straked pipe the blue squares and red circles represent corresponding measured bending strains from figs 8 fig 9 fig 10 c and fig 10 d the calculated values are in a good agreement with the measured one along the flexible pipe in both cf and il direction which demonstrates the validity of displacement reconstruction method for the flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow fig 11 and fig 12 show the results for the cases vr 6 under a small kc number kc 30 and a large kc number kc 95 respectively each figure contains four subplots showing time history of the viv response and time varying frequency at the 5th gauge point of straked pipe in the cf direction subfigures a of figs 11 and 12 are the calculated time varying shedding frequency f st which is calculated by 23 f s t t s t u t d where st refers to the strouhal number st 0 2 f st is the calculated vortex shedding frequency subfigures b of figs 11 and 12 are the viv displacement response which is reconstructed by utilizing the modal superposition method as described in section 3 2 subfigures c of figs 11 and 12 show the time history of the modal weight p t of displacements subfigures d of figs 11 and 12 are the wavelet analysis of the strain signal the depth of the color indicates the concentration level of the strain components subfigures e of figs 11 and 12 present the time varying natural frequency and viv response dominant frequency the blue dash and red solid lines represent the first and second order eigen frequency while the black line refers to the dominant frequency it should be noted that the first and second order eigen frequency f 1 f 2 have considered the measured time varying tension f t t and assuming the added mass coefficient c m to be equal to 1 which can be calculated by 24 f n t n 2 l f t t m n 2 π 2 l 2 e i m m m s 1 4 π d 2 ρ c m c m 1 0 n 1 2 as presented in fig 11 calculated shedding frequency varies from 0 to 2hz viv displacement amplitude in the cf direction is less modulated and the maximum value reaches 0 25 d at kc 30 as shown in fig 11 d and fig 11 e viv response is always dominated by the 1st natural mode under larger kc number kc 95 as shown in fig 12 a strong amplitude modulation appears and the maximum value of viv displacement is less than 0 1 d an obvious viv developing process including building up lock in and dying out can be observed these response features of straked pipe in an oscillatory are similar to that of the bare one fu et al 2014 fig 13 shows the maximum displacement standard deviation of the viv of bare and straked pipes the blue squares and red circles represent the displacement response of the bare and straked pipe respectively although helical strakes can effectively suppress viv response the suppression efficiency η calculated by eq 25 at a small kc number is not very ideal as that at larger kc number ren et al 2019a 25 η y max y s max y max 100 y max and y s max are the maximum root mean square values of the displacement for a bare and straked pipe which can be obtained by eqs 26 and 27 respectively 26 y max max y r m s b z 27 y s max max y r m s s z where y rms b z and y rms s z are the rms value of displacement response of the bare and straked pipe at the position z in the cf direction respectively recently researchers chaplin et al 2005 song et al 2016 2017 vandiver 1985 have found that the drag forces and coefficients in the il direction were greatly affected by the viv response through the experiments of a flexible pipe in uniform flow the distinctive features of viv response between the small and large kc numbers may lead to different performance of hydrodynamic force and coefficients in the il direction which requires further investigation 4 2 hydrodynamic force distribution based on measured strains in the il direction the displacement responses and hydrodynamic forces in the il direction can be calculated to verify this hydrodynamic force identification method a finite element model of flexible pipe with the same parameters as those shown in table 1 was built by ansys strain response in the il direction was calculated by applying the same time history of identified hydrodynamic force on the flexible pipe fig 14 shows the time history of measured and calculated strain at the position of the 5th gauge point in the il direction under vr 6 for kc 30 and 121 compared with the measured strain the calculated values are in a good agreement with the measured one this consistency demonstrates the validity of this hydrodynamic identification method for a flexible pipe in an oscillatory flow using the hydrodynamic force identification method proposed in section 3 3 force at each cross section along the flexible pipe under different reduced velocities and kc numbers can be obtained fig 15 fig 18 show the time histories of forced motion velocity displacement response in the cf direction and hydrodynamic force in the il direction at the 5th gauge point and spatiotemporal distribution of hydrodynamic force for bare and straked pipe under vr 6 0 each figure has four subplots figures a of figs 15 18 show time history of forced motion velocity figures b of figs 15 18 illustrate time history of displacement response at the 5th gauge point in cf direction hilbert transform method bracewell 1978 is used to obtain amplitude envelope of viv displacement response figures c of figs 15 18 are the time history of hydrodynamic force at the cross section of the 5th gauge point in il direction figures c of figs 15 18 represent spatiotemporal distribution of hydrodynamic force in the il direction the gradient of the color represents the magnitude of the force the waveforms in figure a c and d of figs 15 18 can be clearly observed in an oscillatory flow a period of the oscillation motion contains acceleration and deceleration phases under the small kc number kc 30 as shown in fig 15 b viv displacement response of the straked pipe at acceleration stages is not symmetric with that at deceleration stages the amplitude value in acceleration phase at half a maximum forced motion velocity i is about 0 11 d and this value in deceleration phase ii becomes 0 20 d the former response is smaller than the latter as called hysteresis fu et al 2014 however their hydrodynamic forces behave different features although the asymmetric feature of displacement response is also observed in hydrodynamic force the force in acceleration phase is larger than that in deceleration phase as shown in fig 10 c force is about 3 3 n m in acceleration phase at the point iii while about 1 4 n m in deceleration phase at point iv the same phenomena can also be observed in bare pipe as presents in fig 17 fig 17 b shows that the viv response reaches 0 40 d at the point i and 0 67 d at the point ii correspondingly the forces are 1 8 n m 0 n m at the points iii and iv respectively the main reasons for this interesting phenomenon will be further analyzed below compared with the straked pipe the higher frequency components of hydrodynamic force on the bare pipe fluctuates more obviously it indicates that helical strake can effectively reduce this higher frequency force fluctuation the reasons can be attributed to the suppression effects of helical strakes on viv response in the cf direction this is consistent with results derived from experiments in uniform flow api 1998 ren et al 2019b under large kc number kc 121 viv response cannot be induced by the disorder and weak vortex due to the vortex breaking effects of helical strakes ren et al 2019a as shown in fig 17 a the viv developing process cannot be clearly observed at this case the response amplitudes at points i and ii are 0 03 d and 0 014 d respectively the viv response hysteresis is not obvious under this kc number the force at points iii and iv are 1 9 n m and 0 8 n m for the bare pipe viv developing process and hysteresis can be clearly seen at kc 121 as shown in fig 18 b the viv response amplitudes at points i and ii are 0 25 d and 0 53 d respectively corresponding forces at points iii and iv are 1 3 n m and 1 0 n m similar with the case of small kc number fluctuation of hydrodynamic force on the bare pipe is more obvious than the straked pipe these observations indicate that the asymmetric features of viv response and hydrodynamic force are the main phenomena for both bare and straked pipes to further illustrate these features more clearly y d f versus instantaneous reduced velocity u f 1 d are plotted in fig 19 and fig 20 the red and green solid lines represent corresponding response and force at acceleration and deceleration stages respectively differences between the red and green lines in both figs 19 and 20 indicate that both the straked and bare pipe in oscillatory flow for these kc numbers have different viv response features at acceleration and deceleration stages i e hysteresis phenomenon fu et al 2014 this is caused by the lag between vortex shedding and instantaneous reduced velocity the vortex shedding doesn t change immediately with forced motion velocity altering fu et al 2018 however at large kc number forced motion period and displacement become longer and larger the vortex will be breaking by helical strakes when kc number reaches a certain large value vortex induced vibration is difficult to be excited both development process and hysteresis of vortex induced vibration are difficult to be clearly observed different from viv response with instantaneous reduced velocity the force in acceleration phase are larger than that in deceleration phase it is not consistent with the belief that the larger viv response will lead to larger drag force based on the experimental results of flexible pipe in steady flow chaplin et al 2005 ren et al 2019b vandiver 1985 these unexpected results may be closely related to the interaction between the fluids derived forth and the backward motion of the flexible pipe fig 21 presents the sketch of this interaction in the deceleration phase the pipe drives the attached water to the right when pipe accelerates back to the left it will encounter former water body moving to the right this makes the effective velocity in acceleration phase faster than that in deceleration phase resulting in corresponding former hydrodynamic force is larger than the latter one this is called wake effects williamson 2006 although helical strakes reduced higher frequency hydrodynamic force fluctuation through suppressing viv response the asymmetric features of the force cannot be avoided more insightful experiments and cfd simulations would be carried out in the near future to further investigate this interesting phenomenon 4 3 drag and added mass coefficients after obtaining displacement response and hydrodynamic force in the il direction the drag coefficient c d z and added mass coefficient c m z at each node of bare and straked pipe can be identified through the proposed method in section 3 3 fig 22 illustrates the distribution of drag coefficients along bare and straked pipes under v r 6 0 for kc 30 and 121 fig 22 a shows drag coefficients of the straked pipe are larger than that of the bare pipe c d are around 2 3 and 3 2 for the bare and straked pipes respectively although the viv response of the straked pipe is not as significant as that of the bare one magnification effects of helical strake on drag coefficients can be clearly found with kc number increasing from 30 to 121 all c d of both the straked and bare pipes are all approaching asymptotically to 1 90 compared with the typical value c d 1 2 derived from the towing test of stationary rigid cylinder blevins and saunders 1977 drag of both the bare and straked pipes are all amplified however the reasons of drag amplification mechanism are different in an oscillatory flow for the bare pipe drag force is amplified by viv response for the straked pipe it is caused by an increased hydrodynamic diameter and altered wake ren et al 2019b unexpectedly two drag coefficients of the bare and straked pipes under a larger kc number are at the same level it can be also concluded that the magnified effects on drag by increasing hydrodynamic diameter for the straked pipe is not always necessarily greater than that of viv response in the cf direction for the bare pipe in oscillatory flow with a larger kc number fig 23 presents the distribution of added mass coefficients along the bare and straked pipes c m of the straked pipe is obviously larger than that of bare pipe in all cases it is consistent with the results of api 1998 api 1998 to validate the reliability of identified coefficients the coefficients are used to calculate the corresponding hydrodynamic forces fig 24 shows the time history of measured and calculated hydrodynamic force on straked pipe in the il direction in the case of vr 6 0 for kc 30 the blue solid line and red dash line represent the measured and calculated force respectively a good agreement is seen between these two values at different positions along the flexible pipe this demonstrates that the identified coefficients are correct to further reveal the effects of helical strake on force coefficients in the il direction the mean coefficients are introduced here the mean drag coefficients c d and mean added mass coefficients c m are defined as 28 c d 1 l 0 l c d z d z 29 c m 1 l 0 l c m z d z where l is the length of the flexible pipe model through eqs 28 and 29 mean drag and added mass coefficients under different kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities are summarized in fig 25 and fig 28 as shown in fig 25 the red circle and blue rectangle symbols represent the mean drag coefficients on the straked and bare pipe respectively it shows that drag coefficients on both the bare and straked pipes under small kc number are magnified while distributions of mean drag coefficient are stable with kc number under larger kc number more in detail under small kc number the amplified phenomena of drag coefficients on the straked pipe are more significant than the bare one fig 25 a presents mean drag coefficients of the straked pipe reach 4 1 while 3 3 for bare pipe under vr 4 0 and kc 13 as reduced velocities increases to 6 and 8 c d of staked pipe can be amplified to approximately 5 8 and 8 8 as illustrated in fig 25 b and c under kc 13 and 9 respectively under larger kc number the mean drag coefficients are approaching to 1 8 and 1 5 for bare and staked pipe as shown in fig 25 a under vr 4 0 respectively and c d stabilize at 1 9 and 2 0 for both the bare and straked pipes as vr increases to 6 0 and 8 0 as shown in fig 25 b and c respectively the mean drag coefficients for both bare and straked pipe increase with maximum reduced velocities under a larger kc number to further reveal the reasons behinds the above features of mean drag coefficients and investigate the effects of helical strakes and viv responses on drag coefficients viv displacement amplitudes are summarized in fig 26 under vr 4 0 the response of bare one is only excited under small kc number and correspondingly magnification of drag coefficients can be also seen as kc number increases viv decreases to stable value which is less than 0 1 d meanwhile mean drag coefficients decrease from 3 3 at kc 13 to a smaller asymptotic value 1 5 at larger kc number these two value trends have good consistency as a result drag amplification can be attributed to the viv response as the results reported by vandiver et al 1985 according to experiments of a flexible pipe in steady flow compared with the bare pipe viv responses of the straked pipe are sufficiently suppressed while amplification of drag coefficients of the straked pipe can be still seen at the same magnitude with the bare one under a small kc number the magnification of drag on straked pipe is even slightly obvious the downward trend can also be seen in mean drag coefficients with kc number therefore it can be easily inferred that drag magnification of the straked pipe in an oscillatory flow is not caused by viv response in the cf direction the main reasons can be attributed to the wake effect as previously mentioned in the case of a small kc number the forced oscillation period is shorter and the forced oscillation amplitude is smaller the time of the pipe in the wake is more pronounced the effective velocity will be larger than the actually forced oscillation velocity in most time of the whole oscillation period when the kc number increase the wake effects will be weakened thus although there is no obvious viv response the drag coefficients of the straked pipe are significantly magnified at small kc number and decrease to the asymptotic value at a larger kc number beyond that slightly larger coefficients observed on straked pipe can be attributed to this hydrodynamic diameter increased due to covered helical strakes as maximum reduced velocities increase to 6 and 8 viv of bare pipe is significantly excited in the case of all kc numbers maximum viv displacement amplitudes increase with maximum reduced velocities mean values of viv displacement amplitudes are around 0 15 d 0 35 d and 0 45 d for vr 4 6 and 8 respectively correspondingly increased trends of c d are also seen this is consistent with the belief that larger viv response leads to lager drag force by broadening incoming flow area as previously described however the considerable viv of straked pipe only occurs in the case of small kc number kc is around 30 we surprisingly find that the maximum drag coefficients of straked pipe do not appear when viv responses reach their maximum value although the viv response at kc 20 is smaller than that at kc around 30 c d of the former one is significantly larger than the latter so viv response of the straked pipe is not a direct reason for the drag magnification under small kc number another factors as wake effect and increasing hydrodynamic diameter by helical strakes may play the dominant role it also indicates that drag magnification of helical strakes caused by wake effects is more significant than viv in the case of small kc number compared with the bare pipe even though obvious viv of the bare pipe is excited the drag coefficients of the bare pipe are not at the same magnitude as those of straked pipe this means the effects of wake on the straked pipe is more intensive than the bare pipe and further indicates that the helical strakes can enhance the effects of wake to better understand the enhanced effects of helical strakes on flow wake the sketches are shown in fig 27 due to the viscosity of fluid water attached to a flexible pipe are driven by the movement of pipe when the pipe decelerates and moves in the opposite direction the movement direction of water body cannot change immediately resulting in the effective velocity greater than the actual velocity as shown in fig 27 a different from bare pipe helical stakes tied on flexible pipe make the attached water hardly escape this allows a larger volume of added fluid to be fully accelerated and finally enhanced the above effects of wake as presented in fig 27 b under vr 6 and 8 in the case of larger kc number two drag coefficients are the same it means the amplification of drag coefficient caused by viv for the bare pipe is equal to that by increasing hydrodynamic diameter and enhanced effects of flow wake for the straked pipe in the case of larger kc number in an oscillatory flow fig 28 shows the distribution of added mass coefficients versus kc number under different maximum reduced velocities for the bare pipe there are no obvious differences in the added mass coefficients among various maximum reduced velocities the values of c m for the bare pipe are approaching asymptotically to approximately 0 8 while the distributions of mean added mass of streaked one under different maximum reduced velocities are more discrete and obviously amplified the mean added mass of straked pipe is around 0 8 2 0 and 3 0 under vr 4 0 6 0 and 8 0 respectively the magnification of added mass coefficients can be also attributed to helical strakes impeding the detachment of attaching water the larger added mass coefficients indicate that much more water attached to the straked pipe under lower reduced velocity the force oscillation period is too long and attached water can easily detach from helical strakes however when oscillation period becomes shorter and the maximum reduced velocities increase to 6 0 and 8 0 it will be more difficult for attached water to escape thus the added mass coefficients increase with vr these results are consistent with the above explanations of the enhanced effects of helical strakes on wake as previously mentioned in the past research the vortex induced vibration suppression efficiency of the helical strakes 15 d in pitch and 0 25 d in height was tested in a rigid cylinder experiments under steady flow by schaudt et al 2008 obtaining at least 94 reduction moreover the drag coefficients are found to be approximately 1 5 in the steady flow which is not very amplified by helical strakes it means the 15d 0 25d helical strakes can serve as an ideal suppression device of the viv in the steady flow however through above observed results in the present work the application of helical strakes may cause great concern in an oscillatory flow such a large coefficient of straked pipe under small kc number in an oscillatory flow is previously unimaginable in riser design when using the helical strakes to suppress viv issue beyond that the suppression efficiency of helical strakes is not ideal as that in steady flow under small kc number kc around 30 as shown in fig 26 therefore lower suppression efficiency and severe drag magnification effects of helical strakes may have an extremely adverse influence on riser this may lead to serious potential engineering safety problems and must be taken into consideration in real project it suggests that suppression efficiency and drag amplification for helical strakes with other pitches and heights should be evaluated through flexible pipe experiments not only in a steady flow but also in an oscillatory flow 5 conclusions in this paper magnification of hydrodynamic coefficients of a straked pipe in an oscillatory flow including drag and added mass coefficients are experimentally investigated the maximum reduced velocities range from 4 to 8 and the kc numbers vary between 9 and 165 the hydrodynamic force and coefficients on helical strakes are first revealed by using inverse analysis and the least squares method the features of hydrodynamic force in deceleration and acceleration phase are presented in detail distribution of corresponding mean coefficients versus kc numbers and maximum reduced velocities are summarized compared with a bare pipe effects of helical strakes covering on flexible pipe on hydrodynamic coefficients are further investigated the main conclusions are as follows 1 asymmetric features of hydrodynamic force caused by wake effects are first observed in both bare and straked pipes moreover helical strakes can effectively reduce higher frequency hydrodynamic force fluctuation through suppressing viv response 2 under large kc number the drag coefficients of the straked pipe are at the same level as the bare one while added mass coefficients of the former one are larger than that of the latter one magnified effects on drag by increasing hydrodynamic diameter for straked pipe are not always necessarily greater than that of viv response in the cf direction for the bare pipe in an oscillatory flow 3 under small kc number significantly amplification was found in the straked pipe the maximum value of c d can reach approximately 10 enhanced effects on the wake and increasing hydrodynamic diameters by helical strakes are main potential reasons 4 lower suppression efficiency and severe drag magnification effects of helical strakes under small kc number may have an extremely adverse influence on riser it may lead to

21724,the thruster thruster interaction in the vector layout propulsion system of a remotely operated vehicle rov should be considered the influence of the deflection angle rotation speed and thrusters ducted propellers spacing on the rov thrust performance was analyzed the previously reported empirical formula has shortcomings in predicting the thruster thruster interaction at small deflection angles 0 10 when the two thrusters were in a tandem condition the total forward thrust increased first and then decreased with the increase in the forward thruster deflection angle the maximum thrust occurred when the forward thruster deflection angle was about 15 when the four thrusters in a vector layout were divided into left and right groups the interaction between the two groups was small the thrust of the single thruster was significantly influenced by the change of the transverse spacing however it was not significantly influenced by the change of the longitudinal spacing the change of the rotational speed had little influence on the thrust of the downstream thruster the thrust loss was less influenced by the change of the spacing and rotational speed than the deflection angle keywords remotely operated vehicle rov detached eddy simulation des vector layout ducted propeller deflection angle 1 introduction the most important ability of remotely operated vehicles rov christ 2007 is to perform heavy duty high intensity and high precision operations in deep sea environments which are dangerous and complex rov is an important type of equipment necessary for the utilization of deep sea resources li et al 2018 to achieve multiple freedom motion the propulsion systems in rov are often arranged in different directions vector layout the vector propulsion system is composed of multiple fixed thrusters for each working condition the rov is often driven by multiple thrusters to achieve the motion control of a rov with minimum energy consumption the thrust optimization problem of vector layout propulsion systems must be solved johansen and fossen 2013 fossen 2011 the modeling of vector layout propulsion systems and the method of thrust distribution have become popular and crucial issues of current research yang et al 2001 soylu et al 2008 however the current research of thrust distribution in rov is based on the assumption that the hydrodynamic performance of the thruster is known and the flow field is uniform wu 2017 however the size of the rov limits the spacing between the thrusters thus the thruster thruster interaction cannot be ignored there are many types of thrusters such as general ducted channel water jet flat magnetic fluid and vector thrusters zhu 1992 the main advantage of the ducted propeller is that its thrust is larger and more efficient than a general propeller when it operates in low speed and heavy load conditions ducted propellers also help to reduce the hull vibrations and wake dang and laheij 2004 dietmar and howard 1999 martijn et al 2004 a large bollard pull thrust is required in an rov so the ducted propellers are used in the vector layout propulsion system for greater thrust the design and simulation history of the propeller can be divided into two parts 1 before the 1950s experimental studies of propellers were primarily used studies had been conducted by famous scholars such as froude durand and schaffran van lammeren et al 1948 2 after the 1950s the use of simulations increased before the 1990s ship propeller theory based on potential flow theory was mainly used which included the lift line lift surface and surface element methods however viscosity is a non negligible factor for the study of thruster thruster interaction dong et al 2009 since the 1990s with the development of viscous flow theory and the advancement of technology cfd has been gradually developed and applied qin et al 2019 go et al 2017 investigated the effect of a duct on propeller performance the propeller with the duct leads to greater thrust and torque than that without the duct zhang and jaiman 2019 found that the short wave instability is the primary mechanism for the breakdown of the tip leakage vortex in the turbulent wake the thruster thruster interaction problem for rov is similar to the problem in dynamic positioning propulsion systems on marine platforms multiple thrusters are arranged in the dynamic positioning propulsion system and there is more than 45 thrust loss between adjacent thrusters leif and rune 2001 in the design of the dynamic positioning thrust system due to thruster thruster interaction certain deflection angles are forbidden the forbidden angle acts as the boundary condition for optimal control in the thrust distribution problem yang et al 2009 however compared with the dynamic positioning system on offshore platform the thruster on an rov is more complicated and the thruster thruster interaction is more significant the thruster thruster interaction is depended on the size of rov in addition there is an overall interaction of the thrust performance in the vector layout propulsion system so the thrust performance should be evaluated by overall index therefore thruster thruster interaction should be considered as an important factor in the thrust strategy 2 cfd model the most significant difference between ducted and general propeller is that there is a duct outside the blades for a ducted propeller the gap between the duct and blades is very small so the viscosity especially the boundary layer cannot be ignored therefore potential flow theory which neglects viscosity is not suitable in recent years cfd methods have been used to study ducted propellers cfd methods can be mainly divided into three types li 2017 direct numerical simulation dns large eddy simulation les and reynolds averaged navier stokes rans dns is the most accurate but the requirements on the mesh quality and quantity and the computing requirements are too strict to be applied to actual engineering simulations rans is the most widely used method as its computational requirements are lower however due to the time averaging some random and small vortices cannot be captured and the viscosity of the wake is incorrectly increased les replaces small scale vortices at a certain scale with a total quantity in the momentum equation large scale eddies are directly simulated and small scale vortices are simulated by an established model smagorinsky 1963 thus most of the vortex information can be retained which makes the simulation more accurate however les requires greater meshing and computational requirements and it is difficult to meet these requirements for complex systems the detached eddy simulation des model which combines the les and rans models has been widely used in recent years spalart et al 1997 the rans model is applied to the near wall region which reduces the requirement for the near wall mesh the les model is applied to the far wall region the simulation accuracy and computational requirements can be satisfied by the des model nowadays the des method has been applied to the simulation of ducted propellers and good results have been obtained dong et al 2015 2 1 object of research shanghai jiao tong university underwater engineering institute developed 6000 m depth sea dragon iii rov which was a heavy duty rov and had strong thrust performance the rov has 7 ducted propellers 4 in horizontal plane and 3 in vertical plane in order to obtain good thrust for different direction in the horizontal plane the 4 ducted propellers are in vector layout it is shown in fig 1 the main performance indexes are listed in table 1 it is clear that the sea dragon iii rov requires high maneuverability and controllability with well chosen layout of propulsion system which easily obtains the vector thrust in 360 direction in horizontal plane the model of a single ducted propeller is shown in fig 2 the blade parameters of the ducted propeller are listed in table 2 2 2 meshing the simulation was validated for a single ducted propeller based on the accuracy and simulation requirements of bollard pull test for the ducted propeller the simulation region was set to 8d before and 13d after the model of the propeller the radial diameter was 8d where d refers to the diameter of the propeller the simulation region was divided into a rotating region that only contained the blades and an external region that only contained the duct the data were transferred between the two regions through an interface the inside of the duct was meshed by polyhedral mesh in star ccm and the thin mesh model was used to increase the mesh density in the gap region the thin mesh model was a model that could automatically determine the size of the thin region based on a set threshold and create a layered mesh in the thin region thus the tip leakage region can be easily found and filled with a dense mesh the external region is simple and a less dense mesh was used to reduce computational requirements the wall function was applied to the boundary layer which required that the height of the first layer of the wall to fulfill the y dimensionless wall distance requirement generally the value of y should be between 30 and 300 in this article the y of the model was 45 which met the simulation requirement the mesh is shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the number of cells in the rotation region was about 790 000 and the number in the external region was about 620 000 2 3 boundary conditions and other parameters the simulation was simulated by star ccm the sliding mesh and unsteady des model were applied the simple algorithm was used for the pressure velocity coupling the boundary conditions were set as follows the inlet condition was a pressure inlet the initial inflow velocity was 0 the outlet condition was a pressure outlet and the surface of the rod shaft conduit blade and hub were all set with non slip wall boundary conditions the surface between the external region and the internal rotation region was set as the interface across which data were transmitted 3 convergence analysis to test the influence of the number of cells on the simulation three simulation models with different numbers of cells were compared the index of convergence indicated whether the simulated values converged as the number of cells increased the speed of the incoming flow was set to u 0 m s and the rotation speed u 0 m s was r 820 rpm the convergence ratio r g ittc 2017 which was used to verify the convergence of the three simulations is defined as follows 1 r g ε 32 ε 21 r g ε 21 ε 32 where ε 21 s 2 s 1 and ε 32 s 3 s 2 s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the solutions simulated by the coarse medium and fine mesh the state of convergence can be classified as follows 1 monotonic 0 r g 1 0 r g 1 2 oscillatory 1 r g 0 r g 0 r g 1 3 divergent r g 1 the simulated thrust for the three meshes is shown in table 3 the convergence ratio of the thrust and torque was monotonic based on the definitions above this indicated that with the increases in the number of cells the convergence was monotonic thus with cells number increases beyond 1 978 million the variation of the solution can be neglected therefore it was reasonable to apply the medium mesh model the same model was also used when simulating multiple ducted propellers 4 analysis of solution 4 1 simulation verification of single thruster the open water ducted propeller was tested in the towing tank of shanghai jiao tong university the advance coefficient j was changed fig 5 shows the simulation results of the thrust with different advance coefficients the maximum difference was 3 85 as shown in fig 5 k t thrust coefficient of the ducted propellers obtained from the simulations with different advance coefficients were accurate 4 2 simulation verification of two thrusters for the study of the interaction of two thrusters arranged in the forward and downstream of the vehicle an empirical formula has been reported dang and laheij 2004 which was used as a benchmark in this study these empirical formulas are as follows 2 t t t 0 1 0 8 x d 2 3 interaction in free open water t t t 0 1 0 75 x d 2 3 interaction under a flat bottom t φ t 1 t φ 3 130 t 3 φ 3 interaction under deflection angle where t is thrust reduction ratio at 0 deflection angle t is thrust of the forward thruster t 0 is thrust of the downstream thruster x is distance between the two thrusters d is thruster diameter φ is deflection angle t φ is thrust reduction ratio at deflection angle φ for the downstream thruster first the simulation was designed based on the benchmark working conditions and was compared with the prediction of the empirical formula however the factors related to the thruster type are not considered in the empirical formula the formula is mainly used to predict the thruster thruster interaction in a dynamic positioning system the applicable working conditions were different from the actual working conditions of the rov so the empirical formula could only be used for qualitative research and trend analysis in addition the arrangement of the two thrusters for the empirical formula is different from that on the rov in the arrangement for the empirical formula there is no deflection angle of the downstream thruster and in the rov arrangement studied herein the same deflection angle is used in the forward and downstream thrusters which was primarily due to the lateral movement of the rov the two arrangements are shown in fig 6 and forward and axial directions are shown in fig 6 by changing the deflection angle of the forward thruster 0 5 10 15 20 30 and 45 while the deflection angle of the downstream thruster is fixed the thrust value was compared with the thrust value predicted by the empirical formula the velocity distribution of the flow field is shown in fig 7 the simulated thrust values were compared with those predicted by the empirical formula to verify the accuracy of the empirical formula and determine the applicability of the empirical formula the rotation speed of design operating in sea dragon iii rov is 1200 rpm and 820 rpm rotation speed is selected to be compared the thrust of 820 rpm is only half of the thrust of 1200 rpm the comparison is shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the result predicted by the formula deviated significantly from the simulation result when the deflection angle was less than 10 region i when the deflection angle was 0 the deviation reached 72 55 this was mainly due to the lack of the thruster type in the empirical formula thus the empirical formula is not suitable for predicting the performance of a ducted propeller in vector layout propulsion system when the deflection angle was equal to or greater than 10 region ii the deviation of the predicted thrust values from the empirical formula and simulation was small at deflection angles larger than 15 the thrust of the downstream thruster was relatively stable the thrust loss of the downstream thruster was almost negligible combined with the velocity distribution it can be seen that when the deflection angle was larger than 15 the downstream thruster was almost out of the influence of the forward thruster wake the thrust loss mainly depended on how much the downstream thruster was immersed in the wake of the forward thruster the radial influence range of the forward thruster wake increased with the increase in the wake extension distance after the downstream thruster was out of this range the thrust quickly returned to the thrust of that in open water 4 3 comparison between four thruster and two thruster simplified arrangement the reference arrangement was the actual arrangement in the sea dragon iii rov the four thrusters could be divided into two groups lateral and forward downstream groups the interaction between the two groups was different the two groups are shown in fig 9 there was overall interaction between the two groups the lateral interaction δ l and forward downstream interaction δ f d can be used to measure the overall interaction the relationship of these factors is as follows 3 t t t l 2 δ l t t t f t d δ f d where t t is thrust of four thrusters t l is thrust of two thrusters in single lateral group t f is thrust of two thrusters in forward group t d is thrust of two thrusters in downstream group by comparing the four thruster and the two thruster simplified arrangement δ l and δ f d can be calculated the mesh for the four thruster arrangement is shown in fig 10 comparing the total forward thrust of the lateral simplified and the four thruster arrangement δ l was calculated the results are shown in table 4 as shown in table 4 in the lateral simplified arrangement comparing twice of the forward thrust of one side and total forward thrust of four thruster arrangement the deviation was 0 33 at 820 rpm when the rotation speed was increased to 1200 rpm the difference was 1 22 with the rotation speed increase the difference increased but its value was small the interaction of the thrust on the left and right sides was small and could be ignored in the predictions this simplified method can be used to replace the whole flow field for further study taking 820 rpm as an example the flow field in the lateral simplified and four thruster arrangement is shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the streamlines of the lateral simplified and four thruster arrangement were different in the lateral simplified arrangement both the thrusters could receive inflow from the other side in the four thruster arrangement the two thrusters on one side could not receive inflow from the other side the wake of the downstream thrusters then extended backward along the center line red line in fig 11 and there was complex flow in the front region of the collision point in general these differences did not influence the thrust of the thruster but only influenced the distribution of the surrounding flow field thus only other equipment placed around the thruster would be influenced δ f d can be calculated by comparing the total forward thrust of the four thruster arrangement and the total forward thrust of the forward and downstream groups the calculation method of δ f d is as follows 4 δ f d t f t d t t the value of δ f d is determined by thruster thruster interaction the larger the interaction the larger the value of δ f d δ f d for different deflection angles is shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 at both rotation speeds the variation trend of δ f d was the same the thrust loss decreased quickly with the increase in the deflection angle for angles less than 15 the thrust loss nearly reached the thrust value of two thrusters in open water when the deflection angle was 0 at high rotation speed the interaction of the two groups of thrusters was significantly greater than that at low rotation speed however the interaction decreased with the increase in the deflection angle and δ f d was close to 0 when the deflection angle was greater than 15 the interaction was small when the deflection angle was greater than 15 whether the lateral or forward downstream simplified arrangement was considered the maximum total forward thrust occurred when the deflection angle was about 15 the total forward thrust decreased when the deflection angle was greater than 15 therefore increasing of the deflection angle did not always improve the thrust and there was a maximum point at about 15 in addition according to the analysis of the lateral group the interaction between the two lateral groups was very small at the reference spacing thus the two thrusters on one side could be only analyzed when studying the influence of the deflection angle variations the results can be extended to four thruster arrangement this simplified arrangement will be used to study the influence of different deflection angles in the four thruster arrangement 4 4 interaction of four thrusters with different deflection angles 4 4 1 analysis of downstream thrusters axial thrust variation with deflection angle changes at different deflection angles although the downstream thruster was always influenced by the forward thruster the interaction may be different the axial thrust of the downstream thrusters at different deflection angles is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the axial thrust changed rapidly when the deflection angle was smaller than 15 when the deflection angle was bigger than 15 it changed slowly and was almost equal to the open water thrust of the single thruster the change of the thrust was mainly caused by the change of the inlet conditions of the downstream thruster the streamline at each deflection angle is shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 when the deflection angle was smaller than 15 the downstream thruster was completely or partially immersed in the wake of the forward thruster so the thrust loss was greater when the deflection angle was greater than 15 the downstream thruster was out of the direct influence range of the forward thruster although the inlet condition of the downstream thruster was different from that in the open water the thrust was not significantly influenced 4 4 2 analysis of total forward thrust variation with deflection angle changes when the rov moves forward a large forward thrust is required although a larger β leads to a smaller thrust thrust interaction the forward thrust is split into the lateral direction with the increase of the deflection angle that may lead to a decrease in the forward thrust considering the mutual thruster thruster interaction it is necessary to study the influence of the deflection angle on the total forward thrust if forward and backward motion are the main motion of the rov such an arrangement can be adopted the total forward thrust with different deflection angle β is as shown in fig 15 as shown in fig 15 the maximum thrust occurred when the deflection angle was about 15 which was the same as that when the axial thrust of the downstream thruster start to be stable it subsequently decreased significantly with the increase in the deflection angle with the deflection angle increased the thrust is increasingly dispersed laterally which resulted in the decrease of total forward thrust this is why the total forward thrust decreased when the deflection angle was greater than 15 when the deflection angle was smaller than 15 thrust loss caused by the increase of the deflection angle on the downstream thruster was greater than the thrust dispersing caused by the deflection angle increasing this was the reason the total forward thrust could increase when the deflection angle was smaller than 15 however the critical deflection angle 15 is a special case in the propulsion arrangement of the sea dragon iii rov when the diameter of the thruster and the distance between the thrusters changes the critical deflection angle may be different the geometric relationship between two thrusters is shown in fig 16 from fig 16 critical deflection angle can be obtained as follow 5 c p c o cos β d cos β 2 6 c q c s cos β d 2 cos β when the value of β is small 7 o s p q c p c q d 2 1 cos 2 β cos β 8 tan β sin β cos β o s o o d 2 1 cos 2 β cos β l d 2 l 1 cos β cos β sin β 2 2 l d sin β 2 0 sin β 2 l d 2 l d 2 8 2 9 β arcsin 2 l d 2 l d 2 8 2 where l is the distance between the two thrusters d is diameter of the thruster in the sea dragon iii rov l 4 87d a critical deflection angle can be calculated by the formula that β 11 606 there is about 3 difference from the conclusion of simulation which is caused by the diffusion of the thruster wake 4 5 interaction of four thrusters with different spacing the interaction of the spacing between the four thrusters cannot be considered by simplified arrangements although the interaction of the two lateral groups at the reference spacing is small this is not true when the spacing is changed thus only the four thruster arrangement can be used to study this problem the interaction of the spacing between the thrusters depends on the transverse and longitudinal spacing according to the optimized latin hypercube sampling method liu et al 2011 the evenly distributed test points were set within a certain constraint range to make the simulation more typical and representative the reference arrangement of the thrusters was the actual arrangement of the sea dragon iii rov the constraint range was designed based on the reference arrangement for expressing the distribution of the test points better the coordinate system and coordinates of the four thrusters in the reference arrangement are shown in fig 17 in fig 17 thruster p1 has two coordinate values x and y and the coordinates of the other three thrusters can be determined based on the coordinates of p1 the constraint range and coordinates of each test point were selected by the optimized latin hypercube sampling the test points and constraint range were as shown in table 5 and fig 18 point 0 is the reference point points 1 9 are the test points and the mesh in fig 18 is the constraint range compared with the thrust in open water the axial thrust variation ratios of the forward and downstream thrusters with different spacing are shown in fig 19 the flow fields of four representative test point no 0 no 4 no 7 no 8 are shown in fig 20 as shown in fig 19 the thrust of the forward thruster was not significantly influenced by the change of the longitudinal spacing and rotational speed but was influenced by the change of the transverse spacing but the influence was small the thrust of the downstream thruster was not significantly influenced by the change of the longitudinal spacing but it was significantly influenced by the change of the transverse spacing and rotational speed as shown in fig 20 when the spacing in the x direction changed there were small inflow changes of the downstream thruster when the spacing in the y direction changed there were greater inflow changes of the downstream thruster in summary the forward and downstream thrusters were not significantly influenced by the change of the longitudinal pitch but they were significantly influenced by the change of the transverse spacing when the transverse spacing was reduced to half the thrust loss at 1200 rpm was about 4 94 the influence of the rotation speed was only on the thrust of the downstream thruster but not on the forward thruster combined with the results of the deflection angle mentioned above for the range of spacing in this study the interaction caused by spacing was smaller than that caused by deflection angles in the design of an rov the influence of these factors should be considered comprehensively to minimize the thrust loss of the vector layout propulsion system 5 conclusion based on the des model the thruster thruster interaction for rov with vector layout propulsion system were simulated and analyzed by changing the rotation speed the deflection angle and the spacing between the thrusters the thruster thruster interaction of the vector layout propulsion system was analyzed the conclusions were as follows 1 the empirical formula has shortcomings in predicting interaction between ducted propellers especially when the deflection angle is small 0 10 2 when the two thrusters were in a tandem condition the total forward thrust increased first and then decreased with the increase of the deflection angle in the forward thruster the maximum thrust occurred when the deflection angle of forward thruster was about 15 3 when the four thrusters were in a vector layout and divided into left and right groups the interaction between the two groups was small the total thrust could be calculated by multiplying the thrust of one sided group by two the thrust of two thrusters in single group is similar to that of the thrusters in a tandem condition 4 when the four thrusters were in a vector layout and the longitudinal and transverse spacing were changed to half the thrust of the thrusters were significantly influenced by the change of the transverse spacing the thrust was not significantly influenced by the change of the longitudinal spacing the change of the rotational speed only influenced the thrust of the downstream thruster but this influence was small the thrust loss was less influenced by the change of the spacing and rotational speed than by the change of the deflection

of the first layer of the wall to fulfill the y dimensionless wall distance requirement generally the value of y should be between 30 and 300 in this article the y of the model was 45 which met the simulation requirement the mesh is shown in fig 3 and fig 4 the number of cells in the rotation region was about 790 000 and the number in the external region was about 620 000 2 3 boundary conditions and other parameters the simulation was simulated by star ccm the sliding mesh and unsteady des model were applied the simple algorithm was used for the pressure velocity coupling the boundary conditions were set as follows the inlet condition was a pressure inlet the initial inflow velocity was 0 the outlet condition was a pressure outlet and the surface of the rod shaft conduit blade and hub were all set with non slip wall boundary conditions the surface between the external region and the internal rotation region was set as the interface across which data were transmitted 3 convergence analysis to test the influence of the number of cells on the simulation three simulation models with different numbers of cells were compared the index of convergence indicated whether the simulated values converged as the number of cells increased the speed of the incoming flow was set to u 0 m s and the rotation speed u 0 m s was r 820 rpm the convergence ratio r g ittc 2017 which was used to verify the convergence of the three simulations is defined as follows 1 r g ε 32 ε 21 r g ε 21 ε 32 where ε 21 s 2 s 1 and ε 32 s 3 s 2 s 1 s 2 and s 3 are the solutions simulated by the coarse medium and fine mesh the state of convergence can be classified as follows 1 monotonic 0 r g 1 0 r g 1 2 oscillatory 1 r g 0 r g 0 r g 1 3 divergent r g 1 the simulated thrust for the three meshes is shown in table 3 the convergence ratio of the thrust and torque was monotonic based on the definitions above this indicated that with the increases in the number of cells the convergence was monotonic thus with cells number increases beyond 1 978 million the variation of the solution can be neglected therefore it was reasonable to apply the medium mesh model the same model was also used when simulating multiple ducted propellers 4 analysis of solution 4 1 simulation verification of single thruster the open water ducted propeller was tested in the towing tank of shanghai jiao tong university the advance coefficient j was changed fig 5 shows the simulation results of the thrust with different advance coefficients the maximum difference was 3 85 as shown in fig 5 k t thrust coefficient of the ducted propellers obtained from the simulations with different advance coefficients were accurate 4 2 simulation verification of two thrusters for the study of the interaction of two thrusters arranged in the forward and downstream of the vehicle an empirical formula has been reported dang and laheij 2004 which was used as a benchmark in this study these empirical formulas are as follows 2 t t t 0 1 0 8 x d 2 3 interaction in free open water t t t 0 1 0 75 x d 2 3 interaction under a flat bottom t φ t 1 t φ 3 130 t 3 φ 3 interaction under deflection angle where t is thrust reduction ratio at 0 deflection angle t is thrust of the forward thruster t 0 is thrust of the downstream thruster x is distance between the two thrusters d is thruster diameter φ is deflection angle t φ is thrust reduction ratio at deflection angle φ for the downstream thruster first the simulation was designed based on the benchmark working conditions and was compared with the prediction of the empirical formula however the factors related to the thruster type are not considered in the empirical formula the formula is mainly used to predict the thruster thruster interaction in a dynamic positioning system the applicable working conditions were different from the actual working conditions of the rov so the empirical formula could only be used for qualitative research and trend analysis in addition the arrangement of the two thrusters for the empirical formula is different from that on the rov in the arrangement for the empirical formula there is no deflection angle of the downstream thruster and in the rov arrangement studied herein the same deflection angle is used in the forward and downstream thrusters which was primarily due to the lateral movement of the rov the two arrangements are shown in fig 6 and forward and axial directions are shown in fig 6 by changing the deflection angle of the forward thruster 0 5 10 15 20 30 and 45 while the deflection angle of the downstream thruster is fixed the thrust value was compared with the thrust value predicted by the empirical formula the velocity distribution of the flow field is shown in fig 7 the simulated thrust values were compared with those predicted by the empirical formula to verify the accuracy of the empirical formula and determine the applicability of the empirical formula the rotation speed of design operating in sea dragon iii rov is 1200 rpm and 820 rpm rotation speed is selected to be compared the thrust of 820 rpm is only half of the thrust of 1200 rpm the comparison is shown in fig 8 as shown in fig 8 the result predicted by the formula deviated significantly from the simulation result when the deflection angle was less than 10 region i when the deflection angle was 0 the deviation reached 72 55 this was mainly due to the lack of the thruster type in the empirical formula thus the empirical formula is not suitable for predicting the performance of a ducted propeller in vector layout propulsion system when the deflection angle was equal to or greater than 10 region ii the deviation of the predicted thrust values from the empirical formula and simulation was small at deflection angles larger than 15 the thrust of the downstream thruster was relatively stable the thrust loss of the downstream thruster was almost negligible combined with the velocity distribution it can be seen that when the deflection angle was larger than 15 the downstream thruster was almost out of the influence of the forward thruster wake the thrust loss mainly depended on how much the downstream thruster was immersed in the wake of the forward thruster the radial influence range of the forward thruster wake increased with the increase in the wake extension distance after the downstream thruster was out of this range the thrust quickly returned to the thrust of that in open water 4 3 comparison between four thruster and two thruster simplified arrangement the reference arrangement was the actual arrangement in the sea dragon iii rov the four thrusters could be divided into two groups lateral and forward downstream groups the interaction between the two groups was different the two groups are shown in fig 9 there was overall interaction between the two groups the lateral interaction δ l and forward downstream interaction δ f d can be used to measure the overall interaction the relationship of these factors is as follows 3 t t t l 2 δ l t t t f t d δ f d where t t is thrust of four thrusters t l is thrust of two thrusters in single lateral group t f is thrust of two thrusters in forward group t d is thrust of two thrusters in downstream group by comparing the four thruster and the two thruster simplified arrangement δ l and δ f d can be calculated the mesh for the four thruster arrangement is shown in fig 10 comparing the total forward thrust of the lateral simplified and the four thruster arrangement δ l was calculated the results are shown in table 4 as shown in table 4 in the lateral simplified arrangement comparing twice of the forward thrust of one side and total forward thrust of four thruster arrangement the deviation was 0 33 at 820 rpm when the rotation speed was increased to 1200 rpm the difference was 1 22 with the rotation speed increase the difference increased but its value was small the interaction of the thrust on the left and right sides was small and could be ignored in the predictions this simplified method can be used to replace the whole flow field for further study taking 820 rpm as an example the flow field in the lateral simplified and four thruster arrangement is shown in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 the streamlines of the lateral simplified and four thruster arrangement were different in the lateral simplified arrangement both the thrusters could receive inflow from the other side in the four thruster arrangement the two thrusters on one side could not receive inflow from the other side the wake of the downstream thrusters then extended backward along the center line red line in fig 11 and there was complex flow in the front region of the collision point in general these differences did not influence the thrust of the thruster but only influenced the distribution of the surrounding flow field thus only other equipment placed around the thruster would be influenced δ f d can be calculated by comparing the total forward thrust of the four thruster arrangement and the total forward thrust of the forward and downstream groups the calculation method of δ f d is as follows 4 δ f d t f t d t t the value of δ f d is determined by thruster thruster interaction the larger the interaction the larger the value of δ f d δ f d for different deflection angles is shown in fig 12 as shown in fig 12 at both rotation speeds the variation trend of δ f d was the same the thrust loss decreased quickly with the increase in the deflection angle for angles less than 15 the thrust loss nearly reached the thrust value of two thrusters in open water when the deflection angle was 0 at high rotation speed the interaction of the two groups of thrusters was significantly greater than that at low rotation speed however the interaction decreased with the increase in the deflection angle and δ f d was close to 0 when the deflection angle was greater than 15 the interaction was small when the deflection angle was greater than 15 whether the lateral or forward downstream simplified arrangement was considered the maximum total forward thrust occurred when the deflection angle was about 15 the total forward thrust decreased when the deflection angle was greater than 15 therefore increasing of the deflection angle did not always improve the thrust and there was a maximum point at about 15 in addition according to the analysis of the lateral group the interaction between the two lateral groups was very small at the reference spacing thus the two thrusters on one side could be only analyzed when studying the influence of the deflection angle variations the results can be extended to four thruster arrangement this simplified arrangement will be used to study the influence of different deflection angles in the four thruster arrangement 4 4 interaction of four thrusters with different deflection angles 4 4 1 analysis of downstream thrusters axial thrust variation with deflection angle changes at different deflection angles although the downstream thruster was always influenced by the forward thruster the interaction may be different the axial thrust of the downstream thrusters at different deflection angles is shown in fig 13 as shown in fig 13 the axial thrust changed rapidly when the deflection angle was smaller than 15 when the deflection angle was bigger than 15 it changed slowly and was almost equal to the open water thrust of the single thruster the change of the thrust was mainly caused by the change of the inlet conditions of the downstream thruster the streamline at each deflection angle is shown in fig 14 as shown in fig 14 when the deflection angle was smaller than 15 the downstream thruster was completely or partially immersed in the wake of the forward thruster so the thrust loss was greater when the deflection angle was greater than 15 the downstream thruster was out of the direct influence range of the forward thruster although the inlet condition of the downstream thruster was different from that in the open water the thrust was not significantly influenced 4 4 2 analysis of total forward thrust variation with deflection angle changes when the rov moves forward a large forward thrust is required although a larger β leads to a smaller thrust thrust interaction the forward thrust is split into the lateral direction with the increase of the deflection angle that may lead to a decrease in the forward thrust considering the mutual thruster thruster interaction it is necessary to study the influence of the deflection angle on the total forward thrust if forward and backward motion are the main motion of the rov such an arrangement can be adopted the total forward thrust with different deflection angle β is as shown in fig 15 as shown in fig 15 the maximum thrust occurred when the deflection angle was about 15 which was the same as that when the axial thrust of the downstream thruster start to be stable it subsequently decreased significantly with the increase in the deflection angle with the deflection angle increased the thrust is increasingly dispersed laterally which resulted in the decrease of total forward thrust this is why the total forward thrust decreased when the deflection angle was greater than 15 when the deflection angle was smaller than 15 thrust loss caused by the increase of the deflection angle on the downstream thruster was greater than the thrust dispersing caused by the deflection angle increasing this was the reason the total forward thrust could increase when the deflection angle was smaller than 15 however the critical deflection angle 15 is a special case in the propulsion arrangement of the sea dragon iii rov when the diameter of the thruster and the distance between the thrusters changes the critical deflection angle may be different the geometric relationship between two thrusters is shown in fig 16 from fig 16 critical deflection angle can be obtained as follow 5 c p c o cos β d cos β 2 6 c q c s cos β d 2 cos β when the value of β is small 7 o s p q c p c q d 2 1 cos 2 β cos β 8 tan β sin β cos β o s o o d 2 1 cos 2 β cos β l d 2 l 1 cos β cos β sin β 2 2 l d sin β 2 0 sin β 2 l d 2 l d 2 8 2 9 β arcsin 2 l d 2 l d 2 8 2 where l is the distance between the two thrusters d is diameter of the thruster in the sea dragon iii rov l 4 87d a critical deflection angle can be calculated by the formula that β 11 606 there is about 3 difference from the conclusion of simulation which is caused by the diffusion of the thruster wake 4 5 interaction of four thrusters with different spacing the interaction of the spacing between the four thrusters cannot be considered by simplified arrangements although the interaction of the two lateral groups at the reference spacing is small this is not true when the spacing is changed thus only the four thruster arrangement can be used to study this problem the interaction of the spacing between the thrusters depends on the transverse and longitudinal spacing according to the optimized latin hypercube sampling method liu et al 2011 the evenly distributed test points were set within a certain constraint range to make the simulation more typical and representative the reference arrangement of the thrusters was the actual arrangement of the sea dragon iii rov the constraint range was designed based on the reference arrangement for expressing the distribution of the test points better the coordinate system and coordinates of the four thrusters in the reference arrangement are shown in fig 17 in fig 17 thruster p1 has two coordinate values x and y and the coordinates of the other three thrusters can be determined based on the coordinates of p1 the constraint range and coordinates of each test point were selected by the optimized latin hypercube sampling the test points and constraint range were as shown in table 5 and fig 18 point 0 is the reference point points 1 9 are the test points and the mesh in fig 18 is the constraint range compared with the thrust in open water the axial thrust variation ratios of the forward and downstream thrusters with different spacing are shown in fig 19 the flow fields of four representative test point no 0 no 4 no 7 no 8 are shown in fig 20 as shown in fig 19 the thrust of the forward thruster was not significantly influenced by the change of the longitudinal spacing and rotational speed but was influenced by the change of the transverse spacing but the influence was small the thrust of the downstream thruster was not significantly influenced by the change of the longitudinal spacing but it was significantly influenced by the change of the transverse spacing and rotational speed as shown in fig 20 when the spacing in the x direction changed there were small inflow changes of the downstream thruster when the spacing in the y direction changed there were greater inflow changes of the downstream thruster in summary the forward and downstream thrusters were not significantly influenced by the change of the longitudinal pitch but they were significantly influenced by the change of the transverse spacing when the transverse spacing was reduced to half the thrust loss at 1200 rpm was about 4 94 the influence of the rotation speed was only on the thrust of the downstream thruster but not on the forward thruster combined with the results of the deflection angle mentioned above for the range of spacing in this study the interaction caused by spacing was smaller than that caused by deflection angles in the design of an rov the influence of these factors should be considered comprehensively to minimize the thrust loss of the vector layout propulsion system 5 conclusion based on the des model the thruster thruster interaction for rov with vector layout propulsion system were simulated and analyzed by changing the rotation speed the deflection angle and the spacing between the thrusters the thruster thruster interaction of the vector layout propulsion system was analyzed the conclusions were as follows 1 the empirical formula has shortcomings in predicting interaction between ducted propellers especially when the deflection angle is small 0 10 2 when the two thrusters were in a tandem condition the total forward thrust increased first and then decreased with the increase of the deflection angle in the forward thruster the maximum thrust occurred when the deflection angle of forward thruster was about 15 3 when the four thrusters were in a vector layout and divided into left and right groups the interaction between the two groups was small the total thrust could be calculated by multiplying the thrust of one sided group by two the thrust of two thrusters in single group is similar to that of the thrusters in a tandem condition 4 when the four thrusters were in a vector layout and the longitudinal and transverse spacing were changed to half the thrust of the thrusters were significantly influenced by the change of the transverse spacing the thrust was not significantly influenced by the change of the longitudinal spacing the change of the rotational speed only influenced the thrust of the downstream thruster but this influence was small the thrust loss was less influenced by the change of the spacing and rotational speed than by the change of the deflection
