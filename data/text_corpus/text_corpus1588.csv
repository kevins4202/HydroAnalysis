7940,study region morocco northwestern africa study focus since april 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission have opened new pathways for hydrologists to monitor the changes in terrestrial total water storage tws here the center for space research csr goddard space flight center gsfc jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the average avg grace mascon solutions were used to examine the changes in tws and groundwater storages gws in morocco with an emphasis on natural replenishment events and their link to snow cover area sca and rainfall variability new hydrological insights for the region the results showed that grace tws from avg twsavg and gsfc twsgsfc can fairly describe the temporal patterns of the groundwater level gwl moreover during 2002 2020 the tws underwent a strong depletion relatively masked by natural recharge events this was revealed as we identified two intermittent depletion episodes with statistically significant rates 1 03 0 11 to 0 31 0 1 cm yr 1 higher than those obtained for the long term trend lines 0 28 0 11 to 0 15 0 07 cm yr 1 the tws appeared to be strongly linked with the sca metrics and rainfall indices with 1 3 months of lag our findings suggest that the rainfall distribution can be more insightful about changes in groundwater levels compared to the rainfall monthly totals graphical abstract ga1 keywords grace groundwater depletion changepoint natural recharge grace versus climate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface water is often considered as the primary source intended to satisfy the demand of different sectors in agriculture one of the main water consumers in morocco crop irrigation from dam allocations and rainfall are preferable given their cost effective use compared to groundwater however the decreasing tendencies in rainfall totals combined with the irregular distribution of event occurrence in recent decades filahi et al 2015 ipcc 2014 ouatiki et al 2019 have led to more reliance on groundwater population growth in its turn escalated this reliance as more wells were drilled to meet the growing water demand for domestic usage bouchaou et al 2009 thus an increase in pumping has provoked a serious depletion in the water table since the 1990 s drops of 5 65 m in the groundwater level were registered between 1990 and 2019 in various regions in morocco bahir et al 2021 hssaisoune et al 2020 ouassanouan et al 2022 this situation is more likely to worsen as future scenarios suggest further decline and irregularity in surface water supplies filahi et al 2017 marchane et al 2021 nevertheless the long term depletion is often palliated by continuous yet low natural recharge the latter is mainly ensured by surface water infiltration through river beds irrigation and precipitation received over the lowlands and the mountainous regions bouchaou et al 2009 bouimouass et al 2020 fakir et al 2021 still the imbalance between the extraction and natural recharge rates makes it difficult to reach sustainability hssaisoune et al 2020 in view of the above mentioned challenges understanding the variability of groundwater storage is essential for sustainable management and optimal planning of water resources this is critical information for planning socio economic development and environmental sustainability especially in countries with a gdp highly dependent on agricultural yields such as morocco despite the major role groundwater resources play on many levels their monitoring remains inconsistent and limited in both temporal and spatial scales the shortage in piezometers and controlled wells and thus the lack of relevant and temporally continuous observations are the main limiting factors remote sensing observations collected by multiple satellite based sensors offer a promising venue to complement in situ data various spatial missions freely provide global and gridded estimates of different components of the hydrologic cycle recent advances have been made in snow cover hall and riggs 2016 and soil moisture retrievals entekhabi et al 2010 employing data from optical and microwave sensors the equivalent water thickness of these water cycle components in addition to groundwater are summed up by the grace and its follow on grace fo mission in what so called total water storage anomalies tapley et al 2019 the mission jointly launched by nasa and german dlr space agencies acquire changes in gravity fields the latter are generally driven by water mass redistribution on top and beneath the earth s surface this opened huge opportunities for studying the water stored in reservoirs and land atmosphere fluxes eicker et al 2020 in the last two decades grace was considered in various water related applications asoka et al 2017 döll et al 2014 ferreira et al 2020 xiao et al 2015 many studies have investigated its robustness against the groundwater level observations the water storage estimates were found to agree very well with the in situ measurements in different regions worldwide particularly the mascon solutions showed the best match bhanja et al 2018 neves et al 2020 shen et al 2015 xie et al 2018 noteworthy good agreement was also reported for groundwater storage determined using spherical harmonic solutions ferreira et al 2020 additionally the grace data were combined with outputs from hydrologic and land surface models to strengthen the accuracy of the water balance estimation gleason et al 2018 mehrnegar et al 2020 they have proved adequate to improve surface soil moisture estimation over densely vegetated areas where the passive microwave estimates are susceptible to uncertainties and evapotranspiration mapping in water limited regions sadeghi et al 2020 shen et al 2017 grace was used to map the ice mass loss estimates over glaciers doumbia et al 2020 jin et al 2017 and quantify snow accumulation over high latitudes adopting a mass balance approach behrangi et al 2018 niu et al 2007 more frequently the grace time series were used to analyze the long term temporal changes in groundwater storage and its susceptibility to climate variability ahmed 2020 ahmed et al 2014 bhanja et al 2018 hasan et al 2019 leblanc et al 2011 2009 shen et al 2015 xie et al 2018 in morocco two studies explored the patterns of groundwater using grace measurements ahmed et al 2021 milewski et al 2020 the authors compared the trend lines slopes of rainfall and grace based groundwater anomalies to explain the sustainability of the groundwater resources in this study we aim at assessing the temporal variability of terrestrial water storage over morocco with an emphasis on its link to rainfall and snow cover patterns based on trend test and correlation analysis we shed light on the interaction between climate variability and terrestrial water storage and how surface water intakes can relatively mask the ongoing depletion 2 methods 2 1 study area the study covers morocco in northwestern africa it was firstly held over the whole territory subdivided into four subregions region 1 4 and then focused on an area of smaller scale fig 1 the latter include the oum er rbia oer and tensift ten river basins grouped together oer ten hereafter occupying a surface of approximately 64 000 km² the region is bordered from the east by the atlas mountain chain culminating at 4124 m a s l that holds the credit for most of the water supplying the surrounding lowlands boudhar et al 2011 ouatiki et al 2020 the water stored in aquifers deep confined and shallow unconfined and dams support the allocation for drinking industrial and agricultural activities 325 800 ha of irrigated lands and electricity production through hydropower plants the oer ten is mainly influenced by the north atlantic oscillation knippertz et al 2003 it is dominated by semi arid conditions that become relatively humid as we move towards high elevations the rainfall is strongly variable over space and time hadri et al 2021 ouatiki et al 2019 its annual cycle is characterized by a wet period from november to april and a dry period from jun to september with the highest and lowest totals usually recorded during the winter december january and february and summer months june july and august respectively above 1000 m a s l precipitation occurs as snow between mid november and mid april and completely vanishes during the hot summer boudhar et al 2020 2016 2 2 rainfall daily rainfall records from ground rain gauges situated within the oer and ten river basins were used in this study with a temporal coverage of 39 hydrologic years 09 1976 08 2015 the data were provided by the oum er rbia and tensift hydraulic agencies abhoer and abht respectively and the regional office for agricultural development of tadla ormvat the daily observations were processed to calculate four rainfall indices at monthly and annual time scales according to the climate change indices list provided by the expert team on climate change detection and indices peterson et al 2001 1 rainfall the total rainfall in mm per month year 2 nwd the count in days of wet days per month year a day is considered as wet when the total rainfall exceeds a certain threshold in the present study six different thresholds 0 1 mm 1 mm 2 mm 3 mm 4 mm and 5 mm were tested to define a wet day 3 ncwd the count in days of wet spells with at least 2 consecutive wet days 4 mcwd the length in days of the wet spells exhibiting the maximum consecutive wet days in addition to the in situ observations gridded satellite rainfall estimates from the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr product were employed ashouri et al 2015 the final persiann cdr data is provided as quasi global 60 s to 60 n rainfall estimates at 0 25 x 0 25 spatial resolution every 3 h the product was chosen considering the good performance it showed when evaluated against rain gauges within the study region ouatiki et al 2022 in review although slightly surpassed by the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg persiann cdr was preferred given its availability for a period from 1983 to the present long enough to allow relevant climatological analysis we must highlight that the term year hereafter refers to the hydrologic year from september to august e g 01 09 2002 31 08 2003 2002 2003 2 3 snow cover area snow depth measurement stations are relatively scarce over the oer ten s mountainous region 20 000 km2 above 1000 m a s l thus sca retrieved from terra modis satellite data mod10a1 is used in this study as an alternative for snow in situ measurements hall and riggs 2016 mod10a1 product provides daily observations spatially gridded at 500 m from 2000 to the present moreover to deal with the missing values and cloud coverage effect the sca daily maps were processed adopting a method developed for the moroccan atlas mountain range marchane et al 2015 using the corrected mod10a1 data time series of snow cover area in percentage scap were built relative to the total area of the oer ten s mountainous region thus three metrics maximum median and average of the daily scap were derived for each month and year of the period 2000 2015 2 4 soil moisture the soil moisture sm estimates were obtained at 100 cm depth via the surfex in french surface externalisée surface modeling platform developed by météo france albergel et al 2019 the platform includes the isba land surface model implemented with the trip oki and sud 1998 hydrologic model through a global land data assimilation system ldas monde albergel et al 2017 the latter permits the incorporation of surface soil moisture sm and leaf area index satellite observations to constrain the near surface variables including sm simulated by the isba trip coupled model

the data quality control 10 piezometer records that present the least amount of missing data were selected the best temporal overlap that allowed to maximize the number of retained piezometers was found for the period 2002 2017 the available piezometers are distributed over the whole study region and capture the majority of the aquifers average monthly gwl time series were calculated for oer ten in this study given the lack of specific yield estimates in addition to the strong heterogeneity of the aquifer systems over the study region we did not consider the groundwater storage from in situ observations instead we have standardized the groundwater level time series of each well by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation before computing the regional groundwater level average bloomfield and marchant 2013 zhao et al 2017 this approach adopted by ahmed et al 2021 over the same context can maintain information about the temporal patterns the main focus here of the groundwater level 2 6 surface water bodies in the oer ten basin surface water is mostly represented through anthropogenic hydraulic infrastructures these facilities are jointly managed and regulated by the abhoer and the national office of electricity and drinking water onee to support the water needs for drinking and socioeconomic activities the monthly storage time series of the two largest dams bin el ouidane and al massira were considered in this study to account for the surface water effect on grace tws estimates the data were obtained from the abhoer for the period between 2002 and 2017 2 7 grace mission grace april 2002 june 2017 and grace fo june 2018 present jointly launched by nasa and dlr map the earth s monthly gravity changes provoked by mass redistribution above and below the earth s surface tapley et al 2019 2004 their end user data are provided as equivalent water thickness anomalies and corrected for most geophysical distortions they are available as solutions from various centers csr german research centre for geosciences gfz jpl and gsfc in spherical harmonics and or mascons mass concentration blocks versions the mascons are newly released as an alternative for solving the gravity signals and have advantages over spherical harmonics they are less subject to leakage errors and show better land ocean signals separation landerer and cooley 2021 luthcke et al 2013 watkins et al 2015 several studies indicated the precedence of mascon solutions over the harmonic in representing the groundwater variations bhanja et al 2018 2016 neves et al 2020 xie et al 2018 the earth s monthly terrestrial tws anomalies from jpl csr and gsfc grace mascon solutions were used in this work for the period 2002 2020 the data are available at different spatial samplings with a native resolution of about 3 x3 the three solutions were averaged to obtain a mean tws time series the errors associated with the average tws were computed as the monthly standard deviation of the three solutions ahmed and wiese 2019 due to measures taken for battery saving the tws time series contain some missing months the latter were filled by using a three month moving average window however when more than two successive months were missing the gaps were omitted during all of the analyses considered in this study the tws sums the water masses contained in the different terrestrial reservoirs surface water bodies swb snow water equivalent swe sm gws canopy ca shen et al 2015 employing the mass balance approach the changes in the gws can be estimated as 1 gws tws swb swe sm ca one or more of the equation terms swb swe sm or ca can be omitted according to their significance to the long term variations in the tws shen et al 2015 here the gws was derived from the tws based on swb and sm the errors associated with the gws data were computed as the root sum of squares of the errors associated with each of the terms considered in the gws estimation eq 2 2 σ gws σ tws σ sm σ swb where σ gws is the error in grace based gws σ tws grace tws error σ sm monthly standard deviation from surfex soil moistures estimates and σ swb is the monthly standard deviation from surface water reservoirs 2 8 statistical indices and metrics the tws and gws time series were tested for monotonic trends using the seasonal mann kendall test kendall 1938 mann 1945 the magnitude of the trend was quantified based on the theil sen slope estimator sen 1968 theil 1950 to consider the impact of data inhomogeneity on the estimated trend slopes a predefined function was used to detect the presence of potential change points in the tws time series the function relies on the work done by lavielle 2005 and killick et al 2012 to identify the location where the mean and slope of the time series significantly change it consecutively divides the time series into two sections and computes an estimate of the mean of each section the change point is identified at the location where deviation of the sum of the residual error reaches a minimum value the spearman rank scc eq 3 correlation coefficient and root mean square error rmse eq 4 were used to examine how well grace data follow the temporal patterns of the gwl observations the scc was also adopted to assess the linear relationship of grace versus the sca metrics and rainfall indices all the variables considered in this analysis were standardized the same way as for the gwl section 2 5 also a smoothing filter was applied to the gwl sca metrics and rainfall indices using the savitzky golay filter 3 scc i i n r x i r x r y i r y i 1 n r x i r x 2 i 1 n r y i r y 2 4 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where x i and y i are the values of x variable and y variable in the time i respectively r x i and r y i are the rank of the x variable and y variable values respectively with mean values of r x and r y n is the number of records 3 results and discussion 3 1 water storage temporal variability according to the seasonal mann kendall and theil sen slope results the three studied grace solutions csr gsfc and jpl present different behaviors in terms of long term trend directions and magnitudes fig 2a b and c according to csr region 3 and 4 experienced spatially predominant rising trends in tws fig 2a the wetting trend over the southern regions appeared to be more prominent and statistically significant compared to region 1 in the latter the positive slopes are mostly found in areas near the atlantic coastline particularly in the far northeast of the country the drying rates on the other hand were observed in some parts of region 2 but mainly in the far western side of region 1 with fewer isolated cases that were statistically significant at the 0 05 level contrasted observations can be drawn using the gsfc solution fig 2b while the upward trends were spatially limited in the west of region 1 and east of region 3 the depletion patterns were widespread all over the country the trends were statistically significant in the majority of cases region 3 and region 4 but particularly strong in region 2 the tws trends from jpl show roughly similar patterns as those depicted by gsfc but with less spatial details statistically significant decreasing tendencies were found in the majority of region 2 in the south of region 4 and with relatively higher rates in the eastern part of region 1 increasing slopes were widespread in region 3 and of less extent in region 1 mostly of small amplitudes regional and global trend maps are often used to assess the long term tendencies and emphasize the underlying factors of wetting and drying conditions over large scales hasan 2019 milewski et al 2020 rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 however sometimes these tendencies can be unreal and temporarily caused by natural patterns or remarkable wetting events ahmed et al 2021 rodell et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 consequently one could falsely draw conclusions that do not describe the real situation and give confidence about the sustainability of the groundwater when it is actually in depletion numerous authors reported that the presence of significant breaks in time series can strongly influence the long term trend lines by causing slope dampening and signs reversal militino et al 2020 sharma et al 2016 given that we investigated the presence of change points in tws over morocco fig 2g h and i multiple change points were detected in twscsr six twsgsfc five and twsjpl six anomalies fig 2g h and i the temporal position of the change points differs depending on solutions and regions the ones detected in csr showed a certain spatial variability with five different years were found in region 1 2008 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 three in region 2 2009 2014 and 2015 and region 3 2009 2014 and 2015 and two 2007 and 2008 in region 4 in the gsfc they seemed relatively spatially consistent as two main change points were widespread 2008 detected in region 1 and 2012 in region 2 3 and 4 in addition to three others 2006 2010 and 2014 scattered in small areas according to jpl four change years were detected in region 1 2008 2009 2010 and 2015 two in region 2 2009 and 2015 and region 3 2007 and 2015 and three in region 4 2006 2007 and 2010 moreover the tws peaks near the detected change points are generally among the highest over the full study period except in region 4 for csr and gsfc they correspond to percentiles between 82 and 100 which may indicate that the data have witnessed a sharp break in the mean and slope possibly provoked by a potential recharge event for further inspection we analyzed the temporal variation of the twscsr twsgsfc twsjpl twsavg and their respective gws estimates over the oer ten fig 3a h each of the tws and gws time series was tested for trend and three trend lines were reported on each of the subplots the first line in dots represents the overall trend of the water storage considering the whole study period 09 2002 08 2020 the other two lines represent the tendency before and after 2008 2009 detected as a significant change point in tws of all solutions fig 2 the full time series of the tws and gws show completely different trends depending on solutions while the tws fig 3a c e and g demonstrates a significant decreasing tendency for all four tws time series with rates of 0 15 0 07 cm yr 1 csr 0 15 0 11 cm yr 1 gsfc 0 28 0 11 cm yr 1 jpl and 0 15 0 09 cm yr 1 avg the gws fig 3b d f and h appeared to be increasing or near steady over the studied period the rising tendency was statistically significant only for gwscsr 0 1 0 05 cm yr 1 however blindly interpreting the trend slope values can be misleading particularly for the gws given its inconsistency with the decline in gwl records reported in several studies ahmed et al 2021 hssaisoune et al 2020 ouassanouan et al 2022 rafik et al 2021 thus neither the positive trends nor those seeming near steady should be directly considered as indicators of gaining in water storage or sustainability of the water table different factors can be the source of the tendency appearing as positive firstly the inadequacy of the soil moisture data with overly estimated magnitudes can cause exaggerated subtraction of water quantities from the tws this can lead to gws time series with unrealistic temporal patterns secondly trend rates were necessarily influenced by the significant change in the mean of the gws after 2008 that could have a role in stretching the trend lines upwards resulting in apparent wetting patterns overall the different solutions seemed to be wetter in the second half of the study period than in the first one except for gsfc which exhibited a small drying slope the cumulative water storage deficit consistently increased in 2008 onwards due to the frequent occurrence of above normal months fig 3i and j as we split the reference period at the change point we note that the gws from most solutions was actually declining during the two sub periods 2002 2007 and 2008 2020 overall since 2002 the study region underwent a significant depletion according to all tws time series this depletion could have been stronger if it was not for the sudden rise in the tws that concurred with the change point in 2008 2009 the latter consists of a potential recharge event of the groundwater storage which is clearly captured by the piezometer observations fig 4 following the same approach as for the gws we note that the terrestrial water reservoirs were subject to intermittent depletion episodes of relatively stronger magnitudes during the 2002 2008 period a statistically significant decrease was observed for twscsr 0 31 0 22 cm yr 1 twsgsfc 0 73 0 29 cm yr 1 twsjpl 0 89 0 2 cm yr 1 and twsavg 0 57 0 22 cm yr 1 that was ruptured thanks to the potential recharge event if the declining tendency continued at the same rate the tws peak in 2008 2009 would have been 1 39 2 37 cm csr 2 63 4 18 cm gsfc 3 57 3 85 cm jpl and 2 48 3 03 cm avg instead of 3 27 cm 11 17 cm 4 14 cm and 6 19 cm respectively however even with the water levels being temporarily remedied the depletion resumed as strong as it was before the breakpoint the median decreasing rates of the second period after 2008 2009 were also statistically significant with the magnitudes obtained by the jpl 1 03 0 11 solution being greater than those obtained based on the csr 0 31 0 1 cm yr 1 gsfc 0 66 0 14 cm yr 1 and avg 0 68 0 1 cm yr 1 solutions 3 2 grace versus groundwater level as demonstrated earlier different inferences can be drawn about the temporal variation of the tws and gws as we use different grace solutions thus the use of one solution over the other or even the average of various solutions should be done with care to avoid misleading conclusions nevertheless there is a necessity for grace evaluation against the in situ records to appropriately select the data that best match the temporal patterns of the gwl in this section we examined the relationship between the standardized gwl and three grace mascon solutions csr gsfc and jpl in addition to their ensemble mean time series avg fig 4 employing the scc and rmse metrics it should be noted that because of the abundance of missing data particularly between 2002 and 2006 the analysis was done in two parts we used the full time series 2002 2017 in the first one while in the second one only the segment with the most consistent data 2007 2017 was considered we note that the grace solutions performed differently with reference to the gwl table 1 overall the tws time series provided by the gsfc and avg seemed to better capture the gwl temporal patterns compared to those provided by the csr and jpl according to scc and rmse indicators twsavg showed better agreement to the gwl changes with an overall scc rmse of 0 61 0 88 followed by twsgsfc with 0 58 0 89 furthermore the relationship between the two data sources was stronger in the second part of the time series with the preeminence of twsavg scc 0 79 and rmse 0 79 and twsgsfc scc 0 71 and rmse 0 77 over the rest of the solutions the correlation coefficients obtained here lay within the same range as what was reported in several regions over the world bhanja et al 2016 hasan 2019 xie et al 2018 this highlights grace s significance for groundwater monitoring and modeling however one should be careful when choosing the grace solution and soil moisture data to be used for the water balance equation resolution our findings suggest that in some cases the tws can match the gwl fluctuations well better than the gws it exhibited greater correlation coefficients and lower rmses by an average of 0 2 0 5 and 0 1 0 3 points respectively this can be partly attributed as mentioned earlier to the inadequacy of the model based soil moisture estimates for the studied context previous studies employed soil moisture from the global land data assimilation system gldas model and found gws tendencies that were similar to what was reported here for surfex ahmed et al 2021 milewski et al 2020 3 3 grace sca and rainfall interaction to emphasize the interaction between surface water intakes and tws anomalies we investigated the changes in rainfall and sca we observe that the peaks captured by grace in 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 correspond to remarkably wet conditions fig 5a 130 mm yr 1 and 95 mm yr 1 above the long term rainfall average were registered in 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 respectively both years were among the wettest all over the reference period as they belong to the 10th decile 2008 2009 prank 97 was the second most wet year on record since the 1970 s and 2014 2015 was the fourth with a prank of 92 their precedence was widespread over most of the study region particularly 2008 2009 according to the persiann cdr product fig 5b the same year occupied ranks from the 65th to the 96th being above the 80th 90th rank over 75 25 of oer ten the ranking of 2014 2015 on the other hand was less spatially prominent with prank values below 85 at 75 of the grid cells additionally fig 6 shows that during the same years the mountainous region received the snow for longer periods and over larger extents in almost 50 of the snowy season the elevations above 1000 m a s l were covered at 9 68 and 10 53 in 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 respectively notably 2008 2009 q75 22 had more snow days of large extents than any other year including 2014 2015 q75 17 similar patterns can be deduced when analyzing the three rainfall indices nwd ncwd and mcwd calculated using daily measurements with six different thresholds for wet day definition fig 7a c we note that the two tws peaks can be associated with the number of wet days and the frequency and length of the wet spells the peaks seemed to take place under a large number of wet days especially when they occur consecutively the corresponding years can be clearly distinguished among the period 2002 2015 particularly 2008 2009 this holds true for most rainfall thresholds but with a larger extent at 1 mm d 1 under this threshold 80 19 and 60 15 wet days cwd were recorded in 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 respectively the maximum length of the wet spells was 7 2008 2009 and 9 2014 2015 consecutive days with median lengths of 3 days in 2008 2009 and 2 days in 2014 2015 the above mentioned observations may indicate that precipitation can be a potential contributor to the relative enhancement of terrestrial water storage over the oer ten this is in line with the findings of isotopic studies that examined the interaction between surface and groundwater in oum er rbia and tensift river basins bouchaou et al 2009 bouimouass et al 2020 n da et al 2016 the authors agreed on the major role that rainfall and snowmelt play in recharging the underlying aquifers however one may wonder about the nature of this contribution is it related to the total amount of water produced by rainfall and snowmelt for a certain period or to the daily temporal distribution of these totals for further investigation the relationship of the tws time series versus sca metrics and rainfall indices were graphically interpreted fig 8a and statistically explored based on the spearman correlation coefficient fig 8b and c only the twsavg and twsgsfc were considered here given their better agreement with the gwl observations compared to the twsjpl twscsr gwsgsfc gwsjpl and gwscsr estimates the twsavg and twsgsfc exhibited a clear seasonality over the studied period fig 8a they took lower values in the late summer and maximum values frequently occurred in the late winter and early spring generally the tws peaks seemed to be shifted compared to the observed peaks in precipitation this suggests that the rise in tws in the spring can be a kind of response to precipitation feeding the terrestrial water reservoirs during the wet period november april this observation is further supported by the correlation coefficients reported in fig 8b and c the results show that the tws poorly correlates with the raw sca and rainfall total data for zero month lag the sccs from twsavg twsgsfc were on average 0 55 0 4 for sca metrics and 0 33 0 26 for the total rainfall the correlation became stronger as the time lag is increased to reach a maximum at a specific value depending on variables the three snow metrics max avg and med sca agreed on a maximum correlation at 1 month of lag with a slight precedence of the avg sca and max sca over the med sca the lag can be relatively higher when the snow cover is abundant the tws peaks during 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 for instance respectively occurred in march and april fig 8a they were about two to three months behind the snow peak january and generally dephased by one to two months compared to the peak february of the tws interannual average the monthly rainfall on the other hand showed the highest agreement with the twsavg and twsgsfc after 1 2 months of lag similar phase shifts were found for rainfall in tropical and subtropical african regions ahmed et al 2011 humphrey et al 2016 the reported shifts were explained by the decay in water mass storage primarily caused by delayed water movements within the soil profile ahmed et al 2011 the average and total rainfall have been widely used to study the interaction between surface water intakes and grace monthly patterns ahmed et al 2021 2011 asoka et al 2017 humphrey et al 2016 rodell et al 2018 xie et al 2018 either by trendline comparison or correlation analysis aggregated rainfall was found to significantly modulate the terrestrial water storage asoka et al 2017 humphrey et al 2016 xie et al 2018 here we found that the indices describing the rainfall distribution have a relatively stronger relationship with the tws time series compared to the monthly totals this was mainly true for the nwd and mcwd as they respectively exhibited correlation coefficients around 0 62 0 53 and 0 59 0 54 our results suggest that the frequency of wet days and the length of the wet spells can have more to say in the replenishment process of aquifers than the total and average monthly rainfall this can be explained by the fact that abundant wet days assure continuous water supply to the soil mainly when they occur consecutively this also can allow less activation of the evapotranspiration process given the shortage of direct solar energy which can give more chance for the infiltrated water to percolate deeper and amply contribute to the groundwater flow 4 conclusions in this study we examined the terrestrial water variation as provided by the grace gravity anomalies over morocco three mascon solutions jpl csr and gsfc and their ensemble average avg were analyzed using change point and trend tests additionally spearman correlation coefficient and root mean square error were employed to assess the grace estimates correspondence with the gwl moreover the analysis of grace data with climate variables was conducted to understand how the temporal changes in sca and rainfall can explain the terrestrial water monthly patterns considering multiple time lags the trend analysis conducted using the seasonal mann kendall test and sen slope estimator revealed different terrestrial water tendencies there was a spatial predominance of depletion patterns followed by small magnitude wetting slopes however the presence of significant change points within the time series seemed to have relatively masked the actual situation in the northern region for instance the significant breakpoint identified in 2008 which corresponds to a remarkable natural groundwater recharge event relatively caused a dampening of the overall depletion rate the long term trend slopes were relatively weaker between 0 28 0 11 cm yr 1 and 0 15 0 07 cm yr 1 compared to those calculated when the time series were split at the change point our analysis focused on oer ten showed that the declining rates between 1 03 0 11 cm yr 1 and 0 31 0 1 cm yr 1 were relatively stronger before and after the change point this suggests that since 2002 the region underwent intermittent depletion episodes interrupted by a temporary rise of the water table fed by surface water generally the terrestrial water storage patterns were found to be linked with the changes in sca and rainfall our results indicated that the twsavg and twsgsfc the best to describe the gwl temporal patterns showed the highest correlations with the sca metrics and rainfall indices after 1 3 months of lag in particular the number of wet days and the length of consecutive wet days exhibited relatively better correlations compared to the monthly totals these findings suggest that in addition to the sca and total rainfall more interest should be given to the rainfall distribution when studying the underlying sources of the groundwater natural recharge credit authorship contribution statement hamza ouatiki conceptualization formal analysis software

7940,study region morocco northwestern africa study focus since april 2002 the gravity recovery and climate experiment grace mission have opened new pathways for hydrologists to monitor the changes in terrestrial total water storage tws here the center for space research csr goddard space flight center gsfc jet propulsion laboratory jpl and the average avg grace mascon solutions were used to examine the changes in tws and groundwater storages gws in morocco with an emphasis on natural replenishment events and their link to snow cover area sca and rainfall variability new hydrological insights for the region the results showed that grace tws from avg twsavg and gsfc twsgsfc can fairly describe the temporal patterns of the groundwater level gwl moreover during 2002 2020 the tws underwent a strong depletion relatively masked by natural recharge events this was revealed as we identified two intermittent depletion episodes with statistically significant rates 1 03 0 11 to 0 31 0 1 cm yr 1 higher than those obtained for the long term trend lines 0 28 0 11 to 0 15 0 07 cm yr 1 the tws appeared to be strongly linked with the sca metrics and rainfall indices with 1 3 months of lag our findings suggest that the rainfall distribution can be more insightful about changes in groundwater levels compared to the rainfall monthly totals graphical abstract ga1 keywords grace groundwater depletion changepoint natural recharge grace versus climate data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction surface water is often considered as the primary source intended to satisfy the demand of different sectors in agriculture one of the main water consumers in morocco crop irrigation from dam allocations and rainfall are preferable given their cost effective use compared to groundwater however the decreasing tendencies in rainfall totals combined with the irregular distribution of event occurrence in recent decades filahi et al 2015 ipcc 2014 ouatiki et al 2019 have led to more reliance on groundwater population growth in its turn escalated this reliance as more wells were drilled to meet the growing water demand for domestic usage bouchaou et al 2009 thus an increase in pumping has provoked a serious depletion in the water table since the 1990 s drops of 5 65 m in the groundwater level were registered between 1990 and 2019 in various regions in morocco bahir et al 2021 hssaisoune et al 2020 ouassanouan et al 2022 this situation is more likely to worsen as future scenarios suggest further decline and irregularity in surface water supplies filahi et al 2017 marchane et al 2021 nevertheless the long term depletion is often palliated by continuous yet low natural recharge the latter is mainly ensured by surface water infiltration through river beds irrigation and precipitation received over the lowlands and the mountainous regions bouchaou et al 2009 bouimouass et al 2020 fakir et al 2021 still the imbalance between the extraction and natural recharge rates makes it difficult to reach sustainability hssaisoune et al 2020 in view of the above mentioned challenges understanding the variability of groundwater storage is essential for sustainable management and optimal planning of water resources this is critical information for planning socio economic development and environmental sustainability especially in countries with a gdp highly dependent on agricultural yields such as morocco despite the major role groundwater resources play on many levels their monitoring remains inconsistent and limited in both temporal and spatial scales the shortage in piezometers and controlled wells and thus the lack of relevant and temporally continuous observations are the main limiting factors remote sensing observations collected by multiple satellite based sensors offer a promising venue to complement in situ data various spatial missions freely provide global and gridded estimates of different components of the hydrologic cycle recent advances have been made in snow cover hall and riggs 2016 and soil moisture retrievals entekhabi et al 2010 employing data from optical and microwave sensors the equivalent water thickness of these water cycle components in addition to groundwater are summed up by the grace and its follow on grace fo mission in what so called total water storage anomalies tapley et al 2019 the mission jointly launched by nasa and german dlr space agencies acquire changes in gravity fields the latter are generally driven by water mass redistribution on top and beneath the earth s surface this opened huge opportunities for studying the water stored in reservoirs and land atmosphere fluxes eicker et al 2020 in the last two decades grace was considered in various water related applications asoka et al 2017 döll et al 2014 ferreira et al 2020 xiao et al 2015 many studies have investigated its robustness against the groundwater level observations the water storage estimates were found to agree very well with the in situ measurements in different regions worldwide particularly the mascon solutions showed the best match bhanja et al 2018 neves et al 2020 shen et al 2015 xie et al 2018 noteworthy good agreement was also reported for groundwater storage determined using spherical harmonic solutions ferreira et al 2020 additionally the grace data were combined with outputs from hydrologic and land surface models to strengthen the accuracy of the water balance estimation gleason et al 2018 mehrnegar et al 2020 they have proved adequate to improve surface soil moisture estimation over densely vegetated areas where the passive microwave estimates are susceptible to uncertainties and evapotranspiration mapping in water limited regions sadeghi et al 2020 shen et al 2017 grace was used to map the ice mass loss estimates over glaciers doumbia et al 2020 jin et al 2017 and quantify snow accumulation over high latitudes adopting a mass balance approach behrangi et al 2018 niu et al 2007 more frequently the grace time series were used to analyze the long term temporal changes in groundwater storage and its susceptibility to climate variability ahmed 2020 ahmed et al 2014 bhanja et al 2018 hasan et al 2019 leblanc et al 2011 2009 shen et al 2015 xie et al 2018 in morocco two studies explored the patterns of groundwater using grace measurements ahmed et al 2021 milewski et al 2020 the authors compared the trend lines slopes of rainfall and grace based groundwater anomalies to explain the sustainability of the groundwater resources in this study we aim at assessing the temporal variability of terrestrial water storage over morocco with an emphasis on its link to rainfall and snow cover patterns based on trend test and correlation analysis we shed light on the interaction between climate variability and terrestrial water storage and how surface water intakes can relatively mask the ongoing depletion 2 methods 2 1 study area the study covers morocco in northwestern africa it was firstly held over the whole territory subdivided into four subregions region 1 4 and then focused on an area of smaller scale fig 1 the latter include the oum er rbia oer and tensift ten river basins grouped together oer ten hereafter occupying a surface of approximately 64 000 km² the region is bordered from the east by the atlas mountain chain culminating at 4124 m a s l that holds the credit for most of the water supplying the surrounding lowlands boudhar et al 2011 ouatiki et al 2020 the water stored in aquifers deep confined and shallow unconfined and dams support the allocation for drinking industrial and agricultural activities 325 800 ha of irrigated lands and electricity production through hydropower plants the oer ten is mainly influenced by the north atlantic oscillation knippertz et al 2003 it is dominated by semi arid conditions that become relatively humid as we move towards high elevations the rainfall is strongly variable over space and time hadri et al 2021 ouatiki et al 2019 its annual cycle is characterized by a wet period from november to april and a dry period from jun to september with the highest and lowest totals usually recorded during the winter december january and february and summer months june july and august respectively above 1000 m a s l precipitation occurs as snow between mid november and mid april and completely vanishes during the hot summer boudhar et al 2020 2016 2 2 rainfall daily rainfall records from ground rain gauges situated within the oer and ten river basins were used in this study with a temporal coverage of 39 hydrologic years 09 1976 08 2015 the data were provided by the oum er rbia and tensift hydraulic agencies abhoer and abht respectively and the regional office for agricultural development of tadla ormvat the daily observations were processed to calculate four rainfall indices at monthly and annual time scales according to the climate change indices list provided by the expert team on climate change detection and indices peterson et al 2001 1 rainfall the total rainfall in mm per month year 2 nwd the count in days of wet days per month year a day is considered as wet when the total rainfall exceeds a certain threshold in the present study six different thresholds 0 1 mm 1 mm 2 mm 3 mm 4 mm and 5 mm were tested to define a wet day 3 ncwd the count in days of wet spells with at least 2 consecutive wet days 4 mcwd the length in days of the wet spells exhibiting the maximum consecutive wet days in addition to the in situ observations gridded satellite rainfall estimates from the precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks climate data record persiann cdr product were employed ashouri et al 2015 the final persiann cdr data is provided as quasi global 60 s to 60 n rainfall estimates at 0 25 x 0 25 spatial resolution every 3 h the product was chosen considering the good performance it showed when evaluated against rain gauges within the study region ouatiki et al 2022 in review although slightly surpassed by the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg persiann cdr was preferred given its availability for a period from 1983 to the present long enough to allow relevant climatological analysis we must highlight that the term year hereafter refers to the hydrologic year from september to august e g 01 09 2002 31 08 2003 2002 2003 2 3 snow cover area snow depth measurement stations are relatively scarce over the oer ten s mountainous region 20 000 km2 above 1000 m a s l thus sca retrieved from terra modis satellite data mod10a1 is used in this study as an alternative for snow in situ measurements hall and riggs 2016 mod10a1 product provides daily observations spatially gridded at 500 m from 2000 to the present moreover to deal with the missing values and cloud coverage effect the sca daily maps were processed adopting a method developed for the moroccan atlas mountain range marchane et al 2015 using the corrected mod10a1 data time series of snow cover area in percentage scap were built relative to the total area of the oer ten s mountainous region thus three metrics maximum median and average of the daily scap were derived for each month and year of the period 2000 2015 2 4 soil moisture the soil moisture sm estimates were obtained at 100 cm depth via the surfex in french surface externalisée surface modeling platform developed by météo france albergel et al 2019 the platform includes the isba land surface model implemented with the trip oki and sud 1998 hydrologic model through a global land data assimilation system ldas monde albergel et al 2017 the latter permits the incorporation of surface soil moisture sm and leaf area index satellite observations to constrain the near surface variables including sm simulated by the isba trip coupled model more information can be found on surfex official website http www umr cnrm fr surfex last access august 2021 2 5 groundwater level gwl from 44 piezometers were delivered by the abhoer and abht after the data quality control 10 piezometer records that present the least amount of missing data were selected the best temporal overlap that allowed to maximize the number of retained piezometers was found for the period 2002 2017 the available piezometers are distributed over the whole study region and capture the majority of the aquifers average monthly gwl time series were calculated for oer ten in this study given the lack of specific yield estimates in addition to the strong heterogeneity of the aquifer systems over the study region we did not consider the groundwater storage from in situ observations instead we have standardized the groundwater level time series of each well by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation before computing the regional groundwater level average bloomfield and marchant 2013 zhao et al 2017 this approach adopted by ahmed et al 2021 over the same context can maintain information about the temporal patterns the main focus here of the groundwater level 2 6 surface water bodies in the oer ten basin surface water is mostly represented through anthropogenic hydraulic infrastructures these facilities are jointly managed and regulated by the abhoer and the national office of electricity and drinking water onee to support the water needs for drinking and socioeconomic activities the monthly storage time series of the two largest dams bin el ouidane and al massira were considered in this study to account for the surface water effect on grace tws estimates the data were obtained from the abhoer for the period between 2002 and 2017 2 7 grace mission grace april 2002 june 2017 and grace fo june 2018 present jointly launched by nasa and dlr map the earth s monthly gravity changes provoked by mass redistribution above and below the earth s surface tapley et al 2019 2004 their end user data are provided as equivalent water thickness anomalies and corrected for most geophysical distortions they are available as solutions from various centers csr german research centre for geosciences gfz jpl and gsfc in spherical harmonics and or mascons mass concentration blocks versions the mascons are newly released as an alternative for solving the gravity signals and have advantages over spherical harmonics they are less subject to leakage errors and show better land ocean signals separation landerer and cooley 2021 luthcke et al 2013 watkins et al 2015 several studies indicated the precedence of mascon solutions over the harmonic in representing the groundwater variations bhanja et al 2018 2016 neves et al 2020 xie et al 2018 the earth s monthly terrestrial tws anomalies from jpl csr and gsfc grace mascon solutions were used in this work for the period 2002 2020 the data are available at different spatial samplings with a native resolution of about 3 x3 the three solutions were averaged to obtain a mean tws time series the errors associated with the average tws were computed as the monthly standard deviation of the three solutions ahmed and wiese 2019 due to measures taken for battery saving the tws time series contain some missing months the latter were filled by using a three month moving average window however when more than two successive months were missing the gaps were omitted during all of the analyses considered in this study the tws sums the water masses contained in the different terrestrial reservoirs surface water bodies swb snow water equivalent swe sm gws canopy ca shen et al 2015 employing the mass balance approach the changes in the gws can be estimated as 1 gws tws swb swe sm ca one or more of the equation terms swb swe sm or ca can be omitted according to their significance to the long term variations in the tws shen et al 2015 here the gws was derived from the tws based on swb and sm the errors associated with the gws data were computed as the root sum of squares of the errors associated with each of the terms considered in the gws estimation eq 2 2 σ gws σ tws σ sm σ swb where σ gws is the error in grace based gws σ tws grace tws error σ sm monthly standard deviation from surfex soil moistures estimates and σ swb is the monthly standard deviation from surface water reservoirs 2 8 statistical indices and metrics the tws and gws time series were tested for monotonic trends using the seasonal mann kendall test kendall 1938 mann 1945 the magnitude of the trend was quantified based on the theil sen slope estimator sen 1968 theil 1950 to consider the impact of data inhomogeneity on the estimated trend slopes a predefined function was used to detect the presence of potential change points in the tws time series the function relies on the work done by lavielle 2005 and killick et al 2012 to identify the location where the mean and slope of the time series significantly change it consecutively divides the time series into two sections and computes an estimate of the mean of each section the change point is identified at the location where deviation of the sum of the residual error reaches a minimum value the spearman rank scc eq 3 correlation coefficient and root mean square error rmse eq 4 were used to examine how well grace data follow the temporal patterns of the gwl observations the scc was also adopted to assess the linear relationship of grace versus the sca metrics and rainfall indices all the variables considered in this analysis were standardized the same way as for the gwl section 2 5 also a smoothing filter was applied to the gwl sca metrics and rainfall indices using the savitzky golay filter 3 scc i i n r x i r x r y i r y i 1 n r x i r x 2 i 1 n r y i r y 2 4 rmse i 1 n x i y i 2 n where x i and y i are the values of x variable and y variable in the time i respectively r x i and r y i are the rank of the x variable and y variable values respectively with mean values of r x and r y n is the number of records 3 results and discussion 3 1 water storage temporal variability according to the seasonal mann kendall and theil sen slope results the three studied grace solutions csr gsfc and jpl present different behaviors in terms of long term trend directions and magnitudes fig 2a b and c according to csr region 3 and 4 experienced spatially predominant rising trends in tws fig 2a the wetting trend over the southern regions appeared to be more prominent and statistically significant compared to region 1 in the latter the positive slopes are mostly found in areas near the atlantic coastline particularly in the far northeast of the country the drying rates on the other hand were observed in some parts of region 2 but mainly in the far western side of region 1 with fewer isolated cases that were statistically significant at the 0 05 level contrasted observations can be drawn using the gsfc solution fig 2b while the upward trends were spatially limited in the west of region 1 and east of region 3 the depletion patterns were widespread all over the country the trends were statistically significant in the majority of cases region 3 and region 4 but particularly strong in region 2 the tws trends from jpl show roughly similar patterns as those depicted by gsfc but with less spatial details statistically significant decreasing tendencies were found in the majority of region 2 in the south of region 4 and with relatively higher rates in the eastern part of region 1 increasing slopes were widespread in region 3 and of less extent in region 1 mostly of small amplitudes regional and global trend maps are often used to assess the long term tendencies and emphasize the underlying factors of wetting and drying conditions over large scales hasan 2019 milewski et al 2020 rodell et al 2018 tapley et al 2019 however sometimes these tendencies can be unreal and temporarily caused by natural patterns or remarkable wetting events ahmed et al 2021 rodell et al 2018 sharma et al 2016 consequently one could falsely draw conclusions that do not describe the real situation and give confidence about the sustainability of the groundwater when it is actually in depletion numerous authors reported that the presence of significant breaks in time series can strongly influence the long term trend lines by causing slope dampening and signs reversal militino et al 2020 sharma et al 2016 given that we investigated the presence of change points in tws over morocco fig 2g h and i multiple change points were detected in twscsr six twsgsfc five and twsjpl six anomalies fig 2g h and i the temporal position of the change points differs depending on solutions and regions the ones detected in csr showed a certain spatial variability with five different years were found in region 1 2008 2009 2010 2014 and 2015 three in region 2 2009 2014 and 2015 and region 3 2009 2014 and 2015 and two 2007 and 2008 in region 4 in the gsfc they seemed relatively spatially consistent as two main change points were widespread 2008 detected in region 1 and 2012 in region 2 3 and 4 in addition to three others 2006 2010 and 2014 scattered in small areas according to jpl four change years were detected in region 1 2008 2009 2010 and 2015 two in region 2 2009 and 2015 and region 3 2007 and 2015 and three in region 4 2006 2007 and 2010 moreover the tws peaks near the detected change points are generally among the highest over the full study period except in region 4 for csr and gsfc they correspond to percentiles between 82 and 100 which may indicate that the data have witnessed a sharp break in the mean and slope possibly provoked by a potential recharge event for further inspection we analyzed the temporal variation of the twscsr twsgsfc twsjpl twsavg and their respective gws estimates over the oer ten fig 3a h each of the tws and gws time series was tested for trend and three trend lines were reported on each of the subplots the first line in dots represents the overall trend of the water storage considering the whole study period 09 2002 08 2020 the other two lines represent the tendency before and after 2008 2009 detected as a significant change point in tws of all solutions fig 2 the full time series of the tws and gws show completely different trends depending on solutions while the tws fig 3a c e and g demonstrates a significant decreasing tendency for all four tws time series with rates of 0 15 0 07 cm yr 1 csr 0 15 0 11 cm yr 1 gsfc 0 28 0 11 cm yr 1 jpl and 0 15 0 09 cm yr 1 avg the gws fig 3b d f and h appeared to be increasing or near steady over the studied period the rising tendency was statistically significant only for gwscsr 0 1 0 05 cm yr 1 however blindly interpreting the trend slope values can be misleading particularly for the gws given its inconsistency with the decline in gwl records reported in several studies ahmed et al 2021 hssaisoune et al 2020 ouassanouan et al 2022 rafik et al 2021 thus neither the positive trends nor those seeming near steady should be directly considered as indicators of gaining in water storage or sustainability of the water table different factors can be the source of the tendency appearing as positive firstly the inadequacy of the soil moisture data with overly estimated magnitudes can cause exaggerated subtraction of water quantities from the tws this can lead to gws time series with unrealistic temporal patterns secondly trend rates were necessarily influenced by the significant change in the mean of the gws after 2008 that could have a role in stretching the trend lines upwards resulting in apparent wetting patterns overall the different solutions seemed to be wetter in the second half of the study period than in the first one except for gsfc which exhibited a small drying slope the cumulative water storage deficit consistently increased in 2008 onwards due to the frequent occurrence of above normal months fig 3i and j as we split the reference period at the change point we note that the gws from most solutions was actually declining during the two sub periods 2002 2007 and 2008 2020 overall since 2002 the study region underwent a significant depletion according to all tws time series this depletion could have been stronger if it was not for the sudden rise in the tws that concurred with the change point in 2008 2009 the latter consists of a potential recharge event of the groundwater storage which is clearly captured by the piezometer observations fig 4 following the same approach as for the gws we note that the terrestrial water reservoirs were subject to intermittent depletion episodes of relatively stronger magnitudes during the 2002 2008 period a statistically significant decrease was observed for twscsr 0 31 0 22 cm yr 1 twsgsfc 0 73 0 29 cm yr 1 twsjpl 0 89 0 2 cm yr 1 and twsavg 0 57 0 22 cm yr 1 that was ruptured thanks to the potential recharge event if the declining tendency continued at the same rate the tws peak in 2008 2009 would have been 1 39 2 37 cm csr 2 63 4 18 cm gsfc 3 57 3 85 cm jpl and 2 48 3 03 cm avg instead of 3 27 cm 11 17 cm 4 14 cm and 6 19 cm respectively however even with the water levels being temporarily remedied the depletion resumed as strong as it was before the breakpoint the median decreasing rates of the second period after 2008 2009 were also statistically significant with the magnitudes obtained by the jpl 1 03 0 11 solution being greater than those obtained based on the csr 0 31 0 1 cm yr 1 gsfc 0 66 0 14 cm yr 1 and avg 0 68 0 1 cm yr 1 solutions 3 2 grace versus groundwater level as demonstrated earlier different inferences can be drawn about the temporal variation of the tws and gws as we use different grace solutions thus the use of one solution over the other or even the average of various solutions should be done with care to avoid misleading conclusions nevertheless there is a necessity for grace evaluation against the in situ records to appropriately select the data that best match the temporal patterns of the gwl in this section we examined the relationship between the standardized gwl and three grace mascon solutions csr gsfc and jpl in addition to their ensemble mean time series avg fig 4 employing the scc and rmse metrics it should be noted that because of the abundance of missing data particularly between 2002 and 2006 the analysis was done in two parts we used the full time series 2002 2017 in the first one while in the second one only the segment with the most consistent data 2007 2017 was considered we note that the grace solutions performed differently with reference to the gwl table 1 overall the tws time series provided by the gsfc and avg seemed to better capture the gwl temporal patterns compared to those provided by the csr and jpl according to scc and rmse indicators twsavg showed better agreement to the gwl changes with an overall scc rmse of 0 61 0 88 followed by twsgsfc with 0 58 0 89 furthermore the relationship between the two data sources was stronger in the second part of the time series with the preeminence of twsavg scc 0 79 and rmse 0 79 and twsgsfc scc 0 71 and rmse 0 77 over the rest of the solutions the correlation coefficients obtained here lay within the same range as what was reported in several regions over the world bhanja et al 2016 hasan 2019 xie et al 2018 this highlights grace s significance for groundwater monitoring and modeling however one should be careful when choosing the grace solution and soil moisture data to be used for the water balance equation resolution our findings suggest that in some cases the tws can match the gwl fluctuations well better than the gws it exhibited greater correlation coefficients and lower rmses by an average of 0 2 0 5 and 0 1 0 3 points respectively this can be partly attributed as mentioned earlier to the inadequacy of the model based soil moisture estimates for the studied context previous studies employed soil moisture from the global land data assimilation system gldas model and found gws tendencies that were similar to what was reported here for surfex ahmed et al 2021 milewski et al 2020 3 3 grace sca and rainfall interaction to emphasize the interaction between surface water intakes and tws anomalies we investigated the changes in rainfall and sca we observe that the peaks captured by grace in 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 correspond to remarkably wet conditions fig 5a 130 mm yr 1 and 95 mm yr 1 above the long term rainfall average were registered in 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 respectively both years were among the wettest all over the reference period as they belong to the 10th decile 2008 2009 prank 97 was the second most wet year on record since the 1970 s and 2014 2015 was the fourth with a prank of 92 their precedence was widespread over most of the study region particularly 2008 2009 according to the persiann cdr product fig 5b the same year occupied ranks from the 65th to the 96th being above the 80th 90th rank over 75 25 of oer ten the ranking of 2014 2015 on the other hand was less spatially prominent with prank values below 85 at 75 of the grid cells additionally fig 6 shows that during the same years the mountainous region received the snow for longer periods and over larger extents in almost 50 of the snowy season the elevations above 1000 m a s l were covered at 9 68 and 10 53 in 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 respectively notably 2008 2009 q75 22 had more snow days of large extents than any other year including 2014 2015 q75 17 similar patterns can be deduced when analyzing the three rainfall indices nwd ncwd and mcwd calculated using daily measurements with six different thresholds for wet day definition fig 7a c we note that the two tws peaks can be associated with the number of wet days and the frequency and length of the wet spells the peaks seemed to take place under a large number of wet days especially when they occur consecutively the corresponding years can be clearly distinguished among the period 2002 2015 particularly 2008 2009 this holds true for most rainfall thresholds but with a larger extent at 1 mm d 1 under this threshold 80 19 and 60 15 wet days cwd were recorded in 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 respectively the maximum length of the wet spells was 7 2008 2009 and 9 2014 2015 consecutive days with median lengths of 3 days in 2008 2009 and 2 days in 2014 2015 the above mentioned observations may indicate that precipitation can be a potential contributor to the relative enhancement of terrestrial water storage over the oer ten this is in line with the findings of isotopic studies that examined the interaction between surface and groundwater in oum er rbia and tensift river basins bouchaou et al 2009 bouimouass et al 2020 n da et al 2016 the authors agreed on the major role that rainfall and snowmelt play in recharging the underlying aquifers however one may wonder about the nature of this contribution is it related to the total amount of water produced by rainfall and snowmelt for a certain period or to the daily temporal distribution of these totals for further investigation the relationship of the tws time series versus sca metrics and rainfall indices were graphically interpreted fig 8a and statistically explored based on the spearman correlation coefficient fig 8b and c only the twsavg and twsgsfc were considered here given their better agreement with the gwl observations compared to the twsjpl twscsr gwsgsfc gwsjpl and gwscsr estimates the twsavg and twsgsfc exhibited a clear seasonality over the studied period fig 8a they took lower values in the late summer and maximum values frequently occurred in the late winter and early spring generally the tws peaks seemed to be shifted compared to the observed peaks in precipitation this suggests that the rise in tws in the spring can be a kind of response to precipitation feeding the terrestrial water reservoirs during the wet period november april this observation is further supported by the correlation coefficients reported in fig 8b and c the results show that the tws poorly correlates with the raw sca and rainfall total data for zero month lag the sccs from twsavg twsgsfc were on average 0 55 0 4 for sca metrics and 0 33 0 26 for the total rainfall the correlation became stronger as the time lag is increased to reach a maximum at a specific value depending on variables the three snow metrics max avg and med sca agreed on a maximum correlation at 1 month of lag with a slight precedence of the avg sca and max sca over the med sca the lag can be relatively higher when the snow cover is abundant the tws peaks during 2008 2009 and 2014 2015 for instance respectively occurred in march and april fig 8a they were about two to three months behind the snow peak january and generally dephased by one to two months compared to the peak february of the tws interannual average the monthly rainfall on the other hand showed the highest agreement with the twsavg and twsgsfc after 1 2 months of lag similar phase shifts were found for rainfall in tropical and subtropical african regions ahmed et al 2011 humphrey et al 2016 the reported shifts were explained by the decay in water mass storage primarily caused by delayed water movements within the soil profile ahmed et al 2011 the average and total rainfall have been widely used to study the interaction between surface water intakes and grace monthly patterns ahmed et al 2021 2011 asoka et al 2017 humphrey et al 2016 rodell et al 2018 xie et al 2018 either by trendline comparison or correlation analysis aggregated rainfall was found to significantly modulate the terrestrial water storage asoka et al 2017 humphrey et al 2016 xie et al 2018 here we found that the indices describing the rainfall distribution have a relatively stronger relationship with the tws time series compared to the monthly totals this was mainly true for the nwd and mcwd as they respectively exhibited correlation coefficients around 0 62 0 53 and 0 59 0 54 our results suggest that the frequency of wet days and the length of the wet spells can have more to say in the replenishment process of aquifers than the total and average monthly rainfall this can be explained by the fact that abundant wet days assure continuous water supply to the soil mainly when they occur consecutively this also can allow less activation of the evapotranspiration process given the shortage of direct solar energy which can give more chance for the infiltrated water to percolate deeper and amply contribute to the groundwater flow 4 conclusions in this study we examined the terrestrial water variation as provided by the grace gravity anomalies over morocco three mascon solutions jpl csr and gsfc and their ensemble average avg were analyzed using change point and trend tests additionally spearman correlation coefficient and root mean square error were employed to assess the grace estimates correspondence with the gwl moreover the analysis of grace data with climate variables was conducted to understand how the temporal changes in sca and rainfall can explain the terrestrial water monthly patterns considering multiple time lags the trend analysis conducted using the seasonal mann kendall test and sen slope estimator revealed different terrestrial water tendencies there was a spatial predominance of depletion patterns followed by small magnitude wetting slopes however the presence of significant change points within the time series seemed to have relatively masked the actual situation in the northern region for instance the significant breakpoint identified in 2008 which corresponds to a remarkable natural groundwater recharge event relatively caused a dampening of the overall depletion rate the long term trend slopes were relatively weaker between 0 28 0 11 cm yr 1 and 0 15 0 07 cm yr 1 compared to those calculated when the time series were split at the change point our analysis focused on oer ten showed that the declining rates between 1 03 0 11 cm yr 1 and 0 31 0 1 cm yr 1 were relatively stronger before and after the change point this suggests that since 2002 the region underwent intermittent depletion episodes interrupted by a temporary rise of the water table fed by surface water generally the terrestrial water storage patterns were found to be linked with the changes in sca and rainfall our results indicated that the twsavg and twsgsfc the best to describe the gwl temporal patterns showed the highest correlations with the sca metrics and rainfall indices after 1 3 months of lag in particular the number of wet days and the length of consecutive wet days exhibited relatively better correlations compared to the monthly totals these findings suggest that in addition to the sca and total rainfall more interest should be given to the rainfall distribution when studying the underlying sources of the groundwater natural recharge credit authorship contribution statement hamza ouatiki conceptualization formal analysis software

7941,study region the hulu catchment on northeast qinghai tibet plateau china study focus dew and hoarfrost dh are prominent components of the non precipitation water inputs in arid and semi arid regions but research into them is mostly neglected in alpine regions to understand the formation and variations of dh as well as whether dh has a significant impact on the water balance and ecosystem a field measurement experiment of dew was conducted in the hulu catchment meanwhile the amount duration and frequency of dh at different elevations in the hulu catchment from 2016 to 2020 were estimated using the penman equation new hydrological insights for the region dh was common weather phenomenon in the hulu catchment with small interannual and large monthly variations in amount duration and frequency dh showed significant seasonal pattern and elevation dependence which depending on the seasonal pattern and elevation dependence of meteorological factors the mean annual amount of dh ranged from 3 mm to 33 mm contributing 0 3 7 3 of precipitation indicating that dh was not a critical component of water balance nevertheless dh was ecologically important in replenishing surface soil water deficits and mitigating diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature protecting vegetation and microorganisms from water and temperature stress in alpine regions this study has important implications for understanding the energy transfer water cycle and ecosystem operation in alpine regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords dew hoarfrost alpine region penman equation seasonal pattern elevation dependence 1 introduction dew is the liquid water formed when supersaturated water vapor near the surface condenses on the surface of ground and objects with the surface temperature is equal to or lower than the dew point temperature agam and berliner 2006 beysens 2006 1995 jacobs et al 2002 1999 monteith 1957 the main difference of the formation between dew and hoarfrost is whether the dew point temperature is below 0 so hoarfrost is also considered to be a special form of dew dew and hoarfrost dh are generally considered to be prominent components of non precipitation water inputs chamizo et al 2021 kool et al 2021 gao et al 2020 kaseke et al 2017 kidron and temina 2017 uclés et al 2015 as well as important forms of energy transfer and water cycle near the surface ninari and berliner 2002 the formation and dissipation of dh is a crucial factor to maintain the operation of ecosystems particularly in arid and semi arid areas evans et al 2019 wang et al 2017c wierzchos et al 2012 jacobs et al 2002 kidron 1999 dew is a critical water source for surface plants and microorganisms in arid and semi arid areas such as deserts and adjacent areas with scarce precipitation zhuang et al 2021 florentin and agam 2017 jacobs et al 1999 many studies have shown that biological soil crusts in arid environments are maintained by dew mainly due to the higher frequency and more stable amount of dew compared to precipitation li et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 jia et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 therefore dew plays a role of wind prevention sand fixation and fix carbon dioxide indirectly chamizo et al 2021 ouyang and hu 2017 lange et al 1997 some studies also showed that dew can be directly consumed by small animals such as ants and snails shachak et al 2002 moffett 1985 while hoarfrost can protect vegetation to avoid and reduce the risk of frostbite groh et al 2018 although some studies have shown that dew adhering to the surface of crops may promote the development of fungi bacteria and pests which can breed diseases and have some side effects on agricultural production groh et al 2018 saab et al 2017 zhang and watson 1997 zuberer and kenerley 1993 dew can also promote seed germination improve seed germination and boost agricultural production hosseini et al 2020 zhuang and zhao 2015 gutterman 1997 in addition dew in the urban environment not only increases the surface water supply but also adheres to the surface of suspended particles moistening and settling them and thus purifying the air muskała et al 2015 takeuchi et al 2001 mulawa et al 1986 therefore the amount duration and frequency of dew in urban environment are also important indicators when assessing urban air quality ye et al 2018 2007 2006 gałek et al 2016 although dh plays a prominent role in regional water supplies and ecosystems it is difficult to measure it effectively due to the small amount of daily dh ninari and berliner 2002 malek et al 1999 as a result many researchers have been searching for effective methods of directly measuring dh direct methods of dew measurement include the duvdevani method kidron et al 2000 subramaniam and rao 1983 duvdevani 1947 the artificial condensation surface ye et al 2018 zhuang and zhao 2014 kidron 1998 the hiltner dew balance hanisch et al 2015 zangvil 1996 and the lysimeters of which lysimeters with different materials specifications and buried depths are the most commonly used method of dew measurement at present uclés et al 2015 2013 guo et al 2013 ninari and berliner 2002 measurement of dew has been controversial due to the large differences of the thermal and physical properties between the measuring equipment and the actual condensation surface which often leads to the overestimation of dew amount and is an important reason why the maximum daily dew in some areas far exceeds the theoretical values kidron et al 2021 kidron and kronenfeld 2020 it is well known that the formation of dh is a phase change process of water which is accompanied by the transformation of the latent heat flux agam and berliner 2006 beysens 2006 1995 in view of this it is a feasible and an internationally accepted method to estimate the formation and variations of dh by calculating latent heat flux madeira et al 2002 the commonly used methods to calculate the latent heat flux include the aerodynamic method jacobs et al 2008 the bowen ratio energy balance method breb zhuang and zhao 2017 kalthoff et al 2006 malek et al 1999 the eddy covariance technique ec wang et al 2019 florentin and agam 2017 hao et al 2012 moro et al 2007 and the penman equation groh et al 2018 uclés et al 2014 jacobs et al 2006 because there are uncertainties in the calculation of latent heat flux and the applicability of dh estimation based on the relationship between water phase transition and latent heat flux needs to be validated based on measured data most of the studies on measurement and estimation of dh are in arid and semi arid areas kidron and kronenfeld 2020 zhuang and zhao 2017 uclés et al 2014 jacobs et al 2002 1999 kidron et al 2000 malek et al 1999 however there are few studies on the formation and variations of dh in alpine regions and the contribution and role of dh in the surface water balance and ecosystem in alpine regions are not clear the climatic characteristics of the alpine regions are very different from those of the arid and semi arid regions and the humid regions where temperatures are low and heat and water exchanges are frequent han et al 2018 chen et al 2014 not many studies have shown that dh was also an important component of the surface water balance in alpine regions with the amount of dh was even exceeding that of arid and semi arid regions wang 2009 2012 de jong 2005 therefore research into the formation and variations of dh is of vital significance to understand the energy transfer water cycle and ecosystem operation in alpine regions accounting for more than 43 5 of the land area in china in the current study the hulu catchment on northeast qinghai tibet plateau was selected as the study area the main objectives of this study are 1 to understand the formation and variations characteristics of dh 2 to quantify the amount duration and frequency of dh 3 to analyze the effect of meteorological factors and elevation on dh formation and variations and 4 to explore the contribution and role of dh to surface water balance and ecosystem in alpine regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and meteorological factors observation this study was conducted at the hulu catchment 38 12 38 17 n 99 50 99 54 e in the qilian mountains on northeast qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 the hulu catchment covers an area of 23 km2 with elevations between 2960 m and 4820 m and it is a typical alpine catchment for observing and studying on the mountainous meteorology cryospheric hydrology and alpine ecosystem which operated and maintained by the qilian alpine ecology and hydrology research station qilian station northwest institute of eco environment and resources chinese academy of sciences han et al 2018 chen et al 2014 the climate type of the hulu catchment has the characteristics of both the alpine climate and the temperate continental climate between 2016 and 2020 the mean annual temperature of the hulu catchment was 1 0 c and the mean annual precipitation was 650 mm the temperature was the highest in august and the lowest in february and the precipitation was mainly concentrated in the warm season from may to october which accounting for 80 92 of the annual precipitation four observation sites represented by site a site b site c and site d respectively located at different elevations in the hulu catchment were used for dew and hoarfrost measurement and estimation fig 1c and the four observation sites were all equipped with a set of automatic weather stations aws with two heights of air temperature relative humidity wind speed measurement and other meteorological factors measurement based on a cryosphere hydrology observation system established in 2008 chen et al 2014 the location information of each observation site and the meteorological factors observed are given in table 1 and table 2 in addition to general meteorological factors site a is also equipped with double fence intercomparison reference dfir and double fence automatic reference dfar han et al 2018 chen et al 2015 all the meteorological factors are collected every minute by the datalogger and stored according to the average value calculated over 30 min 2 2 measurement of dew by microlysimeters between june 6 and september 12 2020 two microlysimeters marked with mls a and mls b respectively installed near the aws of the observation site a were used for dew measurement at night without hoarfrost formation in the observation period fig 1b an electronic balance accuracy 0 1 g was used to weigh the microlysimeters every 30 min and record their mass changes as δm the microlysimeters were made of stainless steel with a diameter of 31 5 cm and a depth of 40 cm the installation method of the microlysimeters was to take natural soil and placed it in the inner tank of the microlysimeters and buried it in the soil to make its opening flush with the ground surface fig 2 this design can minimize the overestimation of dew caused by the rapid radiation cooling of the materials of microlysimeters ninari and berliner 2002 in nights without precipitation dew is not the main reason for the mass increase of the microlysimeters which is due to the presence of water vapor adsorption in the shallow soil kharitonova et al 2010 kosmas et al 1998 the water vapor adsorption by soil occurs when the surface temperature is higher than dew point temperature and the moisture content of soil pores is lower than that of air zhang et al 2016 agam and berliner 2006 kosmas et al 2001 therefore the positive δm obtained when the surface temperature was higher than the dew point temperature was eliminated and the effective positive δm were summed at night finally the dew amount measured by the microlysimeters can be expressed by eq 1 1 m 10 i 1 n δ m ρ s δ m 0 i 1 2 3 n where m mm is the dew amount δm g is the effective positive mass change of the microlysimeters at the next moment compared with the previous moment for an interval over 30 min ρ g cm 3 is the density of dew s cm2 is the projected area of the microlysimeters opening and the constant 10 is the conversion coefficient between units 2 3 estimation of dh by penman equation when the surface temperature is equal to or lower than the dew point temperature t d i e t 0 t d dh condenses on the surface of the ground and objects the dew point temperature can be calculated according to the actual vapor pressure of air bosen 1958 2 t d 116 91 237 3 ln e a 16 78 ln e a where t d is the dew point temperature e a kpa is the actual vapor pressure at air temperature t a in this situation the surface of the ground and objects are fully wet and the vapor pressure of the surface can be considered to be saturated so that the latent heat flux can be calculated according to the penman equation monteith and unsworth 2013 garratt 1992 penman 1948 3 λ e δ r n g 0 ρ a c p e s e a r a δ γ where λe w m 2 is the latent heat flux negative for the formation of dh r n w m 2 is the net radiation flux g 0 w m 2 is the surface soil heat flux e s kpa is the saturated vapor pressure at air temperature t a δ kpa 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve ρ a kg m 3 is the air density c p j kg 1 c 1 is the specific heat of air at constant pressure here we use the value of 1013 j kg 1 c 1 γ kpa 1 is the psychrometric constant and r a m s 1 is the aerodynamic resistance of vapor transport e s and e a can be calculated from the following equation murray 1967 4a e s 0 6108 exp 17 27 t a 237 3 t a 4b e a r h e s 100 where t a and rh are the air temperature and relative humidity at the observation height of 1 5 m respectively the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve δ kpa 1 is given by the following equation murray 1967 5 δ e 0 e s t 0 t a where e 0 kpa is the saturated vapor pressure at the surface temperature t 0 the decrease of air density and psychrometric constant due to the increase of elevation must be considered in alpine regions the air density and psychrometric constant are given by eqs 6a 6b 6c and 6d respectively allen et al 1998 brunt 1952 6a p a 101 3 293 0 0065 h 293 5 26 6b ρ a 1 293 p a p a t m 273 15 273 15 t a 6c γ d e w 0 665 10 3 p a 6d γ h o a r f r o s t 0 588 10 3 p a where p a kpa is the atmospheric pressure ρ a kg m 3 is the air density p atm 101 325 kpa is the standard atmospheric pressure γ dew and γ hoarfrost kpa 1 are the psychrometric constant for dew and hoarfrost respectively h m a s l is the elevation the aerodynamic resistance of water vapor transport can be obtained from the following equation huang 1997 7 r a ln z z 0 m ψ v ζ κ u where z m is the observation height of air temperature and wind speed z 1 5 m z 0m m is the surface roughness length κ is the von kármán constant κ 0 4 u m s 1 is the friction velocity and ψ v ζ is the stability correction function of water vapor flux if considering the stability of the near surface atmosphere the integral form of the wind speed profile can be expressed as sheng et al 2003 monin and obukhov 1954 8 u u κ ln z z 0 m ψ m ζ where u m s 1 is the wind speed at the observation height z and ψ m ζ is the stability correction function for momentum when the near surface atmosphere is under unstable stratification the stability correction functions of momentum and water vapor fluxes are as follows högström 1988 dyer 1974 businger et al 1971 9 ψ m ζ 2 ln 1 x 2 ln 1 x 2 2 2 arctan x π 2 ψ v ζ 2 ln 1 y 2 ζ 0 where x 1 16ζ 1 4 and y 1 16ζ 1 2 when the near surface atmosphere is under stable stratification and neutral stratification the stability correction functions of momentum and water vapor fluxes are as follows 10 ψ m ζ ψ v ζ 5 ζ ζ 0 where ζ is the atmospheric stability parameter which has the following relationship with bulk richardson number sheng et al 2003 chen 1983 11 ζ φ h ζ φ m 2 ζ r i b where φ m ζ and φ h ζ are the universal functions of momentum and heat respectively their relationship with atmospheric stability parameters ζ can be expressed as follows dyer 1974 12a φ m ζ 1 16 ζ 1 4 φ h ζ 1 16 ζ 1 2 ζ 0 12b φ m ζ φ h ζ 1 5 ζ ζ 0 the bulk richardson number can be computed by eq 13 jacobs et al 2006 sharan 2003 zoumakis and kelessis 1991 irwin and binkowski 1981 barker and baxter 1975 13 r i b g θ δ θ z u 2 g t t a t 0 z u 2 where g 9 8 m s 2 is the acceleration of gravity t k is the mean absolute air temperature at observation height z and surface temperature u m s is the wind speed at observation height z the atmospheric stability parameters ζ can be obtained from eq 11 to eq 13 and then the stability correction functions of momentum ψ m ζ and water vapor fluxes ψ v ζ at different atmospheric stratification can be calculated according to eqs 9 and 10 respectively because the change of friction velocity u and surface roughness length z 0m is very small with the increase of observation height near the surface layer anderson and neff 2008 the wind speed profiles u 1 and u 2 at two observation heights can be obtained by eq 8 and then the friction velocity and surface roughness length can be obtained by solving binary linear eq 14 huang 1997 then the friction velocity and surface roughness length obtained from the above solution and the stability correction functions of water vapor fluxes are brought into eq 7 to obtain the value of aerodynamic resistance of water vapor transport r a and the latent heat flux λe is calculated by eq 3 finally 14 u 1 f 1 u z 0 m u 2 f 2 u z 0 m where u 1 and u 2 are the wind speed at observation height of z z 1 1 5 m and z 2 2 5 m respectively when t 0 t d eq 15 is used to estimate the amount of dh 15 e a ρ w 1 λ i 1 n λ e λ e 0 i 1 2 3 n where e mm is the estimated amount of dh a s is the time interval of meteorological factors a 1800 s ρ w kg m 3 is the density of water ρ w 1000 kg m 3 the value of the latent heat varies only slightly over general temperature ranges so the latent heat of vaporization dew λ v 2501 kj kg 1 and the latent heat of sublimation hoarfrost λ s 2835 kj kg 1 were taken in this study 3 results 3 1 measured daily dew amount in order to avoid the effects of precipitation and fog on the accuracy of dew measurement the nights without precipitation fog and clouds were selected to conducted the dew measurement experiment using the above mentioned two microlysimeters which were weighed manually using an electronic balance at intervals of 30 min meanwhile the invalid data when the surface temperature was higher than the dew point temperature was eliminated and the effective mass increase value δm of the two microlysimeters were retained however due to the concentration of precipitation in the warm season rapid weather changes and frequent occurrence of landslides and other geological disasters in the hulu catchment it inevitably led to the failure of dew measurement and only 31 sets of valid data could be used in this study during the observation period fig 3a shows the mean daily dew amount of 31 groups measured by mls a and mls b there were great differences in daily dew amount even if the same weather conditions without precipitation fog and clouds were selected for dew measurement at night during the observation period the daily maximum daily minimum and mean daily dew amount were 0 257 mm 0 013 mm and 0 111 mm respectively during the same period the mean total precipitation and mean daily precipitation observed by the dfir and the dfar were 335 mm and 3 35 mm respectively in terms of mean daily dew and precipitation the amount of dew only accounts for 3 3 of the precipitation during the observation period which indicates that dew is not critical part of water balance in the warm season in the hulu catchment 3 2 weather conditions with dew formation the formation of dh is a natural weather phenomenon accompanied by significant changes in meteorological factors fig 4 shows the changes of the nighttime mean weather conditions corresponding to 31 sets of effective measured dew during the observation period the air temperature and surface temperatures continued to decrease at night until the lowest at about 7 a m before sunrise while the change of dew point temperature was very small at night fig 4a the mean surface temperature at night during the observation period was generally lower than the dew point temperature from 0 a m to 7 a m indicated that dew was mainly formed during this period and it also showed that the mean duration of dew during the observation period was over 7 h the changes of wind speed and relative humidity were different at night which showed that the wind speed has a process of first decreasing to a stable level and then increasing and the relative humidity was just the opposite fig 4b the mean wind speed and relative humidity in the main period with dew formation 0 7 a m were 0 97 m s and 86 respectively while the mean wind speed and relative humidity in the period without dew formation were 1 83 m s and 52 respectively after sunrise the wind speed and relative humidity increased and decreased rapidly respectively furthermore as can be seen in fig 4c the net radiation and surface soil heat flux changed little during the night with dew formation while both net radiation and surface soil heat flux increase rapidly after sunrise these results demonstrated that breezes i e stable atmospheric stratification was conducive to the formation of dew and adequate moisture was the material source of dew formation 3 3 comparison between measured dew and estimated dew comparison of the measured daily dew amount obtained by mls a and mls b for 31 nights during the observation period shows that the linear regression relationship is y 0 95x with r 2 0 91 indicating that there is a good correlation between the two microlysimeters fig 5a comparison between the mean daily amount of measured dew by the microlysimeters and the daily amount of estimated dew by the penman equation for 31 nights were made during the observation period fig 5b the fitted lines were considerably close to the 1 1 line with a slope of 0 90 and the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse between the measured dew and estimated dew are 0 84 and 0 03 mm respectively as the estimated dew amount agree well within 10 with the measured dew amount and the different thermodynamic properties of dew and hoarfrost have been considered the penman equation was considered acceptable for nighttime dh estimation in the hulu catchment however as the slope of the fitted line is 0 9 indicating that the daily dew amount estimated by the penman equation is an underestimation of approximately 10 compared to the measured dew 3 4 annual monthly and daily amount of dh based on the penman equation the annual maximum daily and mean daily amount of dh at the four observation sites at different elevations in the hulu catchment from 2016 to 2020 was estimated as shown in table 3 table 3 and fig 6a show that there was very little variations in the amount of dh per year across the observation sites but very large difference in the amount of dh between observation sites the mean annual amount of dh at the four observation sites from 2016 to 2020 were 30 00 mm 19 20 mm 10 33 mm and 6 55 mm with standard deviations were 2 40 mm 1 31 mm 0 46 mm and 0 87 mm respectively these results demonstrated that dh were more stable component of the surface water input table 3 and fig 6b show that the maximum daily amount of dh at observation site a site b and site d ranged from 0 2 mm to 0 3 mm from 2016 to 2020 while the maximum daily amount of dh at observation site c exceeded 0 3 mm in both 2017 and 2019 the mean maximum daily amount of dh from observation site a to site d were 0 255 mm 0 240 mm 0 291 mm and 0 250 mm respectively which were much lower than the maximum theoretical daily amount calculated at 0 47 mm based on the model of potential dew proposed by jacobs et al 2002 table 3 and fig 6c show that the mean daily amount of dh from site a to site d were 0 096 mm 0 086 mm 0 081 mm and 0 073 mm respectively which were much higher than the threshold of 0 03 mm that was available water source for microorganisms as proved by kappen et al 1979 although interannual variations in dh amount were not significant across the four observation sites monthly variations in dh amount were evident across the four observation sites fig 7 shows the comparison of mean monthly amount of dh at the four observation sites from 2016 to 2020 it can be found that the distribution of dh in any observation site was extremely uneven and the monthly variations of dh amount indicated that dh has significant seasonal patterns the maximum monthly amount of dh from site a to site d were 4 20 mm 2 93 mm 2 10 mm and 1 77 mm respectively the minimum monthly amount were 0 83 mm 0 62 mm 0 30 mm and 0 04 mm respectively and the standard deviations of monthly amount of dh were 1 26 mm 0 84 mm 0 53 mm and 0 56 mm respectively the amount of dh increases in the warm season and decreases in the cold season the monthly maximum amount of dh at each observation site occurred in august and the mean monthly minimum amount of dh occurred in february in general agreement with the monthly variations in air temperature fig 8 shows the mean proportion of annual dew amount and annual hoarfrost amount at the four observation sites in the hulu catchment during 2016 2020 it can be seen that from site a to site d the mean proportion of annual dew amount in the total annual dh amount is 46 48 56 and 61 respectively while the proportion of annual hoarfrost amount in the total annual dh amount is 54 52 44 and 39 respectively of the total annual dh amount the proportion of dew increases and the proportion of hoarfrost decreases as the elevation increases from site a to site d despite the gradual decrease in temperature from site a to site d with increasing altitude the amount of dh at higher elevations is concentrated in the warm season with little in the cold season fig 7 so the proportion of dew increases with elevation and the opposite for hoarfrost the hoarfrost occupies a certain proportion of dh in the hulu catchment highlighting the cold climate of the alpine regions 3 5 daily duration and annual frequency of dh the duration of dh refers to the time from the beginning of the formation to complete dissipation of dh which includes two processes one is the nighttime gradual accumulation of dh and the other is the daytime rapid evaporation of dh due to the large variations between daily dew amounts during the observation period the night with the maximum dew amount from july 11 to july 12 2020 was selected to represent the nighttime accumulation and daytime evaporation processes of dew fig 9 shows the variations of nighttime accumulation and daytime evaporation of measured dew by microlysimeters and estimated dew by the penman equation during the night from july 11 to july 12 2020 it can be clearly found that the accumulation of dew mainly occurred from 23 00 7 00 the next day the evaporation of dew mainly occurred from 7 00 10 00 am and the duration of dew was more than 9 h the accumulation of dew was very slow and the evaporation rate of dew was much faster than that of dew accumulation comparison of the nighttime accumulation and daytime evaporation between the measured dew by the microlysimeters and estimated dew by the penman equation shows that the dew estimated by the penman equation is consistent with dew measured by the microlysimeters and that the penman equation is highly accurate for dew estimation according to the daily duration of dh at the four observation sites in the hulu catchment estimated by the penman equation as shown in fig 10a it can be found that there were large variations in the daily duration of dh at each observation site and the maximum daily duration was more than 12 h the mean daily duration of dh at the four observation sites from site a to site d during 2016 2020 were 6 5 h 6 0 h 4 5 h and 4 2 h with standard deviations of 3 3 h 3 0 h 3 0 h and 2 9 h respectively the frequency of dh is the number of days with dh formation in a year the frequency of dh at four observation sites in the hulu catchment from 2016 2020 was estimated based on the penman equation shown in fig 10b as can be seen from fig 10b there were little interannual variations in dh frequency across the four observation sites but very large variations in dh frequency between the four observation sites the mean annual frequency of dh in the four observation sites from site a to site d during 2016 2020 were 313 d 223 d 128 d and 90 d with standard deviations of 8 3 d 9 8 d 8 3 d and 11 8 d and the mean annual frequency of dh accounted for 86 61 35 and 25 of the year for the period 2016 2020 the mean number of precipitation days from site a to site d were 110 d 121 d 152 d and 155 d which accounted for 30 33 42 and 42 of the year these results demonstrated that dh formation was more frequent than precipitation at low elevations in the hulu catchment 3 6 formation and variations of dh with elevation the elevation of the four observation sites selected in the hulu catchment increases from site a to site d and the elevation of the four observation sites listed in table 2 fig 11 shows that the mean annual amount mean daily duration and mean annual frequency of dh from 2016 2020 decrease with the increase in elevation indicating that dh have significant elevation dependence in the hulu catchment the elevation dependence of dh is manifested by a linear or non linear relationship between the amount duration and frequency of dh and elevation and these relationships may be expressed as follows 16 y 1 1645 e 0 00136 x 17 y 2 0 002 12 67 18 y 3 7317 e 0 00107 x where y 1 mm y is the annual amount of dh y 2 h d the mean daily duration of dh y 3 d y is the annual frequency of dh and x m is the elevation the relationships between the annual amount and annual frequency of dh decreasing with increasing elevation are not linear while the relationship between the mean daily duration of dh decreasing with increasing elevation is linear eqs 16 18 predict a decrease in approximately 2 07 mm 0 20 h and 19 40 d in the annual amount mean daily duration and annual frequency of dh per 100 m increase in elevation respectively 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal patterns of dh in alpine regions it is commonly believed that the autumn september to november in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere is the season with the largest amount of dh over the year wang et al 2017a this is because the nocturnal weather conditions in autumn are conducive to radiation cooling iijima and shinoda 2002 however this study shows that this may be not a universal phenomenon the results indicate that the monthly amount of dh shows significant seasonal characteristics and the seasonal characteristics of dh are basically the same at different elevations i e the warm season may to october is the season with the higher monthly amount of dh while the cold season november through april is the season with the lower monthly amount of dh as can be seen from fig 7 the mean monthly amount of dh at the four observation sites located at different elevations was the maximum in august and the minimum in february the seasonal characteristics of dh in the hulu catchment are consistent with the monthly variations of temperature and relative humidity i e the monthly mean temperature and monthly mean relative humidity are highest in august and lowest in february respectively the seasonal characteristics of dh in the hulu catchment suggest that the monthly variations of dh in alpine regions are influenced by temperature and relative humidity however the seasonal variations of dh in other regions are not completely influenced by temperature and relative humidity a six years of dew without the formation of hoarfrost observations conducted in the negev desert which has a mediterranean climate indicated that the total monthly amount of dew shows two maxima in september and in december january and two minima in april and november zangvil 1996 among them the monthly amount of dew was the largest in december and the smallest in april the monthly variations of dew in the negev desert were not consistent with the variations in temperature and relative humidity and the inconsistency of the monthly variations of dew with the variations in temperature and relative humidity was also found in humid grassland area in the netherlands with temperate maritime climate jacobs et al 2006 although the distribution of monthly amount of dew hoarfrost included is relatively evenly over the year there is still a slight tendency for lower dew amounts during the longest daylight period may to july and vice versa during the autumn jacobs et al 2006 the monthly variations of dh in different climatic zones mentioned above indicate that dh has certain seasonal patterns and the seasonal patterns of dh have obvious regional differences the seasonal patterns of dh may be influenced by a combination of meteorological factors and the amount of dh in different months may affect by different dominant meteorological factors which needs to be further investigated 4 2 elevation dependence of dh in alpine regions elevation altitude was reported as playing an important role in determining dew formation in the negev desert near the mediterranean sea i e the amount and days of dew increased with elevation which may be explained by the more efficient nocturnal radiational cooling occurring at higher elevations kidron 1999 however the results suggested that the elevation dependence of dh in the hulu catchment was diametrically opposed to that in arid regions not only does the amount and frequency of dh decrease with increasing elevation but also the duration of dh decreases with increasing elevation fig 11 the reasons for the elevation dependence of the amount duration and frequency of dh with increasing elevation may be in relation to meteorological factors duvdevani 1953 in addition to the surface soil heat flux other meteorological factors such as air temperature wind speed relative humidity and net radiation in the hulu catchment show a significant elevation dependence yang et al 2019 chen et al 2014 fig 12 provides ample evidence of the elevation dependence of meteorological factors other than the surface soil heat flux in the formation of dh at nights the elevation dependence of air temperature and relative humidity leads to the dew point temperature decrease with increasing elevation the premise for dh formation is that the surface temperature is equal to or lower than the dew point temperature and the larger difference between the dew point temperature and the surface temperature the more favorable the formation of dh as evidenced by the elevation dependence difference between the dew point temperature and the surface temperature with dh formation at nights fig 13 in summary the elevation dependence of meteorological factors is the main reason for the elevation dependence of dh while the difference between dew point temperature and the surface temperature at night decreases with increasing elevation is the direct reason for the decrease in dh with increasing elevation in the hulu catchment it should be noted that the elevation dependence of dh in the hulu catchment is not linear which is related to the calculation method of dew point temperature from eq 2 and equation 4 it is clear that the dew point temperature is a function of air temperature and relative humidity and the relationship between dew point temperature and air temperature and relative humidity is not linear bosen 1958 the opposite elevation dependence of dh in arid regions and alpine regions suggests that the formation and variations of dh have significant regional differences so that the elevation effects on dh must be considered 4 3 contribution and role of dh in the water balance and ecosystem previous studies on the precipitation gradient showed that there was a significant linear relationship between precipitation and elevation based on more than 20 sets of rain gauges and t200b precipitation observation at different elevations in the hulu catchment wang et al 2017b chen et al 2015 which can be expressed by eq 19 wang 2020 19 y 0 32 x 471 49 r 2 0 94 where x m a s l is the elevation y mm is the annual precipitation it is obvious that the annual precipitation increases with the increase in elevation and the coefficient of determination between annual precipitation and elevation is 0 94 based on eqs 16 and 19 the mean annual amount of dh varied from 3 mm to 33 mm the precipitation varied from 450 mm to 1050 mm and the trends in the annual amount of dh and precipitation with increasing elevation were reversed in the hulu catchment the contribution of the annual amount of dh in annual precipitation ranged from 0 3 to 7 3 indicating that the amount of dh was not a critical component of the surface water balance but was mostly neglected on the studies of surface water input in the past despite the contribution of dh to precipitation in the hulu catchment is not critical it cannot be ignored as dh plays an important role in the operation of alpine ecosystems the climatic characteristics of alpine regions are extremely specific typically characterized by low temperature high wind speed strong radiation and large differences in diurnal temperature han et al 2018 chen et al 2014 the strong daytime evapotranspiration in the warm season causes an extreme deficit in topsoil moisture leading to water stress for vegetation and microorganisms while the frequent formation and long duration of dh is an effective supplement to the deficit in topsoil moisture especially at night without precipitation the low temperature and extreme diurnal temperature difference in alpine regions especially the sharp diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature tend to cause temperature stress to vegetation and microorganisms the formation of dh releases latent heat and mitigates the loss of surface heat due to strong radiation cooling at night zhou et al 2002 liu et al 1998 which plays a role in reducing diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature especially the formation of hoarfrost which protects vegetation and microorganisms from frost thus reducing the temperature stress of vegetation and microorganisms in alpine regions dh supplements water deficits in the topsoil and reduces diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature playing a vital role in mitigating water and temperature stress on vegetation and microorganisms thus contributing to the operation of ecosystems in alpine regions 5 conclusions although dh is a common natural weather phenomenon in alpine regions understanding of its formation and variations are still limited and the contribution and role of dh in surface water balance and ecosystems are mostly neglected based on measurement and estimation of dh it was found that the formation of dh was accompanied by significant changes in meteorological factors indicating that the formation of dh was the result of a combination of meteorological factors interannual variations in the amount duration and frequency of dh were not significant but there was a clear seasonal pattern within years suggesting that the warm season was more conducive to the dh formation than the cold season the amount duration and frequency of dh showed a decreasing trend with increasing elevation demonstrating a significant elevation dependence of dh the seasonal and elevation dependence of dh in the hulu catchment depends on the seasonal and elevation dependence of meteorological factors the mean annual amount of dh ranged from 3 mm to 33 mm and its contribution to precipitation ranged from 0 3 to 7 3 indicating that dh is not a critical component of surface water input in the hulu catchment but it is ecologically important dh supplements surface water deficits caused by strong evaporation during the day while the formation of dh releases heat to slow diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature playing an important role in alleviating water and temperature stress on vegetation and microorganisms and maintaining the operation of ecosystems therefore research into the formation and variations of dh are of vital significance to understand the energy transfer water cycle and ecosystem operation in alpine regions credit

7941,study region the hulu catchment on northeast qinghai tibet plateau china study focus dew and hoarfrost dh are prominent components of the non precipitation water inputs in arid and semi arid regions but research into them is mostly neglected in alpine regions to understand the formation and variations of dh as well as whether dh has a significant impact on the water balance and ecosystem a field measurement experiment of dew was conducted in the hulu catchment meanwhile the amount duration and frequency of dh at different elevations in the hulu catchment from 2016 to 2020 were estimated using the penman equation new hydrological insights for the region dh was common weather phenomenon in the hulu catchment with small interannual and large monthly variations in amount duration and frequency dh showed significant seasonal pattern and elevation dependence which depending on the seasonal pattern and elevation dependence of meteorological factors the mean annual amount of dh ranged from 3 mm to 33 mm contributing 0 3 7 3 of precipitation indicating that dh was not a critical component of water balance nevertheless dh was ecologically important in replenishing surface soil water deficits and mitigating diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature protecting vegetation and microorganisms from water and temperature stress in alpine regions this study has important implications for understanding the energy transfer water cycle and ecosystem operation in alpine regions graphical abstract ga1 keywords dew hoarfrost alpine region penman equation seasonal pattern elevation dependence 1 introduction dew is the liquid water formed when supersaturated water vapor near the surface condenses on the surface of ground and objects with the surface temperature is equal to or lower than the dew point temperature agam and berliner 2006 beysens 2006 1995 jacobs et al 2002 1999 monteith 1957 the main difference of the formation between dew and hoarfrost is whether the dew point temperature is below 0 so hoarfrost is also considered to be a special form of dew dew and hoarfrost dh are generally considered to be prominent components of non precipitation water inputs chamizo et al 2021 kool et al 2021 gao et al 2020 kaseke et al 2017 kidron and temina 2017 uclés et al 2015 as well as important forms of energy transfer and water cycle near the surface ninari and berliner 2002 the formation and dissipation of dh is a crucial factor to maintain the operation of ecosystems particularly in arid and semi arid areas evans et al 2019 wang et al 2017c wierzchos et al 2012 jacobs et al 2002 kidron 1999 dew is a critical water source for surface plants and microorganisms in arid and semi arid areas such as deserts and adjacent areas with scarce precipitation zhuang et al 2021 florentin and agam 2017 jacobs et al 1999 many studies have shown that biological soil crusts in arid environments are maintained by dew mainly due to the higher frequency and more stable amount of dew compared to precipitation li et al 2021 zheng et al 2018 jia et al 2014 zhang et al 2009 therefore dew plays a role of wind prevention sand fixation and fix carbon dioxide indirectly chamizo et al 2021 ouyang and hu 2017 lange et al 1997 some studies also showed that dew can be directly consumed by small animals such as ants and snails shachak et al 2002 moffett 1985 while hoarfrost can protect vegetation to avoid and reduce the risk of frostbite groh et al 2018 although some studies have shown that dew adhering to the surface of crops may promote the development of fungi bacteria and pests which can breed diseases and have some side effects on agricultural production groh et al 2018 saab et al 2017 zhang and watson 1997 zuberer and kenerley 1993 dew can also promote seed germination improve seed germination and boost agricultural production hosseini et al 2020 zhuang and zhao 2015 gutterman 1997 in addition dew in the urban environment not only increases the surface water supply but also adheres to the surface of suspended particles moistening and settling them and thus purifying the air muskała et al 2015 takeuchi et al 2001 mulawa et al 1986 therefore the amount duration and frequency of dew in urban environment are also important indicators when assessing urban air quality ye et al 2018 2007 2006 gałek et al 2016 although dh plays a prominent role in regional water supplies and ecosystems it is difficult to measure it effectively due to the small amount of daily dh ninari and berliner 2002 malek et al 1999 as a result many researchers have been searching for effective methods of directly measuring dh direct methods of dew measurement include the duvdevani method kidron et al 2000 subramaniam and rao 1983 duvdevani 1947 the artificial condensation surface ye et al 2018 zhuang and zhao 2014 kidron 1998 the hiltner dew balance hanisch et al 2015 zangvil 1996 and the lysimeters of which lysimeters with different materials specifications and buried depths are the most commonly used method of dew measurement at present uclés et al 2015 2013 guo et al 2013 ninari and berliner 2002 measurement of dew has been controversial due to the large differences of the thermal and physical properties between the measuring equipment and the actual condensation surface which often leads to the overestimation of dew amount and is an important reason why the maximum daily dew in some areas far exceeds the theoretical values kidron et al 2021 kidron and kronenfeld 2020 it is well known that the formation of dh is a phase change process of water which is accompanied by the transformation of the latent heat flux agam and berliner 2006 beysens 2006 1995 in view of this it is a feasible and an internationally accepted method to estimate the formation and variations of dh by calculating latent heat flux madeira et al 2002 the commonly used methods to calculate the latent heat flux include the aerodynamic method jacobs et al 2008 the bowen ratio energy balance method breb zhuang and zhao 2017 kalthoff et al 2006 malek et al 1999 the eddy covariance technique ec wang et al 2019 florentin and agam 2017 hao et al 2012 moro et al 2007 and the penman equation groh et al 2018 uclés et al 2014 jacobs et al 2006 because there are uncertainties in the calculation of latent heat flux and the applicability of dh estimation based on the relationship between water phase transition and latent heat flux needs to be validated based on measured data most of the studies on measurement and estimation of dh are in arid and semi arid areas kidron and kronenfeld 2020 zhuang and zhao 2017 uclés et al 2014 jacobs et al 2002 1999 kidron et al 2000 malek et al 1999 however there are few studies on the formation and variations of dh in alpine regions and the contribution and role of dh in the surface water balance and ecosystem in alpine regions are not clear the climatic characteristics of the alpine regions are very different from those of the arid and semi arid regions and the humid regions where temperatures are low and heat and water exchanges are frequent han et al 2018 chen et al 2014 not many studies have shown that dh was also an important component of the surface water balance in alpine regions with the amount of dh was even exceeding that of arid and semi arid regions wang 2009 2012 de jong 2005 therefore research into the formation and variations of dh is of vital significance to understand the energy transfer water cycle and ecosystem operation in alpine regions accounting for more than 43 5 of the land area in china in the current study the hulu catchment on northeast qinghai tibet plateau was selected as the study area the main objectives of this study are 1 to understand the formation and variations characteristics of dh 2 to quantify the amount duration and frequency of dh 3 to analyze the effect of meteorological factors and elevation on dh formation and variations and 4 to explore the contribution and role of dh to surface water balance and ecosystem in alpine regions 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area and meteorological factors observation this study was conducted at the hulu catchment 38 12 38 17 n 99 50 99 54 e in the qilian mountains on northeast qinghai tibet plateau fig 1 the hulu catchment covers an area of 23 km2 with elevations between 2960 m and 4820 m and it is a typical alpine catchment for observing and studying on the mountainous meteorology cryospheric hydrology and alpine ecosystem which operated and maintained by the qilian alpine ecology and hydrology research station qilian station northwest institute of eco environment and resources chinese academy of sciences han et al 2018 chen et al 2014 the climate type of the hulu catchment has the characteristics of both the alpine climate and the temperate continental climate between 2016 and 2020 the mean annual temperature of the hulu catchment was 1 0 c and the mean annual precipitation was 650 mm the temperature was the highest in august and the lowest in february and the precipitation was mainly concentrated in the warm season from may to october which accounting for 80 92 of the annual precipitation four observation sites represented by site a site b site c and site d respectively located at different elevations in the hulu catchment were used for dew and hoarfrost measurement and estimation fig 1c and the four observation sites were all equipped with a set of automatic weather stations aws with two heights of air temperature relative humidity wind speed measurement and other meteorological factors measurement based on a cryosphere hydrology observation system established in 2008 chen et al 2014 the location information of each observation site and the meteorological factors observed are given in table 1 and table 2 in addition to general meteorological factors site a is also equipped with double fence intercomparison reference dfir and double fence automatic reference dfar han et al 2018 chen et al 2015 all the meteorological factors are collected every minute by the datalogger and stored according to the average value calculated over 30 min 2 2 measurement of dew by microlysimeters between june 6 and september 12 2020 two microlysimeters marked with mls a and mls b respectively installed near the aws of the observation site a were used for dew measurement at night without hoarfrost formation in the observation period fig 1b an electronic balance accuracy 0 1 g was used to weigh the microlysimeters every 30 min and record their mass changes as δm the microlysimeters were made of stainless steel with a diameter of 31 5 cm and a depth of 40 cm the installation method of the microlysimeters was to take natural soil and placed it in the inner tank of the microlysimeters and buried it in the soil to make its opening flush with the ground surface fig 2 this design can minimize the overestimation of dew caused by the rapid radiation cooling of the materials of microlysimeters ninari and berliner 2002 in nights without precipitation dew is not the main reason for the mass increase of the microlysimeters which is due to the presence of water vapor adsorption in the shallow soil kharitonova et al 2010 kosmas et al 1998 the water vapor adsorption by soil occurs when the surface temperature is higher than dew point temperature and the moisture content of soil pores is lower than that of air zhang et al 2016 agam and berliner 2006 kosmas et al 2001 therefore the positive δm obtained when the surface temperature was higher than the dew point temperature was eliminated and the effective positive δm were summed at night finally the dew amount measured by the microlysimeters can be expressed by eq 1 1 m 10 i 1 n δ m ρ s δ m 0 i 1 2 3 n where m mm is the dew amount δm g is the effective positive mass change of the microlysimeters at the next moment compared with the previous moment for an interval over 30 min ρ g cm 3 is the density of dew s cm2 is the projected area of the microlysimeters opening and the constant 10 is the conversion coefficient between units 2 3 estimation of dh by penman equation when the surface temperature is equal to or lower than the dew point temperature t d i e t 0 t d dh condenses on the surface of the ground and objects the dew point temperature can be calculated according to the actual vapor pressure of air bosen 1958 2 t d 116 91 237 3 ln e a 16 78 ln e a where t d is the dew point temperature e a kpa is the actual vapor pressure at air temperature t a in this situation the surface of the ground and objects are fully wet and the vapor pressure of the surface can be considered to be saturated so that the latent heat flux can be calculated according to the penman equation monteith and unsworth 2013 garratt 1992 penman 1948 3 λ e δ r n g 0 ρ a c p e s e a r a δ γ where λe w m 2 is the latent heat flux negative for the formation of dh r n w m 2 is the net radiation flux g 0 w m 2 is the surface soil heat flux e s kpa is the saturated vapor pressure at air temperature t a δ kpa 1 is the slope of the saturation vapor pressure curve ρ a kg m 3 is the air density c p j kg 1 c 1 is the specific heat of air at constant pressure here we use the value of 1013 j kg 1 c 1 γ kpa 1 is the psychrometric constant and r a m s 1 is the aerodynamic resistance of vapor transport e s and e a can be calculated from the following equation murray 1967 4a e s 0 6108 exp 17 27 t a 237 3 t a 4b e a r h e s 100 where t a and rh are the air temperature and relative humidity at the observation height of 1 5 m respectively the slope of the saturated vapor pressure curve δ kpa 1 is given by the following equation murray 1967 5 δ e 0 e s t 0 t a where e 0 kpa is the saturated vapor pressure at the surface temperature t 0 the decrease of air density and psychrometric constant due to the increase of elevation must be considered in alpine regions the air density and psychrometric constant are given by eqs 6a 6b 6c and 6d respectively allen et al 1998 brunt 1952 6a p a 101 3 293 0 0065 h 293 5 26 6b ρ a 1 293 p a p a t m 273 15

pressure γ dew and γ hoarfrost kpa 1 are the psychrometric constant for dew and hoarfrost respectively h m a s l is the elevation the aerodynamic resistance of water vapor transport can be obtained from the following equation huang 1997 7 r a ln z z 0 m ψ v ζ κ u where z m is the observation height of air temperature and wind speed z 1 5 m z 0m m is the surface roughness length κ is the von kármán constant κ 0 4 u m s 1 is the friction velocity and ψ v ζ is the stability correction function of water vapor flux if considering the stability of the near surface atmosphere the integral form of the wind speed profile can be expressed as sheng et al 2003 monin and obukhov 1954 8 u u κ ln z z 0 m ψ m ζ where u m s 1 is the wind speed at the observation height z and ψ m ζ is the stability correction function for momentum when the near surface atmosphere is under unstable stratification the stability correction functions of momentum and water vapor fluxes are as follows högström 1988 dyer 1974 businger et al 1971 9 ψ m ζ 2 ln 1 x 2 ln 1 x 2 2 2 arctan x π 2 ψ v ζ 2 ln 1 y 2 ζ 0 where x 1 16ζ 1 4 and y 1 16ζ 1 2 when the near surface atmosphere is under stable stratification and neutral stratification the stability correction functions of momentum and water vapor fluxes are as follows 10 ψ m ζ ψ v ζ 5 ζ ζ 0 where ζ is the atmospheric stability parameter which has the following relationship with bulk richardson number sheng et al 2003 chen 1983 11 ζ φ h ζ φ m 2 ζ r i b where φ m ζ and φ h ζ are the universal functions of momentum and heat respectively their relationship with atmospheric stability parameters ζ can be expressed as follows dyer 1974 12a φ m ζ 1 16 ζ 1 4 φ h ζ 1 16 ζ 1 2 ζ 0 12b φ m ζ φ h ζ 1 5 ζ ζ 0 the bulk richardson number can be computed by eq 13 jacobs et al 2006 sharan 2003 zoumakis and kelessis 1991 irwin and binkowski 1981 barker and baxter 1975 13 r i b g θ δ θ z u 2 g t t a t 0 z u 2 where g 9 8 m s 2 is the acceleration of gravity t k is the mean absolute air temperature at observation height z and surface temperature u m s is the wind speed at observation height z the atmospheric stability parameters ζ can be obtained from eq 11 to eq 13 and then the stability correction functions of momentum ψ m ζ and water vapor fluxes ψ v ζ at different atmospheric stratification can be calculated according to eqs 9 and 10 respectively because the change of friction velocity u and surface roughness length z 0m is very small with the increase of observation height near the surface layer anderson and neff 2008 the wind speed profiles u 1 and u 2 at two observation heights can be obtained by eq 8 and then the friction velocity and surface roughness length can be obtained by solving binary linear eq 14 huang 1997 then the friction velocity and surface roughness length obtained from the above solution and the stability correction functions of water vapor fluxes are brought into eq 7 to obtain the value of aerodynamic resistance of water vapor transport r a and the latent heat flux λe is calculated by eq 3 finally 14 u 1 f 1 u z 0 m u 2 f 2 u z 0 m where u 1 and u 2 are the wind speed at observation height of z z 1 1 5 m and z 2 2 5 m respectively when t 0 t d eq 15 is used to estimate the amount of dh 15 e a ρ w 1 λ i 1 n λ e λ e 0 i 1 2 3 n where e mm is the estimated amount of dh a s is the time interval of meteorological factors a 1800 s ρ w kg m 3 is the density of water ρ w 1000 kg m 3 the value of the latent heat varies only slightly over general temperature ranges so the latent heat of vaporization dew λ v 2501 kj kg 1 and the latent heat of sublimation hoarfrost λ s 2835 kj kg 1 were taken in this study 3 results 3 1 measured daily dew amount in order to avoid the effects of precipitation and fog on the accuracy of dew measurement the nights without precipitation fog and clouds were selected to conducted the dew measurement experiment using the above mentioned two microlysimeters which were weighed manually using an electronic balance at intervals of 30 min meanwhile the invalid data when the surface temperature was higher than the dew point temperature was eliminated and the effective mass increase value δm of the two microlysimeters were retained however due to the concentration of precipitation in the warm season rapid weather changes and frequent occurrence of landslides and other geological disasters in the hulu catchment it inevitably led to the failure of dew measurement and only 31 sets of valid data could be used in this study during the observation period fig 3a shows the mean daily dew amount of 31 groups measured by mls a and mls b there were great differences in daily dew amount even if the same weather conditions without precipitation fog and clouds were selected for dew measurement at night during the observation period the daily maximum daily minimum and mean daily dew amount were 0 257 mm 0 013 mm and 0 111 mm respectively during the same period the mean total precipitation and mean daily precipitation observed by the dfir and the dfar were 335 mm and 3 35 mm respectively in terms of mean daily dew and precipitation the amount of dew only accounts for 3 3 of the precipitation during the observation period which indicates that dew is not critical part of water balance in the warm season in the hulu catchment 3 2 weather conditions with dew formation the formation of dh is a natural weather phenomenon accompanied by significant changes in meteorological factors fig 4 shows the changes of the nighttime mean weather conditions corresponding to 31 sets of effective measured dew during the observation period the air temperature and surface temperatures continued to decrease at night until the lowest at about 7 a m before sunrise while the change of dew point temperature was very small at night fig 4a the mean surface temperature at night during the observation period was generally lower than the dew point temperature from 0 a m to 7 a m indicated that dew was mainly formed during this period and it also showed that the mean duration of dew during the observation period was over 7 h the changes of wind speed and relative humidity were different at night which showed that the wind speed has a process of first decreasing to a stable level and then increasing and the relative humidity was just the opposite fig 4b the mean wind speed and relative humidity in the main period with dew formation 0 7 a m were 0 97 m s and 86 respectively while the mean wind speed and relative humidity in the period without dew formation were 1 83 m s and 52 respectively after sunrise the wind speed and relative humidity increased and decreased rapidly respectively furthermore as can be seen in fig 4c the net radiation and surface soil heat flux changed little during the night with dew formation while both net radiation and surface soil heat flux increase rapidly after sunrise these results demonstrated that breezes i e stable atmospheric stratification was conducive to the formation of dew and adequate moisture was the material source of dew formation 3 3 comparison between measured dew and estimated dew comparison of the measured daily dew amount obtained by mls a and mls b for 31 nights during the observation period shows that the linear regression relationship is y 0 95x with r 2 0 91 indicating that there is a good correlation between the two microlysimeters fig 5a comparison between the mean daily amount of measured dew by the microlysimeters and the daily amount of estimated dew by the penman equation for 31 nights were made during the observation period fig 5b the fitted lines were considerably close to the 1 1 line with a slope of 0 90 and the coefficient of determination r 2 and root mean square error rmse between the measured dew and estimated dew are 0 84 and 0 03 mm respectively as the estimated dew amount agree well within 10 with the measured dew amount and the different thermodynamic properties of dew and hoarfrost have been considered the penman equation was considered acceptable for nighttime dh estimation in the hulu catchment however as the slope of the fitted line is 0 9 indicating that the daily dew amount estimated by the penman equation is an underestimation of approximately 10 compared to the measured dew 3 4 annual monthly and daily amount of dh based on the penman equation the annual maximum daily and mean daily amount of dh at the four observation sites at different elevations in the hulu catchment from 2016 to 2020 was estimated as shown in table 3 table 3 and fig 6a show that there was very little variations in the amount of dh per year across the observation sites but very large difference in the amount of dh between observation sites the mean annual amount of dh at the four observation sites from 2016 to 2020 were 30 00 mm 19 20 mm 10 33 mm and 6 55 mm with standard deviations were 2 40 mm 1 31 mm 0 46 mm and 0 87 mm respectively these results demonstrated that dh were more stable component of the surface water input table 3 and fig 6b show that the maximum daily amount of dh at observation site a site b and site d ranged from 0 2 mm to 0 3 mm from 2016 to 2020 while the maximum daily amount of dh at observation site c exceeded 0 3 mm in both 2017 and 2019 the mean maximum daily amount of dh from observation site a to site d were 0 255 mm 0 240 mm 0 291 mm and 0 250 mm respectively which were much lower than the maximum theoretical daily amount calculated at 0 47 mm based on the model of potential dew proposed by jacobs et al 2002 table 3 and fig 6c show that the mean daily amount of dh from site a to site d were 0 096 mm 0 086 mm 0 081 mm and 0 073 mm respectively which were much higher than the threshold of 0 03 mm that was available water source for microorganisms as proved by kappen et al 1979 although interannual variations in dh amount were not significant across the four observation sites monthly variations in dh amount were evident across the four observation sites fig 7 shows the comparison of mean monthly amount of dh at the four observation sites from 2016 to 2020 it can be found that the distribution of dh in any observation site was extremely uneven and the monthly variations of dh amount indicated that dh has significant seasonal patterns the maximum monthly amount of dh from site a to site d were 4 20 mm 2 93 mm 2 10 mm and 1 77 mm respectively the minimum monthly amount were 0 83 mm 0 62 mm 0 30 mm and 0 04 mm respectively and the standard deviations of monthly amount of dh were 1 26 mm 0 84 mm 0 53 mm and 0 56 mm respectively the amount of dh increases in the warm season and decreases in the cold season the monthly maximum amount of dh at each observation site occurred in august and the mean monthly minimum amount of dh occurred in february in general agreement with the monthly variations in air temperature fig 8 shows the mean proportion of annual dew amount and annual hoarfrost amount at the four observation sites in the hulu catchment during 2016 2020 it can be seen that from site a to site d the mean proportion of annual dew amount in the total annual dh amount is 46 48 56 and 61 respectively while the proportion of annual hoarfrost amount in the total annual dh amount is 54 52 44 and 39 respectively of the total annual dh amount the proportion of dew increases and the proportion of hoarfrost decreases as the elevation increases from site a to site d despite the gradual decrease in temperature from site a to site d with increasing altitude the amount of dh at higher elevations is concentrated in the warm season with little in the cold season fig 7 so the proportion of dew increases with elevation and the opposite for hoarfrost the hoarfrost occupies a certain proportion of dh in the hulu catchment highlighting the cold climate of the alpine regions 3 5 daily duration and annual frequency of dh the duration of dh refers to the time from the beginning of the formation to complete dissipation of dh which includes two processes one is the nighttime gradual accumulation of dh and the other is the daytime rapid evaporation of dh due to the large variations between daily dew amounts during the observation period the night with the maximum dew amount from july 11 to july 12 2020 was selected to represent the nighttime accumulation and daytime evaporation processes of dew fig 9 shows the variations of nighttime accumulation and daytime evaporation of measured dew by microlysimeters and estimated dew by the penman equation during the night from july 11 to july 12 2020 it can be clearly found that the accumulation of dew mainly occurred from 23 00 7 00 the next day the evaporation of dew mainly occurred from 7 00 10 00 am and the duration of dew was more than 9 h the accumulation of dew was very slow and the evaporation rate of dew was much faster than that of dew accumulation comparison of the nighttime accumulation and daytime evaporation between the measured dew by the microlysimeters and estimated dew by the penman equation shows that the dew estimated by the penman equation is consistent with dew measured by the microlysimeters and that the penman equation is highly accurate for dew estimation according to the daily duration of dh at the four observation sites in the hulu catchment estimated by the penman equation as shown in fig 10a it can be found that there were large variations in the daily duration of dh at each observation site and the maximum daily duration was more than 12 h the mean daily duration of dh at the four observation sites from site a to site d during 2016 2020 were 6 5 h 6 0 h 4 5 h and 4 2 h with standard deviations of 3 3 h 3 0 h 3 0 h and 2 9 h respectively the frequency of dh is the number of days with dh formation in a year the frequency of dh at four observation sites in the hulu catchment from 2016 2020 was estimated based on the penman equation shown in fig 10b as can be seen from fig 10b there were little interannual variations in dh frequency across the four observation sites but very large variations in dh frequency between the four observation sites the mean annual frequency of dh in the four observation sites from site a to site d during 2016 2020 were 313 d 223 d 128 d and 90 d with standard deviations of 8 3 d 9 8 d 8 3 d and 11 8 d and the mean annual frequency of dh accounted for 86 61 35 and 25 of the year for the period 2016 2020 the mean number of precipitation days from site a to site d were 110 d 121 d 152 d and 155 d which accounted for 30 33 42 and 42 of the year these results demonstrated that dh formation was more frequent than precipitation at low elevations in the hulu catchment 3 6 formation and variations of dh with elevation the elevation of the four observation sites selected in the hulu catchment increases from site a to site d and the elevation of the four observation sites listed in table 2 fig 11 shows that the mean annual amount mean daily duration and mean annual frequency of dh from 2016 2020 decrease with the increase in elevation indicating that dh have significant elevation dependence in the hulu catchment the elevation dependence of dh is manifested by a linear or non linear relationship between the amount duration and frequency of dh and elevation and these relationships may be expressed as follows 16 y 1 1645 e 0 00136 x 17 y 2 0 002 12 67 18 y 3 7317 e 0 00107 x where y 1 mm y is the annual amount of dh y 2 h d the mean daily duration of dh y 3 d y is the annual frequency of dh and x m is the elevation the relationships between the annual amount and annual frequency of dh decreasing with increasing elevation are not linear while the relationship between the mean daily duration of dh decreasing with increasing elevation is linear eqs 16 18 predict a decrease in approximately 2 07 mm 0 20 h and 19 40 d in the annual amount mean daily duration and annual frequency of dh per 100 m increase in elevation respectively 4 discussion 4 1 seasonal patterns of dh in alpine regions it is commonly believed that the autumn september to november in the mid latitudes of the northern hemisphere is the season with the largest amount of dh over the year wang et al 2017a this is because the nocturnal weather conditions in autumn are conducive to radiation cooling iijima and shinoda 2002 however this study shows that this may be not a universal phenomenon the results indicate that the monthly amount of dh shows significant seasonal characteristics and the seasonal characteristics of dh are basically the same at different elevations i e the warm season may to october is the season with the higher monthly amount of dh while the cold season november through april is the season with the lower monthly amount of dh as can be seen from fig 7 the mean monthly amount of dh at the four observation sites located at different elevations was the maximum in august and the minimum in february the seasonal characteristics of dh in the hulu catchment are consistent with the monthly variations of temperature and relative humidity i e the monthly mean temperature and monthly mean relative humidity are highest in august and lowest in february respectively the seasonal characteristics of dh in the hulu catchment suggest that the monthly variations of dh in alpine regions are influenced by temperature and relative humidity however the seasonal variations of dh in other regions are not completely influenced by temperature and relative humidity a six years of dew without the formation of hoarfrost observations conducted in the negev desert which has a mediterranean climate indicated that the total monthly amount of dew shows two maxima in september and in december january and two minima in april and november zangvil 1996 among them the monthly amount of dew was the largest in december and the smallest in april the monthly variations of dew in the negev desert were not consistent with the variations in temperature and relative humidity and the inconsistency of the monthly variations of dew with the variations in temperature and relative humidity was also found in humid grassland area in the netherlands with temperate maritime climate jacobs et al 2006 although the distribution of monthly amount of dew hoarfrost included is relatively evenly over the year there is still a slight tendency for lower dew amounts during the longest daylight period may to july and vice versa during the autumn jacobs et al 2006 the monthly variations of dh in different climatic zones mentioned above indicate that dh has certain seasonal patterns and the seasonal patterns of dh have obvious regional differences the seasonal patterns of dh may be influenced by a combination of meteorological factors and the amount of dh in different months may affect by different dominant meteorological factors which needs to be further investigated 4 2 elevation dependence of dh in alpine regions elevation altitude was reported as playing an important role in determining dew formation in the negev desert near the mediterranean sea i e the amount and days of dew increased with elevation which may be explained by the more efficient nocturnal radiational cooling occurring at higher elevations kidron 1999 however the results suggested that the elevation dependence of dh in the hulu catchment was diametrically opposed to that in arid regions not only does the amount and frequency of dh decrease with increasing elevation but also the duration of dh decreases with increasing elevation fig 11 the reasons for the elevation dependence of the amount duration and frequency of dh with increasing elevation may be in relation to meteorological factors duvdevani 1953 in addition to the surface soil heat flux other meteorological factors such as air temperature wind speed relative humidity and net radiation in the hulu catchment show a significant elevation dependence yang et al 2019 chen et al 2014 fig 12 provides ample evidence of the elevation dependence of meteorological factors other than the surface soil heat flux in the formation of dh at nights the elevation dependence of air temperature and relative humidity leads to the dew point temperature decrease with increasing elevation the premise for dh formation is that the surface temperature is equal to or lower than the dew point temperature and the larger difference between the dew point temperature and the surface temperature the more favorable the formation of dh as evidenced by the elevation dependence difference between the dew point temperature and the surface temperature with dh formation at nights fig 13 in summary the elevation dependence of meteorological factors is the main reason for the elevation dependence of dh while the difference between dew point temperature and the surface temperature at night decreases with increasing elevation is the direct reason for the decrease in dh with increasing elevation in the hulu catchment it should be noted that the elevation dependence of dh in the hulu catchment is not linear which is related to the calculation method of dew point temperature from eq 2 and equation 4 it is clear that the dew point temperature is a function of air temperature and relative humidity and the relationship between dew point temperature and air temperature and relative humidity is not linear bosen 1958 the opposite elevation dependence of dh in arid regions and alpine regions suggests that the formation and variations of dh have significant regional differences so that the elevation effects on dh must be considered 4 3 contribution and role of dh in the water balance and ecosystem previous studies on the precipitation gradient showed that there was a significant linear relationship between precipitation and elevation based on more than 20 sets of rain gauges and t200b precipitation observation at different elevations in the hulu catchment wang et al 2017b chen et al 2015 which can be expressed by eq 19 wang 2020 19 y 0 32 x 471 49 r 2 0 94 where x m a s l is the elevation y mm is the annual precipitation it is obvious that the annual precipitation increases with the increase in elevation and the coefficient of determination between annual precipitation and elevation is 0 94 based on eqs 16 and 19 the mean annual amount of dh varied from 3 mm to 33 mm the precipitation varied from 450 mm to 1050 mm and the trends in the annual amount of dh and precipitation with increasing elevation were reversed in the hulu catchment the contribution of the annual amount of dh in annual precipitation ranged from 0 3 to 7 3 indicating that the amount of dh was not a critical component of the surface water balance but was mostly neglected on the studies of surface water input in the past despite the contribution of dh to precipitation in the hulu catchment is not critical it cannot be ignored as dh plays an important role in the operation of alpine ecosystems the climatic characteristics of alpine regions are extremely specific typically characterized by low temperature high wind speed strong radiation and large differences in diurnal temperature han et al 2018 chen et al 2014 the strong daytime evapotranspiration in the warm season causes an extreme deficit in topsoil moisture leading to water stress for vegetation and microorganisms while the frequent formation and long duration of dh is an effective supplement to the deficit in topsoil moisture especially at night without precipitation the low temperature and extreme diurnal temperature difference in alpine regions especially the sharp diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature tend to cause temperature stress to vegetation and microorganisms the formation of dh releases latent heat and mitigates the loss of surface heat due to strong radiation cooling at night zhou et al 2002 liu et al 1998 which plays a role in reducing diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature especially the formation of hoarfrost which protects vegetation and microorganisms from frost thus reducing the temperature stress of vegetation and microorganisms in alpine regions dh supplements water deficits in the topsoil and reduces diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature playing a vital role in mitigating water and temperature stress on vegetation and microorganisms thus contributing to the operation of ecosystems in alpine regions 5 conclusions although dh is a common natural weather phenomenon in alpine regions understanding of its formation and variations are still limited and the contribution and role of dh in surface water balance and ecosystems are mostly neglected based on measurement and estimation of dh it was found that the formation of dh was accompanied by significant changes in meteorological factors indicating that the formation of dh was the result of a combination of meteorological factors interannual variations in the amount duration and frequency of dh were not significant but there was a clear seasonal pattern within years suggesting that the warm season was more conducive to the dh formation than the cold season the amount duration and frequency of dh showed a decreasing trend with increasing elevation demonstrating a significant elevation dependence of dh the seasonal and elevation dependence of dh in the hulu catchment depends on the seasonal and elevation dependence of meteorological factors the mean annual amount of dh ranged from 3 mm to 33 mm and its contribution to precipitation ranged from 0 3 to 7 3 indicating that dh is not a critical component of surface water input in the hulu catchment but it is ecologically important dh supplements surface water deficits caused by strong evaporation during the day while the formation of dh releases heat to slow diurnal fluctuations in surface temperature playing an important role in alleviating water and temperature stress on vegetation and microorganisms and maintaining the operation of ecosystems therefore research into the formation and variations of dh are of vital significance to understand the energy transfer water cycle and ecosystem operation in alpine regions credit

7942,study region the study region is represented by seven irrigation districts distributed under different climate and topography conditions in italy study focus this study explores the reliability and consistency of the global era5 single levels and era5 land reanalysis datasets in predicting the main agrometeorological estimates commonly used for crop water requirements calculation in particular the reanalysis data was compared variable by variable e g solar radiation rs air temperature tair relative humidity rh wind speed u10 reference evapotranspiration et0 with in situ agrometeorological observations obtained from 66 automatic weather stations 2008 2020 in addition the presence of a climate dependency on their accuracy was assessed at the different irrigation districts new hydrological insights for the region a general good agreement was obtained between observed and reanalysis agrometeorological variables at both daily and seasonal scales the best performance was obtained for tair followed by rh rs and u10 for both reanalysis datasets especially under temperate climate conditions these performances were translated into slightly higher accuracy of et0 estimates by era5 land product confirming the potential of using reanalysis datasets as an alternative data source for retrieving the et0 and overcoming the unavailability of observed agrometeorological data graphical abstract ga1 keywords weather ground based observation reanalysis dataset data processing modelling and simulation water management irrigation 1 introduction the quantitative estimation of the evapotranspiration et fluxes exchanged within the soil plant atmosphere continuum is a precondition for rational irrigation scheduling crop yield forecasting and hydrological modelling applications hupet and vanclooster 2001 nowadays the crop reference et et0 formulation proposed by penman monteith p m and popularized by the fao 56 paper as a reference methodology for calculating crop water requirements allen et al 1998 is still largely used for practical purposes pereira et al 2015 the use of the p m approach calls for the necessity of having a reliable and complete set of site specific agrometeorological data in fact the p m approach calculates the et0 for a standard surface requiring a complete set of ground based agrometeorological data such as the air temperature tair the wind speed u2 the solar radiation rs and the relative humidity rh to parameterize the surface and aerodynamic resistances commonly agrometeorological variables are measured by automatic weather stations their data integrity is ensured by proper data quality assessment and control procedures de pauw et al 2000 however ground based observations could be affected by several errors mainly due to the sensor properties such as their accuracy settings instrument drift or temporal data sampling frequency beven 1979 hupet and vanclooster 2001 meyer et al 1989 other shortcomings are related to the agrometeorological time series consistency the time series can suffer from substantial time gaps capra et al 2013 and often protocols for correcting and or estimating poor quality or missing data need to be applied see e g pereira et al 2015 moreover the agrometeorological data representativeness of well watered conditions needs to be checked before implementing them in the et0 approach pereira et al 2015 despite the utmost importance of observed agrometeorological data for agriculture purposes the agrometeorological networks are often sparse over the territory especially in arid zones de pauw et al 2000 sometimes data access is another critical point for end users because data is managed and distributed by different regional services at the national level pelosi et al 2021 to compensate for the lack of spatial and temporal distributed information other weather data sources have steadily developed such as the use of interpolation methods from gauge based observations the adoption of satellite based datasets or the creation of gridded datasets obtained by adjusting the spatial interpolation estimates with satellite observations pelosi et al 2020 moreover during the last century great advances have been reached in agrometeorological data forecasting using global and regional numerical weather prediction nwp models several studies have already exploited their potential for supporting sustainable irrigation management e g negm et al 2017 chirico et al 2018 longo minnolo et al 2020 medina et al 2018 pelosi et al 2016 vanella et al 2020 as an example vanella et al 2020 showed that the use of forecast agrometeorological estimates provided by the consortium for small scale modelling cosmo http www cosmo model org opens promising perspectives for assessing the et0 in different agriculture contexts particularly under conditions of water scarcity instead than using past agrometeorological data besides the nwp models the use of atmospheric reanalysis is another alternative weather data source atmospheric reanalysis has generated increasing interest in the recent decade due to its ability to provide complete and consistent time series of multiple meteorological parameters at a global scale by covering several decades tarek et al 2020 from a theoretical point of view the reanalysis process is a retrospective analysis of past historical data this process makes use of the ever increasing computational resources recent versions of nwp models and assimilation schemes in general the reanalysis approaches assimilate a wide array of atmospheric and ocean measured and remotely sensed information within a dynamical physical coupled numerical model poli et al 2016 one of the recognized advantages of using reanalysis approaches is that their outputs are not directly dependent on the density of ground based observational networks thus they have the potential to provide variables in areas with little and or no surface coverage tarek et al 2020 moreover pelosi et al 2020 reported that reanalysis data can represent an efficient data source for planning and design studies applied to irrigation water management currently several modelling centres provide reanalysis products at variable spatial and temporal scales lindsay et al 2014 chaudhuri et al 2013 as an example the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf periodically applies its forecast models and data assimilation systems to reanalyse archived observations for generating global data sets describing the recent history of the atmosphere land surface and oceans the latest released ecmwf reanalysis products are era5 single levels era5 and era5 land era5 l which are being produced within the copernicus climate change service and freely distributed since 2019 the first dataset era5 covers the entire globe from 1979 at a spatial resolution of about 30 km depending on latitude the second dataset era5 l has been produced by replaying the land component of the era5 climate reanalysis with a horizontal spatial resolution of 9 km specifically era5 l uses air temperature tair air humidity and air pressure in a process of atmospheric forcing as input to control the simulated land fields these atmospheric variables are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of era5 l muñoz sabater 2019 a comprehensive review of the state of the art associated with the use of era5 l for land and environmental applications is presented by muñoz sabater et al 2021 they demonstrated the added value of era5 l reanalysis products in comparison to era interim and era5 for estimating a wide range of in situ observations even if they have not evaluated the performance of the reanalysis products in predicting et fluxes the specific objective of this study was to explore the effectiveness of using the most advanced global ecmwf reanalysis data era5 single levels and era5 l as a potential data source for predicting the main agrometeorological variables and estimating the et0 in different climate contexts within the italian territory at daily and seasonal scales in addition visual geographic information system gis based user friendly tools have been developed in this study for guiding the users in the reanalyses data pre processing steps 2 materials and methods the methodological approach proposed in this study was carried out in the framework of the research project integrated computer modeling and monitoring for irrigation planning in italy incipit the general aim of the incipit project is to identify a shared set of modelling tools and monitoring techniques for the assessment of irrigation water uses in seven irrigation districts distributed over the italian territory in this context time series of daily values of the agrometeorological variables registered in 66 weather stations referred to as the incipit irrigation districts table 1 and fig 1 were collected the use of the new generation ecmwf reanalysis datasets was then evaluated in comparison to the retrieved ground based agrometeorological data for the et0 estimation 2 1 ground based agrometeorological variables at the study sites the observed agrometeorological data was acquired on a daily scale from 66 weather stations located in six different italian administrative regions campania emilia romagna lombardy apulia sardinia and sicily within the reference period 2008 2020 from january 1st 2008 to december 31st 2020 due to the trans regional component of this study the observed agrometeorological data were provided from multiple ground based sources managed by different regional meteorological agencies located in each of the irrigation districts of interest fig 1 and table 1 the set of agrometeorological variables under investigation was composed of solar radiation rs w m 2 maximum and minimum tair measured at 2 m c maximum and minimum relative humidity rh wind speed measured at 2 m u2 m s 1 and 10 m u10 m s 1 respectively and et0 estimates calculated with the p m approach mm d 1 the selection of the weather stations was based on a twofold criterion firstly they were identified by setting a maximum distance 50 km between the centroid of each of the 7 irrigation districts under study whose coordinates are reported in table 1 and the candidate weather stations secondly the selection was refined based on the temporal consistency i e continuous time series and completeness i e the complete set of data of the available agrometeorological series under these criteria more than 50 million records were acquired from 66 weather stations covering a great range of climatic conditions mainly in terms of the different irrigation district geographic locations i e northern central and insular italy and elevation features table 1 note that the available dataset for sardinia sites was only composed of the et0 estimates in particular under the improved köppen geiger classification recently provided at 1 km resolution by beck et al 2018 a number of 7 weather stations located in apulia are characterized by arid steppe cold climate bsk 24 sites placed in campania sicily eastern and western part and sardinia are featured by dry and hot summer temperate climate csa and 32 sites located in emilia romagna

data processing steps are described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 respectively 2 3 reanalysis data collection and characteristics in this study the most advanced global reanalysis data produced in europe by ecmwf has been used era5 single levels hersbach et al 2020 and era5 l muñoz sabater 2019 the main technical details of these reanalysis datasets are reported in table 2 the era5 dataset is the 5th generation of ecmwf global reanalysis succeeding era interim and covering the entire globe from 1979 at a spatial resolution of about 30 km the era5 l dataset is generated for the entire globe with a native horizontal resolution of about 9 km released on a regular 0 1 x 0 1 grid by replaying the land component of era5 climate reanalysis from 1981 to 2 3 months before the present specifically the atmospheric forcing in era5 l is provided by land fields of era5 atmospheric variables in era5 tair air humidity and air pressure are corrected to account for the elevation difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of era5 l according to the so called lapse rate correction muñoz sabater 2019 although era5 l runs at the enhanced spatial resolution there is a limit that data are not provided for numerical grid points falling on the sea surface or in the proximity of the coastline pelosi et al 2020 the era5 and era5 l reanalysis datasets were

daily time step to be compared variable by variable with the ground based observations the daily minimum and maximum tair and tdew values were obtained from the hourly data the daily tair comparisons were carried out considering the average of the daily maximum tmax and minimum temperatures tmin the daily rs values were aggregated on 24 h basis the daily rh was calculated as the ratio between the actual ea and the saturation eo t vapour pressure using the average tair and tdew derived on 24 h basis as inputs according to the formula proposed in allen et al 1998 1 rh 100 e a e o t 2 e a e o t

retrieved by era5 and era5 l datasets as reported in allen et al 1998 note that the wind speed comparison between the ground based and reanalysis observations was performed on the u10 basis the wind speed at 2 m u2 was rescaled from the logarithmic wind profile for being used as input in the et0 calculation using the p m approach see section 2 3 the above mentioned reanalysis datasets data pre processing steps were performed using five ad hoc gis based toolboxes developed in arcpy esri see supplementary materials section the reanalysis post processed data were extracted from the overall domain at the weather stations location variable by variable fig 1 finally as for the daily ground based data the reanalysis data were aggregated in four periods for seasonality analyses using the same time step as used for the ground based data 2 4 calculating daily et0 estimates although era5 single levels and era5 l provide potential evapotranspiration data etp this variable is conceptually different from et0 estimates as defined in the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 in particular etp is computed in era5 based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to crops mixed farming and assuming no stress from soil moisture hersbach et al 2018 whereas etp in era5 l is computed as open water evaporation assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by the artificial surface condition muñoz 2019 thus in this study daily et0 estimates were obtained by implementing the reanalysis of agrometeorological data through the penman monteith pm method penman 1956

the comparisons between the reanalysis based agrometeorological estimations from era5 and era5 l respectively and the ground based observations were assessed using different statistical metrics such as the slope of the regression line forced by the origin the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse eq 5 the mean bias error bias eq 6 the mean absolute error mae eq 7 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 8 calculated as follows 5 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n 6 mae 1 n s i o i 7 pbias s i o i o i 100 8 nrmse rmse o ˆ where s i is the simulated value by era5 and era5

observations the difference in reproducing the agrometeorological variables by era5 and era5 l products respectively was assessed by applying the least squares linear regression method and by comparing the outputs of the regression lines in terms of slope for p values 0 05 this statistical analysis was conducted using the r software r core team 2020 the evaluation of the topographic effect on the agrometeorological variables obtained by the reanalysis datasets was assessed by comparing the elevation of the selected weather stations table 1 with the average elevation observed at the cell size of the era5 single levels and era5 l datasets 30 and 9 km respectively see supplementary materials section in particular the main zonal statistics count mean minimum maximum standard deviation and median values of the elevation values were extracted at the level of the cell containing the weather stations table 1 from a digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 75 m released by the italian ministry of the environment and the protection of the territory and the sea 3 results 3 1 agrometeorological variable by variable comparisons the description of the main results obtained

seasons table 5 greater accuracy was obtained at lombardy winter autumn seasons and western sicily spring summer seasons study sites while lower accuracy was obtained at apulia study sites for all seasons table 5 4 discussion climate reanalysis data have been widely used for hydrological and meteorological applications however it is still difficult to quantitatively estimate their accuracy due to their variability both at spatial and temporal scales especially under complex topography and pronounced climatic heterogeneity i e the rainfall jiao et al 2021 often ground variables are taken into account in the reanalysis process such as air pressure tair rh and u10 to improve the reanalysis data quality however if the data assimilation approach can improve data accuracy by adding physically meaningful information from the predictive model this is still subject to uncertainty the main sources of uncertainty are due to numerical simulations assimilation schemes and errors associated with the observation systems dee et al 2011 in this sense some studies showed that it is difficult to completely replace observational data with reanalysis information for describing the true state of the atmosphere bengtsson et al 2004 e g for long term climate trend studies liu et al 2018 and or for capturing seasonal and inter annual changes jiao et al 2021 this study explored the potential of using the new released ecmwf climate reanalysis datasets i e era5 and era5 l for proving daily and seasonal agrometeorological information tair rs rh u10 and et0 by determining their performance against measured ground based observations within the italian territory in the reference period 2008 2020 moreover since new user requirements are constantly emerging in society muñoz sabater et al 2021 ad hoc user interfaces gis based user friendly tools have been developed in this study for supporting the needs of a diverse set of users next to the climate and weather research motivations within the reanalysis data pre processing steps fig 1 s 4 s herein a generally good agreement was observed between the ability of era5 and era5 l products in reproducing the agrometeorological variables of interest commonly used for et calculation in comparison to the ground based observations collected at 66 study sites distributed over 7 irrigation districts specifically the daily tair estimates offered the most accurate reanalysis predictions followed by the rh rs and u10 variables which still provided satisfactory results tables 3 4 figs 3 5 similar i e for rh or slightly improved statistical metrics were obtained by era5 in comparison to era5 l i e showing lower rmse values than era5 l for tair and rs respectively in 67 and 83 of the total number of the investigated irrigation districts this can be attributed to the fact these variables are more homogeneous at the spatial scales provided by era5 products in comparison to era5 l fig 5 s in supplementary materials section the u10 performance was always more consistent for era5 than era5 l in comparison to the observations at all irrigation districts most likely because era5 l does not consider the influence of the sea surface in its products muñoz sabater 2019 altogether the daily tair rs rh and u10 estimates were more accurate during the autumn season for both reanalysis datasets tables 3 4 the influence of topographic features on the accuracy of the reanalysis data was also investigated following the evidence that it could be significant provided by previous studies for example gao and hao 2014 evaluated the relationship existing between the elevation of the climate reanalysis data from era interim and the observed station s elevation these authors pointed out that differences in elevation can affect the accuracy of the reanalysis data especially in areas with relatively higher altitudes analogous considerations are reported by longo minnolo et al 2022 for a sicilian watershed with elevation values ranging between 0 and 3313 m a s l for which the highest rmse values were observed in the era5 l cells with relatively higher variations in altitude to overcome these shortcomings in mountainous areas other authors suggest applying altitude correction procedures especially for water vapour precipitation and tair estimates zhao et al 2008 feng et al 2012 hu et al 2013 negm et al 2018 for altitudes below 1000 m a s l however jiao et al 2021 found a good agreement between climate reanalysis and observational data similar results emerged from this study where no specific relationships were obtained between the elevation changes and the goodness of reanalysis datasets in reproducing the agrometeorological variables of interest at the site by site scale within the seven irrigation districts under investigation table 1 these findings show that the accuracy of the reanalyses products is strongly connected with the climatic conditions rather than the topographic distribution of the selected study sites due to the above mentioned explanations and for maintaining the integrity of the reanalysis datasets no topography corrections were applied in this study the performance of reanalysis data strongly depends on the different climate conditions characterizing the investigated sites as shown by tarek et al 2020 specifically these authors observed that tair and precipitation estimated by era5 are systematically more performant in comparison to era interim at all the 13 northern america climate zones under study in addition they reported that in situ measurements are higher than era5 for cfa and hot summer humid continental dfa climate zones elsewhere these differences are less pronounced in this sense they did not experience the difference in hydrological modelling performance using both era5 products and observations over 9 of the 13 climate zones for the remaining regions bsk cfa dfa and warm summer humid continental climate dfb the use of observations resulted in improved hydrological modelling performance in agreement with tarek et al 2020 in our study site specific performance depended on the different investigated climate conditions table 1 in particular the major part of the variables of interest rs rh u10 and et0 resulted in greater and lower performance under csa and bks climate conditions respectively by both reanalysis datasets except for tair estimates provided by era5 that shows an inverted pattern due to the influence of the sea temperature in this product hersbach et al 2020 intermediate performance was observed under cfa climate zones the good quality of the reanalysis data was translated into reliable daily and seasonal et0 estimates with an underestimation from 2 up to 13 for the climate classes under study specifically as for the other variables et0 estimates were more accurate in autumn winter than in spring summer by both reanalysis datasets in terms of rmse values table 5 and fig 6 in addition era5 l reproduces with greater accuracy and higher spatial resolution the et0 observations at most of the study sites even under different climate conditions i e showing lower rmse values than era5 in 86 of the total number of the irrigation districts under study thus the high accuracy obtained in this study when estimating et0 by reanalysis products resulting in rmse and nrmse values ranging between 0 57 and 0 90 mm d 1 and from 0 17 to 0 31 respectively suggests the potential use of this information for calculating the daily crop evapotranspiration rates aiming at supporting the irrigation scheduling in this sense rolle et al 2021 have recently estimated the global irrigation requirement of 26 crops by implementing the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 to calculate et0 by using information on tair and rs retrieved by the era5 dataset other studies assessed the use of a blended set of weather input data composed of era5 l outputs and different sources of climate data i e reanalysis data and satellite based radiation data to evaluate the et0 for the campania region pelosi et al 2020 pelosi and chirico 2021 pelosi et al 2021 combined the era5 l products with multispectral satellite imagery for estimating the past crop evapotranspiration under this scenario the results of the present study may contribute to the informed use of reanalysis data in water management applications in italy and elsewhere 5 conclusion this study explores the performance of the era5 single levels and era5 l in depicting the agrometeorological data from 2008 to 2020 in comparison to observational data measured at 66 sites distributed over 7 irrigation districts over the italian territory specifically the main findings that can be drawn from this study are the following the daily average tair estimates offered the most accurate reanalysis predictions followed by rh rs and u10 variables this was translated into reliable daily et0 estimates resulting in rmse and nrmse values ranging between 0 57 and 0 90 mm d 1 and from 0 17 to 0 31 respectively similar or slightly improved statistical metrics were obtained by era5 in comparison to era5 l in estimating rh tair and rs whereas the u10 and et0 performances were more consistent by era5 and era5 l respectively when compared to the observations at the majority of the irrigation districts under study the rs rh u10 and et0 estimates resulted in higher and lower performance under csa and bks climate conditions respectively by both reanalysis datasets conversely a reverse pattern was obtained for tair estimates provided by era5 being more accurate under bsk intermediate performance was observed under cfa climate zones these results help to improve our understanding of the uncertain sources of reanalysis data under different climate conditions the rational application of these datasets and the potential improvements for the next product generation in addition they open promising perspectives for the use of reanalysis data as an alternative data source to estimate et0 for irrigation water management in different climate contexts

7942,study region the study region is represented by seven irrigation districts distributed under different climate and topography conditions in italy study focus this study explores the reliability and consistency of the global era5 single levels and era5 land reanalysis datasets in predicting the main agrometeorological estimates commonly used for crop water requirements calculation in particular the reanalysis data was compared variable by variable e g solar radiation rs air temperature tair relative humidity rh wind speed u10 reference evapotranspiration et0 with in situ agrometeorological observations obtained from 66 automatic weather stations 2008 2020 in addition the presence of a climate dependency on their accuracy was assessed at the different irrigation districts new hydrological insights for the region a general good agreement was obtained between observed and reanalysis agrometeorological variables at both daily and seasonal scales the best performance was obtained for tair followed by rh rs and u10 for both reanalysis datasets especially under temperate climate conditions these performances were translated into slightly higher accuracy of et0 estimates by era5 land product confirming the potential of using reanalysis datasets as an alternative data source for retrieving the et0 and overcoming the unavailability of observed agrometeorological data graphical abstract ga1 keywords weather ground based observation reanalysis dataset data processing modelling and simulation water management irrigation 1 introduction the quantitative estimation of the evapotranspiration et fluxes exchanged within the soil plant atmosphere continuum is a precondition for rational irrigation scheduling crop yield forecasting and hydrological modelling applications hupet and vanclooster 2001 nowadays the crop reference et et0 formulation proposed by penman monteith p m and popularized by the fao 56 paper as a reference methodology for calculating crop water requirements allen et al 1998 is still largely used for practical purposes pereira et al 2015 the use of the p m approach calls for the necessity of having a reliable and complete set of site specific agrometeorological data in fact the p m approach calculates the et0 for a standard surface requiring a complete set of ground based agrometeorological data such as the air temperature tair the wind speed u2 the solar radiation rs and the relative humidity rh to parameterize the surface and aerodynamic resistances commonly agrometeorological variables are measured by automatic weather stations their data integrity is ensured by proper data quality assessment and control procedures de pauw et al 2000 however ground based observations could be affected by several errors mainly due to the sensor properties such as their accuracy settings instrument drift or temporal data sampling frequency beven 1979 hupet and vanclooster 2001 meyer et al 1989 other shortcomings are related to the agrometeorological time series consistency the time series can suffer from substantial time gaps capra et al 2013 and often protocols for correcting and or estimating poor quality or missing data need to be applied see e g pereira et al 2015 moreover the agrometeorological data representativeness of well watered conditions needs to be checked before implementing them in the et0 approach pereira et al 2015 despite the utmost importance of observed agrometeorological data for agriculture purposes the agrometeorological networks are often sparse over the territory especially in arid zones de pauw et al 2000 sometimes data access is another critical point for end users because data is managed and distributed by different regional services at the national level pelosi et al 2021 to compensate for the lack of spatial and temporal distributed information other weather data sources have steadily developed such as the use of interpolation methods from gauge based observations the adoption of satellite based datasets or the creation of gridded datasets obtained by adjusting the spatial interpolation estimates with satellite observations pelosi et al 2020 moreover during the last century great advances have been reached in agrometeorological data forecasting using global and regional numerical weather prediction nwp models several studies have already exploited their potential for supporting sustainable irrigation management e g negm et al 2017 chirico et al 2018 longo minnolo et al 2020 medina et al 2018 pelosi et al 2016 vanella et al 2020 as an example vanella et al 2020 showed that the use of forecast agrometeorological estimates provided by the consortium for small scale modelling cosmo http www cosmo model org opens promising perspectives for assessing the et0 in different agriculture contexts particularly under conditions of water scarcity instead than using past agrometeorological data besides the nwp models the use of atmospheric reanalysis is another alternative weather data source atmospheric reanalysis has generated increasing interest in the recent decade due to its ability to provide complete and consistent time series of multiple meteorological parameters at a global scale by covering several decades tarek et al 2020 from a theoretical point of view the reanalysis process is a retrospective analysis of past historical data this process makes use of the ever increasing computational resources recent versions of nwp models and assimilation schemes in general the reanalysis approaches assimilate a wide array of atmospheric and ocean measured and remotely sensed information within a dynamical physical coupled numerical model poli et al 2016 one of the recognized advantages of using reanalysis approaches is that their outputs are not directly dependent on the density of ground based observational networks thus they have the potential to provide variables in areas with little and or no surface coverage tarek et al 2020 moreover pelosi et al 2020 reported that reanalysis data can represent an efficient data source for planning and design studies applied to irrigation water management currently several modelling centres provide reanalysis products at variable spatial and temporal scales lindsay et al 2014 chaudhuri et al 2013 as an example the european centre for medium range weather forecasts ecmwf periodically applies its forecast models and data assimilation systems to reanalyse archived observations for generating global data sets describing the recent history of the atmosphere land surface and oceans the latest released ecmwf reanalysis products are era5 single levels era5 and era5 land era5 l which are being produced within the copernicus climate change service and freely distributed since 2019 the first dataset era5 covers the entire globe from 1979 at a spatial resolution of about 30 km depending on latitude the second dataset era5 l has been produced by replaying the land component of the era5 climate reanalysis with a horizontal spatial resolution of 9 km specifically era5 l uses air temperature tair air humidity and air pressure in a process of atmospheric forcing as input to control the simulated land fields these atmospheric variables are corrected to account for the altitude difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of era5 l muñoz sabater 2019 a comprehensive review of the state of the art associated with the use of era5 l for land and environmental applications is presented by muñoz sabater et al 2021 they demonstrated the added value of era5 l reanalysis products in comparison to era interim and era5 for estimating a wide range of in situ observations even if they have not evaluated the performance of the reanalysis products in predicting et fluxes the specific objective of this study was to explore the effectiveness of using the most advanced global ecmwf reanalysis data era5 single levels and era5 l as a potential data source for predicting the main agrometeorological variables and estimating the et0 in different climate contexts within the italian territory at daily and seasonal scales in addition visual geographic information system gis based user friendly tools have been developed in this study for guiding the users in the reanalyses data pre processing steps 2 materials and methods the methodological approach proposed in this study was carried out in the framework of the research project integrated computer modeling and monitoring for irrigation planning in italy incipit the general aim of the incipit project is to identify a shared set of modelling tools and monitoring techniques for the assessment of irrigation water uses in seven irrigation districts distributed over the italian territory in this context time series of daily values of the agrometeorological variables registered in 66 weather stations referred to as the incipit irrigation districts table 1 and fig 1 were collected the use of the new generation ecmwf reanalysis datasets was then evaluated in comparison to the retrieved ground based agrometeorological data for the et0 estimation 2 1 ground based agrometeorological variables at the study sites the observed agrometeorological data was acquired on a daily scale from 66 weather stations located in six different italian administrative regions campania emilia romagna lombardy apulia sardinia and sicily within the reference period 2008 2020 from january 1st 2008 to december 31st 2020 due to the trans regional component of this study the observed agrometeorological data were provided from multiple ground based sources managed by different regional meteorological agencies located in each of the irrigation districts of interest fig 1 and table 1 the set of agrometeorological variables under investigation was composed of solar radiation rs w m 2 maximum and minimum tair measured at 2 m c maximum and minimum relative humidity rh wind speed measured at 2 m u2 m s 1 and 10 m u10 m s 1 respectively and et0 estimates calculated with the p m approach mm d 1 the selection of the weather stations was based on a twofold criterion firstly they were identified by setting a maximum distance 50 km between the centroid of each of the 7 irrigation districts under study whose coordinates are reported in table 1 and the candidate weather stations secondly the selection was refined based on the temporal consistency i e continuous time series and completeness i e the complete set of data of the available agrometeorological series under these criteria more than 50 million records were acquired from 66 weather stations covering a great range of climatic conditions mainly in terms of the different irrigation district geographic locations i e northern central and insular italy and elevation features table 1 note that the available dataset for sardinia sites was only composed of the et0 estimates in particular under the improved köppen geiger classification recently provided at 1 km resolution by beck et al 2018 a number of 7 weather stations located in apulia are characterized by arid steppe cold climate bsk 24 sites placed in campania sicily eastern and western part and sardinia are featured by dry and hot summer temperate climate csa and 32 sites located in emilia romagna and lombardy are referred to no dry season hot summer temperate climate conditions cfa the quality of the ground based data was checked according to the procedure proposed in allen 1996 daily ground based data was aggregated in 4 periods for seasonality analyses on the astronomical basis as follows winter 1st january 19th march and 21st 31st december spring 20th march 20th june summer 21st june 22nd september and autumn 23rd september 20th december 2 2 reanalysis datasets description the technical characteristics of the used reanalysis datasets era5 single levels and era5 l and the related data processing steps are described in sections 2 2 1 and 2 2 2 respectively 2 3 reanalysis data collection and characteristics in this study the most advanced global reanalysis data produced in europe by ecmwf has been used era5 single levels hersbach et al 2020 and era5 l muñoz sabater 2019 the main technical details of these reanalysis datasets are reported in table 2 the era5 dataset is the 5th generation of ecmwf global reanalysis succeeding era interim and covering the entire globe from 1979 at a spatial resolution of about 30 km the era5 l dataset is generated for the entire globe with a native horizontal resolution of about 9 km released on a regular 0 1 x 0 1 grid by replaying the land component of era5 climate reanalysis from 1981 to 2 3 months before the present specifically the atmospheric forcing in era5 l is provided by land fields of era5 atmospheric variables in era5 tair air humidity and air pressure are corrected to account for the elevation difference between the grid of the forcing and the higher resolution grid of era5 l according to the so called lapse rate correction muñoz sabater 2019 although era5 l runs at the enhanced spatial resolution there is a limit that data are not provided for numerical grid points falling on the sea surface or in the proximity of the coastline pelosi et al 2020 the era5 and era5 l reanalysis datasets were freely downloaded from the climate change service copernicus platform https cds climate copernicus eu cdsapp search type dataset through the climate data store web interface v 1 0 in network common data form netcdf format for the entire italian domain 1221 79 916 46 km as for the ground based observations within the reference period 2008 2020 the hourly agrometeorological variables of interest were the tair 2m temperature t2m c and the dew point temperatures tdew named as 2m dewpoint temperature d2m m s 1 the rs surface solar radiation downwards ssrd j m 2 and the vertical and horizontal component of the wind speed 10m u component of wind u10 m s 1 and 10m v component of wind v10 m s 1 2 3 1 data pre processing steps both hourly era5 single levels and era5 l data were aggregated at a daily time step to be compared variable by variable with the ground based observations the daily minimum and maximum tair and tdew values were obtained from the hourly data the daily tair comparisons were carried out considering the average of the daily maximum tmax and minimum temperatures tmin the daily rs values were aggregated on 24 h basis the daily rh was calculated as the ratio between the actual ea and the saturation eo t vapour pressure using the average tair and tdew derived on 24 h basis as inputs according to the formula proposed in allen et al 1998 1 rh 100 e a e o t 2 e a e o t dew 0 6108 exp 17 27 t dew t dew 237 3 3 e o t 0 6108 exp 17 27 t air t air 237 3 the daily wind speed at 10 m u10 m s 1 was calculated using the horizontal and vertical components v10 and u10 retrieved by era5 and era5 l datasets as reported in allen et al 1998 note that the wind speed comparison between the ground based and reanalysis observations was performed on the u10 basis the wind speed at 2 m u2 was rescaled from the logarithmic wind profile for being used as input in the et0 calculation using the p m approach see section 2 3 the above mentioned reanalysis datasets data pre processing steps were performed using five ad hoc gis based toolboxes developed in arcpy esri see supplementary materials section the reanalysis post processed data were extracted from the overall domain at the weather stations location variable by variable fig 1 finally as for the daily ground based data the reanalysis data were aggregated in four periods for seasonality analyses using the same time step as used for the ground based data 2 4 calculating daily et0 estimates although era5 single levels and era5 l provide potential evapotranspiration data etp this variable is conceptually different from et0 estimates as defined in the fao 56 paper allen et al 1998 in particular etp is computed in era5 based on surface energy balance calculations with the vegetation parameters set to crops mixed farming and assuming no stress from soil moisture hersbach et al 2018 whereas etp in era5 l is computed as open water evaporation assuming that the atmosphere is not affected by the artificial surface condition muñoz 2019 thus in this study daily et0 estimates were obtained by implementing the reanalysis of agrometeorological data through the penman monteith pm method penman 1956 monteith 1965 as follows 4 et 0 0 408 δ r n g γ c n t 273 u 2 e s e a δ γ 1 c d u 2 where rn is the net radiation at the grass surface and g is the soil heat flux density in mj m 2 d 1 for a 24 h daily time step cn and cd are constants equal to 900 and 0 34 respectively which vary according to the time step the reference crop type and daytime night time ratio t is the mean daily tair c γ is the slope of the saturation vapour pressure curve at tair kpa c 1 γ is the psychrometric constant kpa c 1 es is the saturation vapour pressure at tair kpa ea is the average daily actual vapour pressure kpa and u2 is the average daily wind speed at 2 m height m s 1 note that the daily et0 ground based estimates mm d 1 were provided at all site locations by the regional meteorological agencies table 1 except for campania and emilia romagna regions for which daily et0 values were estimated by eq 4 using the agrometeorological information measured in situ 2 5 statistical indicators the comparisons between the reanalysis based agrometeorological estimations from era5 and era5 l respectively and the ground based observations were assessed using different statistical metrics such as the slope of the regression line forced by the origin the coefficient of determination r2 the root mean square error rmse eq 5 the mean bias error bias eq 6 the mean absolute error mae eq 7 and the normalized root mean square error nrmse eq 8 calculated as follows 5 rmse i 1 n s i o i 2 n 6 mae 1 n s i o i 7 pbias s i o i o i 100 8 nrmse rmse o ˆ where s i is the simulated value by era5 and era5 l dataset respectively o i is the observed value from the ground based agrometeorological stations where s ˆ and o ˆ are the averages of the data arrays of s i and o i and n is the number of observations the difference in reproducing the agrometeorological variables by era5 and era5 l products respectively was assessed by applying the least squares linear regression method and by comparing the outputs of the regression lines in terms of slope for p values 0 05 this statistical analysis was conducted using the r software r core team 2020 the evaluation of the topographic effect on the agrometeorological variables obtained by the reanalysis datasets was assessed by comparing the elevation of the selected weather stations table 1 with the average elevation observed at the cell size of the era5 single levels and era5 l datasets 30 and 9 km respectively see supplementary materials section in particular the main zonal statistics count mean minimum maximum standard deviation and median values of the elevation values were extracted at the level of the cell containing the weather stations table 1 from a digital elevation model with a spatial resolution of 75 m released by the italian ministry of the environment and the protection of the territory and the sea 3 results 3 1 agrometeorological variable by variable comparisons the description of the main results obtained

seasons table 5 greater accuracy was obtained at lombardy winter autumn seasons and western sicily spring summer seasons study sites while lower accuracy was obtained at apulia study sites for all seasons table 5 4 discussion climate reanalysis data have been widely used for hydrological and meteorological applications however it is still difficult to quantitatively estimate their accuracy due to their variability both at spatial and temporal scales especially under complex topography and pronounced climatic heterogeneity i e the rainfall jiao et al 2021 often ground variables are taken into account in the reanalysis process such as air pressure tair rh and u10 to improve the reanalysis data quality however if the data assimilation approach can improve data accuracy by adding physically meaningful information from the predictive model this is still subject to uncertainty the main sources of uncertainty are due to numerical simulations assimilation schemes and errors associated with the observation systems dee et al 2011 in this sense some studies showed that it is difficult to completely replace observational data with reanalysis information for describing the true state of the atmosphere bengtsson et al 2004 e g for long term climate trend studies liu et al 2018 and or for capturing seasonal and inter annual changes jiao et al 2021 this study explored the potential of using the new released ecmwf climate reanalysis datasets i e era5 and era5 l for proving daily and seasonal agrometeorological information tair rs rh u10 and et0 by determining their performance against measured ground based observations within the italian territory in the reference period 2008 2020 moreover since new user requirements are constantly emerging in society muñoz sabater et al 2021 ad hoc user interfaces gis based user friendly tools have been developed in this study for supporting the needs of a diverse set of users next to the climate and weather research motivations within the reanalysis data pre processing steps fig 1 s 4 s herein a generally good agreement was observed between the ability of era5 and era5 l products in reproducing the agrometeorological variables of interest commonly used for et calculation in comparison to the ground based observations collected at 66 study sites distributed over 7 irrigation districts specifically the daily tair estimates offered the most accurate reanalysis predictions followed by the rh rs and u10 variables which still provided satisfactory results tables 3 4 figs 3 5 similar i e for rh or slightly improved statistical metrics were obtained by era5 in comparison to era5 l i e showing lower rmse values than era5 l for tair and rs respectively in 67 and 83 of the total number of the investigated irrigation districts this can be attributed to the fact these variables are more homogeneous at the spatial scales provided by era5 products in comparison to era5 l fig 5 s in supplementary materials section the u10 performance was always more consistent for era5 than era5 l in comparison to the observations at all irrigation districts most likely because era5 l does not consider the influence of the sea surface in its products muñoz sabater 2019 altogether the daily tair rs rh and u10 estimates were more accurate during the autumn season for both reanalysis datasets tables 3 4 the influence of topographic features on the accuracy of the reanalysis data was also investigated following the evidence that it could be significant provided by previous studies for example gao and hao 2014 evaluated the relationship existing between the elevation of the climate reanalysis data from era interim and the observed station s elevation these authors pointed out that differences in elevation can affect the accuracy of the reanalysis data especially in areas with relatively higher altitudes analogous considerations are reported by longo minnolo et al 2022 for a sicilian watershed with elevation values ranging between 0 and 3313 m a s l for which the highest rmse values were observed in the era5 l cells with relatively higher variations in altitude to overcome these shortcomings in mountainous areas other authors suggest applying altitude correction procedures especially for water vapour precipitation and tair estimates zhao et al 2008 feng et al 2012 hu et al 2013 negm et al 2018 for altitudes below 1000 m a s l however jiao et al 2021 found a good agreement between climate reanalysis and observational data similar results emerged from this study where no specific relationships were obtained between the elevation changes and the goodness of reanalysis datasets in reproducing the agrometeorological variables of interest at the site by site scale within the seven irrigation districts under investigation table 1 these findings show that the accuracy of the reanalyses products is strongly connected with the climatic conditions rather than the topographic distribution of the selected study sites due to the above mentioned explanations and for maintaining the integrity of the reanalysis datasets no topography corrections were applied in this study the performance of reanalysis data strongly depends on the different climate conditions characterizing the investigated sites as shown by tarek et al 2020 specifically these authors observed that tair and precipitation estimated by era5 are systematically more performant in comparison to era interim at all the 13 northern america climate zones under study in addition they reported that in situ measurements are higher than era5 for cfa and hot summer humid continental dfa climate zones elsewhere these differences are less pronounced in this sense they did not experience the difference in hydrological modelling performance using both era5 products and observations over 9 of the 13 climate zones for the remaining regions bsk cfa dfa and warm summer humid continental climate dfb the use of observations resulted in improved hydrological modelling performance in agreement with tarek et al 2020 in our study site specific performance depended on the different investigated climate conditions table 1 in particular the major part of the variables of interest rs rh u10 and et0 resulted in greater and lower performance under csa and bks climate conditions respectively by both reanalysis datasets except for tair estimates provided by era5 that shows an inverted pattern due to the influence of the sea temperature in this product hersbach et al 2020 intermediate performance was observed under cfa climate zones the good quality of the reanalysis data was translated into reliable daily and seasonal et0 estimates with an underestimation from 2 up to 13 for the climate classes under study specifically as for the other variables et0 estimates were more accurate in autumn winter than in spring summer by both reanalysis datasets in terms of rmse values table 5 and fig 6 in addition era5 l reproduces with greater accuracy and higher spatial resolution the et0 observations at most of the study sites even under different climate conditions i e showing lower rmse values than era5 in 86 of the total number of the irrigation districts under study thus the high accuracy obtained in this study when estimating et0 by reanalysis products resulting in rmse and nrmse values ranging between 0 57 and 0 90 mm d 1 and from 0 17 to 0 31 respectively suggests the potential use of this information for calculating the daily crop evapotranspiration rates aiming at supporting the irrigation scheduling in this sense rolle et al 2021 have recently estimated the global irrigation requirement of 26 crops by implementing the hargreaves samani method hargreaves and samani 1985 to calculate et0 by using information on tair and rs retrieved by the era5 dataset other studies assessed the use of a blended set of weather input data composed of era5 l outputs and different sources of climate data i e reanalysis data and satellite based radiation data to evaluate the et0 for the campania region pelosi et al 2020 pelosi and chirico 2021 pelosi et al 2021 combined the era5 l products with multispectral satellite imagery for estimating the past crop evapotranspiration under this scenario the results of the present study may contribute to the informed use of reanalysis data in water management applications in italy and elsewhere 5 conclusion this study explores the performance of the era5 single levels and era5 l in depicting the agrometeorological data from 2008 to 2020 in comparison to observational data measured at 66 sites distributed over 7 irrigation districts over the italian territory specifically the main findings that can be drawn from this study are the following the daily average tair estimates offered the most accurate reanalysis predictions followed by rh rs and u10 variables this was translated into reliable daily et0 estimates resulting in rmse and nrmse values ranging between 0 57 and 0 90 mm d 1 and from 0 17 to 0 31 respectively similar or slightly improved statistical metrics were obtained by era5 in comparison to era5 l in estimating rh tair and rs whereas the u10 and et0 performances were more consistent by era5 and era5 l respectively when compared to the observations at the majority of the irrigation districts under study the rs rh u10 and et0 estimates resulted in higher and lower performance under csa and bks climate conditions respectively by both reanalysis datasets conversely a reverse pattern was obtained for tair estimates provided by era5 being more accurate under bsk intermediate performance was observed under cfa climate zones these results help to improve our understanding of the uncertain sources of reanalysis data under different climate conditions the rational application of these datasets and the potential improvements for the next product generation in addition they open promising perspectives for the use of reanalysis data as an alternative data source to estimate et0 for irrigation water management in different climate contexts

7943,study region northwestern uganda study focus siting water supply wells in fractured rock aquifers is challenging due to the heterogeneity of fracture systems since fractures must be both connected and abundant for water to be extracted in usable quantities two conceptual models explaining the permeability generating mechanisms have been proposed in the literature the faulting model and the weathering model to test these hypotheses we estimated hydraulic conductivity in northwestern uganda with eight inverse groundwater flow models calibrated to hydraulic heads and river discharge each model incorporated different assumptions about the hydraulic conductivity distribution based on age surface slopes and faults new hydrological insights for the region the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion and the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults were shown to have the best fit for these data because of model non uniqueness it is difficult to conclusively determine if either conceptual model is correct due to limited field observations however the results suggest that faulting could play a significant role in the regional groundwater flow field and further study is needed to determine the importance of normal faults in groundwater flow additionally results from the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion suggest that rock age is a poor predictor of weathering extent as spatially and temporally varying rates of erosion prevent a clear trend between age and hydraulic conductivity graphical abstract ga1 keywords fractured rock regional groundwater flow inverse modeling numerical modeling water supply data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction around the world many people depend on groundwater sourced from fractured rock aquifers for their water supply however water supply wells drilled in fractured rock are often dry or low yielding because they do not intersect hydraulically conductive fractures sander 1997 the motivation of this work is to gain an understanding of the permeability generation mechanisms in northern uganda because the region has experienced a growing population of refugees migrating from south sudan the growing population will need access to sufficient clean water supplies in a region of the world that lacks hydrologic data unfortunately the paucity of high quality data in the region leads to substantial uncertainty in identifying the driving permeability generation mechanisms while many boreholes have been drilled none have been outfitted with long term monitoring equipment and often only a single water level measurement is available from when the well was initially drilled our objective is to determine if groundwater models can help elucidate the primary regional scale permeability generating mechanism in northwestern uganda and as a result guide further studies to develop water management plans in the region numerous conceptual models exist to explain permeability and groundwater storage in crystalline bedrock aquifers these include compartmentalization of groundwater due to sealed fault zones mayo and koontz 2000 joints opening due to folding fischer and wilkerson 2000 intrusion of dikes delaney et al 1986 and lithological contacts cooke et al 2006 in this study we focus on two simplified models the weathering model and the faulting model lachassagne et al 2011 and maréchal et al 2004 argue that permeability is solely determined by weathering which occurs when water dissolves components of rock this is further supported by taylor and howard 2000 who claim that weathering changes the depth of the regolith weathered layer which in turn affects both the permeability and water storage these processes are concentrated in regions around the equator where surface weathering creates a relatively deep layer of saprolite above the bedrock taylor and howard 2000 and do not apply to glaciated regions additionally this conceptual model only applies to the near surface and does not affect deep groundwater flow alternatively according to acworth 1987 permeable zones are generated by tectonically induced fracturing while the overlying regolith provides the majority of the water storage this agrees with others who have shown that permeability is controlled by faults which open fractures in bedrock barton et al 1995 bense et al 2013 caine et al 1996 evans et al 1997 micarelli et al 2003 molnar et al 2007 to test the applicability of these conceptual models a series of inverse regional groundwater flow models at a 1 km resolution were employed hydraulic head and flux data were compiled from existing borehole datasets and the conceptual models were evaluated based on how closely they matched these data modeling fractured rock aquifers has been done in three different ways the equivalent porous media approach discrete fracture approach and the dual porosity approach cook 2003 the equivalent porous media approach assumes that at some scale a representative elementary volume rev can be assigned where the average properties of the aquifer can be assumed constant at any scale greater than the rev the discrete fracture approach requires detailed information about the orientation length and structure of individual fractures dual porosity models specify parameters for both the fracture system and the matrix and are mostly used for cases where the matrix is very porous e g sandstone this study utilized the equivalent porous media approach but explicitly modeled mapped faults the equivalent porous media approach has been shown to be effective for many highly heterogenous systems including karst abusaada and sauter 2013 ghasemizadeh et al 2015 scanlon et al 2003 and fractured rock jarrahi et al 2019 jaunat et al 2016 the equivalent porous media approach is justified here for a few reasons first the rev is likely much smaller than the grid size used in the model for regional scale features while fracture density likely varies on a much smaller scale than the grid cell size over the 1 km2 cell size there is an average conductivity that incorporates smaller scale variation in fracture density similarly because the fault zones are large scale features we do not represent smaller fractures within the fault zone but rather assume a bulk conductivity for the entire zone second the study area has limited data on the specific characteristics of the fault zone fractures and therefore the distribution and orientation of fracture properties are unknown thus the discrete fracture model is not possible given the data limitations dual porosity models would be viable candidates for model selection however given that the number of parameters would increase by a factor of 2 matrix and fracture values for each parameter present we settled on the equivalent porous media approach both to maintain model simplicity and because blessent et al 2014 showed that dual porosity models had similar prediction errors when compared to equivalent porous media models groundwater flow model calibration involves non unique solutions which complicates the evaluation of conceptual models as multiple conductivity fields can provide the same fit to hydraulic head and streamflow data while these limitations exist many studies have used calibrated groundwater models to better understand fractured rock systems including hydraulic conductivity dependence on depth sanford 2017 movement of radioactive materials from a waste disposal site blessent et al 2011 and understanding controls on well yield in fractured rock aquifers bianchi et al 2020 similarly nastev et al 2005 used a calibrated model of southwestern quebec to constrain recharge and hydraulic conductivity values and dewandel et al 2021 showed that uniform regional hydraulic conductivity field with only two zones produced similar results to a more complicated mapped conductivity field while non unique solutions can cause issues for conceptual model evaluation many studies have utilized calibrated groundwater models to understand regional groundwater flow in fractured rock systems however these studies all had the benefit of extensive existing data sources to draw upon in this study we tested if model calibration in a data poor region could be used to determine the primary permeability generation mechanism in northwestern uganda 2 study area this study focuses on the northwestern part of uganda this region is useful for testing the importance of faulting and weathering processes in permeability generation because it contains both a deep weathered zone and significant tectonic activity northwestern uganda underwent deep weathering during the jurassic and cretaceous and was uplifted in the mid miocene due to rifting taylor and howard 1999 this began a period of erosion however the areas in the uplifted terrain that have shallow slopes will likely still have deep regolith layers and therefore higher permeability and storage since granitic bedrock underlies most of the study area and fluid flow in granite has previously been associated with faulting sausse and genter 2005 it is possible that tectonic activity plays a significant role in the permeability structure at a regional scale this study does not account for the transient nature of fault permeability but rather we assume that the average permeability of a fault zone is increased due to an increase in fracture density the albertine rift valley which has been shown to be seismically active bwambale et al 2015 martini et al 2013 and the aswa lineament which has also shown signs of seismic activity volon et al 1998 both pass through near the study area between these two fault zones there is an area lacking significant tectonic activity setting up an ideal condition to test the conceptual models northwestern uganda contains two different geologic settings within the rift valley there is a mixture of fluvially deposited sand silt and gravel outside the rift valley there is a sequence of topsoil weathered bedrock fractured bedrock and unfractured bedrock hydrogeologic units are divided up based on the geologic map from westerhof et al 2014 which sorts the basement rock into tectono thermal units based on age and rock type aside from the rift valley sediments the other six hydrogeologic units are composed of granites and gneisses each of these are divided up by age of the rock which has significant implication for the extent of weathering older rocks are likely to be more weathered but also likely to have undergone significant erosion the southeast and southwestern part of the study area contains mesoarchean and neoarchean rocks of the uleppi group west nile block and the northern uganda terrain while the northern section contains mesoproterozoic and neoproterozoic rocks of the madi igisi belt thus the rift valley sediments should have the highest permeability followed by the mesoarchean rocks followed by the northern uganda terrane the lowest permeability should be found in the mesoproterozoic rocks and the neoproterozoic rocks 3 methods eight conceptual models were used to test the weathered and fractured bedrock hypotheses fig 1 weathering extent and thus permeability were assumed to be correlated with age therefore the models were grouped into two categories age based models and non age based models the age based models all contain hydraulic conductivity zones that follow the distribution described by westerhof et al 2014 while the non age based models incorporate fault zones into homogeneous weathered and fractured layers the first age based model was a one layer model with hydraulic conductivity zones determined by the geologic units fig 1a this model assumed that weathering and fracturing extent are correlated and determined by age the second model contains an upper layer with the age based weathering from the geologic map with a homogeneous second layer fig 1b the third model assumes a heterogeneous basement corresponding to the rock unit above fig 1c the fourth model included suspected areas of erosion based on the hypothesis that surface slopes will be a predictor of deep weathering and thus hydraulic conductivity fig 1c the fifth model included specified fault zones from westerhof et al 2014 in which the faults are assumed to cut across both layers fig 1d the non age based models assumed that hydraulic conductivity was primarily controlled by faults and did not follow the geologic distribution described by westerhof et al 2014 these models assumed a homogeneous weathered layer above a homogeneous fractured layer fig 1e and included both normal and reverse faults fig 1f the final model only included the normal faults fig 1f to test the conceptual models a series of inverse steady state deterministic equivalent porous media numerical models was created in groundwater vistas version 6 rumbaugh and rumbaugh 2011 and run in modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 to estimate hydraulic conductivity values for each conceptual model the models were run using the upstream weighting package with a convergence criteria of 0 01 m head change and 10 m residual each model consisted of 140 rows and 140 columns with cell dimensions of 1 km by 1 km both hydraulic head and flux measurements were used as targets for the calibration a database of 1606 existing wells was acquired from the ugandan ministry of water and the environment fig 2 a subset of 702 locations had depth to water measurements taken at a single time while water levels vary seasonally seasonal measurement errors are likely a small percentage of the total head difference across the study area and therefore these data were considered acceptable calibration targets hydraulic heads were calculated by subtracting depth to water measurements from elevation data produced by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 meter digital elevation model dem rabus et al 2003 the srtm dem has an absolute height error of 5 6 m at 90 confidence over the african continent farr et al 2007 additional error is introduced because the dem covers a 30 m area and there could be significant elevation change over that area thus if we assume elevation was measured at the center of the 30 m grid and most of the domain has a surface slope less than ten degrees then the maximum elevation error expected for the well is 2 6 m with an estimated casing height of 1 m this introduces error up to 9 2 m in the head targets additional error in the head targets exists due the steady state assumption applied to transient groundwater recharge in uganda flux targets were used in addition to the hydraulic head targets for model calibration over the three year period 2001 2003 stream flow was measured at panyango located at the southern edge of the model where lake albert flows into the albert nile and laropi located at the northeastern edge of the model where the albert nile leaves uganda otim 2005 differential stream gauging was used to specify a groundwater flux reach target using the stream flow routing package prudic et al 2004 however this accounts for both the groundwater discharge and surface runoff in the basin as no streamflow data was gathered for any of the tributaries within the model domain the edges of the model were represented as no flow boundaries and the nile river was represented as a stream boundary it was assumed that groundwater flow in this region follows a boundary circumscribed by the surface water divides no flow boundaries were used because the area of interest all lies within the albert nile drainage basin nsubuga et al 2014 this means that all water that falls in the region should flow towards the albert nile a single stream boundary was used for the nile because it was unknown if the other streams in the region are perennial or ephemeral streams the elevation of the top layer was inferred from a 30 m dem in arcmap first the 30 m dem was clipped to a 140 km by 140 km grid encompassing the area of interest with an origin of 255 000 m easting and 281 000 m northing in the wgs utm zone 36 n coordinate system then the 30 m dem was resampled using the nearest neighbor technique to produce a raster dataset with a resolution of 1 km by 1 km the elevation of the lower layer was determined using estimates of depth to bedrock from the well database the depth to bedrock measurements were kriged in arcmap and the kriged map was resampled at a 1 km by 1 km resolution and subtracted from the elevation of the top layer the bottom of the fractured layer was arbitrarily chosen to be 500 m above sea level for the heterogeneous basement model with weathering fig 1c a slope calculation was performed on the dem and areas with slopes greater than 10 were given a different hydraulic conductivity zone parameter estimation software pest was used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity doherty 1994 preliminary sensitivity analysis was performed and showed estimation of hydraulic conductivity was most sensitive to recharge therefore recharge was held constant and hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal and vertical directions were estimated at three different recharge scenarios 220 mm year 155 mm year and 90 mm year these scenarios represent the maximum median and minimum of the range of recharge values estimated for northwestern uganda nsubuga et al 2014 an additional sensitivity analysis showed that the stream conductance was a sensitive parameter so in all the models the stream conductance was held constant at 15 000 m year or 41 m day which is in the range of clean sand in order to compare results between conceptual models pest was then used to estimate hydraulic conductivity for all zones in the vertical and horizontal directions pest was run using a log transform and set to be factor limited with a range of 10 4 to 105 m year for all the hydraulic conductivities these limits were chosen because they span the range of known conductivities for igneous and metamorphic fractured rock the hydraulic conductivity of each zone was estimated and evaluated for accuracy based on known hydraulic conductivity ranges from heath 1983 models were then evaluated based on the root mean squared error akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic poeter and anderson 2005 4 results and discussion 4 1 recharge model each conceptual modeling framework was run using 3 different recharge values of 0 09 m year 0 15 m year and 0 22 m year taylor and howard 2000 estimated the recharge in northwestern uganda to be 0 22 m year while nsubuga et al 2014 estimated the recharge to be between 0 09 m year and 0 22 m year table 1 shows the root mean squared error rmse for all the conceptual models generally for the age based geologic models the error increases as the recharge rate increases this suggests that recharge is likely closer to 0 09 m year for the fault models there is not a clear correlation between recharge and rmse however the higher recharge models 0 22 m year and 0 15 m year provided unrealistic estimates of hydraulic conductivity for these models the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock layer was 100 000 m year similar to that of coarse sand since most of the region is bedrock and regolith this indicates that recharge is likely closer to 0 09 m year than to the 0 22 m year estimated by taylor and howard 2000 even at the lowest level of recharge there are still zones that have higher hydraulic conductivities than expected thus it is possible that the recharge rate is less than 0 09 m per year this has important implications for water supply sustainability as the population of the region has been growing rapidly 4 2 geologic model to evaluate the hypothesis that permeability in fractured rock aquifers is controlled by weathering we ran a set of models in which hydraulic conductivity zones were delineated based on the regional geology since most of the region is granite and gneiss the zones were based on the age of the rock as a proxy for weathering extent the simplest age based zonation models were not able to accurately represent the head distribution and base flow of the system the one layer age based model fig 1a had an rmse of over 60 m table 1 adding a lower un weathered unit fig 1b did not improve the calibration when heterogeneity was applied to the lower layer according to mapped surface heterogeneity fig 1c error was significantly reduced rmse 27 95 m but adding highly eroded areas based on surface slope to the two layer heterogeneous basement model fig 1c provided the lowest rmse at 21 40 m adding faults to the age based models fig 1d did not improve the calibration rms 37 13 m for all the conceptual models the modeled flux was within one order of magnitude of the estimated flux the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion has high hydraulic conductivities in the upper weathered layer and lower conductivities in the bedrock layer table 2 the root mean square errors for the different recharge models were 21 40 m 24 66 m and 26 64 m for the 0 09 m year 0 15 m year and 0 22 m year recharge scenarios respectively this continues to support the assumption that the lowest recharge level is likely the most accurate for the region the erosion model matches the hypothesis that the areas with higher surface slopes will have lower hydraulic conductivity as zones 15 19 have lower conductivities than the surrounding zones fig 3 table 2 adding erosion information significantly improves the calibration over the heterogeneous model without erosion the hydraulic conductivities predicted by the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion are relatively high compared to expected values for the weathered layer the bedrock layer is closer to the anticipated values for fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks with zone 10 being anomalously high at 100 000 m per year there is a chance that the zonation pattern based on the geologic map from westerhof et al 2014 does not correctly match the hydraulic conductivity distribution this is because all the units from the geologic map represent the same rock type either granite or gneiss and they are differentiated by age therefore this complexity was removed to investigate the effect of just the mapped faults using a set of three models these models assume that given enough time weathering extent hydraulic conductivity is the same across the model but the thickness of the weathered profile varies with age which is captured in the kriged depth to bedrock these models all utilize a homogeneous weathered layer and a homogeneous bedrock layer but have different fault types represented in the model the first was a two layer model with normal and reverse faults represented by different zones fig 1f the second model only contained normal faults fig 1f and the third model contained no fault zones fig 1e of these three models the two layer homogeneous model with only normal faults has the lowest rmse of 23 67 m for the 0 09 m year recharge and the most realistic hydraulic conductivity values the hydraulic conductivities for the normal fault model follow the expected distribution with a high hydraulic conductivity in the weathered layer a low hydraulic conductivity for the bedrock layer and an intermediate hydraulic conductivity for the fault zone fig 4 table 3 therefore it is possible that normal faults have a significant impact on the hydraulic conductivity in the region while this simple model could be the most realistic it operates under the assumption that the entire weathered layer has the same hydraulic conductivity which could be problematic as weathering extent has been shown to affect hydraulic conductivity taylor and howard 2000 since the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion has 38 parameters while the two layer homogenous models have 4 6 parameters there is a chance of overfitting parameters to data noise especially given the high measurement uncertainties in this region to account for overfitting the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic were calculated to determine which model represents the data best with the fewest parameters the models with the lowest aic and bic scores are considered the best representation of the system table 4 if the aic model values are within ten points of each other they are both considered likely conceptual models the aic model selection criteria which poeter and anderson 2005 claim is the ideal groundwater model selection criteria ranks the two layer heterogeneous model with erosion as the most likely of the age based zonation models this could be due to the existence of extra parameters however the hydraulic conductivity for each of the steep sloped zones is a few orders of magnitude lower than the surrounding more extensively weathered material which matches the conceptual model fig 3 table 2 this indicates that land surface slope might be a reasonable predictor of well yield in the absence of well data since areas with steeper slopes will be less extensively weathered but due to the larger number of parameters the aic ranking for this model is worse when compared to the two layer homogeneous model with no faults and the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults this is also confirmed by the bic model selection criteria using the aic and bic criteria the two layer homogeneous model with no faults is considered the best model however this model has unrealistically high hydraulic conductivities which preclude it from being considered the ideal model the homogeneous model with all faults at 0 22 m year recharge and the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults at 0 15 m year and 0 22 m year recharge also have conductivities that exceed the possible values for the bedrock layer this leaves the two layer heterogeneous model with erosion and the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults as the most likely models with the two layer homogeneous normal fault model having an edge due to fewer parameters in fact the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults also follows a more realistic hydraulic conductivity distribution across the model domain 4 3 sources of error hydraulic conductivity was allowed to vary as high as 100 000 m year which is approximately that of coarse sand the fact that many zones in the two layer models were hitting the maximum indicates that some model assumptions are likely incorrect some error likely occurs from the choice of no flow boundary conditions on the edges of the model while the groundwater divides were assumed to follow the perimeter of surface water divides this assumption may lead to errors by preventing inter basin transfers of groundwater this would create higher hydraulic heads along the edges of the model causing parameter estimation to increase hydraulic conductivity to account for these effects to test the impact of boundary conditions the two layer heterogeneous model with erosion was run with both a constant head boundary set at land surface and a no flow boundary there was minimal change in the magnitudes of conductivity field however there were some differences between the two models in terms of which zones had the highest conductivity sensitivity analysis shows that the streambed conductivity was an important parameter which was set at 15 000 m year representing the conductivity of clean sand raising streambed conductivity would likely allow some of the hydraulic conductivity zones to be lower however it is unlikely that it would be on the same order of magnitude as gravel we chose to hold this parameter constant because the water level data contained significant error due to both the transient nature of recharge and error from using shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model for the elevation at each well so the models were likely calibrating to noise in the data set since the total head change over the model domain is 863 m the error for the best fit models is less than 3 of the total head change with the estimated measurement error 9 2 m taking up approximately 40 of the rmse additional error could be introduced by kriging depth to bedrock specifically in the rift valley bedrock is likely much deeper than estimated the geology in the rift valley is mostly unconsolidated sediment and kriging depth to bedrock using data from outside the rift valley is likely underestimating the depth to bedrock similarly the assumption that the bottom of the second layer was at 500 m above sea level likely contributed error this assumption was made because permeability has been shown to decrease with depth jiang et al 2010 therefore the fractures would close and essentially form a no flow boundary however it has also been shown that permeability does not correlate with depth in fault zone systems ranjram et al 2015 while fractures are unlikely to close due to faulting they are likely to close over most of the domain which is dominated by weathered bedrock thus we assume that there is not substantial water exchange between the shallow and deep flow systems to test these assumptions the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion at 0 09 m year recharge was modified by lowering the bottom elevation of the bedrock layer from 500 m above sea level to 0 m above sea level this resulted in over predicting water levels and would require even higher hydraulic conductivities for the fault model error could occur due to having one hydraulic conductivity value for all the faults making the model difficult to accurately calibrate as different faults likely exhibit different behavior on smaller scales it is possible that fault zones could have a significant effect on hydraulic conductivity that is not noticeable at the 1 km resolution significant error could be introduced by the choice of resolution around fault zones however the 1 km resolution was chosen to keep model runtimes reasonable finally hydraulically active faults in the region might be unmapped 4 4 implications both fault zones and weathering extent likely play a role in the permeability of aquifers in northwestern uganda the two most probable models have substantially different underlying assumptions but some general conclusions can be drawn both the fault model and weathered bedrock model contain information about the weathering extent because the depth of the upper weathered layer was kriged to the bedrock depth data thus weathering extent is a crucial factor in determining the permeability at the regional scale additionally all the models generally show the upper weathered layer has a higher hydraulic conductivity while the lower fractured layer has a lower hydraulic conductivity this is true across all the conceptual models and agrees with the results found by taylor and howard 2000 thus there is high confidence that deeper wells will generally experience lower hydraulic conductivities across the region the hydraulic conductivities in all conceptual models were on the high end of observed hydraulic conductivity for fractured rock aquifers and were about one order of magnitude higher than those found by taylor and howard 2000 this is to be expected as it has been shown that hydraulic conductivity is scale dependent schulze makuch et al 1999 however given widespread reports of dry wells and the consistency of high hydraulic conductivity across all models it is likely the recharge for the region is overestimated while there is some consistency between the two best models there is also significant discrepancy between them regarding the influence of faults on regional groundwater flow if the fault model is the correct conceptual model then a few additional conclusions can be drawn the fault model showed fault zones had a higher hydraulic conductivity than the lower fractured layer but a lower hydraulic conductivity than the upper weathered layer this would suggest that wells located near a large scale regional fault could tap into a larger regional flow system and therefore have a greater water supply on a regional scale reverse faults appear to play a relatively small role in the flow patterns observed in northwestern uganda while normal faults seem to have a stronger effect due to the small area taken up by fault zones thick weathering profiles appear to have the most water storage and permeability however areas with many normal faults could provide a greater volume of water if they also contain a thick weathered layer it is critical that more research is conducted into the influence of normal faults in northwestern uganda to determine if they do in fact play a substantial role in regional groundwater flow similarly this research suggests that further study is needed to quantify the permeability and water storage of fault zones around the world many global scale models of groundwater flow do not include fault zones e g de graaf et al 2015 because they depend on global permeability maps that neglected these features since they occur on a smaller scale gleeson et al 2014 hartmann and moosdorf 2012 while efforts to improve the representation of unconsolidated sediment in these models has occurred huscroft et al 2018 there has not been a similar effort to incorporate fault zones these results suggest that fault zones could be a critical feature governing groundwater flow at the regional scale coupled with a global compilation of fault zone classification by scibek et al 2016 in which 70 of faults were shown to act as conduits for groundwater flow the research presented here suggests that more research is needed to upscale faults and incorporate them into regional and global scale groundwater flow models on the other hand it is possible that the two layer heterogeneous weathering model with erosion is the correct conceptual model as it is the simplest solution that fits the available data if the weathering model is correct some additional conclusions can be drawn overall it appears that present day surface slopes may be a suitable indicator of conductivity in the upper layer but it poorly reflects the parameters that govern flow in the fractured bedrock layer below the regolith this agrees with taylor and howard 2000 who say that the slope affects the extent of weathering and erosion using rock age as an estimate of weathering extent does not appear to be a good assumption in the absence of geophysical or pumping test data because the erosion history is an important factor governing the weathering extent this would suggest that weathering is the primary control on regional permeability in fractured rock aquifers even when there are many faults in the region additional data will be needed especially in fault zones to confirm these findings as inverse models have non unique solutions and in these models there is uncertainty in both the calibration targets and upscaling small scale point measurements to a regional scale many of the head measurements are affected by local scale heterogeneity that is absent from these models while there is still substantial uncertainty regarding permeability and storage at the local level these results suggest fault zones and weathering extent are critical to understanding groundwater flow at the regional scale however model non uniqueness precludes us from determining the correct conceptual model the lack of data in the region prevents the use of regional model calibration from elucidating the primary permeability generation mechanism previous model regional fractured rock calibration studies that have used model calibration to test alternative hypotheses e g blessent et al 2011 dewandel et al 2021 sanford 2017 all were able to draw on extensive datasets when constructing their conceptual models additional data requirements include streamflow measurements time series measurements of hydraulic head better characterization of fault zones and better characterization of the thickness of the weathered layer using either more boreholes or geophysics these data are necessary for predicting regions with higher yielding wells 5 conclusions two hypotheses about permeability in the fractured rock aquifers of northwestern uganda namely that permeability is controlled by weathering or faulting were investigated using a series of eight inverse groundwater flow models different conceptual models were tested to see which best fit hydraulic head and flux data best a set of five models were predicated on the idea that rock age would govern hydraulic conductivity findings from this set of five models indicated that the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion can replicate the data most accurately a set of three models assumed that age did not control weathering extent and therefore permeability since almost the entire model domain is granite or gneiss these models assumed that conductivity would be essentially the same for all the weathered and bedrock layers across the entire model and only faults could change the permeability findings from this set of models suggest that normal fault zones could play an important role in the groundwater flow regime in northwestern uganda both the fault zone model and the weathered model with erosion showed significant improvements in the calibration over the heterogeneous two layer model and are potentially viable conceptual models for the weathered model with erosion the surface slope seems to predict areas that have been severely eroded and therefore have lower hydraulic conductivities and less capacity to hold water age on the other hand does not appear to be a good indicator of hydraulic conductivity thus high permeability regions are expected to occur in shallow sloped areas and especially in the rift valley and the northeastern section of the model the fault model also cannot be ruled out as it also fits the data reasonably well the fault model suggests that normal faults play a significant role in the hydraulic conductivity of the region therefore targeting locations with mapped normal faults and thick regolith layers could be the optimal approach towards increasing well yields however more research is needed to confirm these findings in such a data sparse region inverse models cannot be used to determine the primary permeability generation mechanism however the models point towards the need for more data collection and suggest that further study is needed into the influence of normal faults on regional groundwater flow credit authorship

7943,study region northwestern uganda study focus siting water supply wells in fractured rock aquifers is challenging due to the heterogeneity of fracture systems since fractures must be both connected and abundant for water to be extracted in usable quantities two conceptual models explaining the permeability generating mechanisms have been proposed in the literature the faulting model and the weathering model to test these hypotheses we estimated hydraulic conductivity in northwestern uganda with eight inverse groundwater flow models calibrated to hydraulic heads and river discharge each model incorporated different assumptions about the hydraulic conductivity distribution based on age surface slopes and faults new hydrological insights for the region the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion and the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults were shown to have the best fit for these data because of model non uniqueness it is difficult to conclusively determine if either conceptual model is correct due to limited field observations however the results suggest that faulting could play a significant role in the regional groundwater flow field and further study is needed to determine the importance of normal faults in groundwater flow additionally results from the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion suggest that rock age is a poor predictor of weathering extent as spatially and temporally varying rates of erosion prevent a clear trend between age and hydraulic conductivity graphical abstract ga1 keywords fractured rock regional groundwater flow inverse modeling numerical modeling water supply data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction around the world many people depend on groundwater sourced from fractured rock aquifers for their water supply however water supply wells drilled in fractured rock are often dry or low yielding because they do not intersect hydraulically conductive fractures sander 1997 the motivation of this work is to gain an understanding of the permeability generation mechanisms in northern uganda because the region has experienced a growing population of refugees migrating from south sudan the growing population will need access to sufficient clean water supplies in a region of the world that lacks hydrologic data unfortunately the paucity of high quality data in the region leads to substantial uncertainty in identifying the driving permeability generation mechanisms while many boreholes have been drilled none have been outfitted with long term monitoring equipment and often only a single water level measurement is available from when the well was initially drilled our objective is to determine if groundwater models can help elucidate the primary regional scale permeability generating mechanism in northwestern uganda and as a result guide further studies to develop water management plans in the region numerous conceptual models exist to explain permeability and groundwater storage in crystalline bedrock aquifers these include compartmentalization of groundwater due to sealed fault zones mayo and koontz 2000 joints opening due to folding fischer and wilkerson 2000 intrusion of dikes delaney et al 1986 and lithological contacts cooke et al 2006 in this study we focus on two simplified models the weathering model and the faulting model lachassagne et al 2011 and maréchal et al 2004 argue that permeability is solely determined by weathering which occurs when water dissolves components of rock this is further supported by taylor and howard 2000 who claim that weathering changes the depth of the regolith weathered layer which in turn affects both the permeability and water storage these processes are concentrated in regions around the equator where surface weathering creates a relatively deep layer of saprolite above the bedrock taylor and howard 2000 and do not apply to glaciated regions additionally this conceptual model only applies to the near surface and does not affect deep groundwater flow alternatively according to acworth 1987 permeable zones are generated by tectonically induced fracturing while the overlying regolith provides the majority of the water storage this agrees with others who have shown that permeability is controlled by faults which open fractures in bedrock barton et al 1995 bense et al 2013 caine et al 1996 evans et al 1997 micarelli et al 2003 molnar et al 2007 to test the applicability of these conceptual models a series of inverse regional groundwater flow models at a 1 km resolution were employed hydraulic head and flux data were compiled from existing borehole datasets and the conceptual models were evaluated based on how closely they matched these data modeling fractured rock aquifers has been done in three different ways the equivalent porous media approach discrete fracture approach and the dual porosity approach cook 2003 the equivalent porous media approach assumes that at some scale a representative elementary volume rev can be assigned where the average properties of the aquifer can be assumed constant at any scale greater than the rev the discrete fracture approach requires detailed information about the orientation length and structure of individual fractures dual porosity models specify parameters for both the fracture system and the matrix and are mostly used for cases where the matrix is very porous e g sandstone this study utilized the equivalent porous media approach but explicitly modeled mapped faults the equivalent porous media approach has been shown to be effective for many highly heterogenous systems including karst abusaada and sauter 2013 ghasemizadeh et al 2015 scanlon et al 2003 and fractured rock jarrahi et al 2019 jaunat et al 2016 the equivalent porous media approach is justified here for a few reasons first the rev is likely much smaller than the grid size used in the model for regional scale features while fracture density likely varies on a much smaller scale than the grid cell size over the 1 km2 cell size there is an average conductivity that incorporates smaller scale variation in fracture density similarly because the fault zones are large scale features we do not represent smaller fractures within the fault zone but rather assume a bulk conductivity for the entire zone second the study area has limited data on the specific characteristics of the fault zone fractures and therefore the distribution and orientation of fracture properties are unknown thus the discrete fracture model is not possible given the data limitations dual porosity models would be viable candidates for model selection however given that the number of parameters would increase by a factor of 2 matrix and fracture values for each parameter present we settled on the equivalent porous media approach both to maintain model simplicity and because blessent et al 2014 showed that dual porosity models had similar prediction errors when compared to equivalent porous media models groundwater flow model calibration involves non unique solutions which complicates the evaluation of conceptual models as multiple conductivity fields can provide the same fit to hydraulic head and streamflow data while these limitations exist many studies have used calibrated groundwater models to better understand fractured rock systems including hydraulic conductivity dependence on depth sanford 2017 movement of radioactive materials from a waste disposal site blessent et al 2011 and understanding controls on well yield in fractured rock aquifers bianchi et al 2020 similarly nastev et al 2005 used a calibrated model of southwestern quebec to constrain recharge and hydraulic conductivity values and dewandel et al 2021 showed that uniform regional hydraulic conductivity field with only two zones produced similar results to a more complicated mapped conductivity field while non unique solutions can cause issues for conceptual model evaluation many studies have utilized calibrated groundwater models to understand regional groundwater flow in fractured rock systems however these studies all had the benefit of extensive existing data sources to draw upon in this study we tested if model calibration in a data poor region could be used to determine the primary permeability generation mechanism in northwestern uganda 2 study area this study focuses on the northwestern part of uganda this region is useful for testing the importance of faulting and weathering processes in permeability generation because it contains both a deep weathered zone and significant tectonic activity northwestern uganda underwent deep weathering during the jurassic and cretaceous and was uplifted in the mid miocene due to rifting taylor and howard 1999 this began a period of erosion however the areas in the uplifted terrain that have shallow slopes will likely still have deep regolith layers and therefore higher permeability and storage since granitic bedrock underlies most of the study area and fluid flow in granite has previously been associated with faulting sausse and genter 2005 it is possible that tectonic activity plays a significant role in the permeability structure at a regional scale this study does not account for the transient nature of fault permeability but rather we assume that the average permeability of a fault zone is increased due to an increase in fracture density the albertine rift valley which has been shown to be seismically active bwambale et al 2015 martini et al 2013 and the aswa lineament which has also shown signs of seismic activity volon et al 1998 both pass through near the study area between these two fault zones there is an area lacking significant tectonic activity setting up an ideal condition to test the conceptual models northwestern uganda contains two different geologic settings within the rift valley there is a mixture of fluvially deposited sand silt and gravel outside the rift valley there is a sequence of topsoil weathered bedrock fractured bedrock and unfractured bedrock hydrogeologic units are divided up based on the geologic map from westerhof et al 2014 which sorts the basement rock into tectono thermal units based on age and rock type aside from the rift valley sediments the other six hydrogeologic units are composed of granites and gneisses each of these are divided up by age of the rock which has significant implication for the extent of weathering older rocks are likely to be more weathered but also likely to have undergone significant erosion the southeast and southwestern part of the study area contains mesoarchean and neoarchean rocks of the uleppi group west nile block and the northern uganda terrain while the northern section contains mesoproterozoic and neoproterozoic rocks of the madi igisi belt thus the rift valley sediments should have the highest permeability followed by the mesoarchean rocks followed by the northern uganda terrane the lowest permeability should be found in the mesoproterozoic rocks and the neoproterozoic rocks 3 methods eight conceptual models were used to test the weathered and fractured bedrock hypotheses fig 1 weathering extent and thus permeability were assumed to be correlated with age therefore the models were grouped into two categories age based models and non age based models the age based models all contain hydraulic conductivity zones that follow the distribution described by westerhof et al 2014 while the non age based models incorporate fault zones into homogeneous weathered and fractured layers the first age based model was a one layer model with hydraulic conductivity zones determined by the geologic units fig 1a this model assumed that weathering and fracturing extent are correlated and determined by age the second model contains an upper layer with the age based weathering from the geologic map with a homogeneous second layer fig 1b the third model assumes a heterogeneous basement corresponding to the rock unit above fig 1c the fourth model included suspected areas of erosion based on the hypothesis that surface slopes will be a predictor of deep weathering and thus hydraulic conductivity fig 1c the fifth model included specified fault zones from westerhof et al 2014 in which the faults are assumed to cut across both layers fig 1d the non age based models assumed that hydraulic conductivity was primarily controlled by faults and did not follow the geologic distribution described by westerhof et al 2014 these models assumed a homogeneous weathered layer above a homogeneous fractured layer fig 1e and included both normal and reverse faults fig 1f the final model only included the normal faults fig 1f to test the conceptual models a series of inverse steady state deterministic equivalent porous media numerical models was created in groundwater vistas version 6 rumbaugh and rumbaugh 2011 and run in modflow 2005 harbaugh 2005 to estimate hydraulic conductivity values for each conceptual model the models were run using the upstream weighting package with a convergence criteria of 0 01 m head change and 10 m residual each model consisted of 140 rows and 140 columns with cell dimensions of 1 km by 1 km both hydraulic head and flux measurements were used as targets for the calibration a database of 1606 existing wells was acquired from the ugandan ministry of water and the environment fig 2 a subset of 702 locations had depth to water measurements taken at a single time while water levels vary seasonally seasonal measurement errors are likely a small percentage of the total head difference across the study area and therefore these data were considered acceptable calibration targets hydraulic heads were calculated by subtracting depth to water measurements from elevation data produced by the shuttle radar topography mission srtm 30 meter digital elevation model dem rabus et al 2003 the srtm dem has an absolute height error of 5 6 m at 90 confidence over the african continent farr et al 2007 additional error is introduced because the dem covers a 30 m area and there could be significant elevation change over that area thus if we assume elevation was measured at the center of the 30 m grid and most of the domain has a surface slope less than ten degrees then the maximum elevation error expected for the well is 2 6 m with an estimated casing height of 1 m this introduces error up to 9 2 m in the head targets additional error in the head targets exists due the steady state assumption applied to transient groundwater recharge in uganda flux targets were used in addition to the hydraulic head targets for model calibration over the three year period 2001 2003 stream flow was measured at panyango located at the southern edge of the model where lake albert flows into the albert nile and laropi located at the northeastern edge of the model where the albert nile leaves uganda otim 2005 differential stream gauging was used to specify a groundwater flux reach target using the stream flow routing package prudic et al 2004 however this accounts for both the groundwater discharge and surface runoff in the basin as no streamflow data was gathered for any of the tributaries within the model domain the edges of the model were represented as no flow boundaries and the nile river was represented as a stream boundary it was assumed that groundwater flow in this region follows a boundary circumscribed by the surface water divides no flow boundaries were used because the area of interest all lies within the albert nile drainage basin nsubuga et al 2014 this means that all water that falls in the region should flow towards the albert nile a single stream boundary was used for the nile because it was unknown if the other streams in the region are perennial or ephemeral streams the elevation of the top layer was inferred from a 30 m dem in arcmap first the 30 m dem was clipped to a 140 km by 140 km grid encompassing the area of interest with an origin of 255 000 m easting and 281 000 m northing in the wgs utm zone 36 n coordinate system then the 30 m dem was resampled using the nearest neighbor technique to produce a raster dataset with a resolution of 1 km by 1 km the elevation of the lower layer was determined using estimates of depth to bedrock from the well database the depth to bedrock measurements were kriged in arcmap and the kriged map was resampled at a 1 km by 1 km resolution and subtracted from the elevation of the top layer the bottom of the fractured layer was arbitrarily chosen to be 500 m above sea level for the heterogeneous basement model with weathering fig 1c a slope calculation was performed on the dem and areas with slopes greater than 10 were given a different hydraulic conductivity zone parameter estimation software pest was used to estimate the hydraulic conductivity doherty 1994 preliminary sensitivity analysis was performed and showed estimation of hydraulic conductivity was most sensitive to recharge therefore recharge was held constant and hydraulic conductivity in the horizontal and vertical directions were estimated at three different recharge scenarios 220 mm year 155 mm year and 90 mm year these scenarios represent the maximum median and minimum of the range of recharge values estimated for northwestern uganda nsubuga et al 2014 an additional sensitivity analysis showed that the stream conductance was a sensitive parameter so in all the models the stream conductance was held constant at 15 000 m year or 41 m day which is in the range of clean sand in order to compare results between conceptual models pest was then used to estimate hydraulic conductivity for all zones in the vertical and horizontal directions pest was run using a log transform and set to be factor limited with a range of 10 4 to 105 m year for all the hydraulic conductivities these limits were chosen because they span the range of known conductivities for igneous and metamorphic fractured rock the hydraulic conductivity of each zone was estimated and evaluated for accuracy based on known hydraulic conductivity ranges from heath 1983 models were then evaluated based on the root mean squared error akaike information criterion aic and bayesian information criterion bic poeter and anderson 2005 4 results and discussion 4 1 recharge model each conceptual modeling framework was run using 3 different recharge values of 0 09 m year 0 15 m year and 0 22 m year taylor and howard 2000 estimated the recharge in northwestern uganda to be 0 22 m year while nsubuga et al 2014 estimated the recharge to be between 0 09 m year and 0 22 m year table 1 shows the root mean squared error rmse for all the conceptual models generally for the age based geologic models the error increases as the recharge rate increases this suggests that recharge is likely closer to 0 09 m year for the fault models there is not a clear correlation between recharge and rmse however the higher recharge models 0 22 m year and 0 15 m year provided unrealistic estimates of hydraulic conductivity for these models the hydraulic conductivity of the bedrock layer was 100 000 m year similar to that of coarse sand since most of the region is bedrock and regolith this indicates that recharge is likely closer to 0 09 m year than to the 0 22 m year estimated by taylor and howard 2000 even at the lowest level of recharge there are still zones that have higher hydraulic conductivities than expected thus it is possible that the recharge rate is less than 0 09 m per year this has important implications for water supply sustainability as the population of the region has been growing rapidly 4 2 geologic model to evaluate the hypothesis that permeability in fractured rock aquifers is controlled by weathering we ran a set of models in which hydraulic conductivity zones were delineated based on the regional geology since most of the region is granite and gneiss the zones were based on the age of the rock as a proxy for weathering extent the simplest age based zonation models were not able to accurately represent the head distribution and base flow of the system the one layer age based model fig 1a had an rmse of over 60 m table 1 adding a lower un weathered unit fig 1b did not improve the calibration when heterogeneity was applied to the lower layer according to mapped surface heterogeneity fig 1c error was significantly reduced rmse 27 95 m but adding highly eroded areas based on surface slope to the two layer heterogeneous basement model fig 1c provided the lowest rmse at 21 40 m adding faults to the age based models fig 1d did not improve the calibration rms 37 13 m for all the conceptual models the modeled flux was within one order of magnitude of the estimated flux the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion has high hydraulic conductivities in the upper weathered layer and lower conductivities in the bedrock layer table 2 the root mean square errors for the different recharge models were 21 40 m 24 66 m and 26 64 m for the 0 09 m year 0 15 m year and 0 22 m year recharge scenarios respectively this continues to support the assumption that the lowest recharge level is likely the most accurate for the region the erosion model matches the hypothesis that the areas with higher surface slopes will have lower hydraulic conductivity as zones 15 19 have lower conductivities than the surrounding zones fig 3 table 2 adding erosion information significantly improves the calibration over the heterogeneous model without erosion the hydraulic conductivities predicted by the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion are relatively high compared to expected values for the weathered layer the bedrock layer is closer to the anticipated values for fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks with zone 10 being anomalously high at 100 000 m per year there is a chance that the zonation pattern based on the geologic map from westerhof et al 2014 does not correctly match the hydraulic conductivity distribution this is because all the units from the geologic map represent the same rock type either granite or gneiss and they are differentiated by age therefore this complexity was removed to investigate the effect of just the mapped faults using a set of three models these models assume that given enough time weathering extent hydraulic conductivity is the same across the model but the thickness of the weathered profile varies with age which is captured in the kriged depth to bedrock these models all utilize a homogeneous weathered layer and a homogeneous bedrock layer but have different fault types represented in the model the first was a two layer model with normal and reverse faults represented by different zones fig 1f the second model only contained normal faults fig 1f and the third model contained no fault zones fig 1e of these three models the two layer homogeneous model with only normal faults has the lowest rmse of 23 67 m for the 0 09 m year recharge and the most realistic hydraulic conductivity values the hydraulic conductivities for the normal fault model follow the expected distribution with a high hydraulic conductivity in the weathered layer a low hydraulic conductivity for the bedrock layer and an intermediate hydraulic conductivity for the fault zone fig 4 table 3 therefore it is possible that normal faults have a significant impact on the hydraulic conductivity in the region while this simple model could be the most realistic it operates under the assumption that the entire weathered layer has the same hydraulic conductivity which could be problematic as weathering extent has been shown to affect hydraulic conductivity taylor and howard 2000 since the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion has 38 parameters while the two layer homogenous models have 4 6 parameters there is a chance of overfitting parameters to data noise especially given the high measurement uncertainties in this region to account for overfitting the akaike information criterion aic and the bayesian information criterion bic were calculated to determine which model represents the data best with the fewest parameters the models with the lowest aic and bic scores are considered the best representation of the system table 4 if the aic model values are within ten points of each other they are both considered likely conceptual models the aic model selection criteria which poeter and anderson 2005 claim is the ideal groundwater model selection criteria ranks the two layer heterogeneous model with erosion as the most likely of the age based zonation models this could be due to the existence of extra parameters however the hydraulic conductivity for each of the steep sloped zones is a few orders of magnitude lower than the surrounding more extensively weathered material which matches the conceptual model fig 3 table 2 this indicates that land surface slope might be a reasonable predictor of well yield in the absence of well data since areas with steeper slopes will be less extensively weathered but due to the larger number of parameters the aic ranking for this model is worse when compared to the two layer homogeneous model with no faults and the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults this is also confirmed by the bic model selection criteria using the aic and bic criteria the two layer homogeneous model with no faults is considered the best model however this model has unrealistically high hydraulic conductivities which preclude it from being considered the ideal model the homogeneous model with all faults at 0 22 m year recharge and the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults at 0 15 m year and 0 22 m year recharge also have conductivities that exceed the possible values for the bedrock layer this leaves the two layer heterogeneous model with erosion and the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults as the most likely models with the two layer homogeneous normal fault model having an edge due to fewer parameters in fact the two layer homogeneous model with normal faults also follows a more realistic hydraulic conductivity distribution across the model domain 4 3 sources of error hydraulic conductivity was allowed to vary as high as 100 000 m year which is approximately that of coarse sand the fact that many zones in the two layer models were hitting the maximum indicates that some model assumptions are likely incorrect some error likely occurs from the choice of no flow boundary conditions on the edges of the model while the groundwater divides were assumed to follow the perimeter of surface water divides this assumption may lead to errors by preventing inter basin transfers of groundwater this would create higher hydraulic heads along the edges of the model causing parameter estimation to increase hydraulic conductivity to account for these effects to test the impact of boundary conditions the two layer heterogeneous model with erosion was run with both a constant head boundary set at land surface and a no flow boundary there was minimal change in the magnitudes of conductivity field however there were some differences between the two models in terms of which zones had the highest conductivity sensitivity analysis shows that the streambed conductivity was an important parameter which was set at 15 000 m year representing the conductivity of clean sand raising streambed conductivity would likely allow some of the hydraulic conductivity zones to be lower however it is unlikely that it would be on the same order of magnitude as gravel we chose to hold this parameter constant because the water level data contained significant error due to both the transient nature of recharge and error from using shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model for the elevation at each well so the models were likely calibrating to noise in the data set since the total head change over the model domain is 863 m the error for the best fit models is less than 3 of the total head change with the estimated measurement error 9 2 m taking up approximately 40 of the rmse additional error could be introduced by kriging depth to bedrock specifically in the rift valley bedrock is likely much deeper than estimated the geology in the rift valley is mostly unconsolidated sediment and kriging depth to bedrock using data from outside the rift valley is likely underestimating the depth to bedrock similarly the assumption that the bottom of the second layer was at 500 m above sea level likely contributed error this assumption was made because permeability has been shown to decrease with depth jiang et al 2010 therefore the fractures would close and essentially form a no flow boundary however it has also been shown that permeability does not correlate with depth in fault zone systems ranjram et al 2015 while fractures are unlikely to close due to faulting they are likely to close over most of the domain which is dominated by weathered bedrock thus we assume that there is not substantial water exchange between the shallow and deep flow systems to test these assumptions the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion at 0 09 m year recharge was modified by lowering the bottom elevation of the bedrock layer from 500 m above sea level to 0 m above sea level this resulted in over predicting water levels and would require even higher hydraulic conductivities for the fault model error could occur due to having one hydraulic conductivity value for all the faults making the model difficult to accurately calibrate as different faults likely exhibit different behavior on smaller scales it is possible that fault zones could have a significant effect on hydraulic conductivity that is not noticeable at the 1 km resolution significant error could be introduced by the choice of resolution around fault zones however the 1 km resolution was chosen to keep model runtimes reasonable finally hydraulically active faults in the region might be unmapped 4 4 implications both fault zones and weathering extent likely play a role in the permeability of aquifers in northwestern uganda the two most probable models have substantially different underlying assumptions but some general conclusions can be drawn both the fault model and weathered bedrock model contain information about the weathering extent because the depth of the upper weathered layer was kriged to the bedrock depth data thus weathering extent is a crucial factor in determining the permeability at the regional scale additionally all the models generally show the upper weathered layer has a higher hydraulic conductivity while the lower fractured layer has a lower hydraulic conductivity this is true across all the conceptual models and agrees with the results found by taylor and howard 2000 thus there is high confidence that deeper wells will generally experience lower hydraulic conductivities across the region the hydraulic conductivities in all conceptual models were on the high end of observed hydraulic conductivity for fractured rock aquifers and were about one order of magnitude higher than those found by taylor and howard 2000 this is to be expected as it has been shown that hydraulic conductivity is scale dependent schulze makuch et al 1999 however given widespread reports of dry wells and the consistency of high hydraulic conductivity across all models it is likely the recharge for the region is overestimated while there is some consistency between the two best models there is also significant discrepancy between them regarding the influence of faults on regional groundwater flow if the fault model is the correct conceptual model then a few additional conclusions can be drawn the fault model showed fault zones had a higher hydraulic conductivity than the lower fractured layer but a lower hydraulic conductivity than the upper weathered layer this would suggest that wells located near a large scale regional fault could tap into a larger regional flow system and therefore have a greater water supply on a regional scale reverse faults appear to play a relatively small role in the flow patterns observed in northwestern uganda while normal faults seem to have a stronger effect due to the small area taken up by fault zones thick weathering profiles appear to have the most water storage and permeability however areas with many normal faults could provide a greater volume of water if they also contain a thick weathered layer it is critical that more research is conducted into the influence of normal faults in northwestern uganda to determine if they do in fact play a substantial role in regional groundwater flow similarly this research suggests that further study is needed to quantify the permeability and water storage of fault zones around the world many global scale models of groundwater flow do not include fault zones e g de graaf et al 2015 because they depend on global permeability maps that neglected these features since they occur on a smaller scale gleeson et al 2014 hartmann and moosdorf 2012 while efforts to improve the representation of unconsolidated sediment in these models has occurred huscroft et al 2018 there has not been a similar effort to incorporate fault zones these results suggest that fault zones could be a critical feature governing groundwater flow at the regional scale coupled with a global compilation of fault zone classification by scibek et al 2016 in which 70 of faults were shown to act as conduits for groundwater flow the research presented here suggests that more research is needed to upscale faults and incorporate them into regional and global scale groundwater flow models on the other hand it is possible that the two layer heterogeneous weathering model with erosion is the correct conceptual model as it is the simplest solution that fits the available data if the weathering model is correct some additional conclusions can be drawn overall it appears that present day surface slopes may be a suitable indicator of conductivity in the upper layer but it poorly reflects the parameters that govern flow in the fractured bedrock layer below the regolith this agrees with taylor and howard 2000 who say that the slope affects the extent of weathering and erosion using rock age as an estimate of weathering extent does not appear to be a good assumption in the absence of geophysical or pumping test data because the erosion history is an important factor governing the weathering extent this would suggest that weathering is the primary control on regional permeability in fractured rock aquifers even when there are many faults in the region additional data will be needed especially in fault zones to confirm these findings as inverse models have non unique solutions and in these models there is uncertainty in both the calibration targets and upscaling small scale point measurements to a regional scale many of the head measurements are affected by local scale heterogeneity that is absent from these models while there is still substantial uncertainty regarding permeability and storage at the local level these results suggest fault zones and weathering extent are critical to understanding groundwater flow at the regional scale however model non uniqueness precludes us from determining the correct conceptual model the lack of data in the region prevents the use of regional model calibration from elucidating the primary permeability generation mechanism previous model regional fractured rock calibration studies that have used model calibration to test alternative hypotheses e g blessent et al 2011 dewandel et al 2021 sanford 2017 all were able to draw on extensive datasets when constructing their conceptual models additional data requirements include streamflow measurements time series measurements of hydraulic head better characterization of fault zones and better characterization of the thickness of the weathered layer using either more boreholes or geophysics these data are necessary for predicting regions with higher yielding wells 5 conclusions two hypotheses about permeability in the fractured rock aquifers of northwestern uganda namely that permeability is controlled by weathering or faulting were investigated using a series of eight inverse groundwater flow models different conceptual models were tested to see which best fit hydraulic head and flux data best a set of five models were predicated on the idea that rock age would govern hydraulic conductivity findings from this set of five models indicated that the two layer heterogeneous basement model with erosion can replicate the data most accurately a set of three models assumed that age did not control weathering extent and therefore permeability since almost the entire model domain is granite or gneiss these models assumed that conductivity would be essentially the same for all the weathered and bedrock layers across the entire model and only faults could change the permeability findings from this set of models suggest that normal fault zones could play an important role in the groundwater flow regime in northwestern uganda both the fault zone model and the weathered model with erosion showed significant improvements in the calibration over the heterogeneous two layer model and are potentially viable conceptual models for the weathered model with erosion the surface slope seems to predict areas that have been severely eroded and therefore have lower hydraulic conductivities and less capacity to hold water age on the other hand does not appear to be a good indicator of hydraulic conductivity thus high permeability regions are expected to occur in shallow sloped areas and especially in the rift valley and the northeastern section of the model the fault model also cannot be ruled out as it also fits the data reasonably well the fault model suggests that normal faults play a significant role in the hydraulic conductivity of the region therefore targeting locations with mapped normal faults and thick regolith layers could be the optimal approach towards increasing well yields however more research is needed to confirm these findings in such a data sparse region inverse models cannot be used to determine the primary permeability generation mechanism however the models point towards the need for more data collection and suggest that further study is needed into the influence of normal faults on regional groundwater flow credit authorship

7944,study region western tropical pacific ocean philippines study focus el niño southern oscillation enso modulates rainfall amount variability and by extension river discharge for the philippines on seasonal to interannual temporal scales the el niño phase of enso considerably decreases rainfall amounts on a seasonal scale with varying degrees of heterogeneity across the philippines the hydrological response of el niño on an interannual scale is relatively immature to investigate the hydrological response a composite time series of 29 rainfall and 61 river discharge stations spanning 1901 2020 and 1908 2017 c e respectively and covering the four major climate types in the philippines were critically assessed new hydrological insights for the region our statistical analyses results of a 100 year dataset demonstrate a decreasing trend compared to pre el niño conditions for both river discharge and rainfall the median response suggests the decreasing trend can last up to 7 years regardless of climate type rainfall amount returns to pre el niño conditions faster than river discharge the sign increasing or decreasing of the hydrological response is either decreasing if at conception of an el niño phase or increasing if at the termination of an el niño phase our results have implications for water resource management and water resiliency of island nations that strongly rely on the timely delivery of rainfall amount further our results highlight the legacy effects of el niño events that likely initiate long term droughts for island nations in western tropical pacific

catchments van beusekom et al 2016 higley and conroy 2019 tropical islands thereby rely on freshwater hydrological processes as ensuing short term droughts affect agriculture and long term droughts severely affect water resources guttman 1999 david et al 2022 the philippines nestled in the western tropical pacific ocean between 4 40 n to 21 10 n 116 40 e to 126 34 e with over 7000 islands in the archipelago figure 1a is acutely sensitive to both el niño and la niña phases of the enso lyon 2004 lyon et al 2006 the drought conditions during an el niño phase within the philippines is induced by the late onset of the rainy season early termination of the rainy season or a weak monsoon system characterized by isolated heavy rainfall events of short durations lansigan et al 2000 the large

response to soil moisture deficits is associated with the el niño phase of enso for the philippines further complicating the relationship between el niño periods and the rainfall is the spatial heterogeneity across the philippines island nations are not climate monoliths and require robust analysis on a country wide scale before regional assessments are made on the impact of enso to the

still poorly understood the long term legacy effect of el niño with respect to drought conditions kolusu et al 2019 terrestrial ecosystems jorge romero et al 2021 and coral reefs claar et al 2018 highlight the need to investigate the response of the hydroclimate to el niño periods on an interannual temporal scale in tropical pacific island nations understanding the relationship between the hydroclimate and el niño periods on an interannual temporal scale is important for water resource management especially since extreme el niño events are predicted to increase in intensity and frequency due to anthropogenic induced greenhouse warming cai et al 2020 in this study we leverage 100 year long river discharge 1908 2017 c e and rainfall amount 1901 2020 c e dataset which is spatially spread across the philippines to discern the relationship between hydrological variables and el niño events for the 20 th and 21 st century paired rainfall amount and river discharge response to enso phases provide a nuanced response to hydroclimate variability which might be missed if only one variable is used schmidt et al 2001 poveda et al 2001 we assign river discharge data and rainfall amount data as the hydroclimate hydrological variables of interest where river discharge is an integration of rainfall over a given river basin and provides insight into the lagged response of the land atmosphere water cycle and rainfall data is a closer reflection to the ocean atmosphere water cycle and larger scale dynamical moisture delivery next to assess the range of hydroclimate responses to the el niño phase of enso we conducted multiple sensitivity analyses using different criterions first we investigated the hydroclimate response to different intensities of el niño events we further investigated the response to temporal evolution of el niño periods i e the beginning and termination of el niño periods an el niño event typifies a single time unit and an el niño period typifies a duration of time to isolate the interannual temporal variability of the hydrological data we removed the seasonal and long term trends from the composite time series the composite time series were the mean river discharge and rainfall station data for the four different climate types superposed epoch analysis sea suggests that rainfall and river discharge decrease at statistically significant values in response to the el niño phase of enso the duration of the decreasing trend can last upto seven years following the event of interest our sensitivity analyses highlight the nuanced hydroclimate response to el niño in the tropical pacific at the conception of an el niño period the hydroclimate variables follow a decreasing trend conversely at the termination of an el niño period we observe that the hydroclimate variables follow an increasing trend lastly rainfall has a quicker albeit a smaller amplitude response to the el niño phase of enso compared to river discharge the availability of a 100 year long monitoring dataset from the tropical pacific allowed an in depth analysis on how the hydrological processes respond to the el niño phase of enso our results have implications for water resource management avenues that traditionally investigate the seasonal response to the el niño or la niña phase of enso lyon 2004 lyon et al 2006 villafuerte et al

resource and watershed management on an interannual scale by deepening our understanding of tropical islands and the occurrences of long term tropical droughts we are better equipped to enhance water

based on the modified coronas classification following tolentino et al 2016 and ibarra et al 2021 figure 1a makanas 1990 jose and cruz 1999 river discharge interchangeably termed here as streamflow and rainfall data were subdivided following the four major climate types composite rainfall averaged over 1901 2020 ce and river discharge averaged over 1908 2017 ce climatologies reveal a distinct boreal summer wet season june october for climate type i figure 1b and 1f and a distinct boreal winter wet season november march for climate type ii figure 1c and 1g climate type iii figure 1d and 1h and climate type iv figure 1e and 1i have a less distinctive wet season river discharge and rainfall data that are part of the hydrological processes are termed here as hydroclimate hydrological variables were collated from multiple observation stations and one gridded spatial dataset river discharge which is sensitive to multiple hydrological processes such as rainfall runoff evapotranspiration and watershed catchment areas fundamentally reflects the amount of effective rainfall that is received the different datasets are briefly described below data handling steps to construct composite river discharge and rainfall time series covering the 20 th and 21 st century for each climate type are also described all steps described herein were conducted using python3 2 van rossum and drake 2009 and available as part of this publication see section 6 2 1 river discharge dataset monthly streamflow observations from 61 river discharge stations spanning 1908 2017 c e were analyzed in this study supplemental table 1 streamflow observation data for 55 stations from 1946 c e onwards come from ibarra et al 2021 and comprise three philippine datasets bureau of research standards dataset global runoff data centre dataset global streamflow indices and metadata archive reference dataset the acquisition and processing of streamflow data for the 55 stations are discussed in detail in tolentino et al 2016 and ibarra et al 2021 briefly the philippines department of public works and highways maintains records of river discharge data initially through the bureau of research and standards and now through the bureau of design the global runoff data center is a global dataset that records river discharge data and was initiated with the world meteorological organization global streamflow indices and metadata archive is a collection of daily streamflow observations gudmundsson et al 2018 we extend the ibarra et al 2021 streamflow observation data by incorporating historical river discharge data that spanned 1908 1922 c e for eight rivers the historical river discharge data is the result of daily streamflow measurements between 1908 and 1914 and 1918 1922 c e made by the irrigation division of the bureau of public works daily streamflow measurements were not made between december 1914 and june 1918 due to lack of funds historical data for 53 rivers are available through the bureau of public works however the daily measurements made were sparse and sporadic williams and gochoco 1924 therefore the criteria for selecting historical river discharge measurements in this study were twofold first data that extended the river discharge observations collated by ibarra et al 2021 were included second historical river discharge data that had measurements for nine or ten years 1908 1913 and 1918 1922 c e were included for further analyses eight historical river discharge data met this criteria bpw in supplemental table 1 in total 61 station datasets with monthly mean values of river discharge were included in this analysis supplemental figure 1 for this study daily discharge measurements reported in liters second were averaged to monthly means and normalized by the drainage area units of sq km resulting in mm month units comparable to the datasets collated in ibarra et al 2021 in cases where diurnal streamflow measurements were made we first took the daily average before downsampling to area normalized monthly means 2 2 rainfall amount dataset monthly rainfall data from 29 stations spanning 1901 2020 c e were analyzed supplemental table 2 data was collated from three different datasets the philippine weather bureau pwb dataset later digitized and archived by the japan agency for marine earth science and technology jamstec included daily rainfall amounts spanning 1901 1940 c e for 65 stations across the philippines kubota et al 2017 however the measured rainfall amount data are sporadic and sparse hence only pwb stations that had ten years of continuously measured rainfall data were selected for analyses 14 stations with daily rainfall data covering 1901 1940 c e met the aforementioned criteria the daily data were summed to give monthly rainfall totals in mm month next the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation aphrodite contains a gridded daily rainfall amount in inches based on a dense network of rain gauge stations interpolated at 0 25x0 25 yatagai et al 2012 rainfall data for 26 stations spanning 1951 1990 c e that extended either the pwb station data or data from 1991 to 2020 c e final dataset were incorporated as monthly rainfall totals in mm month aphrodite is the only gridded dataset used in this study the final dataset denoted as modern in supplemental table 2 is from the united states national centers for environmental information ncei an official repository of climate data from the world meteorological organization the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa regularly deposits its meteorological data in the ncei this third dataset spans rainfall measurements from 1991 to 2020 c e rainfall data measured in inches was converted to monthly totals in mm in order to include data with extreme rainfall amounts and to make the rainfall data more comparable to river discharge data daily rainfall data was summed to monthly rainfall totals in this analysis we are interested in investigating the spatial and temporal hydrological response to the el niño phase of enso in order to compare amplitude and lead and lag relationships between rainfall and river discharge we selected rainfall station data that was spatially and temporally equivalent to a river discharge station and within the same climate type figure 1a hence we note that there are multiple additional rainfall station data from the ncei dataset that were not utilized in this study out of 58 ncei stations we only used rainfall data from 28 stations spanning 1991 2020 c e 2 3 developing composite time series composite time series inorde to be consistent based on climate types were constructed to maximize the length of measured river discharge and rainfall data for subsequent analysis data handling steps to construct river discharge and rainfall data composite time series are described 1 individual river discharge and rainfall data in monthly means mm month and monthly sums mm month respectively were categorized according to the four major climate types 2 the mean of the subset river discharge and rainfall data based on climate types were calculated for example the composite river discharge time series of climate type i is the mean of 17 river discharge stations that fall under climate type i similarly climate type i composite rainfall data time series is the mean of seven rainfall amount stations 3 the mean data were then log transformed to approximately conform to a normal distribution the units are in log mm month 4 the log transformed data were standardized thereby data is unitless by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance hence variation on the y axis of the composite time series is the departure from the log transformed mean 5 a polynomial fit order 3 which best captured the shape of the long term trend was applied to the standardized data from step 4 the long term trend was removed to isolate the intrinsic variability in el niño and to minimize anthropogenic induced variability the resulting trend was then subtracted from the standardized data 6 finally sub seasonal and seasonal frequencies were removed from the detrended data to isolate the interannual variability of el niño cyclicity the sub seasonal and seasonal signal was removed by taking the 6 3 and 12 6 month centered moving average of each time series the resultant composite river discharge and rainfall time series based on the four different climate types were compared against the nino3 4 relative index time series next section missing values in both the rainfall and discharge datasets were assigned nan values for the rainfall datasets we down sampled from daily values to monthly aggregates if years did not have any daily data the subsequent monthly sums were not included in our analyses therefore missing daily data does not impact the observed trends analyzed next for the missing data in the historical discharge dataset we do not include the nan values in our calculations from instantaneous daily discharge l sec to monthly means mm months in ibarra et al 2021 the data are already presented in monthly means 2 4 nino3 4 relative index multiple indices measuring sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the tropical pacific exist to track oscillations between el niño neutral and la niña periods nino3 4 index acts as a bellwether to forecast the onset of enso conditions chen et al 2004 nino3 4 is the average sst anomaly departures from 1971 to 2000 c e in the region bounded by 5 n to 5 s from 170 w to 120 w local sst changes in this region which is indicative of changing deep tropical convection and atmospheric circulation are critical for affecting rainfall variability over the philippines lyon 2004 recent studies highlight the importance in removing the sst tropical trends to increase the sensitivity of the indices in relation to climate change turkington et al 2019 van oldenborgh et al 2021 the nino3 4 relative index is the nino3 4 sst anomaly after removing the tropical 20 s 20 n ocean sst trend van oldenborgh et al 2021 the sst values used in this study are from the extended reconstructed sea surface temperatures version 5 and span 1854 2020 c e huang et al 2017 an el niño period changes in its sst definition depending on the cited study for example trenberth 1997 defines an el niño period if sst anomalies ssta in the nino3 4 region exceed 0 4 c for six months or more in constrast ncei characterizes an el niño period by time periods when ssta in the nino3 4 region exceeds 0 5 c for five months dole et al 2018 lastly the national climate center classifies an el niño period if ssta in the nino3 4 region exceeds 0 8 c which is approximately 1 standard deviation greater than the average sst nicholls 1991 given the range in definitions of what constitutes an el niño period in this analysis we considered an el niño period when ssta in the nino3 4 region exceeded 1 c for three months or more next normal el niño events are classified as deviations of 1 c or greater lastly extreme el niño events are classified by a deviation of 2 2 c or greater in the nino3 4 region following the 1997 97 and 2015 16 events santoso et al 2017 to assess the response of the background noise tropical pacific conditions a superfluous signal with a minimally positive ssta is defined when ssta in the nino3 4 region range between 0 and 0 2 c 2 5 hydroclimate response to el niño events multiple superposed epoch analysis sea with different criterions were conducted to evaluate the range in response of the hydroclimate variables river discharge and rainfall to el niño events and periods sea is a statistical test that identifies the link magnitude and significance between discrete events and continuous time series within a probabilistic framework which is optimized by averaging across all events haurwitz and brier 1981 recently a modified double bootstrap sea framework rao et al 2019 that quantifies uncertainty in the median response and in the natural background variability has been used to investigate enso dee et al 2020 drought gazol and tiscar 2020 and river discharge rao et al 2020 briefly the median response in a sea is a deviation in climatology from a pre event time frame covering a post event time frame a total window length of 11 years which covers three years pre event to 7 years post event was used in our study year 0 therefore corresponds to an el niño event in the format of yyyy mm detailed methodology for the double bootstrap sea is described in rao et al 2019 sea was not conducted on historical 1901 1940 c e river discharge data due to a lack of sufficient and continuous data but was nevertheless included in our time series for graphical comparison with contemporaneous rainfall data to capture the whole range in the hydroclimate response sea was conducted on the composite river discharge and rainfall data with five different categories interchanged with criterion of what defines an event of interest 1 category i normal el niños a discrete time series list where every month with ssta in nino3 4 relative index is greater than 1 c and is thus considered an el niño event of interest 2 category ii extreme el niños a discrete time series list with only extreme el niños defined when ssta in nino3 4 relative index is greater than 2 2 c if multiple consecutive months have ssta s greater than 2 2 c only the month with the largest ssta was considered an event of interest therefore the discrete time series is constructed with the peak of extreme el niños 3 category iii conception of an el niño period a discrete time series that defines an event of interest as the first month during an el niño period of at least three continuous months greater than 1 c 4 category iv termination of an el niño period a discrete time series that defines an event of interest as the last month during an el niño period of at least three continuous months greater than 1 c 5 category v superfluous signal response a discrete time series that defines an event of interest within the neutral phase where ssta is between 0 and 0 2 c the categories therefore capture different flavors during enso s el niño phase category i and ii capture the intensities of el niño events category iii and iv together capture the response of the hydroclimate variables during the life cycle i e conception to termination of an el niño period category v superfluous signal was added to assess the validity of the sea between signal and background conditions of the tropical pacific the 5 th percentile median and 95 th percentile hydroclimate response is calculated from 1000 composite matrices using unique subsets of n events at random without replacement from the discrete event time series n events randomly selected represent approximately half the total number of events for each category events that were beyond the post year time period were not included for example 2015 05 is an el niño event of interest under category i however the post event 7 year period dates to 2022 05 c e as there is no hydroclimate or sst data yet available for that period 2015 05 is not included in the discrete time series which signifies the events of interest the 1 st 5 th 10 th 90 th 95 th 99 th significance thresholds needed to be exceeded for the sea response to be significant were calculated using random bootstrap generated by drawing pseudo events over the entire time series for the same number of n events brad adams et al 2003 the significance thresholds provide a robust assessment such that when the response crosses the threshold there is high confidence that the response is not a random signal the superfluous signal category falls within neutral conditions of enso atmosphere ocean dynamics the category assesses whether it is the el niño phase of enso that contributes to the hydroclimate response or neutral tropical pacific ocean conditions if the hydroclimate response to category v is the same for category i iv as shown by sea delineating between el niño or neutral conditions as the causal mode modulating the hydroclimate response would be difficult 3 results the composite river discharge and rainfall time series with the long term trend and seasonal signal removed for the four climate types compared against nino3 4 relative index are shown in figure 2 and 3 respectively the composite hydroclimate time series covers historical 1901 1940 c e and modern 1950 2020 c e periods the results from the data handling steps to obtain the composite time series for the four climate types for river discharge are shown in supplemental figure 3 6 and rainfall data are in supplemental figure 8 11 the polynomial fit to remove the long term trend and the subsequent detrended river discharge and rainfall data are in supplemental figure 7a h and figure 12a h respectively 3 1 seasonal distribution of el niño events the largest number of el niño events in category i normal el niños see section 2 5 for definitions of different categories occur during the boreal winter october february months figure 4a and 4e for all four climate types el niño events of interest in category i of composite river discharge and rainfall data occur throughout the year april is the month with the lowest number of el niño events the extreme el niño event category ii which is typically the peak a single month with ssta s greater than 2 2 c falls during the boreal winter months figure 4b and 4f this is in agreement with literature suggesting that boreal winter is the maturation period for the nino3 4 region in the pacific ocean mcphaden 2003 here we define the conception of an el niño period category iii as the first month of at least three continuous months with ssta s greater than 1 c filtered from events in category i the seasonal distribution of category iii events is bimodal over spring april june and winter october january months figure 4c and 4g the termination of the el niño period category iv is the last month of at least a three month period with ssta s greater than 1 c filtered from events in category i a majority of events in category iv occur during the boreal late winter early spring february march months figure 4d and 4h suggesting that the conception of el niño events occur in spring or winter conversely el niño periods terminate in the winter seemingly el niño events of interest are absent for category ii iii iv from the boreal summer months of july september this highlights the complex nature of investigating el niño response to hydroclimate variability on the seasonal scale from tropical island nations that are thought to be climate monoliths the variation in the number of counts in river discharge and rainfall data lies in the time continuous nature of the composite time series for the four major climate type the seasonal distribution of the sstas clustering around boreal winter and spring increases confidence in the utility of the discrete time series for sea this is especially the case for category ii which seemingly captures the maturation period of el niños 3 2 river discharge response to different el niño criterion river discharge for all climate types shows strong and statistically significant decreases in the years following el niño events of interest and lasting up to three to five years where an event is defined as any time yyyy mm with ssta greater than 1 c table 1a and figure 5a the decreasing trend and the magnitude of the decrease relative to the pre event climatology varies based on the climate type the strongest decrease in discharge median response relative to the three year pre event mean occurs three years post event i e year 0 3 before increasing at a statistical significance to pre event mean for climate type i orange crosses in figure 5a the 5 th and 95 th percentile response orange shading in figure 5a represents the degree of variability based on choices of 1000 unique sets of 50 el niño events from a total of 103 potential events similarly for climate type ii where ssta is 2 2 c extreme el niños the strongest decrease in discharge occurs five years post event table 1a before increasing olive green crosses in figure 5a the magnitude amplitude of river discharge decrease is the most severe and the trend lasts the longest for climate type ii compared to the remaining three climate types the magnitude and length of decrease in river discharge for climate type iii is similar to climate i s response strongest decrease in discharge occurs four years post event dark green crosses in figure 5a however the increase in discharge is more staggered in climate type iii compared to climate type i the decrease and increase in river discharge median response for climate type iv black crosses in figure 5a follows a similar pattern to climate type iii however the amplitude of decrease is approximately two times more severe in climate type iv than climate type i for category i in category ii table 1b river discharge for all climate types shows a strong decrease in the years following very strong el niño events and lasting up to four climate type i or seven climate type ii and iv years the decrease in river discharge relative to the pre event mean is statistically not significant for climate type iii the magnitude of the strongest decrease is for rivers in climate type ii 0 7 on the y axis the decrease in river discharge for climate types i is followed by an increase to pre event means our sea results for category iii that take a subset at the conception of an el niño period table 1c suggest a decrease in river discharge median response for all climate types the decreasing trend lasts between five climate type iii and seven climate type i and iv years the magnitude of the strongest decrease is for rivers in climate type iv 0 5 on the y axis the median response is statistically not significant for climate type ii conversely our sea results for category iv that take a subset at the termination of an el niño period table 1d suggests an increase in river discharge median response for climate types i iii and iv the increasing river discharge trend lasts for seven years for three climate types the magnitude of the strongest increase similar to category iii is for rivers in climate type iv 0 4 on the y axis river discharge decreases at a statistically insignificant level for climate type ii to ascertain the response of neutral conditions or the background variability superfluous signal check our sea result suggests an increase for climate type i and ii the response in climate type iii and iv is statistically insignificant the superfluous signal response is the opposite from category i and ii which are the conservative and extreme el niño events further the amplitude of the response is much smaller 0 05 compared to the response when using different el niño criterion therefore this result adds confidence that the response in river discharge to el niño events is a deviation from the neutral climate conditions in the nino3 4 region 3 3 rainfall amount response to different el niño criterion historical table 2a and modern table 3a rainfall response for all climate types show a strong and significant decrease in the years following el niño events and lasting up to two to four years where an event is defined as any time period with ssta greater than 1 c figure 5b and 5c the magnitude of decrease in rainfall data is not as strong as the response in river discharge data second the recovery to pre event mean climatology is faster by two to three years in both historical and modern rainfall response compared to river discharge response for category i demonstrating importance of aquifer storage and memory in tropical settings such as the philippines the low number of events in category ii for the historical rainfall data precludes a formal sea assessment however sea shows a decreasing trend in the modern rainfall at a statistical significance level for climate iii and iv in response to extreme el niño events category ii this is similar to the river discharge response to years following extreme el niño events the median response in rainfall suggests an increase to pre event mean conditions after three years following the strongest decrease in rainfall amount rainfall response is not significant for climate type i and is not included in the subsequent discussion the increase in climate type ii is statistically significant at the 90 confidence level table 3b for modern rainfall data this response in the hydroclimate stands out as an outlier compared to the modern rainfall response in climate type iii and iv similar to river discharge response to category iii which considers a subset of events at the conception of an el niño period our sea suggests historical table 2c and modern table 3c rainfall data decrease median response for all climate types lasting between four and seven years sea results for category iv that takes a subset at the termination of an el niño period table 2d and 3d suggest an increasing trend in historical and modern rainfall for all climate types the increasing trend in rainfall data lasts up to seven years following the event of interest for all climate types additionally the modern rainfall response in climate type i is not significant lastly for the response of neutral conditions or the background variability superfluous signal check sea result suggests an increase for historical rainfall data table 2e or a decrease that is statistically not significant for modern rainfall data table 3e for all climate types similar to the superfluous signal river discharge results these results add confidence that the response in rainfall data to el niño events is a deviation from the neutral climate conditions in the nino3 4 region 4 discussion hydroclimate variability in the tropical pacific islands relies on local and equally important on regional climate variability nurse et al 2014 higley and conroy 2019 multiple studies in the tropical pacific have focused on discerning the response of hydrological processes on a seasonal temporal scale to enso variability lyon et al 2006 villafuerte et al 2015 higley and conroy 2019 cerbelaud et al 2022 here we discuss the response of hydrological processes to the enso variability on an interannual scale we first discuss how different intensities of el niño events modulate the hydrological processes in the philippines next we discuss the importance of conception and termination of el niño events to the hydrological variability though the focus is on the philippines the results are discussed in context with the regional setting of the tropical pacific ocean and islands nations affected by enso teleconnections 4 1 hydrological response to the intensity of el niño events we found that following normal category i and extreme category ii el niño events rainfall and river discharge decrease relative to the pre event three year hydroclimate mean the duration of the decreasing hydroclimate trend lasts between three to seven years from the event year 0 on the x axis depending on the climate type and intensity of the el niño event table 1a b 2a b 3a c our results further suggest that the decreasing trend in river discharge can lag by one or two years compared to the rainfall this is the case regardless of climate type alternatively rainfall recovers to the pre event hydroclimate mean faster by one or two years compared to the recovery in river discharge data notably regardless of climate type our results suggest that the amplitude of response is greater for river discharge compared to rainfall the slower return to pre event hydroclimate conditions and the greater amplitude in response is likely attributed to multiple factors that govern river discharge and streamflow conditions where rainfall amount is coupled to ocean atmosphere dynamics lyon 2004 variability in streamflow conditions is sensitive to effective rainfall amount vegetation type size and slope of catchment area bedrock lithology baseflow conditions and floodplain aquifer storage stoelzle et al 2014 yang et al 2017 further tropical islands watershed hydrology is difficult to quantify given parsimonious conditions such as variation in forest canopy and storage watershed area small and steep catchment sizes christian et al 2019 litt et al 2020 the deseasoned and detrended composite time series used in our sea highlight the sensitivity of river discharge to watershed hydrological processes that are not present in the rainfall response and might contribute to the lagged response on a regional scale finally our composite rainfall time series that covers historical pre world war ii table 2a and modern 1950 s onwards table 3a time periods show similar trends with respect to duration and amplitude of response to normal el niño events this further strengthens the argument that rainfall indeed shows a decreasing trend following el niño events the same measurement could not be made for river discharge as we do not have enough events for historical discharge data the large magnitude and consistent decrease in the hydroclimate using the peak of extreme el niño category ii events suggests the legacy of el niño events can lead to potential long term multi year droughts to review category ii is an event of interest with the peak of an extreme el niño where an extreme el niño event is months with ssta s greater than 2 2 c our category ii event list comprised 1958 01 1972 12 1983 01 1992 02 1997 11 modern 1950 s onwards events our sea results for the extreme el niño events suggests that the decreasing trend in response to extreme el niño table 1b and 3b is potentially reflecting the el niño induced long term droughts the decreasing hydroclimate trend continues up to seven years relative to the pre event hydroclimate mean for both river discharge and rainfall composite time series our results are in line with investigations into river and rainfall response to enso on an interannual to interdecadal temporal scale in australia simpson et al 1993 arblaster et al 2002 rimbu et al 2004 the studies investigate the long term or legacy effects of enso on rainfall arblaster et al 2002 and streamflow rimbu et al 2004 variability rimbu et al 2004 found that streamflow variability is strongly correlated to the niño3 index during the 1900 1930 s similarly phases of the enso can trigger long term droughts in south america penalba and rivera 2016 cai et al 2020 and references therein on the interdecadal temporal scale regional drought conditions in south america through enso teleconnections are further compounded by the interdecadal pacific oscillation and the indian ocean dipole cai et al 2020 the relatively short instrumental monitoring record in australia and south america limits an investigation on the interannual to interdecadal temporal scale our study which utilizes a 100 year river discharge and rainfall dataset is the first such investigation into el niño triggering droughts in the tropical islands our study also places the framework of hydroclimatic variables responding to the intensity of el niño events and the duration of the response the latter is an advancement as most studies investigate the seasonal response of enso schmidt et al 2001 limited regional studies exist that investigate the hydrological processes affected by enso on the interannual temporal scale for the philippines sheffield and wood 2007 venkatappa et al 2021 the strength of utilizing sea is that it looks at the aggregate response for the events which for example are over 100 for category i as not all severe el niño events guarantee the nascence of droughts harger 1995 sea further allows us to observe an aggregate response which is useful when investigating el niño events as characteristics of individual el niño events are known to be slightly different harger 1995 fig 6 4 2 temporal placement in the el niño period dictates the trend in the hydrological response enso is a leading source of climate forcing for tropical droughts and is known to modulate droughts in the global tropical region on the interannual and interdecadal temporal scale krishnamurthy and goswami 2000 lyon 2004 mendoza et al 2005 chen et al 2021 chen et al 2021 investigated interdecadal el niño s effects on the central chinese summer rainfall during el niño s developing stages here we discuss how the temporal placement in an el niño period category iii and iv impacts the response in the hydroclimate variables in the philippines at the onset of an el niño period our results suggest that hydroclimate variables decrease up to seven years table 1c 2c 3c conversely at the termination of an el niño period category iv hydroclimate variables increase in as quickly as three years table 1d 2d 3d the temporal placement i e seasonality or inter annual in the el niño period highlights the importance of the variability between events for example 1957 04 is an event at the onset of a continuous el niño period that lasted until 1958 04 seven years post 1957 04 is 1964 04 and during this interval enso oscillates between neutral la niña and el niño phases figure 2a and 3a conversely the termination of the el niño period 1958 04 is bracketed on the pre event side with el niño conditions 1955 04 and with la niña and el niño conditions on the post event side similarly the 1997 05 event is the onset of a continuous el niño period that lasts till 1998 03 the pre event conditions largely fall in the el niño phase of enso and the post event conditions cover neutral la niña and el niño conditions the difference in the hydroclimate variable response to the placement in an el niño period implies sensitivity to antecedent surface conditions the conception of an el niño period category iii is followed by el niño neutral and la niña phases of enso the reduction in the convective system over southeast asia during the conception of an el niño period leads to a decrease in rainfall data which lasts up to seven years and is clearly visible in the historical rainfall data table 2c further the pre event mean is likely during a la niña or neutral phase where the antecedent soil moisture conditions are less likely to be drought prone however the inverse is the case for the hydroclimate response at the termination of an el niño period where the antecedent conditions are more likely to be reflecting drought conditions the post event years in this case are followed by neutral to la niña conditions therefore the varied response in amplitude and duration within the different climate types for category i normal el niño events suggests that land surface features such as vegetation and soil type as well as bedrock type antecedent soil moisture conditions and balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration are important factors modulating the amplitude and the duration of the response penalba and rivera 2016 van beusekom et al 2016 litt et al 2020 boas and mallants 2022 as such the general response in the hydroclimate is to increase following the termination of el niño periods the duration of response is consistently up to seven years table 1d 2d 3d regardless of river discharge or rainfall data this highlights the relatively quick response to wet conditions la niña compared to dry conditions el niño 5 conclusion understanding the interannual hydrological dynamics of island nations is imperative to better plan for water resource management and water resiliency higley and conroy 2019 nguyen et al 2021 the philippines nestled in the tropical pacific ocean is an island nation of over 7000 islands and heavily relies on rainfall to maintain groundwater and streamflow resources in our analysis we utilized a 100 year paired river discharge and rainfall data to ascertain the hydrological response to varying intensities and duration of el niño periods the mean log normalized scaled detrended with the seasonal signal removed composite time series for the four major climate types was compared against the nino3 4 relative index to discern the interannual response using sea analysis our analysis suggests that river discharge and rainfall decrease in response to normal and extreme el niño events the duration of the decreasing trend lasts up to three normal el niño events or seven extreme el niño events years relative to pre event mean following the event further the hydroclimate metrics respond differently based on the temporal placement of an event in an el niño period from conception to termination composite river discharge and rainfall data decrease up to seven years following the conception of an el niño period conversely the hydroclimate response is to increase up to seven years following the termination of an el niño period the magnitude of response is lagged in discharge compared to rainfall amount datasets which is more intimately linked to direct ocean atmosphere dynamics with further development of transfer functions between hydroclimate variables and el niño the fidelity of end of 21 st century simulations can be tested villafuerte et al 2020 desmet and ngo duc 2022 macalalad et al 2021 this is the first study to the best of our knowledge that attempts to quantify the sign magnitude and severity of the hydroclimate response to el niño events for the tropical pacific ocean the results have important implications for hydrological planning of water resources as the legacy effects of el niño might lead to potential long term tropical droughts open

7944,study region western tropical pacific ocean philippines study focus el niño southern oscillation enso modulates rainfall amount variability and by extension river discharge for the philippines on seasonal to interannual temporal scales the el niño phase of enso considerably decreases rainfall amounts on a seasonal scale with varying degrees of heterogeneity across the philippines the hydrological response of el niño on an interannual scale is relatively immature to investigate the hydrological response a composite time series of 29 rainfall and 61 river discharge stations spanning 1901 2020 and 1908 2017 c e respectively and covering the four major climate types in the philippines were critically assessed new hydrological insights for the region our statistical analyses results of a 100 year dataset demonstrate a decreasing trend compared to pre el niño conditions for both river discharge and rainfall the median response suggests the decreasing trend can last up to 7 years regardless of climate type rainfall amount returns to pre el niño conditions faster than river discharge the sign increasing or decreasing of the hydrological response is either decreasing if at conception of an el niño phase or increasing if at the termination of an el niño phase our results have implications for water resource management and water resiliency of island nations that strongly rely on the timely delivery of rainfall amount further our results highlight the legacy effects of el niño events that likely initiate long term droughts for island nations in western tropical pacific

catchments van beusekom et al 2016 higley and conroy 2019 tropical islands thereby rely on freshwater hydrological processes as ensuing short term droughts affect agriculture and long term droughts severely affect water resources guttman 1999 david et al 2022 the philippines nestled in the western tropical pacific ocean between 4 40 n to 21 10 n 116 40 e to 126 34 e with over 7000 islands in the archipelago figure 1a is acutely sensitive to both el niño and la niña phases of the enso lyon 2004 lyon et al 2006 the drought conditions during an el niño phase within the philippines is induced by the late onset of the rainy season early termination of the rainy season or a weak monsoon system characterized by isolated heavy rainfall events of short durations lansigan et al 2000 the large agronomic sectors in multiple tropical pacific ocean island nations rely on seasonal rainfall for crop production with multiple studies highlighting the loss in crop production during el niño events lansigan et al 2000 naylor et al 2001 cinco et al 2014 iizumi et al 2014 stuecker et al 2018 with data spanning 1987 2016 c e stuecker et al 2018 demonstrate that a decrease in rice production as a response to soil moisture deficits is associated with the el niño phase of enso for the philippines further complicating the relationship between el niño periods and the rainfall is the spatial heterogeneity across the philippines island nations are not climate monoliths and require robust analysis on a country wide scale before regional assessments are made on the impact of enso to the hydroclimate lyon 2004 lyon et al 2006 villafuerte et al 2014 2015 david et al 2022 further the legacy effects of el niño induced long term droughts on the hydrological processes in the philippines is still poorly understood the long term legacy effect of el niño with respect to drought conditions kolusu et al 2019 terrestrial ecosystems jorge romero et al 2021 and coral reefs claar et al 2018 highlight the need to investigate the response of the hydroclimate to el niño periods on an interannual temporal scale in tropical pacific island nations understanding the relationship between the hydroclimate and el niño periods on an interannual temporal scale is important for water resource management especially since extreme el niño events are predicted to increase in intensity and frequency due to anthropogenic induced greenhouse warming cai et al 2020 in this study we leverage 100 year long river discharge 1908 2017 c e and rainfall amount 1901 2020 c e dataset which is spatially spread across the philippines to discern the relationship between hydrological variables and el niño events for the 20 th and 21 st century paired rainfall amount and river discharge response to enso phases provide a nuanced response to hydroclimate variability which might be missed if only one variable is used schmidt et al 2001 poveda et al 2001 we assign river discharge data and rainfall amount data as the hydroclimate hydrological variables of interest where river discharge is an integration of rainfall over a given river basin and provides insight into the lagged response of the land atmosphere water cycle and rainfall data is a closer reflection to the ocean atmosphere water cycle and larger scale dynamical moisture delivery next to assess the range of hydroclimate responses to the el niño phase of enso we conducted multiple sensitivity analyses using different criterions first we investigated the hydroclimate response to different intensities of el niño events we further investigated the response to temporal evolution of el niño periods i e the beginning and termination of el niño periods an el niño event typifies a single time unit and an el niño period typifies a duration of time to isolate the interannual temporal variability of the hydrological data we removed the seasonal and long term trends from the composite time series the composite time series were the mean river discharge and rainfall station data for the four different climate types superposed epoch analysis sea suggests that rainfall and river discharge decrease at statistically significant values in response to the el niño phase of enso the duration of the decreasing trend can last upto seven years following the event of interest our sensitivity analyses highlight the nuanced hydroclimate response to el niño in the tropical pacific at the conception of an el niño period the hydroclimate variables follow a decreasing trend conversely at the termination of an el niño period we observe that the hydroclimate variables follow an increasing trend lastly rainfall has a quicker albeit a smaller amplitude response to the el niño phase of enso compared to river discharge the availability of a 100 year long monitoring dataset from the tropical pacific allowed an in depth analysis on how the hydrological processes respond to the el niño phase of enso our results have implications for water resource management avenues that traditionally investigate the seasonal response to the el niño or la niña phase of enso lyon 2004 lyon et al 2006 villafuerte et al 2014 2015 as irrigation dependent ecosystems address the growing scarcity of water perez blanco and sapino 2022 we highlight the legacy effects of el niño and its implications for tropical water resource and watershed management on an interannual scale by deepening our understanding of tropical islands and the occurrences of long term tropical droughts we are better equipped to enhance water resiliency in tropical islands as extreme events continue to rise villafuerte et al 2020 nguyen et al 2021 2 methodology and dataset description four major climate types prevail in the philippines based on the modified coronas classification following tolentino et al 2016 and ibarra et al 2021 figure 1a makanas 1990 jose and cruz 1999 river discharge interchangeably termed here as streamflow and rainfall data were subdivided following the four major climate types composite rainfall averaged over 1901 2020 ce and river discharge averaged over 1908 2017 ce climatologies reveal a distinct boreal summer wet season june october for climate type i figure 1b and 1f and a distinct boreal winter wet season november march for climate type ii figure 1c and 1g climate type iii figure 1d and 1h and climate type iv figure 1e and 1i have a less distinctive wet season river discharge and rainfall data that are part of the hydrological processes are termed here as hydroclimate hydrological variables were collated from multiple observation stations and one gridded spatial dataset river discharge which is sensitive to multiple hydrological processes such as rainfall runoff evapotranspiration and watershed catchment areas fundamentally reflects the amount of effective rainfall that is received the different datasets are briefly described below data handling steps to construct composite river discharge and rainfall time series covering the 20 th and 21 st century for each climate type are also described all steps described herein were conducted using python3 2 van rossum and drake 2009 and available as part of this publication see section 6 2 1 river discharge dataset monthly streamflow observations from 61 river discharge stations spanning 1908 2017 c e were analyzed in this study supplemental table 1 streamflow observation data for 55 stations from 1946 c e onwards come from ibarra et al 2021 and comprise three philippine datasets bureau of research standards dataset global runoff data centre dataset global streamflow indices and metadata archive reference dataset the acquisition and processing of streamflow data for the 55 stations are discussed in detail in tolentino et al 2016 and ibarra et al 2021 briefly the philippines department of public works and highways maintains records of river discharge data initially through the bureau of research and standards and now through the bureau of design the global runoff data center is a global dataset that records river discharge data and was initiated with the world meteorological organization global streamflow indices and metadata archive is a collection of daily streamflow observations gudmundsson et al 2018 we extend the ibarra et al 2021 streamflow observation data by incorporating historical river discharge data that spanned 1908 1922 c e for eight rivers the historical river discharge data is the result of daily streamflow measurements between 1908 and 1914 and 1918 1922 c e made by the irrigation division of the bureau of public works daily streamflow measurements were not made between december 1914 and june 1918 due to lack of funds historical data for 53 rivers are available through the bureau of public works however the daily measurements made were sparse and sporadic williams and gochoco 1924 therefore the criteria for selecting historical river discharge measurements in this study were twofold first data that extended the river discharge observations collated by ibarra et al 2021 were included second historical river discharge data that had measurements for nine or ten years 1908 1913 and 1918 1922 c e were included for further analyses eight historical river discharge data met this criteria bpw in supplemental table 1 in total 61 station datasets with monthly mean values of river discharge were included in this analysis supplemental figure 1 for this study daily discharge measurements reported in liters second were averaged to monthly means and normalized by the drainage area units of sq km resulting in mm month units comparable to the datasets collated in ibarra et al 2021 in cases where diurnal streamflow measurements were made we first took the daily average before downsampling to area normalized monthly means 2 2 rainfall amount dataset monthly rainfall data from 29 stations spanning 1901 2020 c e were analyzed supplemental table 2 data was collated from three different datasets the philippine weather bureau pwb dataset later digitized and archived by the japan agency for marine earth science and technology jamstec included daily rainfall amounts spanning 1901 1940 c e for 65 stations across the philippines kubota et al 2017 however the measured rainfall amount data are sporadic and sparse hence only pwb stations that had ten years of continuously measured rainfall data were selected for analyses 14 stations with daily rainfall data covering 1901 1940 c e met the aforementioned criteria the daily data were summed to give monthly rainfall totals in mm month next the asian precipitation highly resolved observational data integration towards evaluation aphrodite contains a gridded daily rainfall amount in inches based on a dense network of rain gauge stations interpolated at 0 25x0 25 yatagai et al 2012 rainfall data for 26 stations spanning 1951 1990 c e that extended either the pwb station data or data from 1991 to 2020 c e final dataset were incorporated as monthly rainfall totals in mm month aphrodite is the only gridded dataset used in this study the final dataset denoted as modern in supplemental table 2 is from the united states national centers for environmental information ncei an official repository of climate data from the world meteorological organization the philippine atmospheric geophysical and astronomical services administration pagasa regularly deposits its meteorological data in the ncei this third dataset spans rainfall measurements from 1991 to 2020 c e rainfall data measured in inches was converted to monthly totals in mm in order to include data with extreme rainfall amounts and to make the rainfall data more comparable to river discharge data daily rainfall data was summed to monthly rainfall totals in this analysis we are interested in investigating the spatial and temporal hydrological response to the el niño phase of enso in order to compare amplitude and lead and lag relationships between rainfall and river discharge we selected rainfall station data that was spatially and temporally equivalent to a river discharge station and within the same climate type figure 1a hence we note that there are multiple additional rainfall station data from the ncei dataset that were not utilized in this study out of 58 ncei stations we only used rainfall data from 28 stations spanning 1991 2020 c e 2 3 developing composite time series composite time series inorde to be consistent based on climate types were constructed to maximize the length of measured river discharge and rainfall data for subsequent analysis data handling steps to construct river discharge and rainfall data composite time series are described 1 individual river discharge and rainfall data in monthly means mm month and monthly sums mm month respectively were categorized according to the four major climate types 2 the mean of the subset river discharge and rainfall data based on climate types were calculated for example the composite river discharge time series of climate type i is the mean of 17 river discharge stations that fall under climate type i similarly climate type i composite rainfall data time series is the mean of seven rainfall amount stations 3 the mean data were then log transformed to approximately conform to a normal distribution the units are in log mm month 4 the log transformed data were standardized thereby data is unitless by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance hence variation on the y axis of the composite time series is the departure from the log transformed mean 5 a polynomial fit order 3 which best captured the shape of the long term trend was applied to the standardized data from step 4 the long term trend was removed to isolate the intrinsic variability in el niño and to minimize anthropogenic induced variability the resulting trend was then subtracted from the standardized data 6 finally sub seasonal and seasonal frequencies were removed from the detrended data to isolate the interannual variability of el niño cyclicity the sub seasonal and seasonal signal was removed by taking the 6 3 and 12 6 month centered moving average of each time series the resultant composite river discharge and rainfall time series based on the four different climate types were compared against the nino3 4 relative index time series next section missing values in both the rainfall and discharge datasets were assigned nan values for the rainfall datasets we down sampled from daily values to monthly aggregates if years did not have any daily data the subsequent monthly sums were not included in our analyses therefore missing daily data does not impact the observed trends analyzed next for the missing data in the historical discharge dataset we do not include the nan values in our calculations from instantaneous daily discharge l sec to monthly means mm months in ibarra et al 2021 the data are already presented in monthly means 2 4 nino3 4 relative index multiple indices measuring sea surface temperature sst anomalies in the tropical pacific exist to track oscillations between el niño neutral and la niña periods nino3 4 index acts as a bellwether to forecast the onset of enso conditions chen et al 2004 nino3 4 is the average sst anomaly departures from 1971 to 2000 c e in the region bounded by 5 n to 5 s from 170 w to 120 w local sst changes in this region which is indicative of changing deep tropical convection and atmospheric circulation are critical for affecting rainfall variability over the philippines lyon 2004 recent studies highlight the importance in removing the sst tropical trends to increase the sensitivity of the indices in relation to climate change turkington et al 2019 van oldenborgh et al 2021 the nino3 4 relative index is the nino3 4 sst anomaly after removing the tropical 20 s 20 n ocean sst trend van oldenborgh et al 2021 the sst values used in this study are from the extended reconstructed sea surface temperatures version 5 and span 1854 2020 c e huang et al 2017 an el niño period changes in its sst definition depending on the cited study for example trenberth 1997 defines an el niño period if sst anomalies ssta in the nino3 4 region exceed 0 4 c for six months or more in constrast ncei characterizes an el niño period by time periods when ssta in the nino3 4 region exceeds 0 5 c for five months dole et al 2018 lastly the national climate center classifies an el niño period if ssta in the nino3 4 region exceeds 0 8 c which is approximately 1 standard deviation greater than the average sst nicholls 1991 given the range in definitions of what constitutes an el niño period in this analysis we considered an el niño period when ssta in the nino3 4 region exceeded 1 c for three months or more next normal el niño events are classified as deviations of 1 c or greater lastly extreme el niño events are classified by a deviation of 2 2 c or greater in the nino3 4 region following the 1997 97 and 2015 16 events santoso et al 2017 to assess the response of the background noise tropical pacific conditions a superfluous signal with a minimally positive ssta is defined when ssta in the nino3 4 region range between 0 and 0 2 c 2 5 hydroclimate response to el niño events multiple superposed epoch analysis sea with different criterions were conducted to evaluate the range in response of the hydroclimate variables river discharge and rainfall to el niño events and periods sea is a statistical test that identifies the link magnitude and significance between discrete events and continuous time series within a probabilistic framework which is optimized by averaging across all events haurwitz and brier 1981 recently a modified double bootstrap sea framework rao et al 2019 that quantifies uncertainty in the median response and in the natural background variability has been used to investigate enso dee et al 2020 drought gazol and tiscar 2020 and river discharge rao et al 2020 briefly the median response in a sea is a deviation in climatology from a pre event time frame covering a post event time frame a total window length of 11 years which covers three years pre event to 7 years post event was used in our study year 0 therefore corresponds to an el niño event in the format of yyyy mm detailed methodology for the double bootstrap sea is described in rao et al 2019 sea was not conducted on historical 1901 1940 c e river discharge data due to a lack of sufficient and continuous data but was nevertheless included in our time series for graphical comparison with contemporaneous rainfall data to capture the whole range in the hydroclimate response sea was conducted on the composite river discharge and rainfall data with five different categories interchanged with criterion of what defines an event of interest 1 category i normal el niños a discrete time series list where every month with ssta in nino3 4 relative index is greater than 1 c and is thus considered an el niño event of interest 2 category ii extreme el niños a discrete time series list with only extreme el niños defined when ssta in nino3 4 relative index is greater than 2 2 c if multiple consecutive months have ssta s greater than 2 2 c only the month with the largest ssta was considered an event of interest therefore the discrete time series is constructed with the peak of extreme el niños 3 category iii conception of an el niño period a discrete time series that defines an event of interest as the first month during an el niño period of at least three continuous months greater than 1 c 4 category iv termination of an el niño period a discrete time series that defines an event of interest as the last month during an el niño period of at least three continuous months greater than 1 c 5 category v superfluous signal response a discrete time series that defines an event of interest within the neutral phase where ssta is between 0 and 0 2 c the categories therefore capture different flavors during enso s el niño phase category i and ii capture the intensities of el niño events category iii and iv together capture the response of the hydroclimate variables during the life cycle i e conception to termination of an el niño period category v superfluous signal was added to assess the validity of the sea between signal and background conditions of the tropical pacific the 5 th percentile median and 95 th percentile hydroclimate response is calculated from 1000 composite matrices using unique subsets of n events at random without replacement from the discrete event time series n events randomly selected represent approximately half the total number of events for each category events that were beyond the post year time period were not included for example 2015 05 is an el niño event of interest under category i however the post event 7 year period dates to 2022 05 c e as there is no hydroclimate or sst data yet available for that period 2015 05 is not included in the discrete time series which signifies the events of interest the 1 st 5 th 10 th 90 th 95 th 99 th significance thresholds needed to be exceeded for the sea response to be significant were calculated using random bootstrap generated by drawing pseudo events over the entire time series for the same number of n events brad adams et al 2003 the significance thresholds provide a robust assessment such that when the response crosses the threshold there is high confidence that the response is not a random signal the superfluous signal category falls within neutral conditions of enso atmosphere ocean dynamics the category assesses whether it is the el niño phase of enso that contributes to the hydroclimate response or neutral tropical pacific ocean conditions if the hydroclimate response to category v is the same for category i iv as shown by sea delineating between el niño or neutral conditions as the causal mode modulating the hydroclimate response would be difficult 3 results the composite river discharge and rainfall time series with the long term trend and seasonal signal removed for the four climate types compared against nino3 4 relative index are shown in figure 2 and 3 respectively the composite hydroclimate time series covers historical 1901 1940 c e and modern 1950 2020 c e periods the results from the data handling steps to obtain the composite time series for the four climate types for river discharge are shown in supplemental figure 3 6 and rainfall data are in supplemental figure 8 11 the polynomial fit to remove the long term trend and the subsequent detrended river discharge and rainfall data are in supplemental figure 7a h and figure 12a h respectively 3 1 seasonal distribution of el niño events the largest number of el niño events in category i normal el niños see section 2 5 for definitions of different categories occur during the boreal winter october february months figure 4a and 4e for all four climate types el niño events of interest in category i of composite river discharge and rainfall data occur throughout the year april is the month with the lowest number of el niño events the extreme el niño event category ii which is typically the peak a single month with ssta s greater than 2 2 c falls during the boreal winter months figure 4b and 4f this is in agreement with literature suggesting that boreal winter is the maturation period for the nino3 4 region in the pacific ocean mcphaden 2003 here we define the conception of an el niño period category iii as the first month of at least three continuous months with ssta s greater than 1 c filtered from events in category i the seasonal distribution of category iii events is bimodal over spring april june and winter october january months figure 4c and 4g the termination of the el niño period category iv is the last month of at least a three month period with ssta s greater than 1 c filtered from events in category i a majority of events in category iv occur during the boreal late winter early spring february march months figure 4d and 4h suggesting that the conception of el niño events occur in spring or winter conversely el niño periods terminate in the winter seemingly el niño events of interest are absent for category ii iii iv from the boreal summer months of july september this highlights the complex nature of investigating el niño response to hydroclimate variability on the seasonal scale from tropical island nations that are thought to be climate monoliths the variation in the number of counts in river discharge and rainfall data lies in the time continuous nature of the composite time series for the four major climate type the seasonal distribution of the sstas clustering around boreal winter and spring increases confidence in the utility of the discrete time series for sea this is especially the case for category ii which seemingly captures the maturation period of el niños 3 2 river discharge response to different el niño criterion river discharge for all climate types shows strong and statistically significant decreases in the years following el niño events of interest and lasting up to three to five years where an event is defined as any time yyyy mm with ssta greater than 1 c table 1a and figure 5a the decreasing trend and the magnitude of the decrease relative to the pre event climatology varies based on the climate type the strongest decrease in discharge median response relative to the three year pre event mean occurs three years post event i e year 0 3 before increasing at a statistical significance to pre event mean for climate type i orange crosses in figure 5a the 5 th and 95 th percentile response orange shading in figure 5a represents the degree of variability based on choices of 1000 unique sets of 50 el niño events from a total of 103 potential events similarly for climate type ii where ssta is 2 2 c extreme el niños the strongest decrease in discharge occurs five years post event table 1a before increasing olive green crosses in figure 5a the magnitude amplitude of river discharge decrease is the most severe and the trend lasts the longest for climate type ii compared to the remaining three climate types the magnitude and length of decrease in river discharge for climate type iii is similar to climate i s response strongest decrease in discharge occurs four years post event dark green crosses in figure 5a however the increase in discharge is more staggered in climate type iii compared to climate type i the decrease and increase in river discharge median response for climate type iv black crosses in figure 5a follows a similar pattern to climate type iii however the amplitude of decrease is approximately two times more severe in climate type iv than climate type i for category i in category ii table 1b river discharge for all climate types shows a strong decrease in the years following very strong el niño events and lasting up to four climate type i or seven climate type ii and iv years the decrease in river discharge relative to the pre event mean is statistically not significant for climate type iii the magnitude of the strongest decrease is for rivers in climate type ii 0 7 on the y axis the decrease in river discharge for climate types i is followed by an increase to pre event means our sea results for category iii that take a subset at the conception of an el niño period table 1c suggest a decrease in river discharge median response for all climate types the decreasing trend lasts between five climate type iii and seven climate type i and iv years the magnitude of the strongest decrease is for rivers in climate type iv 0 5 on the y axis the median response is statistically not significant for climate type ii conversely our sea results for category iv that take a subset at the termination of an el niño period table 1d suggests an increase in river discharge median response for climate types i iii and iv the increasing river discharge trend lasts for seven years for three climate types the magnitude of the strongest increase similar to category iii is for rivers in climate type iv 0 4 on the y axis river discharge decreases at a statistically insignificant level for climate type ii to ascertain the response of neutral conditions or the background variability superfluous signal check our sea result suggests an increase for climate type i and ii the response in climate type iii and iv is statistically insignificant the superfluous signal response is the opposite from category i and ii which are the conservative and extreme el niño events further the amplitude of the response is much smaller 0 05 compared to the response when using different el niño criterion therefore this result adds confidence that the response in river discharge to el niño events is a deviation from the neutral climate conditions in the nino3 4 region 3 3 rainfall amount response to different el niño criterion historical table 2a and modern table 3a rainfall response for all climate types show a strong and significant decrease in the years following el niño events and lasting up to two to four years where an event is defined as any time period with ssta greater than 1 c figure 5b and 5c the magnitude of decrease in rainfall data is not as strong as the response in river discharge data second the recovery to pre event mean climatology is faster by two to three years in both historical and modern rainfall response compared to river discharge response for category i demonstrating importance of aquifer storage and memory in tropical settings such as the philippines the low number of events in category ii for the historical rainfall data precludes a formal sea assessment however sea shows a decreasing trend in the modern rainfall at a statistical significance level for climate iii and iv in response to extreme el niño events category ii this is similar to the river discharge response to years following extreme el niño events the median response in rainfall suggests an increase to pre event mean conditions after three years following the strongest decrease in rainfall amount rainfall response is not significant for climate type i and is not included in the subsequent discussion the increase in climate type ii is statistically significant at the 90 confidence level table 3b for modern rainfall data this response in the hydroclimate stands out as an outlier compared to the modern rainfall response in climate type iii and iv similar to river discharge response to category iii which considers a subset of events at the conception of an el niño period our sea suggests historical table 2c and modern table 3c rainfall data decrease median response for all climate types lasting between four and seven years sea results for category iv that takes a subset at the termination of an el niño period table 2d and 3d suggest an increasing trend in historical and modern rainfall for all climate types the increasing trend in rainfall data lasts up to seven years following the event of interest for all climate types additionally the modern rainfall response in climate type i is not significant lastly for the response of neutral conditions or the background variability superfluous signal check sea result suggests an increase for historical rainfall data table 2e or a decrease that is statistically not significant for modern rainfall data table 3e for all climate types similar to the superfluous signal river discharge results these results add confidence that the response in rainfall data to el niño events is a deviation from the neutral climate conditions in the nino3 4 region 4 discussion hydroclimate variability in the tropical pacific islands relies on local and equally important on regional climate variability nurse et al 2014 higley and conroy 2019 multiple studies in the tropical pacific have focused on discerning the response of hydrological processes on a seasonal temporal scale to enso variability lyon et al 2006 villafuerte et al 2015 higley and conroy 2019 cerbelaud et al 2022 here we discuss the response of hydrological processes to the enso variability on an interannual scale we first discuss how different intensities of el niño events modulate the hydrological processes in the philippines next we discuss the importance of conception and termination of el niño events to the hydrological variability though the focus is on the philippines the results are discussed in context with the regional setting of the tropical pacific ocean and islands nations affected by enso teleconnections 4 1 hydrological response to the intensity of el niño events we found that following normal category i and extreme category ii el niño events rainfall and river discharge decrease relative to the pre event three year hydroclimate mean the duration of the decreasing hydroclimate trend lasts between three to seven years from the event year 0 on the x axis depending on the climate type and intensity of the el niño event table 1a b 2a b 3a c our results further suggest that the decreasing trend in river discharge can lag by one or two years compared to the rainfall this is the case regardless of climate type alternatively rainfall recovers to the pre event hydroclimate mean faster by one or two years compared to the recovery in river discharge data notably regardless of climate type our results suggest that the amplitude of response is greater for river discharge compared to rainfall the slower return to pre event hydroclimate conditions and the greater amplitude in response is likely attributed to multiple factors that govern river discharge and streamflow conditions where rainfall amount is coupled to ocean atmosphere dynamics lyon 2004 variability in streamflow conditions is sensitive to effective rainfall amount vegetation type size and slope of catchment area bedrock lithology baseflow conditions and floodplain aquifer storage stoelzle et al 2014 yang et al 2017 further tropical islands watershed hydrology is difficult to quantify given parsimonious conditions such as variation in forest canopy and storage watershed area small and steep catchment sizes christian et al 2019 litt et al 2020 the deseasoned and detrended composite time series used in our sea highlight the sensitivity of river discharge to watershed hydrological processes that are not present in the rainfall response and might contribute to the lagged response on a regional scale finally our composite rainfall time series that covers historical pre world war ii table 2a and modern 1950 s onwards table 3a time periods show similar trends with respect to duration and amplitude of response to normal el niño events this further strengthens the argument that rainfall indeed shows a decreasing trend following el niño events the same measurement could not be made for river discharge as we do not have enough events for historical discharge data the large magnitude and consistent decrease in the hydroclimate using the peak of extreme el niño category ii events suggests the legacy of el niño events can lead to potential long term multi year droughts to review category ii is an event of interest with the peak of an extreme el niño where an extreme el niño event is months with ssta s greater than 2 2 c our category ii event list comprised 1958 01 1972 12 1983 01 1992 02 1997 11 modern 1950 s onwards events our sea results for the extreme el niño events suggests that the decreasing trend in response to extreme el niño table 1b and 3b is potentially reflecting the el niño induced long term droughts the decreasing hydroclimate trend continues up to seven years relative to the pre event hydroclimate mean for both river discharge and rainfall composite time series our results are in line with investigations into river and rainfall response to enso on an interannual to interdecadal temporal scale in australia simpson et al 1993 arblaster et al 2002 rimbu et al 2004 the studies investigate the long term or legacy effects of enso on rainfall arblaster et al 2002 and streamflow rimbu et al 2004 variability rimbu et al 2004 found that streamflow variability is strongly correlated to the niño3 index during the 1900 1930 s similarly phases of the enso can trigger long term droughts in south america penalba and rivera 2016 cai et al 2020 and references therein on the interdecadal temporal scale regional drought conditions in south america through enso teleconnections are further compounded by the interdecadal pacific oscillation and the indian ocean dipole cai et al 2020 the relatively short instrumental monitoring record in australia and south america limits an investigation on the interannual to interdecadal temporal scale our study which utilizes a 100 year river discharge and rainfall dataset is the first such investigation into el niño triggering droughts in the tropical islands our study also places the framework of hydroclimatic variables responding to the intensity of el niño events and the duration of the response the latter is an advancement as most studies investigate the seasonal response of enso schmidt et al 2001 limited regional studies exist that investigate the hydrological processes affected by enso on the interannual temporal scale for the philippines sheffield and wood 2007 venkatappa et al 2021 the strength of utilizing sea is that it looks at the aggregate response for the events which for example are over 100 for category i as not all severe el niño events guarantee the nascence of droughts harger 1995 sea further allows us to observe an aggregate response which is useful when investigating el niño events as characteristics of individual el niño events are known to be slightly different harger 1995 fig 6 4 2 temporal placement in the el niño period dictates the trend in the hydrological response enso is a leading source of climate forcing for tropical droughts and is known to modulate droughts in the global tropical region on the interannual and interdecadal temporal scale krishnamurthy and goswami 2000 lyon 2004 mendoza et al 2005 chen et al 2021 chen et al 2021 investigated interdecadal el niño s effects on the central chinese summer rainfall during el niño s developing stages here we discuss how the temporal placement in an el niño period category iii and iv impacts the response in the hydroclimate variables in the philippines at the onset of an el niño period our results suggest that hydroclimate variables decrease up to seven years table 1c 2c 3c conversely at the termination of an el niño period category iv hydroclimate variables increase in as quickly as three years table 1d 2d 3d the temporal placement i e seasonality or inter annual in the el niño period highlights the importance of the variability between events for example 1957 04 is an event at the onset of a continuous el niño period that lasted until 1958 04 seven years post 1957 04 is 1964 04 and during this interval enso oscillates between neutral la niña and el niño phases figure 2a and 3a conversely the termination of the el niño period 1958 04 is bracketed on the pre event side with el niño conditions 1955 04 and with la niña and el niño conditions on the post event side similarly the 1997 05 event is the onset of a continuous el niño period that lasts till 1998 03 the pre event conditions largely fall in the el niño phase of enso and the post event conditions cover neutral la niña and el niño conditions the difference in the hydroclimate variable response to the placement in an el niño period implies sensitivity to antecedent surface conditions the conception of an el niño period category iii is followed by el niño neutral and la niña phases of enso the reduction in the convective system over southeast asia during the conception of an el niño period leads to a decrease in rainfall data which lasts up to seven years and is clearly visible in the historical rainfall data table 2c further the pre event mean is likely during a la niña or neutral phase where the antecedent soil moisture conditions are less likely to be drought prone however the inverse is the case for the hydroclimate response at the termination of an el niño period where the antecedent conditions are more likely to be reflecting drought conditions the post event years in this case are followed by neutral to la niña conditions therefore the varied response in amplitude and duration within the different climate types for category i normal el niño events suggests that land surface features such as vegetation and soil type as well as bedrock type antecedent soil moisture conditions and balance between precipitation and evapotranspiration are important factors modulating the amplitude and the duration of the response penalba and rivera 2016 van beusekom et al 2016 litt et al 2020 boas and mallants 2022 as such the general response in the hydroclimate is to increase following the termination of el niño periods the duration of response is consistently up to seven years table 1d 2d 3d regardless of river discharge or rainfall data this highlights the relatively quick response to wet conditions la niña compared to dry conditions el niño 5 conclusion understanding the interannual hydrological dynamics of island nations is imperative to better plan for water resource management and water resiliency higley and conroy 2019 nguyen et al 2021 the philippines nestled in the tropical pacific ocean is an island nation of over 7000 islands and heavily relies on rainfall to maintain groundwater and streamflow resources in our analysis we utilized a 100 year paired river discharge and rainfall data to ascertain the hydrological response to varying intensities and duration of el niño periods the mean log normalized scaled detrended with the seasonal signal removed composite time series for the four major climate types was compared against the nino3 4 relative index to discern the interannual response using sea analysis our analysis suggests that river discharge and rainfall decrease in response to normal and extreme el niño events the duration of the decreasing trend lasts up to three normal el niño events or seven extreme el niño events years relative to pre event mean following the event further the hydroclimate metrics respond differently based on the temporal placement of an event in an el niño period from conception to termination composite river discharge and rainfall data decrease up to seven years following the conception of an el niño period conversely the hydroclimate response is to increase up to seven years following the termination of an el niño period the magnitude of response is lagged in discharge compared to rainfall amount datasets which is more intimately linked to direct ocean atmosphere dynamics with further development of transfer functions between hydroclimate variables and el niño the fidelity of end of 21 st century simulations can be tested villafuerte et al 2020 desmet and ngo duc 2022 macalalad et al 2021 this is the first study to the best of our knowledge that attempts to quantify the sign magnitude and severity of the hydroclimate response to el niño events for the tropical pacific ocean the results have important implications for hydrological planning of water resources as the legacy effects of el niño might lead to potential long term tropical droughts open
