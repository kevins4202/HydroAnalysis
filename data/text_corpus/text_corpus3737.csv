18685,populations of candidatus accumulibacter a known polyphosphate accumulating organism within clade ic have been proposed to perform anoxic p uptake activity in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems using nitrate as electron acceptor however no consensus has been reached on the ability of ca accumulibacter members of clade ic to reduce nitrate to nitrite discrepancies might relate to the diverse operational conditions which could trigger the expression of the nap and or nar enzyme and or to the accuracy in clade classification this study aimed to assess whether and how certain operational conditions could lead to the enrichment and enhance the denitrification capacity of ca accumulibacter within clade ic to study the potential induction of the denitrifying enzyme an ebpr culture was enriched under anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o conditions that based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and ppk gene sequencing was composed of around 97 on a biovolume basis of affiliates of ca accumulibacter clade ic the influence of the medium composition sludge retention time srt polyphosphate content of the biomass poly p nitrate dosing approach and minimal aerobic srt on potential nitrate reduction were studied despite the different studied conditions applied only a negligible anoxic p uptake rate was observed equivalent to maximum 13 of the aerobic p uptake rate an increase in the anoxic srt at the expenses of the aerobic srt resulted in deterioration of p removal with limited aerobic p uptake and insufficient acetate uptake in the anaerobic phase a near complete genome completeness 100 contamination 0 187 was extracted from the metagenome of the ebpr biomass for the here proposed ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic according to full genome based phylogenetic analysis this lineage was distant from the canonical ca accumulibacter phosphatis with closest neighbor ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic within clade ic this was cross validated with taxonomic classification of the ppk1 gene sequences the genome centric metagenomic analysis highlighted the presence of genes for assimilatory nitrate reductase nas and periplasmic nitrate reductase nap but no gene for respiratory nitrate reductases nar this suggests that ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic was not capable to generate the required energy atp from nitrate under strict anaerobic anoxic conditions to support an anoxic ebpr metabolism definitely this study stresses the incongruence in denitrification abilities of ca accumulibacter clades and reflects the true intra clade diversity which requires a thorough investigation within this lineage graphical abstract image 1 keywords candidatus accumulibacter dpao pao ic denitrification anoxic phosphate uptake genome centric metagenomics 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is a process applied worldwide to remove phosphorus in wastewater treatment plants wwtp henze et al 2008 ebpr is carried out by microorganisms that are capable of storing phosphorus beyond their growth requirements as polyphosphate poly p known as polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos comeau et al 1986 the pao guild comprises multiple genera stokholm bjerregaard et al 2017 with candidatus accumulibacter as well described primary population the relative abundance of ca accumulibacter hereafter referred to as pao has been correlated with good ebpr in wwtps with different configurations worldwide kong et al 2002 zilles et al 2002 saunders et al 2003 he et al 2005 wong et al 2005 ca accumulibacter performs different metabolic processes depending on the availability of terminal electron acceptors under anaerobic conditions i e no electron acceptor available according to environmental engineering lexicon this pao stores carbon e g acetate propionate as poly β hydroxyalkanoates phas at the expense of polyphosphate poly p hydrolysis and glycogen degradation thereafter when an electron acceptor is available such as dissolved oxygen under aerobic conditions and nitrite and presumably nitrate under anoxic conditions the organism consumes the stored pha to replenish its poly p and glycogen storage pools for biomass synthesis and cellular maintenance comeau et al 1986 wentzel et al 1986 smolders et al 1994a 1994b kuba et al 1996b previous studies have suggested that members of the pao guild have different affinities and potentials to use nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors for anoxic p uptake kerrn jespersen and henze 1993 kuba et al 1993 1996a 1997 ahn et al 2001a 2001b kerrn jespersen and henze 1993 have postulated the existence of two types of paos one denitrifying pao type able to use nitrate and oxygen as electron acceptors herein identified as or dpao and another pao type capable of using only oxygen through the long term operation of two sequencing batch reactors sbrs operated under anaerobic anoxic a2 and anaerobic oxic conditions a o kuba et al 1993 have observed that dpao could exhibit an anoxic ebpr activity similar to that of pao on oxygen carvalho et al 2007 observed that rod shaped paos exhibited satisfactory anoxic p removal on nitrate while coccus shaped pao showed poor anoxic ebpr activity later on based on fine scale differences in the genetic sequences of the ppk1 gene peterson et al 2008 identified the existence of two ca accumulibacter clades i and ii with several subclades ia id and iia iig oligonucleotide probes and primers set were designed on this molecular basis for rapid detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and polymerase chain reaction pcr based on these findings and correlations with process performances oehmen et al 2010a b re assessed the different pao phenotypes observed by carvalho et al 2007 and suggested that clade i was responsible for the anoxic p uptake activity observed in ebpr systems in agreement flowers et al 2009 observed that a culture enriched in clade i ca 70 11 based on fish bio volume was able to denitrify without requiring any acclimatization step while a culture dominated by clade ii approx 55 7 clade ii and 32 0 5 clade i per bio volume could not nevertheless after a 24 h acclimatization period to the presence of nitrate both ebpr systems performed a simultaneous denitrification and p uptake activity the anoxic p uptake activity observed in the latter clade ii culture was associated to the presence of the clade i fraction in the system flowers et al 2009 lanham et al 2011 enriched a clade i culture approx 90 bio volume under anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o conditions their enrichment was capable to take up about 12 mg po4 p g 1vss h 1 using nitrate as electron acceptor contrary to the strict a2 operating conditions of kuba et al 1993 the authors reported that maintaining an oxic stage seemed to have been a key condition to secure the reactor stability and obtain a highly enriched clade i culture on the other hand through the execution of short term studies saad et al 2016 and rubio rincón et al 2017a reported that clade i further identified via ppk gene sequence analysis as populations of ca accumulibacter clade ic was unable to use nitrate as electron acceptor as efficient as oxygen or nitrite they suggested that when anoxic p uptake takes place the underlying members of clade ic may use the nitrite generated from the reduction of nitrate by side populations within the microbial community possibly glycogen accumulating organisms gaos or ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos nevertheless both studies were based on the conduction of short term hours batch activity tests with a culture of clade ic affiliates enriched under a o conditions in contrast recent studies performed by camejo et al 2016 have suggested that some populations of clade ic can efficiently use nitrate as electron acceptor for the oxidation of pha and p uptake from a molecular and microbial perspective early genome centric metagenome analyses of populations of ca accumulibacter clades ia and ic have not been able to detect the respiratory nitrate reductase gene nar required for nitrate respiration flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 similar to clade iia and iif recently camejo et al 2018 have identified one ca accumulibacter population of clade ic harbouring a nar gene the denitrification pathway of the aforementioned clades only includes the presence of the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene nap and the required genes to denitrify from nitrite onwards garcía martín et al 2006 flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 according to moreno vivián et al 1999 the main difference among these genes is the potential of their expressed enzyme nap nar to generate energy as atp while both enzymes can reduce nitrate to nitrite only the nar enzyme has been correlated with enough generation of energy as atp to sustain bacterial growth and other microbial processes moreno vivián et al 1999 as such and in view of the contradictory findings previously described the gene expression mechanisms could be responsible for the different anoxic p uptake activities of clade ic phylotypes in ebpr systems reported in literature as first suggested by skennerton et al 2014 it remains unclear which fraction of ca accumulibacter clade ic species harbor the nap or nar genes and if these genes are present in their genome which operational factors could induce their enzymatic expression we aimed to assess the influence of different operating conditions on a clade ic enriched culture rubio rincón et al 2017a the main factors studied were i a high p cod ratio 0 06 g p g 1 cod ii a long sludge retention time srt of 15 d iii a low p cod ratio of 0 03 g p g 1 cod iv a short aerobic srt of 1 5 d and v pulse and continuous nitrate dosing modes combining mixed culture stoichiometry and kinetics investigation with molecular biology and genome centric metagenomics analysis of the here proposed ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic this study contributes to assess conditions that may stimulate and enhance the use of nitrate and elucidate their potential role in ebpr systems it further stresses the need to reappraise metabolic functionalities inside and across clades of the ca accumulibacter lineage and microbial lineages in general beyond correlations observed between relative abundances of clades and biochemical conversions monitored 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation a culture of a ca accumulibacter clade ic population was enriched in a 3 l double jacket stirred tank reactor applikon delft the netherlands with a working volume of 2 5 l a volume of 500 ml of activated sludge from the ebpr wwtp nieuwe waterweg hoek van holland the netherlands was used as inoculum prior to the start of the study the reactor was operated under anaerobic oxic a o conditions for more than a year experimental period a rubio rincón et al 2017a thereafter the operational conditions were changed to anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o experimental period b table 1 once the system was operated under a2o in a pseudo steady state experimental period b the medium composition was changed from the one used by smolders et al 1994a b to the one used by kuba et al 1993 experimental period c with low and high potassium concentration respectively in order to give the opportunity to the assumed slow growing dpaos to proliferate the srt was extended from 8 to 15 d in the experimental period d due to the potential role of gaos in the denitrification activities observed in ebpr systems rubio rincón et al 2017a the feeding p cod ratio was decreased from 0 06 to 0 03 g p g 1 cod experimental period e and f respectively in the experimental period g to address if dpaos could be r or k strategists the nitrate dosing mode was changed from a pulse feeding carried out in 1 min to a longer feeding period of 30 min at a 1 ml min flowrate as studied by kuba et al 1993 tu and schuler 2013 keeping the same nitrate concentration dosed 10 mg no3 n l 1 finally to wash the aerobic paos out and select for dpaos the length of the aerobic phase was gradually decreased and consequently the aerobic srt was shortened from 2 2 days to 0 9 days in experimental period g and further to 0 4 days in experimental period h which is lower than the minimum aerobic srt estimated by brdjanovic et al 1998 of about 1 25 d for a o enriched pao the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h the ph was controlled at 7 6 0 1 with the addition of 0 4 mol l 1 naoh and 0 1 mol l 1 hcl temperature was controlled at 20 1 c in order to create and maintain the anaerobic conditions dinitrogen gas was sparged at the bottom of the reactor during the first 30 min of the anaerobic phase and a water lock was installed at the off gas outlet nitrate was fed either as pulse or continuously for 30 min in accordance to the corresponding experimental period from a bottle containing a 1 g no3 n l 1 stock solution the dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled at 20 of the saturation level by sparging on off compressed air and dinitrogen gas both gases were controlled at 10 l h 1 do and ph levels were monitored continuously ortho phosphate po4 p mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations were measured twice per week when no significant changes in these parameters were observed for more than 3 srts it was assumed that the system had reached pseudo steady state conditions 2 2 nitrate based dpao batch activity tests in order to assess if the biomass specific organic load food to microorganisms f m ratio affecting the anaerobic pha storage and therefore the intracellular carbon availability and its potential impact on the anoxic phosphorus uptake two batch tests were carried out ex situ with half batch 1d and twice batch 2d the f m ratio 37 and 148 mg cod g 1 vss respectively applied in the regular operation of the parent reactor the medium composition was the same like in the operation of the parent reactor each batch test was performed with 200 ml of mlss collected and transferred during experimental period d table 1 in a double jacketed reactor operated at 20 c with a 400 ml working volume the cycle of the batch tests was composed of 1 h of anaerobic and 4 h of anoxic phases in each batch test nitrate was fed as a pulse reaching a concentration of around 45 mg no3 n l 1 dinitrogen gas was continuously sparged at the bottom of the reactor at 10 l h 1 in order to maintain the anaerobic conditions ph was kept at 7 6 0 1 with the automatic addition of 0 4 mol l 1 hcl and 0 4 mol l 1 naoh 2 3 cultivation medium the cultivation medium were prepared in two separate bottles of 10 l carbon and mineral solutions and concentrated 10 times the influent medium fed contained per liter 400 mg cod composed by acetate and propionate supplied in a 3 1 cod ratio 4 mg ca 36 mg so4 2 9 mg mg2 1 mg yeast extract 20 mg n allylthiourea atu and 300 μl of trace element solution prepared according to smolders et al 1994a b in addition the influent medium for i the experimental periods a and b contained per liter 36 mg nh4 n 25 mg po4 p 19 mg k and 18 mg na ii for periods c d and e the medium composition was change to increase the concentration of potassium as reported by kuba et al 1993 to 83 mg nh4 n 25 mg po4 p 50 mg k and 0 mg na and iii for f g and h 83 mg nh4 n 15 mg po4 p 38 mg k and 0 mg na per liter 2 4 chemical analyses ortho phosphate po4 p nitrite no2 n mlss and mlvss were analytically determined as described in apha 2005 nitrate no3 n was measured according to iso 7890 1 1986 acetate and propionate were measured using a varian 430 gc gas chromatograph gc equipped with a split injector 200 c and a wcot fused silica column 105 c coupled to a fid detector 300 c helium was used as carrier gas and 50 μl of butyric acid as internal standard 2 5 characterization of microbial community compositions in order to estimate the relative abundance of the microbial communities along the different experimental periods fish analyses were performed as described by amann 1995 since propionivibrio was not observed with 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing and because the pao 651 fish probe suggested by albertsen et al 2016 has a coverage of 71 of the species from the genus ca accumulibacter the mix probe of pao 651 pao 462 and pao 846 suggested by crocetti et al 2000 was used to target the ca accumulibacter genus with a 89 coverage to differentiate among the different pao clades the probes acc 1 444 pao i and acc 2 444 pao ii were used flowers et al 2009 glycogen accumulating organisms gaos were identified with the gb probe according to kong et al 2002 defluvicoccus clades 1 and 2 were identified with tfo df215 tfo df618 df988 and df1020 probes wong et al 2004 meyer et al 2006 vectashield with dapi was used to avoid the fading of staining and stain all living organisms nielsen et al 2009 fish quantification of each probe was performed by image analysis of 25 random pictures taken with an olympus bx5i microscope and analyzed with the software cell dimensions 1 5 the standard error of the mean was calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of pictures 2 6 analyses of bacterial community compositions by v4 v6 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing genomic dna gdna was extracted using the ultraclean microbial dna extraction kit supplied by mobio laboratories inc ca usa according to the manufacturer s protocol except that the bead beating was substituted by a combination of 5 min heating at 65 c and 5 min beat beating to ensure maximum yields to check for quality and quantity the gdna extracts were loaded onto a 1 agarose gel in 1x tae running buffer analysis of the extracted gdna showed a large high molecular weight fraction and well visible dna yields in comparison to the smart ladder eurogentech nederland b v the extracted gdna was subsequently used for a two step pcr reaction targeting the 16s rrna gene of most bacteria and archaea using the primers u515f 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggta 3 and u1071r 5 garctgrcgrcrrccatgca 3 following wang and qian 2009 the first amplification step was performed to enrich for 16s rrna genes via quantitative pcr qpcr the qpcr reaction comprised 2x iq sybr green supermix bio rad ca usa 500 nmol l 1 primers each and 1 50 ng gdna template added per well final volume of 20 μl by adding miliq water the qpcr program went along a first denaturation at 95 c for 5 min followed by 20 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 50 c for 40 s and elongation at 72 c for 40 s prior to final elongation at 72 c for 7 min during the second step 454 adapters roche and mid tags at the u515f primer were added to the products of step one this protocol was similar to the ones previously described but only taq pcr master mix qiagen inc ca usa was used the program was run for 15 cycles the template product from step one was used as template dna and diluted ten times after the second amplification 12 pcr products were pooled in equimolar ratio and purified over an agarose gel using a genejet gel extraction kit thermo fisher scientific the netherlands the resulting library was send for 454 sequencing and run in 1 8 lane with titanium chemistry by macrogen inc seoul korea after sequencing the reads library was imported into the clc genomics workbench v7 5 1 clc bio aarhus dk and quality limit 0 05 and max two ambiguities allowed trimmed to a minimum of 200 bp and average of 284 bp after trimming the datasets were de multiplexed resulting in 12 samples with an average of 7800 reads per sample a build it silva 123 1 ssuref nr99 taxonomic database was used for blastn analysis on the reads under default conditions to identify chimeric sequences we used the online tool decipher wright et al 2012 a very small portion of reads had a non significant match and were discarded the chimera check was done but eventually not implemented as they were in minor amounts present and of non significant importance to the final results sequences were only included if the e value was sufficient low e 50 the top result was imported into an excel spreadsheet and used to determine taxonomic affiliation and species abundance 2 7 molecular analysis of ca accumulibacter clades by pcr amplification and sequencing of the ppk1 functional gene a direct pcr was performed to identify the ca accumulibacter clade enriched in the biosystem based on the polyphosphate kinase ppk1 functional gene as described by mcmahon et al 2007 the pcr amplicons were produced using accppk1 254f 5 tcac cacc gacg gcaa gac 3 and accppk1 1376r 5 tcga tcat cagc atct tggc 3 primers and sanger sequenced by baseclear leiden the netherlands both strands were quality checked and found non ambiguous subsequently both were aligned to yield a high quality near complete ppk1 gene the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method implemented in the clc genomics workbench package as described by saad et al 2016 in total 332 amino acid positions were used for calculations 2 8 genome centric metagenomic analysis of the ca accumulibacter and flanking lineages present in the reactor two biological samples collected during the anaerobic aerobic and anaerobic anoxic aerobic operations were selected for metagenome sequencing analysis wet lab treatments of aliquots of the ebpr biomass were performed to suppress their background contribution of accompanying populations to the metagenomes and to eventually isolate the ca accumulibacter genome bin by differential coverage synthetic shifts in relative abundances of microbial populations were achieved by contacting the biomass to different substrate temperature and dissolved oxygen conditions in shake flasks gdna was extracted from these samples using the fast dna spin kit for soils mp biomedicals usa by 4 series of 40 s of bead beating the bacterial community compositions were characterized beforehand by v1 v3 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing analysis primer pair 8f 518r according to the midas field guide of activated sludge mcilroy et al 2015 the gdna extracts were purified and prepared for sequencing of the metagenomes using the nextera xt dna sample preparation kit illumina usa according to manufacturer s instructions all purifications steps were performed using the agencourt ampure xp clean up system beckman coulter usa the dual multiplexed pools of tagmented and indexed dna fragments were sequenced on a miseq benchtop sequencer illumina usa at a sequencing depth of 1 gbp per sample with paired end reads of 300 300 bp quality controls were performed using dna analysis d1000 screentape assays on a 2200 tapestation instrument agilenttechnologies usa gdna concentrations were accurately measured using quant it dsdna assay kits thermofischer scientific usa on an infinite m1000 pro plate reader tecan switzerland the metagenomics sequencing raw datasets were processed using the clc genomics workbench qiagen bioinformatics denmark the resulting de novo assembly and coverage files of the metagenomes of the ebpr sludge and background community treatment were loaded into mmgenome karst et al 2016 in r for dual coverage binning of the near complete genome of the ca accumulibacter and flanking lineages present in the bioreactor following the method initially developed by albertsen et al 2013 the single lineage genome assemblies were uploaded into a kbase narrative arkin et al 2016 for phylogenetic classification and functional gene annotation using the rast toolkit brettin et al 2015 after quality control using checkm parks et al 2015 blastn arb silva rnammer trnascan se and quast the obtained assembly of the near complete genome of the ca accumulibacter population selected in the system was taxonomically classified at high resolution against the 28 draft genome assemblies available for this lineage in on line databases such as nih genbank benson et al 2005 ncbi refseq o leary et al 2016 and jgi img chen et al 2017 and imported manually in kbase reference genome assemblies that were deprived of gene and protein annotations of coding sequences were annotated in kbase prior to phylogenetic tree reconstruction the genome centric phylogenetic tree was computed in kbase from reference alignments based on 49 highly conserved clusters of orthologous groups of proteins and using the fasttree2 approximate maximum likelihood method the fastani algorithm was used to discriminate between unique genomes 95 new population or to highlight overlapping genomes 99 by fast computation of pairwise average nucleotide identity fastani values the genome based phylogenetic tree was cross validated with the ppk1 gene based taxonomic classification across the ca accumulibacter lineage the ppk1 gene sequence was retrieved from the genome assembly and matched against sequences of ppk1 gene pcr amplicons obtained from the ebpr biomass based on the uniqueness of the near complete genomes obtained we here proposed the provisional novel species names ca accumulibacter delftensis sp nov ca nocardioides delftensis sp nov and ca thermomonas delftensis sp nov since no isolate and pure culture is available for these organisms the provisional names were proposed according to recommendations of murray and stackebrandt and principles of the international code of nomenclature of prokaryotes a digital protologue table was developed for the description of the provisional taxa following identical procedure adopted lately by andersen et al the genome assemblies and annotations are deposited in kbase and will be made publicly available in genbank european nucleotide archive in progress output milestones of the genome centric metagenomics analysis are available in supporting information 2 9 stoichiometric and kinetic parameters of interest the ratio of phosphorus released to vfa uptake p vfa under anaerobic conditions was calculated based on the observed net phosphorus released at the end of the anaerobic period per vfa consumed the phosphorus content in the biomass was calculated based on a mass balance performed using data from the pseudo steady state conditions as described by kuba et al 1993 the anaerobic metabolic activity of the sludge was characterized using the following anaerobic biomass specific rates of interest i q p o 4 a n m a x maximum observed anaerobic phosphorus release rate in mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 ii m p o 4 a n anaerobic endogenous phosphorus release rate observed once vfa were taken up in mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 iii q p o 4 v f a anaerobic phosphorus release rate due to vfa uptake calculated according to 1 q p o 4 v f a q p o 4 a n m a x m p o 4 a n iv q v f a m a x maximum observed anaerobic vfa uptake rate observed in mg cod g 1 vss h 1 oxygen uptake rate our profiles were determined based on do consumption over time in order to measure the do consumption during the oxic stages the ebpr sludge was recirculated from the parent reactor through a separate 10 ml biological oxygen monitor bom unit for 2 3 min once the do measurements were stable the sludge recirculation was stopped and the do concentration profiles were recorded the do concentrations were kept above a set point of 2 mg o2 l 1 by periodically re starting the sludge recirculation this procedure was repeated along the oxic phases the bom unit was equipped with a wtw oxi 340i do probe germany the anoxic and aerobic biomass specific rates of interest were i q n o 3 a x nitrate uptake rate in mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 ii q p o 4 a x anoxic phosphorus uptake rate in mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 iii q p o 4 o x aerobic phosphorus uptake rate in mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 all rates were calculated by linear regression based on the observed profiles as described in smolders et al 1995 3 results 3 1 operation of the reactor under anaerobic oxic a o conditions the ebpr reactor was operated for more than a year under a o conditions showing a pseudo steady state performance fig 1 a all vfas were anaerobically consumed during the first 15 min of reaction at a maximum biomass specific rate of 269 mg cod g 1 vss h 1 q v f a m a x with a phosphorus release of 199 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 q p o 4 a n m a x once all vfa were taken up a residual p release rate of 2 5 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 m p o 4 a n was observed and assumed to correspond to the anaerobic endogenous p release i e for cellular maintenance under the presence of oxygen phosphorus was taken up at a rate of 58 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 q p o 4 o x the observed ratio of phosphorus taken up per total oxygen consumed was 1 63 mg p mg 1 o2 equivalent to 0 42 mol p mol 1 e transferred during respiration 3 2 long term operation under anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o conditions as observed in fig 1 b g in the anaerobic stage of the a2o system all vfas were taken up and phosphorus was released at a maximum anaerobic rate q p o 4 a n m a x of between 164 and 254 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 once the vfas were consumed the phosphorus released due to maintenance activities m p o 4 a n was considerably higher in the experimental periods b c and e 12 0 0 8 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 than in d f and g 1 9 1 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 the p vfa ratios were rather stable in the experimental periods b c d and e 0 66 0 06 mg po4 p mg 1 cod and higher than in f and g 0 50 0 06 mg po4 p mg 1 cod under anoxic conditions accumulation of nitrite was never detected in none of the experiments fig 1b g a slightly higher denitrification activity of 3 9 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed in the first experimental period b after switching to the a2o conditions in the rest of the experimental periods the denitrification rates did not increase considerably and remained around 2 2 0 5 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 table 2 shows the a2o rates and stoichiometry parameters calculated in each experimental period compared to the aerobic p uptake rates of up to 79 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 a relatively low anoxic p uptake rate q p o 4 a x was observed in periods b c and f 5 0 0 3 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 which even decreased to 3 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 in period g and became negligible in period d as much the relative anoxic phosphorus uptake rates reached 13 of the aerobic phosphorus uptake rates table 2 in all cases phosphorus was fully removed during the oxic phase fig 1 3 3 minimal aerobic srt in the experimental phase h as an attempt to favor the growth of a dpao capable of using nitrate over strict aerobic paos the oxic srt was reduced below the minimum required for aerobic paos to grow as described by brdjanovic et al 1998 after two days of operation with an oxic srt of approximately 0 4 d the vfas started to leak into the anoxic phase 74 mg cod l 1 at day 2 of operation likewise the anaerobic phosphorus release decreased from 117 mg po4 p l 1 to 32 mg po4 p l 1 on the 3rd day of operation the nitrate dose was increased daily to prevent nitrate limitation while avoiding to exceed a concentration of more than 3 mg no3 n l 1 in the oxic phase which may leak into the anaerobic stage despite these measures no dpao activity was observed and no phosphorus was removed in neither the anoxic nor the oxic phases thus up to 27 mg po4 p l 1 were observed at the end of the oxic phase day 2 of operation 3 4 assessment of the effects of the f m ratio on the anoxic phosphorus uptake activity in the batch activity test 1d conducted ex situ with half of the f m ratio applied to the parent reactor the acetate uptake rate q p o 4 v f a and the maximum phosphorus release rate q p o 4 a n m a x were 75 2 mg cod g 1 vss h 1 and 72 2 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 respectively these rates were considerably slower than the ones observed in the batch test 2d executed with twice the f m ratio fed to the parent reactor 265 mg cod g 1 vss h 1 and 235 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 respectively despite these differences the observed p vfa ratios were not considerably different between the two batch tests 0 60 and 0 66 at the batch tests 1d and 2d respectively the anoxic phosphorus uptake and denitrification rates were rather different in the two batch tests fig 2 in the 1d batch test a nitrate reduction rate of 0 8 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed while phosphorus was released at a rate of 2 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 fig 2a on the contrary in the 2d batch test a faster nitrate reduction rate of 1 95 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed together with a marginal phosphorus uptake rate of 0 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 3 5 identification of predominant bacterial populations along the experimental periods fish analyses were performed to identify the predominant microorganisms present in the systems and potentially involved in ebpr over the different experimental periods fig 3 shows a representative image of the microbial composition at the start and end of this research experimental periods a and g respectively the relative abundance of paos related to the genus ca accumulibacter paomix probe set compared to all organisms stained with dapi decreased from 98 95 76 52 along the experimental periods a b d and g respectively despite these differences the fraction of the ca accumulibacter clade i acc 1 444 probe within paos did not change along the experiments 97 4 fig 3 across experimental periods gaos were never abundant the genera ca competibacter and defluviicoccus composed less than 5 of the total microbial populations according to both fish fig 3 and v3 v4 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing table 3 the amplicon sequencing profiles displayed a decrease in the relative abundance of the genus ca accumulibacter from 53 to 33 from experimental periods a to g respectively table 3 finer scale characterization of the ca accumulibacter clades based on pcr and sequencing analyses of the ppk1 gene showed that the system was mainly composed of members of the clade pao ic at the start and end of the experiments fig 4 3 6 near complete genomes of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic and two flanking populations were retrieved from the metagenome of the ebpr biomass and enabled genome centric analysis three near complete genomes were retrieved by differential coverage binning fig 5 a for sub lineages of the main

that the class of betaproteobacteria has recently been reclassified as order betaproteobacteriales in the class of gammaproteobacteria detailed features of the genome bins are provided in fig s1 and table s1 of the supplementary information the genome assemblies were submitted to genbank european nucleotide archive in progress phylogenetic classification of the high quality genome assemblies against reference genomes of these lineages available in on line databases allowed to delineate key populations involved in the biosystem from alignments based on 49 highly conserved clusters of orthologous groups of proteins a new population of the here proposed ca accumulibacter delftensis sp nov clade ic was identified by fine scale differentiation out of the about 30 draft genomes of ca accumulibacter publicly available the recently characterized ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic was the closest neighbor but formed a different phylotype inside clade ic fig 5b computation of pairwise average nucleotide identity ani scores stated the uniqueness of the candidate species ca accumulibacter delftensis pairwise ani 95 the two main accompanying populations of the here proposed ca nocardioides delftensis sp nov and ca thermomonas delftensis sp nov affiliated with closest neighbours of nocardioides jensenii and thermomonas fusca respectively but also formed new candidate species according to pairwise ani scores 95 extraction of the full length 16s rrna genes table s4 from the three genomic datasets and mapping against ncbi and arb silva databases provided additional verification the digital protologue table 5 provides the main characteristics of the near complete genomes of these proposed yet not isolated new candidate species the ani analysis further highlighted that several genome assemblies that have been previously deposited in databases under different reference numbers for the ca accumulibacter lineage are overlapping pairwise ani 99 this has notably arisen from re use of deposited sequencing datasets in bioinformatics studies the pangenome of ani filtered unique single lineage genomes of ca accumulibacter populations displayed diverse non core genetic features in the assemblies fig s2 3 7 matching of genome based and ppk1 based phylogenetic characterizations the phylogenetic output of the high resolution analysis conducted on the near

accumulibacter delftensis clade ic table s5 displayed a perfect match to the sequence of the ppk1 gene amplified from the dpao biomass in the functional gene based phylogenetic tree its ppk1 nucleotide composition was closely related to reference sequences of clade ic it formed a separate population than ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic after comparison with the ppk1 sequence retrieved from the deposited assembly of the latter lineage thereafter the genome based and ppk1 based classification approaches matched resulting in phylogenetic trees of analogous structures and robust molecular differentiation of the lineages 3 8 genome centric investigation of denitrification marker genes of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic ca nocardioides delftensis and ca thermomonas delftensis the underlying coding sequences of the 3 retrieved near complete genomes of ca accumulibacter delftensis ca nocardioides delftensis and ca thermomonas delftensis were annotated and assigned to 30 functional gene categories table s2 including the nitrogen metabolism table 4 and table s3 functional gene annotations of the genome assemblies highlighted a putative complementary interaction between these populations along the nitrogen cycle table 4 and table s3 in supplementary information the ca accumulibacter delftensis genome assembly comprised genes coding for nitrate nitrite transporter assimilatory nitrate reductase nas gene periplasmic nitrate reductase precursor and periplasmic nitrate reductases nap but no genes coding for respiratory nitrate reductases nar it further harbored a whole set of nitrite nir nitric oxide nor and nitrous oxide nos reductases the ca nocardioides delftensis genome assembly contained assimilatory nitrate reductase nitrate nitrite transporter nitrite reductase nad p h large subunit and respiratory nitrate reductases but no further denitrification genes interestingly the ca thermomonas delftensis genome assembly mainly harbored respiratory nitrate reductases alpha beta delta and gamma chains and some denitrification gene homologues nir nor 4 discussion 4 1 effect of different operating conditions on anoxic phosphorus uptake activity the anoxic phosphorus uptake rates observed in the experimental periods conducted under different operating conditions were considerably lower than the oxic p uptake rates table 2 the anoxic p uptake rate reached at most 13 of the oxic p uptake rate thus even though there could be some denitrification associated with an anoxic p uptake this seems not be significant when compared with the oxic p uptake this is in agreement with the study of lanham et al 2011 who observed a faster oxic than anoxic p uptake rate in an a2o reactor alternatively kuba et al 1993 and lee and yun 2014 reported that nitrate could be used as electron acceptor as efficient as oxygen by pao for p uptake however kuba et al 1993 and lee and yun 2014 have applied an a2 configuration in contrast to this study where an a2o configuration was used this suggests that the oxic phase in each cycle may have hampered the selection for a pao and or a microbial population which could enhance the use nitrate as efficient as oxygen for p uptake the aim of this study was to evaluate whether various operational conditions could enhance the denitrification capacities of a ca accumulibacter clade i culture operational changes were applied for a relatively short time allowing for the enzymatic induction but minimizing any shifts in the microbial community composition as the anoxic growth yield can be up to 70 of the aerobic growth yield kuba et al 1993 the srt was extended from 8 to 15 d in the experimental period d as suggested by ahn et al 2002 however this exerted an adverse effect by decreasing the anoxic activity from 3 9 to 2 5 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 experimental phase b and d respectively in contrast to the studies of kuba et al 1993 and ahn et al 2002 a clear anoxic p uptake was never observed it may be concluded that either the denitrification activity observed in this study was not carried out by the ca accumulibacter population selected in this system or the culture was not capable to restore its poly p storage pools under the applied conditions further activity tests with the biomass of experimental period d showed that under a low f m ratio phosphate was surprisingly released under anoxic conditions at a rate of 2 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 despite that nitrate was present in the activity test fig 2a the release of phosphate strongly suggests that the ca accumulibacter affiliate of clade ic obtained in this enrichment culture could not use nitrate as electron acceptor to generate enough energy from its putative reduction thus as suggested by rubio rincón et al 2017a and ribera guardia et al 2016 this pao may prefer to use nitrite generated by side populations among them possibly gaos via the reduction of nitrate to nitrite as electron acceptor for the oxidation of pha the nitrite produced by side populations would be lower according to a decrease in the organic load per biomass f m resulting in energy limitation by the oxidation of pha by paos and a subsequent anoxic p release as observed in fig 2a to further assess if a side population was responsible for the denitrification observed in the system the p cod ratio in the influent was decreased with the aim to increase the gao fraction from experimental period f onwards the population of ca accumulibacter clade ic remained the main pao detected approx 97 4 but decreased from 98 to 52 from experimental periods a to g fig 3 similar to the study of carvalho et al 2007 however gaos did not proliferate as expected up to 1 in the experimental period g fig 3 likely the relatively high ph of 7 6 limited the proliferation of gaos smolders et al 1995 at the same time after the switch from a o to a2o conditions an increase in the fraction of potentially denitrifying thermomonas and chryseobacterium genera was observed 13 and 8 respectively in experimental period g table 3 despite that thermomonas and chryseobacterium are capable to reduce both nitrate and nitrite mergaert et al 2003 kundu et al 2014 the biomass specific denitrification activity did not increase together with their enrichment 2 1 and 1 8 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 in experimental periods f and g respectively the non pao based denitrification activity measured in the system remained uncertain additional analyses of mrna based functional gene expression or protein translation within the nitrogen cycle either via reverse transcription and qpcr or higher throughput molecular analyses like metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics respectively would have helped to identify the biochemical pathways activated together with the bacterial populations involved the role of the side populations within the microbial community e g thermomonas flavobacterium chryseobacterium terrimonas nocardioides remains also unclear under the operating conditions applied here they did not significantly contribute to the denitrification activity this suggests that other factors or microorganisms interact and can e g gaos were suggested by rubio rincón et al 2017a enhance the anoxic p uptake activity over nitrite in ebpr cultures kuba et al 1993 enriched a dpao culture under a2 conditions dosing nitrate continuously during the anoxic stage this dosing mode could benefit k strategist dpaos therefore in period g nitrate was dosed continuously during the anoxic phase as described earlier certain increase in the anoxic p uptake per electron available was observed from 0 13 to 0 24 mol p mol 1 e between periods f and g respectively the anoxic range from 0 13 to 0 24 mol p mol 1 e ratio observed along this study was comparable to the one of 0 19 mol p mol 1 e reported by kuba et al 1993 however the anoxic p uptake rate was slower than the reported by kuba et al 1993 up to 5 4 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 compared to 30 46 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 respectively this indicated that the dosing mode did not play a role to enhance the anoxic phosphorus uptake activity of the sludge as an attempt to favor the growth of dpaos over strict aerobic paos the operational conditions were gradually modified from anaerobic anoxic oxic to anaerobic anoxic experimental periods g and h however once the aerobic srt was reduced below the minimal required acetate started to leak into the anoxic phase after just 2 days of operation despite that nitrate was not limiting likely phas were not completely oxidized during the anoxic and oxic phases thus paos could not take up sufficient phosphorus or produce enough glycogen for anaerobic vfa uptake this is in agreement with lanham et al 2011 who concluded that an oxic phase was essential to maintain a good removal of phosphorus where most of the phosphorus uptake occurred therefore it is suggested that the culture of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic enriched in this study cannot solely rely on the use of nitrate for energy generation for metabolic processes e g via pha oxidation recently in contrast with these findings and those of saad et al 2016 where no significant anoxic phosphorus uptake was observed camejo et al 2016 reported the anoxic p uptake activity on nitrate 11 1 7 mgpo4 p g 1 vss h 1 of a ca accumulibacter clade ic culture however functional diversity in sub lineages can happen making that the ppk analysis cannot be used to anticipate denitrification capabilities hence as discussed in the following sections the correlative trends between ppk1 based taxonomic classification and denitrification activities monitored in ebpr systems is no longer valid the sole detection of microbial clades is not sufficient to explain biochemical conversions the genome centric metagenomics analysis of the near complete genomes of the ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic and ca thermomonas delftensis lineages of the ebpr biomass subjected to a o and a2o conditions interestingly highlighted a putative interaction potential between the two populations from nitrate reduction to nitrite by thermomonas harbors genes coding for respiratory nitrate reductases nar but genes for nitrite reduction were not found in the assembly prior to respiration of nitrite by ca accumulibacter along with p removal the ca nocardioides delftensis lineage harbored functional genes for both nitrate and nitrite respiration the involvement of this population that can display filamentous phenotypes is supposed to primarily occur under disturbed conditions like those where vfa leak into the anoxic stage these functional potentials underlie hypothetical interactions between ca accumulibacter and these accompanying populations in the nitrogen cycle within the ecosystem of lab scale denitrifying ebpr biomass however the previously proposed reduction mechanism from nitrate to nitrite performed by thermomonas and or nocardioides might be conducted by other organisms in full scale wastewater treatment plants further research and analytical methods are needed to elucidate microbial interactions between ca accumulibacter and other genera e g ca competibacter thermomonas nocardioides ca microthrix on the nitrogen cycle 4 2 possible metabolic pathway for nitrate reduction observed in this study only a marginal nitrate consumption of up to 3 9 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed in the enriched ca accumulibacter ic culture experimental period b alternatively to the role of side populations the consumption of nitrate can be associated to growth nitrate assimilation nas generation of metabolic energy nitrate respiration nar and or dissipation of the excess of reducing power nitrate dissimilation nap moreno vivián et al 1999 according to previous studies skennerton et al 2014 different clades of ca accumulibacter contain either the nitrate respiration gene nar clade iic or the periplasmatic nitrate dissimilation gene nap clades ic ia iia iif only the nap gene has been previously identified in the metagenomes of enriched ebpr cultures composed of the clades ia and ic flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 consistently in the present study the genome assembly of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic harbored nas and nap genes but not the nar gene table 4 which could explain the low anoxic p uptake activity measured in the bioreactor camejo et al 2016 have suggested that an enriched clade ic population of ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic contained all the enzymes necessary to perform a full denitrification which has been confirmed by their subsequent integrated omic analysis camejo et al 2018 however the actual operating conditions required to enhance the presence and activation of the required enzymes remain unclear from the nitrogen cycle perspective the two most characterized populations of this interesting clade ic namely ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic and ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic display fine scale differentiation in genes coding for nitrate reduction antagonist presence absence of nap and nar genes ihe1 primarily harbors periplasmic nap and lacks respiratory nar nitrate reductases which is exactly the opposite by uw ldo ic as described by moreno vivián et al 1999 the nap enzyme is not involved in the anaerobic respiration as the enzyme is independent of the energy conserving cytochrome bc1 complex instead the electron required for the reduction of nitrate could be obtained via nadh which passes through proton translocating nadh dehydrogenases bedzyk et al 1999 interestingly the subunit napd which seems to be an important precursor of the subunit napa moreno vivián et al 1999 was not detected in the genome assembly of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic table s3 in supporting information this is notable since napa that is responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite can likely not be promoted in absence of napd thus based on such genetic impotent it is unlikely that the pao population in our system was capable to utilize nitrate moreover the existence and activation of the nar enzyme appears to be required for a considerable anoxic phosphorus uptake using nitrate by ca accumulibacter the absence of nar gene in the genome assembly underlines that this functionality cannot be achieved by the selected ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic regarding the current molecular techniques applied based on fine scale genetic analyses of the ppk1 gene it is possible to differentiate among the ca accumulibacter lineages mcmahon et al 2007 despite the general correlative assumptions that these clades seem to have the same encoding for denitrification they exhibit different anoxic p uptake capabilities on nitrate e g anoxic activities of clades ic and iia garcía martín et al 2006 flowers et al 2008 2013 oehmen et al 2010b 2010c skennerton et al 2014 camejo et al 2016 2018 ribera guardia et al 2016 and this study in view of these observations the traditionally accepted engineering classification of the denitrifying populations of ca accumulibacter grouped based on the ppk gene as either clade i with full denitrification capacity from nitrate onwards or clade ii from nitrite onwards as modeled by oehmen et al 2010c does not seem to be valid and supported as a stand alone approach further studies should include detection and expression of the key denitrifying genes e g nar or proteins e g nar in addition to the clade differentiation using the ppk marker gene it should be thoroughly investigated how different operating conditions can enhance the selection of dpaos the activation of their genetic signatures and their catabolic regulation depending on terminal electron acceptors available the influence of environmental and operational conditions on the gene regulation skennerton et al 2014 and their interaction with the different metabolic pathways and energy consumption deserve special attention definitely microbial ecology have suggested that many functional traits are not necessarily conserved between lineages martiny et al 2015 ancestral genome reconstructions have shown that denitrification genes are part of the flexible genome and that numerous other important genes of ebpr metabolisms have been acquired by horizontal transfer oyserman et al 2016 hence the incongruency between studies on denitrification traits of ca accumulibacter clades does reflect the true intra clade diversity which requires thorough investigation within the ca accumulibacter lineage this statement can be broadened over the complexity of clades of heterotrophic denitrifiers whose genetic pools may result from a rather random acquisition process certainly the concepts and justification of clades need strong reappraisal across microbial tree of life parks et al 2017 toward a more accurate representation of actual metabolisms together with consideration of horizontal transfer of catabolic genes in activated sludge microbiomes 4 3 possible sources of carbon for denitrification by side populations if ultimately the selected dpaos are not able to denitrify from nitrate at relevant and applicable rates it remains possible that the denitrification observed in ebpr systems is carried out partially from nitrate to nitrite by other microbial populations however such potential heterotrophic denitrifiers should be provided with electron donors this adds up to the former questions regarding the factors e g organic substrate availability and substrate storage under anaerobic conditions and underlying the presence of a diversity of potential denitrifiers in the bacterial community of ebpr processes weissbrodt et al 2014 previous research on ebpr have reported the leakage of certain residual concentrations of non vfa organic compounds as a function of the hrt ichihashi et al 2006 the residual organic compounds present in the anoxic stage could be potentially used by ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos as carbon source for denitrification purposes kuba et al 1993 have observed around 5 mg toc l 1 leaking into an anoxic phase which have led to up to 3 8 mg no3 n l 1 reduction if nitrate was reduced to nitrite moreover nitrate from anoxic zones can also intrude into anaerobic stages via internal recirculation flowrates or due to the residual concentrations of these components observed in the end of the alternating aerobic or anoxic phases independently of the experimental periods thus ohos could grow in the system on the vfas fed and nitrate available contributing to the direct denitrification from nitrate to nitrite and even in the subsequent anoxic phase triggered by the endogenous processes in some cases the presence of nitrate in anaerobic stages have nevertheless been reported to favor the growth of dpaos in ebpr systems ahn et al 2001b another possibility is the potential presence of other microorganisms capable to store vfas under anaerobic conditions and then to oxidize them using nitrate tu and schuler 2013 proposed that under carbon limiting conditions paos would outcompete other pha accumulating organisms such as gaos this could be the case in the activity test 1 d performed here with half the organic loading per biomass fig 2a where a denitrification rate of 0 8 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed together with an anoxic p release rate of 2 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 on the contrary in the activity test 2d conducted with double the organic loading per biomass a denitrification rate of 1 95 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 with an anoxic phosphorus uptake rate of 0 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 were observed thus it is suggested that the anoxic p uptake observed in this study was carried out over the nitrite generated by other pha accumulating organisms that might have benefitted from the relatively higher availability of electron donors ekama and wentzel 1999 pointed out that alternating anoxic oxic conditions stimulated the presence of filamentous bacteria the appearance of filamentous bacteria has also been reported in the studies of kerrn jespersen and henze 1993 and comprised up to 10 of the biomass in the studies of lanham et al 2011 early studies of kuba et al 1993 also reported considerable amounts of sludge washed out through the effluent due to settling problems suggesting the presence of filamentous bacteria these filamentous bacteria as the frequently observed thiothrix type 021n or and ca microthrix in wastewater treatment plants can reduce nitrate into nitrite williams and unz 1985 nielsen et al 2000 hesselsoe et al 2005 mcilroy et al 2013 and have also been identified as one of the most abundant side populations present in ebpr lab systems garcia martin et al 2006 interestingly recently some of these e g thiothrix have been reported to also contribute to ebpr rubio rincón et al 2017b further characterization of the metabolisms of the side populations is needed to elucidate their potential involvement in the anoxic p uptake activities of ebpr cultures 5 conclusions the ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic culture enriched and genetically characterized in this study did not exhibit a considerable anoxic p uptake on nitrate it was as high as 13 of the phosphorus uptake observed under aerobic conditions a decrease in the organic load fed per biomass resulted in the anoxic release of phosphorus indicating that this specific population of the clade ic was unable to use nitrate as electron acceptor eventually the system collapsed when the aerobic srt decreased below the minimum required reinforcing the idea that our clade ic cannot rely solely on the use of nitrate as terminal electron acceptor the putative complementary interaction potential between side populations of the genera thermomonas and nocardioides nitrate respiration and the ca accumulibacter population nitrite respiration was highlighted from single lineage genome assemblies extracted from the biomass subjected to a o and a2o conditions we further showed that genome based and ppk1 gene based phylogenies were congruent for the classification of known populations within the ca accumulibacter lineage with genome centric metagenomics approach providing definite advantage to capture functional potential of the phylotypes next research should target functional expression and ecophysiological analyses to validate actual biochemical pathways involved by targeted populations together with microbial interactions in denitrifying ebpr systems we here stressed that correlating denitrifying activities to ca accumulibacter clade differentiation by ppk gene is not valid deep reconsideration of the true intra clade diversity in functional traits that results from evolutionary and horizontal gene transfer processes is paramount

18685,populations of candidatus accumulibacter a known polyphosphate accumulating organism within clade ic have been proposed to perform anoxic p uptake activity in enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr systems using nitrate as electron acceptor however no consensus has been reached on the ability of ca accumulibacter members of clade ic to reduce nitrate to nitrite discrepancies might relate to the diverse operational conditions which could trigger the expression of the nap and or nar enzyme and or to the accuracy in clade classification this study aimed to assess whether and how certain operational conditions could lead to the enrichment and enhance the denitrification capacity of ca accumulibacter within clade ic to study the potential induction of the denitrifying enzyme an ebpr culture was enriched under anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o conditions that based on fluorescence in situ hybridization and ppk gene sequencing was composed of around 97 on a biovolume basis of affiliates of ca accumulibacter clade ic the influence of the medium composition sludge retention time srt polyphosphate content of the biomass poly p nitrate dosing approach and minimal aerobic srt on potential nitrate reduction were studied despite the different studied conditions applied only a negligible anoxic p uptake rate was observed equivalent to maximum 13 of the aerobic p uptake rate an increase in the anoxic srt at the expenses of the aerobic srt resulted in deterioration of p removal with limited aerobic p uptake and insufficient acetate uptake in the anaerobic phase a near complete genome completeness 100 contamination 0 187 was extracted from the metagenome of the ebpr biomass for the here proposed ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic according to full genome based phylogenetic analysis this lineage was distant from the canonical ca accumulibacter phosphatis with closest neighbor ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic within clade ic this was cross validated with taxonomic classification of the ppk1 gene sequences the genome centric metagenomic analysis highlighted the presence of genes for assimilatory nitrate reductase nas and periplasmic nitrate reductase nap but no gene for respiratory nitrate reductases nar this suggests that ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic was not capable to generate the required energy atp from nitrate under strict anaerobic anoxic conditions to support an anoxic ebpr metabolism definitely this study stresses the incongruence in denitrification abilities of ca accumulibacter clades and reflects the true intra clade

this pao stores carbon e g acetate propionate as poly β hydroxyalkanoates phas at the expense of polyphosphate poly p hydrolysis and glycogen degradation thereafter when an electron acceptor is available such as dissolved oxygen under aerobic conditions and nitrite and presumably nitrate under anoxic conditions the organism consumes the stored pha to replenish its poly p and glycogen storage pools for biomass synthesis and cellular maintenance comeau et al 1986 wentzel et al 1986 smolders et al 1994a 1994b kuba et al 1996b previous studies have suggested that members of the pao guild have different affinities and potentials to use nitrate or nitrite as electron acceptors for anoxic p uptake kerrn jespersen and henze 1993 kuba et al 1993 1996a 1997 ahn et al 2001a 2001b kerrn jespersen and henze 1993 have postulated the existence of two types of paos one denitrifying pao type able to use nitrate and oxygen as electron acceptors herein identified as or dpao and another pao type capable of using only oxygen through the long term operation of two sequencing batch reactors sbrs operated under anaerobic anoxic a2 and anaerobic oxic conditions a o kuba et al 1993 have observed that dpao could exhibit an anoxic ebpr activity similar to that of pao on oxygen carvalho et al 2007 observed that rod shaped paos exhibited satisfactory anoxic p removal on nitrate while coccus shaped pao showed poor anoxic ebpr activity later on based on fine scale differences in the genetic sequences of the ppk1 gene peterson et al 2008 identified the existence of two ca accumulibacter clades i and ii with several subclades ia id and iia iig oligonucleotide probes and primers set were designed on this molecular basis for rapid detection by fluorescence in situ hybridization fish and polymerase chain reaction pcr based on these findings and correlations with process performances oehmen et al 2010a b re assessed the different pao phenotypes observed by carvalho et al 2007 and suggested that clade i was responsible for the anoxic p uptake activity observed in ebpr systems in agreement flowers et al 2009 observed that a culture enriched in clade i ca 70 11 based on fish bio volume was able to denitrify without requiring any acclimatization step while a culture dominated by clade ii approx 55 7 clade ii and 32 0 5 clade i per bio volume could not nevertheless after a 24 h acclimatization period to the presence of nitrate both ebpr systems performed a simultaneous denitrification and p uptake activity the anoxic p uptake activity observed in the latter clade ii culture was associated to the presence of the clade i fraction in the system flowers et al 2009 lanham et al 2011 enriched a clade i culture approx 90 bio volume under anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o conditions their enrichment was capable to take up about 12 mg po4 p g 1vss h 1 using nitrate as electron acceptor contrary to the strict a2 operating conditions of kuba et al 1993 the authors reported that maintaining an oxic stage seemed to have been a key condition to secure the reactor stability and obtain a highly enriched clade i culture on the other hand through the execution of short term studies saad et al 2016 and rubio rincón et al 2017a reported that clade i further identified via ppk gene sequence analysis as populations of ca accumulibacter clade ic was unable to use nitrate as electron acceptor as efficient as oxygen or nitrite they suggested that when anoxic p uptake takes place the underlying members of clade ic may use the nitrite generated from the reduction of nitrate by side populations within the microbial community possibly glycogen accumulating organisms gaos or ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos nevertheless both studies were based on the conduction of short term hours batch activity tests with a culture of clade ic affiliates enriched under a o conditions in contrast recent studies performed by camejo et al 2016 have suggested that some populations of clade ic can efficiently use nitrate as electron acceptor for the oxidation of pha and p uptake from a molecular and microbial perspective early genome centric metagenome analyses of populations of ca accumulibacter clades ia and ic have not been able to detect the respiratory nitrate reductase gene nar required for nitrate respiration flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 similar to clade iia and iif recently camejo et al 2018 have identified one ca accumulibacter population of clade ic harbouring a nar gene the denitrification pathway of the aforementioned clades only includes the presence of the periplasmic nitrate reductase gene nap and the required genes to denitrify from nitrite onwards garcía martín et al 2006 flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 according to moreno vivián et al 1999 the main difference among these genes is the potential of their expressed enzyme nap nar to generate energy as atp while both enzymes can reduce nitrate to nitrite only the nar enzyme has been correlated with enough generation of energy as atp to sustain bacterial growth and other microbial processes moreno vivián et al 1999 as such and in view of the contradictory findings previously described the gene expression mechanisms could be responsible for the different anoxic p uptake activities of clade ic phylotypes in ebpr systems reported in literature as first suggested by skennerton et al 2014 it remains unclear which fraction of ca accumulibacter clade ic species harbor the nap or nar genes and if these genes are present in their genome which operational factors could induce their enzymatic expression we aimed to assess the influence of different operating conditions on a clade ic enriched culture rubio rincón et al 2017a the main factors studied were i a high p cod ratio 0 06 g p g 1 cod ii a long sludge retention time srt of 15 d iii a low p cod ratio of 0 03 g p g 1 cod iv a short aerobic srt of 1 5 d and v pulse and continuous nitrate dosing modes combining mixed culture stoichiometry and kinetics investigation with molecular biology and genome centric metagenomics analysis of the here proposed ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic this study contributes to assess conditions that may stimulate and enhance the use of nitrate and elucidate their potential role in ebpr systems it further stresses the need to reappraise metabolic functionalities inside and across clades of the ca accumulibacter lineage and microbial lineages in general beyond correlations observed between relative abundances of clades and biochemical conversions monitored 2 materials and methods 2 1 reactor operation a culture of a ca accumulibacter clade ic population was enriched in a 3 l double jacket stirred tank reactor applikon delft the netherlands with a working volume of 2 5 l a volume of 500 ml of activated sludge from the ebpr wwtp nieuwe waterweg hoek van holland the netherlands was used as inoculum prior to the start of the study the reactor was operated under anaerobic oxic a o conditions for more than a year experimental period a rubio rincón et al 2017a thereafter the operational conditions were changed to anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o experimental period b table 1 once the system was operated under a2o in a pseudo steady state experimental period b the medium composition was changed from the one used by smolders et al 1994a b to the one used by kuba et al 1993 experimental period c with low and high potassium concentration respectively in order to give the opportunity to the assumed slow growing dpaos to proliferate the srt was extended from 8 to 15 d in the experimental period d due to the potential role of gaos in the denitrification activities observed in ebpr systems rubio rincón et al 2017a the feeding p cod ratio was decreased from 0 06 to 0 03 g p g 1 cod experimental period e and f respectively in the experimental period g to address if dpaos could be r or k strategists the nitrate dosing mode was changed from a pulse feeding carried out in 1 min to a longer feeding period of 30 min at a 1 ml min flowrate as studied by kuba et al 1993 tu and schuler 2013 keeping the same nitrate concentration dosed 10 mg no3 n l 1 finally to wash the aerobic paos out and select for dpaos the length of the aerobic phase was gradually decreased and consequently the aerobic srt was shortened from 2 2 days to 0 9 days in experimental period g and further to 0 4 days in experimental period h which is lower than the minimum aerobic srt estimated by brdjanovic et al 1998 of about 1 25 d for a o enriched pao the hydraulic retention time hrt was 12 h the ph was controlled at 7 6 0 1 with the addition of 0 4 mol l 1 naoh and 0 1 mol l 1 hcl temperature was controlled at 20 1 c in order to create and maintain the anaerobic conditions dinitrogen gas was sparged at the bottom of the reactor during the first 30 min of the anaerobic phase and a water lock was installed at the off gas outlet nitrate was fed either as pulse or continuously for 30 min in accordance to the corresponding experimental period from a bottle containing a 1 g no3 n l 1 stock solution the dissolved oxygen do concentration was controlled at 20 of the saturation level by sparging on off compressed air and dinitrogen gas both gases were controlled at 10 l h 1 do and ph levels were monitored continuously ortho phosphate po4 p mixed liquor suspended solids mlss and mixed liquor volatile suspended solids mlvss concentrations were measured twice per week when no significant changes in these parameters were observed for more than 3 srts it was assumed that the system had reached pseudo steady state conditions 2 2 nitrate based dpao batch activity tests in order to assess if the biomass specific organic load food to microorganisms f m ratio affecting the anaerobic pha storage and therefore the intracellular carbon availability and its potential impact on the anoxic phosphorus uptake two batch tests were carried out ex situ with half batch 1d and twice batch 2d the f m ratio 37 and 148 mg cod g 1 vss respectively applied in the regular operation of the parent reactor the medium composition was the same like in the operation of the parent reactor each batch test was performed with 200 ml of mlss collected and transferred during experimental period d table 1 in a double jacketed reactor operated at 20 c with a 400 ml working volume the cycle of the batch tests was composed of 1 h of anaerobic and 4 h of anoxic phases in each batch test nitrate was fed as a pulse reaching a concentration of around 45 mg no3 n l 1 dinitrogen gas was continuously sparged at the bottom of the reactor at 10 l h 1 in order to maintain the anaerobic conditions ph was kept at 7 6 0 1 with the automatic addition of 0 4 mol l 1 hcl and 0 4 mol l 1 naoh 2 3 cultivation medium the cultivation medium were prepared in two separate bottles of 10 l carbon and mineral solutions and concentrated 10 times the influent medium fed contained per liter 400 mg cod composed by acetate and propionate supplied in a 3 1 cod ratio 4 mg ca 36 mg so4 2 9 mg mg2 1 mg yeast extract 20 mg n allylthiourea atu and 300 μl of trace element solution prepared according to smolders et al 1994a b in addition the influent medium for i the experimental periods a and b contained per liter 36 mg nh4 n 25 mg po4 p 19 mg k and 18 mg na ii for periods c d and e the medium composition was change to increase the concentration of potassium as reported by kuba et al 1993 to 83 mg nh4 n 25 mg po4 p 50 mg k and 0 mg na and iii for f g and h 83 mg nh4 n 15 mg po4 p 38 mg k and 0 mg na per liter 2 4 chemical analyses ortho phosphate po4 p nitrite no2 n mlss and mlvss were analytically determined as described in apha 2005 nitrate no3 n was measured according to iso 7890 1 1986 acetate and propionate were measured using a varian 430 gc gas chromatograph gc equipped with a split injector 200 c and a wcot fused silica column 105 c coupled to a fid detector 300 c helium was used as carrier gas and 50 μl of butyric acid as internal standard 2 5 characterization of microbial community compositions in order to estimate the relative abundance of the microbial communities along the different experimental periods fish analyses were performed as described by amann 1995 since propionivibrio was not observed with 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing and because the pao 651 fish probe suggested by albertsen et al 2016 has a coverage of 71 of the species from the genus ca accumulibacter the mix probe of pao 651 pao 462 and pao 846 suggested by crocetti et al 2000 was used to target the ca accumulibacter genus with a 89 coverage to differentiate among the different pao clades the probes acc 1 444 pao i and acc 2 444 pao ii were used flowers et al 2009 glycogen accumulating organisms gaos were identified with the gb probe according to kong et al 2002 defluvicoccus clades 1 and 2 were identified with tfo df215 tfo df618 df988 and df1020 probes wong et al 2004 meyer et al 2006 vectashield with dapi was used to avoid the fading of staining and stain all living organisms nielsen et al 2009 fish quantification of each probe was performed by image analysis of 25 random pictures taken with an olympus bx5i microscope and analyzed with the software cell dimensions 1 5 the standard error of the mean was calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the number of pictures 2 6 analyses of bacterial community compositions by v4 v6 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing genomic dna gdna was extracted using the ultraclean microbial dna extraction kit supplied by mobio laboratories inc ca usa according to the manufacturer s protocol except that the bead beating was substituted by a combination of 5 min heating at 65 c and 5 min beat beating to ensure maximum yields to check for quality and quantity the gdna extracts were loaded onto a 1 agarose gel in 1x tae running buffer analysis of the extracted gdna showed a large high molecular weight fraction and well visible dna yields in comparison to the smart ladder eurogentech nederland b v the extracted gdna was subsequently used for a two step pcr reaction targeting the 16s rrna gene of most bacteria and archaea using the primers u515f 5 gtgycagcmgccgcggta 3 and u1071r 5 garctgrcgrcrrccatgca 3 following wang and qian 2009 the first amplification step was performed to enrich for 16s rrna genes via quantitative pcr qpcr the qpcr reaction comprised 2x iq sybr green supermix bio rad ca usa 500 nmol l 1 primers each and 1 50 ng gdna template added per well final volume of 20 μl by adding miliq water the qpcr program went along a first denaturation at 95 c for 5 min followed by 20 cycles of denaturation at 95 c for 30 s annealing at 50 c for 40 s and elongation at 72 c for 40 s prior to final elongation at 72 c for 7 min during the second step 454 adapters roche and mid tags at the u515f primer were added to the products of step one this protocol was similar to the ones previously described but only taq pcr master mix qiagen inc ca usa was used the program was run for 15 cycles the template product from step one was used as template dna and diluted ten times after the second amplification 12 pcr products were pooled in equimolar ratio and purified over an agarose gel using a genejet gel extraction kit thermo fisher scientific the netherlands the resulting library was send for 454 sequencing and run in 1 8 lane with titanium chemistry by macrogen inc seoul korea after sequencing the reads library was imported into the clc genomics workbench v7 5 1 clc bio aarhus dk and quality limit 0 05 and max two ambiguities allowed trimmed to a minimum of 200 bp and average of 284 bp after trimming the datasets were de multiplexed resulting in 12 samples with an average of 7800 reads per sample a build it silva 123 1 ssuref nr99 taxonomic database was used for blastn analysis on the reads under default conditions to identify chimeric sequences we used the online tool decipher wright et al 2012 a very small portion of reads had a non significant match and were discarded the chimera check was done but eventually not implemented as they were in minor amounts present and of non significant importance to the final results sequences were only included if the e value was sufficient low e 50 the top result was imported into an excel spreadsheet and used to determine taxonomic affiliation and species abundance 2 7 molecular analysis of ca accumulibacter clades by pcr amplification and sequencing of the ppk1 functional gene a direct pcr was performed to identify the ca accumulibacter clade enriched in the biosystem based on the polyphosphate kinase ppk1 functional gene as described by mcmahon et al 2007 the pcr amplicons were produced using accppk1 254f 5 tcac cacc gacg gcaa gac 3 and accppk1 1376r 5 tcga tcat cagc atct tggc 3 primers and sanger sequenced by baseclear leiden the netherlands both strands were quality checked and found non ambiguous subsequently both were aligned to yield a high quality near complete ppk1 gene the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor joining method implemented in the clc genomics workbench package as described by saad et al 2016 in total 332 amino acid positions were used for calculations 2 8 genome centric metagenomic analysis of the ca accumulibacter and flanking lineages present in the reactor two biological samples collected during the anaerobic aerobic and anaerobic anoxic aerobic operations were selected for metagenome sequencing analysis wet lab treatments of aliquots of the ebpr biomass were performed to suppress their background contribution of accompanying populations to the metagenomes and to eventually isolate the ca accumulibacter genome bin by differential coverage synthetic shifts in relative abundances of microbial populations were achieved by contacting the biomass to different substrate temperature and dissolved oxygen conditions in shake flasks gdna was extracted from these samples using the fast dna spin kit for soils mp biomedicals usa by 4 series of 40 s of bead beating the bacterial community compositions were characterized beforehand by v1 v3 16s rrna gene based amplicon sequencing analysis primer pair 8f 518r according to the midas field guide of activated sludge mcilroy et al 2015 the gdna extracts were purified and prepared for sequencing of the metagenomes using the nextera xt dna sample preparation kit illumina usa according to manufacturer s instructions all purifications steps were performed using the agencourt ampure xp clean up system beckman coulter usa the dual multiplexed pools of tagmented and indexed dna fragments were sequenced on a miseq benchtop sequencer illumina usa at a sequencing depth of 1 gbp per sample with paired end reads of 300 300 bp quality controls were performed using dna analysis d1000 screentape assays on a 2200 tapestation instrument agilenttechnologies usa gdna concentrations were accurately measured using quant it dsdna assay kits thermofischer scientific usa on an infinite m1000 pro plate reader tecan switzerland the metagenomics sequencing raw datasets were processed using the clc genomics workbench qiagen bioinformatics denmark the resulting de novo assembly and coverage files of the metagenomes of the ebpr sludge and background community treatment were loaded into mmgenome karst et al 2016 in r for dual coverage binning of the near complete genome of the ca accumulibacter and flanking lineages present in the bioreactor following the method initially developed by albertsen et al 2013 the single lineage genome assemblies were uploaded into a kbase narrative arkin et al 2016 for phylogenetic classification and functional gene annotation using the rast toolkit brettin et al 2015 after quality control using checkm parks et al 2015 blastn arb silva rnammer trnascan se and quast the obtained assembly of the near complete genome of the ca accumulibacter population selected in the system was taxonomically classified at high resolution against the 28 draft genome assemblies available for this lineage in on line databases such as nih genbank benson et al 2005 ncbi refseq o leary et al 2016 and jgi img chen et al 2017 and imported manually in kbase reference genome assemblies that were deprived of gene and protein annotations of coding sequences were annotated in kbase prior to phylogenetic tree reconstruction the genome centric phylogenetic tree was computed in kbase from reference alignments based on 49 highly conserved clusters of orthologous groups of proteins and using the fasttree2 approximate maximum likelihood method the fastani algorithm was used to discriminate between unique genomes 95 new population or to highlight overlapping genomes 99 by fast computation of pairwise average nucleotide identity fastani values the genome based phylogenetic tree was cross validated with the ppk1 gene based taxonomic classification across the ca accumulibacter lineage the ppk1 gene sequence was retrieved from the genome assembly and matched against sequences of ppk1 gene pcr amplicons obtained from the ebpr biomass based on the uniqueness of the near complete genomes obtained we here proposed the provisional novel species names ca accumulibacter delftensis sp nov ca nocardioides delftensis sp nov and ca thermomonas delftensis sp nov since no isolate and pure culture is available for these organisms the provisional names were proposed according to recommendations of murray and stackebrandt and principles of the international code of nomenclature of prokaryotes a digital protologue table was developed for the description of the provisional taxa following identical procedure adopted lately by andersen et al the genome assemblies and annotations are deposited in kbase and will be made publicly available in genbank european nucleotide archive in progress output milestones of the genome centric metagenomics analysis are available in supporting information 2 9 stoichiometric and kinetic parameters of interest the ratio of phosphorus released to vfa uptake p vfa under anaerobic conditions was calculated based on the observed net phosphorus released at the end of the anaerobic period per vfa consumed the phosphorus content in the biomass was calculated based on a mass balance performed using data from the pseudo steady state conditions as described by kuba et al 1993 the anaerobic metabolic activity of the sludge was characterized using the following anaerobic biomass specific rates of interest i q p o 4 a n m a x maximum observed anaerobic phosphorus release rate in mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 ii m p o 4 a n anaerobic endogenous phosphorus release rate observed once vfa were taken up in mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 iii q p o 4 v f a anaerobic phosphorus release rate due to vfa uptake calculated according to 1 q p o 4 v f a q p o 4 a n m a x m p o 4 a n iv q v f a m a x maximum observed anaerobic vfa uptake rate observed in mg cod g 1 vss h 1 oxygen uptake rate our profiles were determined based on do consumption over time in order to measure the do consumption during the oxic stages the ebpr sludge was recirculated from the parent reactor through a separate 10 ml biological oxygen monitor bom unit for 2 3 min once the do measurements were stable the sludge recirculation was stopped and the do concentration profiles were recorded the do concentrations were kept above a set point of 2 mg o2 l 1 by periodically re starting the sludge recirculation this procedure was repeated along the oxic phases the bom unit was equipped with a wtw oxi 340i do probe germany the anoxic and aerobic biomass specific rates of interest were i q n o 3 a x nitrate uptake rate in mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 ii q p o 4 a x anoxic phosphorus uptake rate in mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 iii q p o 4 o x aerobic phosphorus uptake rate in mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 all rates were calculated by linear regression based on the observed profiles as described in smolders et al 1995 3 results 3 1 operation of the reactor under anaerobic oxic a o conditions the ebpr reactor was operated for more than a year under a o conditions showing a pseudo steady state performance fig 1 a all vfas were anaerobically consumed during the first 15 min of reaction at a maximum biomass specific rate of 269 mg cod g 1 vss h 1 q v f a m a x with a phosphorus release of 199 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 q p o 4 a n m a x once all vfa were taken up a residual p release rate of 2 5 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 m p o 4 a n was observed and assumed to correspond to the anaerobic endogenous p release i e for cellular maintenance under the presence of oxygen phosphorus was taken up at a rate of 58 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 q p o 4 o x the observed ratio of phosphorus taken up per total oxygen consumed was 1 63 mg p mg 1 o2 equivalent to 0 42 mol p mol 1 e transferred during respiration 3 2 long term operation under anaerobic anoxic oxic a2o conditions as observed in fig 1 b g in the anaerobic stage of the a2o system all vfas were taken up and phosphorus was released at a maximum anaerobic rate q p o 4 a n m a x of between 164 and 254 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 once the vfas were consumed the phosphorus released due to maintenance activities m p o 4 a n was considerably higher in the experimental periods b c and e 12 0 0 8 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 than in d f and g 1 9 1 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 the p vfa ratios were rather stable in the experimental periods b c d and e 0 66 0 06 mg po4 p mg 1 cod and higher than in f and g 0 50 0 06 mg po4 p mg 1 cod under anoxic conditions accumulation of nitrite was never detected in none of the experiments fig 1b g a slightly higher denitrification activity of 3 9 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed in the first experimental period b after switching to the a2o conditions in the rest of the experimental periods the denitrification rates did not increase considerably and remained around 2 2 0 5 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 table 2 shows the a2o rates and stoichiometry parameters calculated in each experimental period compared to the aerobic p uptake rates of up to 79 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 a relatively low anoxic p uptake rate q p o 4 a x was observed in periods b c and f 5 0 0 3 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 which even decreased to 3 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 in period g and became negligible in period d as much the relative anoxic phosphorus uptake rates reached 13 of the aerobic phosphorus uptake rates table 2 in all cases phosphorus was fully removed during the oxic phase fig 1 3 3 minimal aerobic srt in the experimental phase h as an attempt to favor the growth of a dpao capable of using nitrate over strict aerobic paos the oxic srt was reduced below the minimum required for aerobic paos to grow as described by brdjanovic et al 1998 after two days of operation with an oxic srt of approximately 0 4 d the vfas started to leak into the anoxic phase 74 mg cod l 1 at day 2 of operation likewise the anaerobic phosphorus release decreased from 117 mg po4 p l 1 to 32 mg po4 p l 1 on the 3rd day of operation the nitrate dose was increased daily to prevent nitrate limitation while avoiding to exceed a concentration of more than 3 mg no3 n l 1 in the oxic phase which may leak into the anaerobic stage despite these measures no dpao activity was observed and no phosphorus was removed in neither the anoxic nor the oxic phases thus up to 27 mg po4 p l 1 were observed at the end of the oxic phase day 2 of operation 3 4 assessment of the effects of the f m ratio on the anoxic phosphorus uptake activity in the batch activity test 1d conducted ex situ with half of the f m ratio applied to the parent reactor the acetate uptake rate q p o 4 v f a and the maximum phosphorus release rate q p o 4 a n m a x were 75 2 mg cod g 1 vss h 1 and 72 2 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 respectively these rates were considerably slower than the ones observed in the batch test 2d executed with twice the f m ratio fed to the parent reactor 265 mg cod g 1 vss h 1 and 235 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 respectively despite these differences the observed p vfa ratios were not considerably different between the two batch tests 0 60 and 0 66 at the batch tests 1d and 2d respectively the anoxic phosphorus uptake and denitrification rates were rather different in the two batch tests fig 2 in the 1d batch test a nitrate reduction rate of 0 8 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed while phosphorus was released at a rate of 2 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 fig 2a on the contrary in the 2d batch test a faster nitrate reduction rate of 1 95 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed together with a marginal phosphorus uptake rate of 0 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 3 5 identification of predominant bacterial populations along the experimental periods fish analyses were performed to identify the predominant microorganisms present in the systems and potentially involved in ebpr over the different experimental periods fig 3 shows a representative image of the microbial composition at the start and end of this research experimental periods a and g respectively the relative abundance of paos related to the genus ca accumulibacter paomix probe set compared to all organisms stained with dapi decreased from 98 95 76 52 along the experimental periods a b d and g respectively despite these differences the fraction of the ca accumulibacter clade i acc 1 444 probe within paos did not change along the experiments 97 4 fig 3 across experimental periods gaos were never abundant the genera ca competibacter and defluviicoccus composed less than 5 of the total microbial populations according to both fish fig 3 and v3 v4 16s rrna gene amplicon sequencing table 3 the amplicon sequencing profiles displayed a decrease in the relative abundance of the genus ca accumulibacter from 53 to 33 from experimental periods a to g respectively table 3 finer scale characterization of the ca accumulibacter clades based on pcr and sequencing analyses of the ppk1 gene showed that the system was mainly composed of members of the clade pao ic at the start and end of the experiments fig 4 3 6 near complete genomes of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic and two flanking populations were retrieved from the metagenome of the ebpr biomass and enabled genome centric analysis three near complete genomes were retrieved by differential coverage binning fig 5 a for sub lineages of the main gammaproteobacterial betaproteobacteriales genus ca accumulibacter genome size of 5 3 mbp completeness of 100 contamination of 0 2 gc content of 62 2 and of the two accompanying actinobacterial genus nocardioides 4 7 mbp 99 2 0 7 68 6 and gammaproteobacterial genus thermomonas 2 9 mbp 99 5 0 4 68 4 table 5 from the metagenome of the ebpr biomass exposed to a o and subsequently a2o conditions note that the class of betaproteobacteria has recently been reclassified as order betaproteobacteriales in the class of gammaproteobacteria detailed features of the genome bins are provided in fig s1 and table s1 of the supplementary information the genome assemblies were submitted to genbank european nucleotide archive in progress phylogenetic classification of the high quality genome assemblies against reference genomes of these lineages available in on line databases allowed to delineate key populations involved in the biosystem from alignments based on 49 highly conserved clusters of orthologous groups of proteins a new population of the here proposed ca accumulibacter delftensis sp nov clade ic was identified by fine scale differentiation out of the about 30 draft genomes of ca accumulibacter publicly available the recently characterized ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic was the closest neighbor but formed a different phylotype inside clade ic fig 5b computation of pairwise average nucleotide identity ani scores stated the uniqueness of the candidate species ca accumulibacter delftensis pairwise ani 95 the two main accompanying populations of the here proposed ca nocardioides delftensis sp nov and ca thermomonas delftensis sp nov affiliated with closest neighbours of nocardioides jensenii and thermomonas fusca respectively but also formed new candidate species according to pairwise ani scores 95 extraction of the full length 16s rrna genes table s4 from the three genomic datasets and mapping against ncbi and arb silva databases provided additional verification the digital protologue table 5 provides the main characteristics of the near complete genomes of these proposed yet not isolated new candidate species the ani analysis further highlighted that several genome assemblies that have been previously deposited in databases under different reference numbers for the ca accumulibacter lineage are overlapping pairwise ani 99 this has notably arisen from re use of deposited sequencing datasets in bioinformatics studies the pangenome of ani filtered unique single lineage genomes of ca accumulibacter populations displayed diverse non core genetic features in the assemblies fig s2 3 7 matching of genome based and ppk1 based phylogenetic characterizations the phylogenetic output of the high resolution analysis conducted on the near complete genome of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic was cross validated to the sequencing of ppk1 gene based pcr amplicons the sequence of the ppk1 gene retrieved from the genome assembly of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic table s5 displayed a perfect match to the sequence of the ppk1 gene amplified from the dpao biomass in the functional gene based phylogenetic tree its ppk1 nucleotide composition was closely related to reference sequences of clade ic it formed a separate population than ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic after comparison with the ppk1 sequence retrieved from the deposited assembly of the latter lineage thereafter the genome based and ppk1 based classification approaches matched resulting in phylogenetic trees of analogous structures and robust molecular differentiation of the lineages 3 8 genome centric investigation of denitrification marker genes of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic ca nocardioides delftensis and ca thermomonas delftensis the underlying coding sequences of the 3 retrieved near complete genomes of ca accumulibacter delftensis ca nocardioides delftensis and ca thermomonas delftensis were annotated and assigned to 30 functional gene categories table s2 including the nitrogen metabolism table 4 and table s3 functional gene annotations of the genome assemblies highlighted a putative complementary interaction between these populations along the nitrogen cycle table 4 and table s3 in supplementary information the ca accumulibacter delftensis genome assembly comprised genes coding for nitrate nitrite transporter assimilatory nitrate reductase nas gene periplasmic nitrate reductase precursor and periplasmic nitrate reductases nap but no genes coding for respiratory nitrate reductases nar it further harbored a whole set of nitrite nir nitric oxide nor and nitrous oxide nos reductases the ca nocardioides delftensis genome assembly contained assimilatory nitrate reductase nitrate nitrite transporter nitrite reductase nad p h large subunit and respiratory nitrate reductases but no further denitrification genes interestingly the ca thermomonas delftensis genome assembly mainly harbored respiratory nitrate reductases alpha beta delta and gamma chains and some denitrification gene homologues nir nor 4 discussion 4 1 effect of different operating conditions on anoxic phosphorus uptake activity the anoxic phosphorus uptake rates observed in the experimental periods conducted under different operating conditions were considerably lower than the oxic p uptake rates table 2 the anoxic p uptake rate reached at most 13 of the oxic p uptake rate thus even though there could be some denitrification associated with an anoxic p uptake this seems not be significant when compared with the oxic p uptake this is in agreement with the study of lanham et al 2011 who observed a faster oxic than anoxic p uptake rate in an a2o reactor alternatively kuba et al 1993 and lee and yun 2014 reported that nitrate could be used as electron acceptor as efficient as oxygen by pao for p uptake however kuba et al 1993 and lee and yun 2014 have applied an a2 configuration in contrast to this study where an a2o configuration was used this suggests that the oxic phase in each cycle may have hampered the selection for a pao and or a microbial population which could enhance the use nitrate as efficient as oxygen for p uptake the aim of this study was to evaluate whether various operational conditions could enhance the denitrification capacities of a ca accumulibacter clade i culture operational changes were applied for a relatively short time allowing for the enzymatic induction but minimizing any shifts in the microbial community composition as the anoxic growth yield can be up to 70 of the aerobic growth yield kuba et al 1993 the srt was extended from 8 to 15 d in the experimental period d as suggested by ahn et al 2002 however this exerted an adverse effect by decreasing the anoxic activity from 3 9 to 2 5 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 experimental phase b and d respectively in contrast to the studies of kuba et al 1993 and ahn et al 2002 a clear anoxic p uptake was never observed it may be concluded that either the denitrification activity observed in this study was not carried out by the ca accumulibacter population selected in this system or the culture was not capable to restore its poly p storage pools under the applied conditions further activity tests with the biomass of experimental period d showed that under a low f m ratio phosphate was surprisingly released under anoxic conditions at a rate of 2 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 despite that nitrate was present in the activity test fig 2a the release of phosphate strongly suggests that the ca accumulibacter affiliate of clade ic obtained in this enrichment culture could not use nitrate as electron acceptor to generate enough energy from its putative reduction thus as suggested by rubio rincón et al 2017a and ribera guardia et al 2016 this pao may prefer to use nitrite generated by side populations among them possibly gaos via the reduction of nitrate to nitrite as electron acceptor for the oxidation of pha the nitrite produced by side populations would be lower according to a decrease in the organic load per biomass f m resulting in energy limitation by the oxidation of pha by paos and a subsequent anoxic p release as observed in fig 2a to further assess if a side population was responsible for the denitrification observed in the system the p cod ratio in the influent was decreased with the aim to increase the gao fraction from experimental period f onwards the population of ca accumulibacter clade ic remained the main pao detected approx 97 4 but decreased from 98 to 52 from experimental periods a to g fig 3 similar to the study of carvalho et al 2007 however gaos did not proliferate as expected up to 1 in the experimental period g fig 3 likely the relatively high ph of 7 6 limited the proliferation of gaos smolders et al 1995 at the same time after the switch from a o to a2o conditions an increase in the fraction of potentially denitrifying thermomonas and chryseobacterium genera was observed 13 and 8 respectively in experimental period g table 3 despite that thermomonas and chryseobacterium are capable to reduce both nitrate and nitrite mergaert et al 2003 kundu et al 2014 the biomass specific denitrification activity did not increase together with their enrichment 2 1 and 1 8 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 in experimental periods f and g respectively the non pao based denitrification activity measured in the system remained uncertain additional analyses of mrna based functional gene expression or protein translation within the nitrogen cycle either via reverse transcription and qpcr or higher throughput molecular analyses like metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics respectively would have helped to identify the biochemical pathways activated together with the bacterial populations involved the role of the side populations within the microbial community e g thermomonas flavobacterium chryseobacterium terrimonas nocardioides remains also unclear under the operating conditions applied here they did not significantly contribute to the denitrification activity this suggests that other factors or microorganisms interact and can e g gaos were suggested by rubio rincón et al 2017a enhance the anoxic p uptake activity over nitrite in ebpr cultures kuba et al 1993 enriched a dpao culture under a2 conditions dosing nitrate continuously during the anoxic stage this dosing mode could benefit k strategist dpaos therefore in period g nitrate was dosed continuously during the anoxic phase as described earlier certain increase in the anoxic p uptake per electron available was observed from 0 13 to 0 24 mol p mol 1 e between periods f and g respectively the anoxic range from 0 13 to 0 24 mol p mol 1 e ratio observed along this study was comparable to the one of 0 19 mol p mol 1 e reported by kuba et al 1993 however the anoxic p uptake rate was slower than the reported by kuba et al 1993 up to 5 4 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 compared to 30 46 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 respectively this indicated that the dosing mode did not play a role to enhance the anoxic phosphorus uptake activity of the sludge as an attempt to favor the growth of dpaos over strict aerobic paos the operational conditions were gradually modified from anaerobic anoxic oxic to anaerobic anoxic experimental periods g and h however once the aerobic srt was reduced below the minimal required acetate started to leak into the anoxic phase after just 2 days of operation despite that nitrate was not limiting likely phas were not completely oxidized during the anoxic and oxic phases thus paos could not take up sufficient phosphorus or produce enough glycogen for anaerobic vfa uptake this is in agreement with lanham et al 2011 who concluded that an oxic phase was essential to maintain a good removal of phosphorus where most of the phosphorus uptake occurred therefore it is suggested that the culture of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic enriched in this study cannot solely rely on the use of nitrate for energy generation for metabolic processes e g via pha oxidation recently in contrast with these findings and those of saad et al 2016 where no significant anoxic phosphorus uptake was observed camejo et al 2016 reported the anoxic p uptake activity on nitrate 11 1 7 mgpo4 p g 1 vss h 1 of a ca accumulibacter clade ic culture however functional diversity in sub lineages can happen making that the ppk analysis cannot be used to anticipate denitrification capabilities hence as discussed in the following sections the correlative trends between ppk1 based taxonomic classification and denitrification activities monitored in ebpr systems is no longer valid the sole detection of microbial clades is not sufficient to explain biochemical conversions the genome centric metagenomics analysis of the near complete genomes of the ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic and ca thermomonas delftensis lineages of the ebpr biomass subjected to a o and a2o conditions interestingly highlighted a putative interaction potential between the two populations from nitrate reduction to nitrite by thermomonas harbors genes coding for respiratory nitrate reductases nar but genes for nitrite reduction were not found in the assembly prior to respiration of nitrite by ca accumulibacter along with p removal the ca nocardioides delftensis lineage harbored functional genes for both nitrate and nitrite respiration the involvement of this population that can display filamentous phenotypes is supposed to primarily occur under disturbed conditions like those where vfa leak into the anoxic stage these functional potentials underlie hypothetical interactions between ca accumulibacter and these accompanying populations in the nitrogen cycle within the ecosystem of lab scale denitrifying ebpr biomass however the previously proposed reduction mechanism from nitrate to nitrite performed by thermomonas and or nocardioides might be conducted by other organisms in full scale wastewater treatment plants further research and analytical methods are needed to elucidate microbial interactions between ca accumulibacter and other genera e g ca competibacter thermomonas nocardioides ca microthrix on the nitrogen cycle 4 2 possible metabolic pathway for nitrate reduction observed in this study only a marginal nitrate consumption of up to 3 9 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed in the enriched ca accumulibacter ic culture experimental period b alternatively to the role of side populations the consumption of nitrate can be associated to growth nitrate assimilation nas generation of metabolic energy nitrate respiration nar and or dissipation of the excess of reducing power nitrate dissimilation nap moreno vivián et al 1999 according to previous studies skennerton et al 2014 different clades of ca accumulibacter contain either the nitrate respiration gene nar clade iic or the periplasmatic nitrate dissimilation gene nap clades ic ia iia iif only the nap gene has been previously identified in the metagenomes of enriched ebpr cultures composed of the clades ia and ic flowers et al 2013 skennerton et al 2014 consistently in the present study the genome assembly of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic harbored nas and nap genes but not the nar gene table 4 which could explain the low anoxic p uptake activity measured in the bioreactor camejo et al 2016 have suggested that an enriched clade ic population of ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic contained all the enzymes necessary to perform a full denitrification which has been confirmed by their subsequent integrated omic analysis camejo et al 2018 however the actual operating conditions required to enhance the presence and activation of the required enzymes remain unclear from the nitrogen cycle perspective the two most characterized populations of this interesting clade ic namely ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic and ca accumulibacter sp uw ldo ic display fine scale differentiation in genes coding for nitrate reduction antagonist presence absence of nap and nar genes ihe1 primarily harbors periplasmic nap and lacks respiratory nar nitrate reductases which is exactly the opposite by uw ldo ic as described by moreno vivián et al 1999 the nap enzyme is not involved in the anaerobic respiration as the enzyme is independent of the energy conserving cytochrome bc1 complex instead the electron required for the reduction of nitrate could be obtained via nadh which passes through proton translocating nadh dehydrogenases bedzyk et al 1999 interestingly the subunit napd which seems to be an important precursor of the subunit napa moreno vivián et al 1999 was not detected in the genome assembly of ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic table s3 in supporting information this is notable since napa that is responsible for the reduction of nitrate to nitrite can likely not be promoted in absence of napd thus based on such genetic impotent it is unlikely that the pao population in our system was capable to utilize nitrate moreover the existence and activation of the nar enzyme appears to be required for a considerable anoxic phosphorus uptake using nitrate by ca accumulibacter the absence of nar gene in the genome assembly underlines that this functionality cannot be achieved by the selected ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic regarding the current molecular techniques applied based on fine scale genetic analyses of the ppk1 gene it is possible to differentiate among the ca accumulibacter lineages mcmahon et al 2007 despite the general correlative assumptions that these clades seem to have the same encoding for denitrification they exhibit different anoxic p uptake capabilities on nitrate e g anoxic activities of clades ic and iia garcía martín et al 2006 flowers et al 2008 2013 oehmen et al 2010b 2010c skennerton et al 2014 camejo et al 2016 2018 ribera guardia et al 2016 and this study in view of these observations the traditionally accepted engineering classification of the denitrifying populations of ca accumulibacter grouped based on the ppk gene as either clade i with full denitrification capacity from nitrate onwards or clade ii from nitrite onwards as modeled by oehmen et al 2010c does not seem to be valid and supported as a stand alone approach further studies should include detection and expression of the key denitrifying genes e g nar or proteins e g nar in addition to the clade differentiation using the ppk marker gene it should be thoroughly investigated how different operating conditions can enhance the selection of dpaos the activation of their genetic signatures and their catabolic regulation depending on terminal electron acceptors available the influence of environmental and operational conditions on the gene regulation skennerton et al 2014 and their interaction with the different metabolic pathways and energy consumption deserve special attention definitely microbial ecology have suggested that many functional traits are not necessarily conserved between lineages martiny et al 2015 ancestral genome reconstructions have shown that denitrification genes are part of the flexible genome and that numerous other important genes of ebpr metabolisms have been acquired by horizontal transfer oyserman et al 2016 hence the incongruency between studies on denitrification traits of ca accumulibacter clades does reflect the true intra clade diversity which requires thorough investigation within the ca accumulibacter lineage this statement can be broadened over the complexity of clades of heterotrophic denitrifiers whose genetic pools may result from a rather random acquisition process certainly the concepts and justification of clades need strong reappraisal across microbial tree of life parks et al 2017 toward a more accurate representation of actual metabolisms together with consideration of horizontal transfer of catabolic genes in activated sludge microbiomes 4 3 possible sources of carbon for denitrification by side populations if ultimately the selected dpaos are not able to denitrify from nitrate at relevant and applicable rates it remains possible that the denitrification observed in ebpr systems is carried out partially from nitrate to nitrite by other microbial populations however such potential heterotrophic denitrifiers should be provided with electron donors this adds up to the former questions regarding the factors e g organic substrate availability and substrate storage under anaerobic conditions and underlying the presence of a diversity of potential denitrifiers in the bacterial community of ebpr processes weissbrodt et al 2014 previous research on ebpr have reported the leakage of certain residual concentrations of non vfa organic compounds as a function of the hrt ichihashi et al 2006 the residual organic compounds present in the anoxic stage could be potentially used by ordinary heterotrophic organisms ohos as carbon source for denitrification purposes kuba et al 1993 have observed around 5 mg toc l 1 leaking into an anoxic phase which have led to up to 3 8 mg no3 n l 1 reduction if nitrate was reduced to nitrite moreover nitrate from anoxic zones can also intrude into anaerobic stages via internal recirculation flowrates or due to the residual concentrations of these components observed in the end of the alternating aerobic or anoxic phases independently of the experimental periods thus ohos could grow in the system on the vfas fed and nitrate available contributing to the direct denitrification from nitrate to nitrite and even in the subsequent anoxic phase triggered by the endogenous processes in some cases the presence of nitrate in anaerobic stages have nevertheless been reported to favor the growth of dpaos in ebpr systems ahn et al 2001b another possibility is the potential presence of other microorganisms capable to store vfas under anaerobic conditions and then to oxidize them using nitrate tu and schuler 2013 proposed that under carbon limiting conditions paos would outcompete other pha accumulating organisms such as gaos this could be the case in the activity test 1 d performed here with half the organic loading per biomass fig 2a where a denitrification rate of 0 8 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 was observed together with an anoxic p release rate of 2 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 on the contrary in the activity test 2d conducted with double the organic loading per biomass a denitrification rate of 1 95 mg no3 n g 1 vss h 1 with an anoxic phosphorus uptake rate of 0 7 mg po4 p g 1 vss h 1 were observed thus it is suggested that the anoxic p uptake observed in this study was carried out over the nitrite generated by other pha accumulating organisms that might have benefitted from the relatively higher availability of electron donors ekama and wentzel 1999 pointed out that alternating anoxic oxic conditions stimulated the presence of filamentous bacteria the appearance of filamentous bacteria has also been reported in the studies of kerrn jespersen and henze 1993 and comprised up to 10 of the biomass in the studies of lanham et al 2011 early studies of kuba et al 1993 also reported considerable amounts of sludge washed out through the effluent due to settling problems suggesting the presence of filamentous bacteria these filamentous bacteria as the frequently observed thiothrix type 021n or and ca microthrix in wastewater treatment plants can reduce nitrate into nitrite williams and unz 1985 nielsen et al 2000 hesselsoe et al 2005 mcilroy et al 2013 and have also been identified as one of the most abundant side populations present in ebpr lab systems garcia martin et al 2006 interestingly recently some of these e g thiothrix have been reported to also contribute to ebpr rubio rincón et al 2017b further characterization of the metabolisms of the side populations is needed to elucidate their potential involvement in the anoxic p uptake activities of ebpr cultures 5 conclusions the ca accumulibacter delftensis clade ic culture enriched and genetically characterized in this study did not exhibit a considerable anoxic p uptake on nitrate it was as high as 13 of the phosphorus uptake observed under aerobic conditions a decrease in the organic load fed per biomass resulted in the anoxic release of phosphorus indicating that this specific population of the clade ic was unable to use nitrate as electron acceptor eventually the system collapsed when the aerobic srt decreased below the minimum required reinforcing the idea that our clade ic cannot rely solely on the use of nitrate as terminal electron acceptor the putative complementary interaction potential between side populations of the genera thermomonas and nocardioides nitrate respiration and the ca accumulibacter population nitrite respiration was highlighted from single lineage genome assemblies extracted from the biomass subjected to a o and a2o conditions we further showed that genome based and ppk1 gene based phylogenies were congruent for the classification of known populations within the ca accumulibacter lineage with genome centric metagenomics approach providing definite advantage to capture functional potential of the phylotypes next research should target functional expression and ecophysiological analyses to validate actual biochemical pathways involved by targeted populations together with microbial interactions in denitrifying ebpr systems we here stressed that correlating denitrifying activities to ca accumulibacter clade differentiation by ppk gene is not valid deep reconsideration of the true intra clade diversity in functional traits that results from evolutionary and horizontal gene transfer processes is paramount

18686,when adequately treated grey water represents a potent alternative water resource as it constitutes a large proportion of household wastewater the objective of this paper was to test a full scale version of a novel compact grey water treatment technology based on passive aeration and particle trapping in multiple layers using a modified dual porosity filtration technology grey water from a public bath was passed through a stack of eight reactors each 0 75 m 0 55 0 22 m serially connected for gravity driven flow from top to bottom in a zig zag pattern the topmost reactor served as pre filter for removal of hair and other larger debris the lower seven reactors facilitated degradation of bulk organic contaminants in biofilm established on a stack of five fibrous polyamide nets and trapping of particles by sedimentation on five interlaid corrugated plastic plates by operating the reactors in a time controlled batch mode the corrugated plates further served to trap air and thus ensure passive aeration of the subsequent batch the production rate was 1 2 m3 d and the hydraulic retention time 2 h at an aerial footprint of 0 4 m2 excluding storage tanks after two weeks of initialization a biofilm had established and the system was monitored for additionally three weeks significantly improved effluent quality was obtained as measured from reductions in turbidity 95 total suspended solids 94 chemical oxygen demand 87 and microbiological parameters 55 98 and from stable level of dissolved oxygen in effluent of 3 5 mg l future optimization includes custom made reactors for maximizing production capacity improved removal of total n and total p and addition of final disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords decentralized dual porosity filtration grey water reuse low cost multi layer reactor space efficient 1 introduction global water scarcity has made wastewater reuse a necessity gabarro et al 2013 excluding toilet flush water grey water makes up 65 of domestic wastewater thus representing the largest source for water reuse in households baban et al 2010 eriksson et al 2002 ghaitidak and yadav 2013 gulyas et al 2009 grey water is a reliable source of water due to its daily production santos et al 2012 and compared to sewage water less polluted with only 30 of the organic load and 9 20 of the nutrients pidou et al 2007 and pathogens eriksson et al 2002 friedler 2004 found in sewage wastewater due to various limitations developed treatment technologies are not widespread and subsequently most grey water reuse projects are limited to irrigation of crops that are robust to untreated grey water mandal et al 2011 and toilet flushing industrial cooling and aquifer recharge eriksson et al 2002 friedler and hadari 2006 ghunmi et al 2010 if grey water can be upgraded to high quality water liu et al 2014 grey water reuse purposes may additionally include cleaning operations like floor washing first rinse cycle in laundry machines and dishwashers eriksson et al 2002 galvis et al 2014 vehicle washing fire protection concrete production and wetlands preservation jefferson et al 2004 technologies applied for grey water upgrading include membrane filtration reverse osmosis ro constructed wetlands and rotating bio contactors rbc birks 1998 reported that a medium strength ultra filtration uf membrane grey water treatment system reduced chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and total organic carbon toc by 74 80 and 83 4 respectively even though the permeate was low in turbidity below 1 ntu and free of suspended solids soluble nutrients like ammonia and phosphate passed through the membrane which may trigger re growth of micro organisms in the storage and transportation system li et al 2009 this problem is exaggerated with microfiltration 0 2 μm which is less energy demanding compared to uf and still eliminates microorganisms but unable to reduce not only dissolved nutrients but also bulk organic matter expressed as bod nolde 2000 another drawback is membrane fouling and its consequences in terms of operation and maintenance limiting their economic viability pidou et al 2007 šostar turk et al 2005 report on a grey water treatment system with ro after uf that reduced bod from 86 mg l to 2 mg l corresponding to 98 removal rate however it should be noted that higher energy consumption of ro technology restricts its widespread application li et al 2009 nolde 2000 in terms of operation and maintenance cost constructed wetland can be regarded as the most environmentally friendly and cost effective technology for grey water treatment de gisi et al 2016 however it requires large space masi et al 2010 and therefore it is not suitable for the urban areas another drawback is volume loss due to evapotranspiration a technology developed specifically for grey water treatment is rbc where bod is reduced by degradation of organic contaminants in biofilm developed on serially connected rotating discs that dip into grey water as it flows through chambers nolde 2000 friedler and hadari 2006 conclude that aerobic biological grey water treatment based on rbc system removes most of the biodegradable organic substances and thus re growth of micro organisms and odor problem are avoided making the system more economically feasible however as pointed out by metcalf and eddy 2014 the rbc system does have drawbacks in terms of rather high electricity consumption for rotating heavy discs and risks of shaft breakage an increase in the electricity bill almost outweighing savings on the water bill and multiple shaft breakages over a period of 10 years caused the shutdown of an otherwise well performing rbc system in copenhagen denmark treating bathroom grey water for subsequent toilet flushing eriksson et al 2009 sørensen 2014 taking the difficulties of separating grey water from total domestic wastewater in large scale centralized sewage systems into account decentralized systems applicable at the single building level e g individual households or shared between a limited number of households public bathhouses and small scale industries may be more straightforward todt et al 2015 locally operated systems have the additional advantage of placing users in control of contaminant sources especially input of organic micro pollutants like xenobiotic organic compounds eriksson et al 2002 a common drawback of decentralized systems is the risk of deficit human skills for operation and maintenance for this reason decentralized grey water treatment systems must be based on simple processes ghunmi et al 2011 ideal treatment technologies would consume little energy be affordable environment friendly require limited space easy to operate and maintain by non professionals and would consistently produce high quality effluent despite variations in influent quality atanasova et al 2017 gross et al 2007 achievement of a lasting effect on water supply would require widespread adoption of decentralized grey water collection treatment and storage systems nolde 2000 sinclair et al 2013 to encourage broader grey water reuse santos et al 2012 the purpose of this study was to advance the development of a novel full scale grey water treatment system based on principles that had already been tested at pilot scale prajapati and jensen 2018 the unit operating processes of the technology are degradation of bulk organic matter in a passively aerated biofilm combined with sedimentation of suspended solids in a shallow layer of stagnant water the idea of using stacked shallow treatment layers with different functions originates from the dual porosity filtration dpf technology developed for treatment of road runoff jensen et al 2011 in the pilot study light grey water was exposed to the atmosphere by use of an open 60 l reactor l 2 m w 0 6 m d 0 05 m filled with a 0 05 m thick fibrous polyamide net to support the emergent biofilm and combined with either full drainage after 60 min or half drainage leaving 2 5 cm depth of water after 30 min both producing 1 4 m3 d of effluent using light grey water from a public bath as influent it was found that passive aeration allowed for full biofilm development over a couple of weeks the half drainage tended to return a faster and better biofilm development but no clear difference in pollutant removal efficiency was observed between the two drainage modes the specific objectives of the upscaling study were to convert the pilot reactor to a space efficient full scale grey water treatment system still based on gravity driven flow passive aeration of biofilm and accumulation of sediment provide proof of removal of bulk contaminants in grey water a batch operated system based on shallow fibrous nets for biofilm support interlaid with corrugated plates for sediment trapping and passive aeration was designed allowing for stacking and thus a space efficient system proof of concept was obtained on a prototype constructed from available market products and tested by using light grey water from a public bathhouse as influent over a five week period physical chemical and microbiological parameters were monitored in influent effluent and at intermediate positions in the system after completion of the flow experiment biofilm development and accumulated sediment was inspected 2 materials and methods 2 1 case site sofiebadet an old public bathhouse in copenhagen served as test case for proof of concept the facility accommodates up to 26 persons at a time and offers showers and baths sauna massage and facial clay masks customers are not allowed to bring any personal products rather towels and all other products soap oil cream masks etc are provided by sofiebadet which purchases organic brands for everything including cleaning agents sofiebadet produces approximately 6 m3 of grey water per day of which 5 m3 originates from customers bathing activities only grey water from the bath area which also included grey water from a once a day bath cleaning was used for the testing according to friedler et al 2008 the influent grey water may be categorized as light grey water 2 2 system design and flow mode to convert the pilot reactor prajapati and jensen 2018 to a full scale grey water treatment system suitable for decentralized small scale applications the key challenge was to significantly enhance the biofilm and sedimentation treatment areas while keeping the system compact still relying on passive aeration and gravity driven flow the resulting design was based on brainstorms and small lab tests an overview of critical parameters considered and their corresponding success criteria are presented in supplementary material i grouped after system operation and maintenance and water quality the suggested system which was built in the basement of sofiebadet is presented in fig 1 the major difference between pilot and full scale versions is that pilot scale contained only a single treatment layer whereas full scale version contained multiple treatment layers thereby increasing the treatment area for the same area foot print and same production rate but returning a more complete treatment and thus better effluent quality further the full scale version contained two technological advances i the reactor in pilot scale was directly exposed to atmospheric air whereas in full scale version atmospheric air was created above each treatment layer in a submersed system and ii a layer for particle trapping in was introduced in each treatment layer in full scale version the system consisted of eight reactors stacked on top of each other to form a tower through which grey water passed by gravity in a zig zag pattern from top to bottom the system may be referred to as a dpf grey water tower the reactors were made from eight 90 l plastic boxes each measuring 0 75 m 0 55 m x 0 22 m resulting in a total height of approximately 2 m including the supporting pallet on the floor the top reactor reactor 1 served as pre filter while the seven subsequent reactors reactor 2 to reactor 8 constituted the heart of the treatment system each of the seven reactors contained five sandwiches made from fibrous polyamide nets 10 mm thick enkamat and 4 mm thick enkadrain interlaid with corrugated plates icopal above and below each component was cut into 0 75 m 0 55 m pieces to fit into the boxes as shown and further described in fig 1 and with a total height of 0 115 m the total area of the biofilm supporting net 7 reactors x 5 sandwiches x 0 75 m 0 55 m was 14 4 m2 as were the areas of corrugated plates for sediment trapping lower plate and aeration upper plate the system was operated in batch flow mode fig 1 top right a spirit level was used to ensure horizontal position of reactors and thus replenishment of air in the upward facing cavities of the upper corrugated plates during drainage and filling of reactors filling and drainage were automated by use of timer controlled valves orkli art 40320200 on the outlet of each reactor as seen in fig 1 the start up of the influent pump was timer controlled while flow was stopped when a water level sensor in reactor 1 measured receipt of 25 l water this ensured a similar mobile water volume in subsequent reactors grey water from bathing area was channeled into a single drain and collected in a 1 5 m3 storage tank excess grey water overflowed directly to the sewage system before entering the dpf grey water tower system grey water flowed through the system as follows grey water was pumped to the inlet of reactor 1 the pre filter after 15 min of residence time the outlet valve opened for another 15 min to drain the pre filter and transfer the first batch of water to reactor 2 the outlet valve of which was closed after another 15 min a new batch of grey water was pumped into the pre filter while at the same time the valve from reactor 2 opened to transfer the first batch to reactor 3 etc as illustrated in fig 1 thus a new batch of water was taken in every 30 min resulting in a total hydraulic residence time of 2 h the timer program settings were based on the time required to drain the treatment reactors supplementary material ii and the residence time from the half drainage experiment in the preliminary study prajapati and jensen 2018 2 3 test a five week test numbered days 1 32 consisting of a two week initialization phase days 1 13 for biofilm development and a three week operation phase days 14 32 for assessment of water quality was conducted effluent flow rate was monitored with a flow meter brunata type 171b optuna w and registered once a day from monday to friday water samples were taken from the inlet influent and the outlet effluent and also from seven intermediate positions fig 1 at frequencies as described in supplementary material iii and following the method in table 1 ph electric conductivity ec redox potential dissolved oxygen do turbidity ammonium nh4 and temperature were measured immediately after sampling samples for analysis of total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were stored in a refrigerator and samples to measure cod were stored in a freezer and analyzed after completion of the experiment samples for the three different microbiological analyses were immediately transported in cooler boxes to the department of plant and environmental sciences at the university of copenhagen samples for total bacteria count were preserved with 2 final glutaraldehyde until analysis while samples for heterotrophic bacteria total coliform t coli and escherichia coliform e coli were analyzed immediately after the five week flow experiment the system was dismantled and inspected for biofilm development and sediment accumulation as summarized in table 1 and fully described in supplementary material iii 3 results 3 1 water quality during the 32 days precisely 31 days and 20 h of testing a total volume of 32 34 m3 of light grey water from sofiebadet passed through the dpf grey water tower the corresponding production rate was 1 2 m3 d including daily water samples and water loss during the process of weekly changing of filter nets in reactor 1 the flow was steady throughout the experiment r2 0 9995 thus showing no sign of clogging supplementary material iv reactor 1 performed well as a pre filter it efficiently trapped hair and larger debris in order not to block the inlet the net role was replaced once a week when dismantling the pre filter after completing the experiment accumulated sediment was observed on the corrugated plates sediment in the permanently water saturated part of reactor 1 i e on the lower plates had a dark color and smelled of volatile fatty acids indicating this region to be anaerobic as seen from fig 2 the clarity of grey water improved markedly as it passed through the dpf grey water tower to the naked eye the final effluent was indistinguishable from tap water since this improvement was already visible in the initialization phase that is before biofilm had fully developed sedimentation seems to be the main removal mechanism for suspended particles main proof of concept was obtained by comparing water quality in daily grab samples of influent and effluent for the full five week period ph ec redox do turbidity and tss as measured in grab samples of influent and effluent are presented in fig 3 for the operation phase days 15 32 after a biofilm was assumed to have fully developed cod tn tp total bacteria t coli e coli and heterotrophic bacteria at 21 c and 37 c as measured in influent and effluent samples as well as in effluent from reactor 4 are presented in fig 4 additional measurements of ph ec turbidity and tss in samples of influent and effluent obtained automatically every 4 h with fraction collectors in the operation phase are provided in supplementary material v to reveal the change in water quality from reactor to reactor and thus to gain insight into the contribution of individual reactors boxplots in fig 5 show daily measurements of ph ec redox do and turbidity and tss in influent and effluent from each reactor for tss only from reactor 4 during the operation phase and likewise fig 6 shows measurements for cod tn tp and microbiological parameters for three selected days in the operation phase influent composition fluctuated significantly throughout the five weeks fig s 3 4 5 and 6 which is ascribed to variation in number of bathing guests use of soaps and clay masks as well as the time grey water remained in the storage tank before being sent through the system thus allowing for sedimentation and degradation processes to take place to a varying extent as seen from fig 3 ph remained slightly alkaline in both influent and effluent throughout the experiment varying in a narrow band of 7 6 8 2 and with no trends between individual reactors fig 5 average influent ph was 8 07 0 16 and average effluent ph was 8 09 0 17 alkalinity is ascribed to hydroxide ions from soaps and detergents similarly ec showed no particular development over time but effluent ec was almost always slightly higher than influent ec fig s 3 and 5 indicating enrichments in charged degradation products ions average ec value was 918 152 μs cm for influent and 1063 134 μs cm for effluent regarding do a clear development was observed during the first two weeks effluent do levels mirrored the influent do levels while in the operation phase effluent do stabilized at 3 5 0 5 mg o2 l at an average temperature of 23 c regardless of influent do which averaged 2 5 2 0 mg o2 l fig 3 as seen from fig 5 do in effluent from individual reactors stabilized at distinctly different levels throughout the eight reactors with low and declining levels for reactors 1 and 2 followed by an upward shift in reactor 3 after which increasing levels were seen for each subsequent reactor this suggests that removal of bulk organic contaminants primarily takes place in the upper reactors reactors 2 and 3 where do is consumed via aerobic and possibly anaerobic reactor 3 degradation processes while the lower reactors serve to polish the water and allow for re aeration the pattern for redox potential to a large extent mirrored that of do fig s 3 and 5 it should be noted that the absolute redox readings cannot be trusted since negative values in samples with do should not be possible influent turbidity varied from 17 to 133 fau fig s 3 and 5 in line with the visible improvements fig 2 effluent turbidity was already much improved during the initialization phase and reached levels near zero fau in the operation phase indicating that the treatment process is mainly controlled by gravity driven sedimentation of suspended solids but with some contribution from the biofilm as it develops since the even lower turbidity levels in the operation phase point to degradation of organic macro molecules fig s 3 and 5 similar to turbidity influent tss fluctuated considerably ranging from 7 to 85 mg l fig s 3 and 5 but unlike turbidity tss values in effluent had already reached close to zero during the initialization phase indicating that tss was removed by sedimentation alone on average over the full experimental period influent turbidity was reduced from 61 7 26 0 fau to 3 4 5 3 fau in the effluent corresponding to average removal of 95 while influent tss was reduced from 37 24 mg l to 2 1 mg l in effluent corresponding to average removal of 94 the samples obtained every 4 h with a fraction collector largely confirmed the daily grab samples although it may be noted that these more frequent measurements revealed an even larger span in influent levels of ph ec turbidity and tss supplementary material v average cod in influent in the operation phase was 72 2 51 4 mg l which was reduced to 9 6 3 7 mg l in effluent corresponding to a removal efficiency of 87 the cod removal pattern is by large parallel to the turbidity and tss removal patterns fig s 4 and 6 regarding tn the average influent concentration of 7 02 3 51 mg l was reduced to 4 96 1 74 mg l in effluent corresponding to a removal efficiency of 29 while for tp the average influent concentration of 0 35 0 16 mg l was reduced to 0 14 0 12 mg l in effluent corresponding to a removal efficiency of 58 in both cases clear reductions were observed for only three out of six sampling days days 22 29 and 32 fig 4 and the overall patterns as reflected in effluent from individual reactors fig 6 are also not showing a clear pattern although the assessment may be biased due to rather low influent concentrations of nutrients on several days and although analytical errors or sample contamination especially likely for day 25 samples where tn effluent concentrations exceeded those of reactor 4 effluent and tp effluent exceeded both influent and reactor 4 effluent cannot be excluded the bottom line is that the data does not support an effective tn and tp removal total bacteria count which includes both dead and alive cells was reduced in all samples by an average of 55 and especially on the last two sampling days days 29 and 32 where more than 90 were removed fig 4 it is noted that the level of total bacteria in effluent during these last two days was still high with 4 106 and 2 106 cells ml respectively on average the measured influent concentration of total bacteria during operation phase was 3 5 107 9 x 106 cells ml which was reduced to 2 107 1 107 cells ml in effluent when looking into the group of coliform bacteria t coli and e coli it is seen that their effluent levels were reduced significantly on the days when their levels in influent were elevated most notably on days 22 25 29 and 32 average reduction over all measurements of t coli was from 3 07 104 2 29 104 cells ml in influent to 5 07 102 1 1 x 103 cells ml in effluent which corresponds to 98 removal and for e coli average reduction was from 1 66 102 3 59 102 cells ml in influent to 22 41 cells ml in effluent which corresponds to 87 removal a possible explanation for t coli and e coli levels in reactor 4 exceeding their influent levels on day 22 is scouring of biomass in between reactors 1 and 4 for the broad category of heterotrophic bacteria that can be grown at 21 c and 37 c a clear reduction was observed with average reduction rates of 98 at both temperatures fig 4 on average heterotrophic bacteria at 21 c was reduced from 2 13 106 1 78 106 cells ml in influent to 3 43 104 3 45 104 cells ml in effluent and at 37 c the average reduction was from 2 0 106 1 19 106 cells ml in influent to 3 73 104 3 53 104 cells ml in effluent as with t coli and e coli the heterotrophic bacteria concentration on day 22 was higher in effluent from reactor 4 than in influent which also supports the scouring mechanism explanation the general reduction in microbiological parameters is ascribed to microbial degradation and sedimentation as seen from fig 6 most of the reduction in microbial parameters takes place in the upper reactors which is comparable to the removal patterns for turbidity tss and cod the stability in effluent grey water quality was reflected by the narrow range of standard deviation as compared to influent table 2 the stability was more pronounced in the operation phase than in initializing phase for instance standard deviation of effluent do in initializing phase was 1 54 which narrowed to 0 49 in the operation phase a similar pattern can be seen for turbidity demonstrating the robustness of the system in terms of coping with varying composition of influent grey water to produce stable effluent 3 2 biofilm development and sedimentation post experiment observations of biofilm developed in reactors 2 8 confirmed the treatment profile of the dpf grey water tower as reflected by the differences in biofilm dependent parameters i e do redox turbidity cod and microbiological parameters between individual reactors fig s 5 and 6 as seen in fig 7 a strong gradient in biofilm development was found reactors 2 3 and 4 were fully covered in biofilm with grey slimy deposit reactors 5 and 6 were only slightly covered and reactors 7 and 8 almost resembled clean materials likewise the measurement of dry matter accumulation in individual reactors fig 8 showed that most of the sedimentation took place in the upper reactors as already suggested by the reduction in tss fig 5 additionally the tss mass balance supplementary material vi shows that the biofilm weight decreased gradually from influent to effluent through the longitudinal axis of the tower an observation that is also in line with the biomass deposited in rbc baban et al 2010 4 discussion 4 1 system assessment by adopting the dpf treatment concept of gravity driven flow through shallow treatment sandwiches jensen et al 2011 the dpf grey water tower provides a system without mechanically moving parts this reduces the risk of the kind of breakdowns observed in rbc systems metcalf and eddy 2014 sørensen 2014 and minimizes energy consumption energy is needed only for one time pumping of grey water to the inlet of reactor 1 and for opening and closing the valves further the upper corrugated plates with pockets facing upward trap air inside individual sandwiches thus giving birth to a space efficient passive aeration system this system is superior to constructed wetlands which are similarly environment friendly and cost effective but space inefficient de gisi et al 2016 masi et al 2010 in principle the dpf grey water tower allows for unlimited stacking of the biofilm laboratory measurements show that 4 025 l of air was trapped per reactor corresponding to air storage of 0 31 l m2 of sandwich supplementary material vii another novelty is the provision of space for accumulation of particulate matter over large areas in the downward facing corrugated plates allowing this fraction to have a long residence time compared to other systems e g rbc where sediment in flow through chambers requires frequent removal sørensen 2014 and thus improved conditions for degradation over multiple cycles multiple treatment layers within each reactor and the ability of stacking the reactors vertically enhanced the space efficiency of the dpf grey water tower 14 4 m2 of biofilm and 14 4 m2 of sediment accumulation area were created on only 0 42 m2 of floor area foot print and 0 75 m3 in terms of volume the suggested dpf grey water tower treatment process was based on aerobic degradation of easily degradable organic matter in biofilm and sedimentation of particles and thus not relying on addition of chemicals 4 2 optimization and perspectives overall the measured parameters confirm the improvement in water quality when passing through the eight reactors in the dpf grey water tower while turbidity and tss in effluent from reactor 7 were not much different from final effluent this was not the case for do where reactor 8 increased the do level markedly fig 5 reactor 8 was also seen to contribute to the reduction of cod and microbial parameters fig 6 the almost clean materials observed post experimentally in reactors 7 and 8 confirm that these two final reactors mainly served to polish the water in terms of do cod and microbial parameters a question is whether more efficient polishing could be obtained by replacing the net sandwiches in reactor 8 with a classical filtration through a filter substrate an initialization period of two weeks seems adequate in that the levels of biofilm dependent parameters like do turbidity and cod in the operation phase showed a clear shift in effluent towards steady levels irrespective of influent concentration compared to turbidity and tss cod was less reduced 95 and 94 versus 87 suggesting the remaining cod to be slowly non biodegradable organic matters in a dissolved form abu ghunmi et al 2011 as also stated in studies by eriksson et al 2009 friedler et al 2006 to prevent microbial re growth in the effluent storage tank eriksson et al 2009 extra treatment for improved removal of nutrients is needed the average reduction of ammonium nh4 from influent to effluent supplementary material viii suggests nitrification did take place pointing to denitrification as being missing this could be confirmed by measuring the separate nitrogen species no2 and no3 in a study on grey water treatment using a sequencing batch reactor lamine et al 2007 show that hydraulic retention time hrt can significantly affect the nitrification rate with reductions in nh4 from 6 7 mg l to 6 2 mg l at hrt 0 6 days but to 0 3 mg l at hrt 2 5 days in this system hrt was only 2 h 0 08 days which suggests the need for further studies on the relation between tn removal and hrt removal of tp which is likely to be present as inorganic phosphate may be obtained by adding a sorption step e g iron oxide coated sand loganathan et al 2014 compared to tn and tp values compiled in the review by de gisi et al 2016 and as observed in a study by atanasova et al 2017 the effluent concentration levels observed in this study are similar pointing to a general problem of nutrients removal to assess the potential of grey water reuse after treatment in dpf grey water tower the effluent quality measures obtained were compared with epa 2004 who 2006 and review of guidelines done by li et al 2009 pidou et al 2007 for different countries the values for ph 6 9 turbidity 2 20 and tss 3 30 fall within the guideline limits for toilet flushing irrigation and washing purposes however the effluent quality threshold for tn 15 and tp 0 5 as well as t coli 2 2 100 cfu ml and e coli 2 100 cfu ml were exceeded despite marked reductions in microbial parameters a separate disinfection unit mounted after an effluent storage tank is required for safe reuse of water for highest non potable reuse purposes i e personal hygiene as the effluent from dpf grey water tower had turbidity less than 5 fau fig 5 uv treatment is expected to be effective the risk that biomass flocks might be scoured and then escape through the final reactor also points to replacement of reactor 8 with classical filtration the dpf grey water tower treatment capacity can be optimized with custom made materials which would allow for full exploitation of box volume resulting in larger batches and for enhanced air trapping and sediment accumulation volumes longer operation periods are needed to observe the further development of biofilm into lower reactors as well as risk of scouring and to provide an operation and maintenance management scheme compared to ro which has removal efficiency of 100 for tss and 98 for cod ramona et al 2004 the dpf grey water tower falls behind a combination with pre treatment in dpf grey water tower followed by ro may however be advantageous in terms of reduction in ro membrane fouling and thus energy consumption compared to a rbc system preceded by sedimentation and followed by uv which has a removal efficiency of 84 for tss abdel kader 2013 the dpf grey water tower can match in terms of water quality this is also the case when compared to a rbc system preceded by screening followed by sand filter and chlorination which has removal efficiency of 82 for tss and 75 for cod travis et al 2010 the dpf grey water tower has additional advantages with no rotating parts and less energy consumption compared to constructed wetlands which has removal efficiency of 89 8 for tss and 82 for cod in one study travis et al 2010 and 98 for tss and 81 for cod in another study gross et al 2007 the dpf grey water tower can also match and has an additional advantage of better aerial footprint and no water loss during treatment 5 conclusions the suggested dpf grey water tower can turn light grey water into water that is clear and largely free of bulk contaminants and with a marked reduction in microbial parameters all in all suggesting the water to be reused for high level purposes including personal hygiene provided a final disinfection step is added and demonstrates as such the potential for decentralized low cost space efficient indoor solutions this study has shown that passive aeration of submersed biofilm is possible thus allowing for a space efficient treatment system by stacking of biofilm layers and adoption of batch operated flow with no moving parts the risk of mechanical breakdown is practically eliminated and so is the system complexity so laypersons can operate and maintain the system with gravity driven flow energy consumption is limited to pumping grey water into the upper reactor and opening and closing of valves the multi layer sandwich construction of filter material further reduces the risk of clogging as sediment is accumulated in a different layer from where water is flowing allowing for long term degradation of multiple cycles the dpf grey water tower needs further development before its use can be promoted on a large scale including adequate removal of tn and tp the addition of a final disinfection step

18686,when adequately treated grey water represents a potent alternative water resource as it constitutes a large proportion of household wastewater the objective of this paper was to test a full scale version of a novel compact grey water treatment technology based on passive aeration and particle trapping in multiple layers using a modified dual porosity filtration technology grey water from a public bath was passed through a stack of eight reactors each 0 75 m 0 55 0 22 m serially connected for gravity driven flow from top to bottom in a zig zag pattern the topmost reactor served as pre filter for removal of hair and other larger debris the lower seven reactors facilitated degradation of bulk organic contaminants in biofilm established on a stack of five fibrous polyamide nets and trapping of particles by sedimentation on five interlaid corrugated plastic plates by operating the reactors in a time controlled batch mode the corrugated plates further served to trap air and thus ensure passive aeration of the subsequent batch the production rate was 1 2 m3 d and the hydraulic retention time 2 h at an aerial footprint of 0 4 m2 excluding storage tanks after two weeks of initialization a biofilm had established and the system was monitored for additionally three weeks significantly improved effluent quality was obtained as measured from reductions in turbidity 95 total suspended solids 94 chemical oxygen demand 87 and microbiological parameters 55 98 and from stable level of dissolved oxygen in effluent of 3 5 mg l future optimization includes custom made reactors for maximizing production capacity improved removal of total n and total p and addition of final disinfection graphical abstract image 1 keywords decentralized dual porosity filtration grey water reuse low cost multi layer reactor space efficient 1 introduction global water scarcity has made wastewater reuse a necessity gabarro et al 2013 excluding toilet flush water grey water makes up 65 of domestic wastewater thus representing the largest source for water reuse in households baban et al 2010 eriksson et al 2002 ghaitidak and yadav 2013 gulyas et al 2009 grey water is a reliable source of water due to its daily production santos et al 2012 and compared to sewage water less polluted with only 30 of the organic load and 9 20 of the nutrients pidou et al 2007 and pathogens eriksson et al 2002 friedler 2004 found in sewage wastewater due to various limitations developed treatment technologies are not widespread and subsequently most grey water reuse projects are limited to irrigation of crops that are robust to untreated grey water mandal et al 2011 and toilet flushing industrial cooling and aquifer recharge eriksson et al 2002 friedler and hadari 2006 ghunmi et al 2010 if grey water can be upgraded to high quality water liu et al 2014 grey water reuse purposes may additionally include cleaning operations like floor washing first rinse cycle in laundry machines and dishwashers eriksson et al 2002 galvis et al 2014 vehicle washing fire protection concrete production and wetlands preservation jefferson et al 2004 technologies applied for grey water upgrading include membrane filtration reverse osmosis ro constructed wetlands and rotating bio contactors rbc birks 1998 reported that a medium strength ultra filtration uf membrane grey water treatment system reduced chemical oxygen demand cod biological oxygen demand bod and total organic carbon toc by 74 80 and 83 4 respectively even though the permeate was low in turbidity below 1 ntu and free of suspended solids soluble nutrients like ammonia and phosphate passed through the membrane which may trigger re growth of micro organisms in the storage and transportation system li et al 2009 this problem is exaggerated with microfiltration 0 2 μm which is less energy demanding compared to uf and still eliminates microorganisms but unable to reduce not only dissolved nutrients but also bulk organic matter expressed as bod nolde 2000 another drawback is membrane fouling and its consequences in terms of operation and maintenance limiting their economic viability pidou et al 2007 šostar turk et al 2005 report on a grey water treatment system with ro after uf that reduced bod from 86 mg l to 2 mg l corresponding to 98 removal rate however it should be noted that higher energy consumption of ro technology restricts its widespread application li et al 2009 nolde 2000 in terms of operation and maintenance cost constructed wetland can be regarded as the most environmentally friendly and cost effective technology for grey water treatment de gisi et al 2016 however it requires large space masi et al 2010 and therefore it is not suitable for the urban areas another drawback is volume loss due to evapotranspiration a technology developed specifically for grey water treatment is rbc where bod is reduced by degradation of organic contaminants in biofilm developed on serially connected rotating discs that dip into grey water as it flows through chambers nolde 2000 friedler and hadari 2006 conclude that aerobic biological grey water treatment based on rbc system removes most of the biodegradable organic substances and thus re growth of micro organisms and odor problem are avoided making the system more economically feasible however as pointed out by metcalf and eddy 2014 the rbc system does have drawbacks in terms of rather high electricity consumption for rotating heavy discs and risks of shaft breakage an increase in the electricity bill almost outweighing savings on the water bill and multiple shaft breakages over a period of 10 years caused the shutdown of an otherwise well performing rbc system in copenhagen denmark treating bathroom grey water for subsequent toilet flushing eriksson et al 2009 sørensen 2014 taking the difficulties of separating grey water from total domestic wastewater in large scale centralized sewage systems into account decentralized systems applicable at the single building level e g individual households or shared between a limited number of households public bathhouses and small scale industries may be more straightforward todt et al 2015 locally operated systems have the additional advantage of placing users in control of contaminant sources especially input of organic micro pollutants like xenobiotic organic compounds eriksson et al 2002 a common drawback of decentralized systems is the risk of deficit human skills for operation and maintenance for this reason decentralized grey water treatment systems must be based on simple processes ghunmi et al 2011 ideal treatment technologies would consume little energy be affordable environment friendly require limited space easy to operate and maintain by non professionals and would consistently produce high quality effluent despite variations in influent quality atanasova et al 2017 gross et al 2007 achievement of a lasting effect on water supply would require widespread adoption of decentralized grey water collection treatment and storage systems nolde 2000 sinclair et al 2013 to encourage broader grey water reuse santos et al 2012 the purpose of this study was to advance the development of a novel full scale grey water treatment system based on principles that had already been tested at pilot scale prajapati and jensen 2018 the unit operating processes of the technology are degradation of bulk organic matter in a passively aerated biofilm combined with sedimentation of suspended solids in a shallow layer of stagnant water the idea of using stacked shallow treatment layers with different functions originates from the dual porosity filtration dpf technology developed for treatment of road runoff jensen et al 2011 in the pilot study light grey water was exposed to the atmosphere by use of an open 60 l reactor l 2 m w 0 6 m d 0 05 m filled with a 0 05 m thick fibrous polyamide net to support the emergent biofilm and combined with either full drainage after 60 min or half drainage leaving 2 5 cm depth of water after 30 min both producing 1 4 m3 d of effluent using light grey water from a public bath as influent it was found that passive aeration allowed for full biofilm development over a couple of weeks the half drainage tended to return a faster and better biofilm development but no clear difference in pollutant removal efficiency was observed between the two drainage modes the specific objectives of the upscaling study were to convert the pilot reactor to a space efficient full scale grey water treatment system still based on gravity driven flow passive aeration of biofilm and accumulation of sediment provide proof of removal of bulk contaminants in grey water a batch operated system based on shallow fibrous nets for biofilm support interlaid with corrugated plates for sediment trapping and passive aeration was designed allowing for stacking and thus a space efficient system proof of concept was obtained on a prototype constructed from available market products and tested by using light grey water from a public bathhouse as influent over a five week period physical chemical and microbiological parameters were monitored in influent effluent and at intermediate positions in the system after completion of the flow experiment biofilm development and accumulated sediment was inspected 2 materials and methods 2 1 case site sofiebadet an old public bathhouse in copenhagen served as test case for proof of concept the facility accommodates up to 26 persons at a time and offers showers and baths sauna massage and facial clay masks customers are not allowed to bring any personal products rather towels and all other products soap oil cream masks etc are provided by sofiebadet which purchases organic brands for everything including cleaning agents sofiebadet produces approximately 6 m3 of grey water per day of which 5 m3 originates from customers bathing activities only grey water from the bath area which also included grey water from a once a day bath cleaning was used for the testing according to friedler et al 2008 the influent grey water may be categorized as light grey water 2 2 system design and flow mode to convert the pilot reactor prajapati and jensen 2018 to a full scale grey water treatment system suitable for decentralized small scale applications the key challenge was to significantly enhance the biofilm and sedimentation treatment areas while keeping the system compact still relying on passive aeration and gravity driven flow the resulting design was based on brainstorms and small lab tests an overview of critical parameters considered and their corresponding success criteria are presented in supplementary material i grouped after system operation and maintenance and water quality the suggested system which was built in the basement of sofiebadet is presented in fig 1 the major difference between pilot and full scale versions is that pilot scale contained only a single treatment layer whereas full scale version contained multiple treatment layers thereby increasing the treatment area for the same area foot print and same production rate but returning a more complete treatment and thus better effluent quality further the full scale version contained two technological advances i the reactor in pilot scale was directly exposed to atmospheric air whereas in full scale version atmospheric air was created above each treatment layer in a submersed system and ii a layer for particle trapping in was introduced in each treatment layer in full scale version the system consisted of eight reactors stacked on top of each other to form a tower through which grey water passed by gravity in a zig zag pattern from top to bottom the system may be referred to as a dpf grey water tower the reactors were made from eight 90 l plastic boxes each measuring 0 75 m 0 55 m x 0 22 m resulting in a total height of approximately 2 m including the supporting pallet on the floor the top reactor reactor 1 served as pre filter while the seven subsequent reactors reactor 2 to reactor 8 constituted the heart of the treatment system each of the seven reactors contained five sandwiches made from fibrous polyamide nets 10 mm thick enkamat and 4 mm thick enkadrain interlaid with corrugated plates icopal above and below each component was cut into 0 75 m 0 55 m pieces to fit into the boxes as shown and further described in fig 1 and with a total height of 0 115 m the total area of the biofilm supporting net 7 reactors x 5 sandwiches x 0 75 m 0 55 m was 14 4 m2 as were the areas of corrugated plates for sediment trapping lower plate and aeration upper plate the system was operated in batch flow mode fig 1 top right a spirit level was used to ensure horizontal position of reactors and thus replenishment of air in the upward facing cavities of the upper corrugated plates during drainage and filling of reactors filling and drainage were automated by use of timer controlled valves orkli art 40320200 on the outlet of each reactor as seen in fig 1 the start up of the influent pump was timer controlled while flow was stopped when a water level sensor in reactor 1 measured receipt of 25 l water this ensured a similar mobile water volume in subsequent reactors grey water from bathing area was channeled into a single drain and collected in a 1 5 m3 storage tank excess grey water overflowed directly to the sewage system before entering the dpf grey water tower system grey water flowed through the system as follows grey water was pumped to the inlet of reactor 1 the pre filter after 15 min of residence time the outlet valve opened for another 15 min to drain the pre filter and transfer the first batch of water to reactor 2 the outlet valve of which was closed after another 15 min a new batch of grey water was pumped into the pre filter while at the same time the valve from reactor 2 opened to transfer the first batch to reactor 3 etc as illustrated in fig 1 thus a new batch of water was taken in every 30 min resulting in a total hydraulic residence time of 2 h the timer program settings were based on the time required to drain the treatment reactors supplementary material ii and the residence time from the half drainage experiment in the preliminary study prajapati and jensen 2018 2 3 test a five week test numbered days 1 32 consisting of a two week initialization phase days 1 13 for biofilm development and a three week operation phase days 14 32 for assessment of water quality was conducted effluent flow rate was monitored with a flow meter brunata type 171b optuna w and registered once a day from monday to friday water samples were taken from the inlet influent and the outlet effluent and also from seven intermediate positions fig 1 at frequencies as described in supplementary material iii and following the method in table 1 ph electric conductivity ec redox potential dissolved oxygen do turbidity ammonium nh4 and temperature were measured immediately after sampling samples for analysis of total suspended solids tss total nitrogen tn and total phosphorus tp were stored in a refrigerator and samples to measure cod were stored in a freezer and analyzed after completion of the experiment samples for the three different microbiological analyses were immediately transported in cooler boxes to the department of plant and environmental sciences at the university of copenhagen samples for total bacteria count were preserved with 2 final glutaraldehyde until analysis while samples for heterotrophic bacteria total coliform t coli and escherichia coliform e coli were analyzed immediately after the five week flow experiment the system was dismantled and inspected for biofilm development and sediment accumulation as summarized in table 1 and fully described in supplementary material iii 3 results 3 1 water quality during the 32 days precisely 31 days and 20 h of testing a total volume of 32 34 m3 of light grey water from sofiebadet passed through the dpf grey water tower the corresponding production rate was 1 2 m3 d including daily water samples and water loss during the process of weekly changing of filter nets in reactor 1 the flow was steady throughout the experiment r2 0 9995 thus showing no sign of clogging supplementary material iv reactor 1 performed well as a pre filter it efficiently trapped hair and larger debris in order not to block the inlet the net role was replaced once a week when dismantling the pre filter after completing the experiment accumulated sediment was observed on the corrugated plates sediment in the permanently water saturated part of reactor 1 i e on the lower plates had a dark color and smelled of volatile fatty acids indicating this region to be anaerobic as seen from fig 2 the clarity of grey water improved markedly as it passed through the dpf grey water tower to the naked eye the final effluent was indistinguishable from tap water since this improvement was already visible in the initialization phase that is before biofilm had fully developed sedimentation seems to be the main removal mechanism for suspended particles main proof of concept was obtained by comparing water quality in daily grab samples of influent and effluent for the full five week period ph ec redox do turbidity and tss as measured in grab samples of influent and effluent are presented in fig 3 for the operation phase days 15 32 after a biofilm was assumed to have fully developed cod tn tp total bacteria t coli e coli and heterotrophic bacteria at 21 c and 37 c as measured in influent and effluent samples as well as in effluent from reactor 4 are presented in fig 4 additional measurements of ph ec turbidity and tss in samples of influent and effluent obtained automatically every 4 h with fraction collectors in the operation phase are provided in supplementary material v to reveal the change in water quality from reactor to reactor and thus to gain insight into the contribution of individual reactors boxplots in fig 5 show daily measurements of ph ec redox do and turbidity and tss in influent and effluent from each reactor for tss only from reactor 4 during the operation phase and likewise fig 6 shows measurements for cod tn tp and microbiological parameters for three selected days in the operation phase influent composition fluctuated significantly throughout the five weeks fig s 3 4 5 and 6 which is ascribed to variation in number of bathing guests use of soaps and clay masks as well as the time grey water remained in the storage tank before being sent through the system thus allowing for sedimentation and degradation processes to take place to a varying extent as seen from fig 3 ph remained slightly alkaline in both influent and effluent throughout the experiment varying in a narrow band of 7 6 8 2 and with no trends between individual reactors fig 5 average influent ph was 8 07 0 16 and average effluent ph was 8 09 0 17 alkalinity is ascribed to hydroxide ions from soaps and detergents similarly ec showed no particular development over time but effluent ec was almost always slightly higher than influent ec fig s 3 and 5 indicating enrichments in charged degradation products ions average ec value was 918 152 μs cm for influent and 1063 134 μs cm for effluent regarding do a clear development was observed during the first two weeks effluent do levels mirrored the influent do levels while in the operation phase effluent do stabilized at 3 5 0 5 mg o2 l at an average temperature of 23 c regardless of influent do which averaged 2 5 2 0 mg o2 l fig 3 as seen from fig 5 do in effluent from individual reactors stabilized at distinctly different levels throughout the eight reactors with low and declining levels for reactors 1 and 2 followed by an upward shift in reactor 3 after which increasing levels were seen for each subsequent reactor this suggests that removal of bulk organic contaminants primarily takes place in the upper reactors reactors 2 and 3 where do is consumed via aerobic and possibly anaerobic reactor 3 degradation processes while the lower reactors serve to polish the water and allow for re aeration the pattern for redox potential to a large extent mirrored that of do fig s 3 and 5 it should be noted that the absolute redox readings cannot be trusted since negative values in samples with do should not be possible influent turbidity varied from 17 to 133 fau fig s 3 and 5 in line with the visible improvements fig 2 effluent turbidity was already much improved during the initialization phase and reached levels near zero fau in the operation phase indicating that the treatment process is mainly controlled by gravity driven sedimentation of suspended solids but with some contribution from the biofilm as it develops since the even lower turbidity levels in the operation phase point to degradation of organic macro molecules fig s 3 and 5 similar to turbidity influent tss fluctuated considerably ranging from 7 to 85 mg l fig s 3 and 5 but unlike turbidity tss values in effluent had already reached close to zero during the initialization phase indicating that tss was removed by sedimentation alone on average over the full experimental period influent turbidity was reduced from 61 7 26 0 fau to 3 4 5 3 fau in the effluent corresponding to average removal of 95 while influent tss was reduced from 37 24 mg l to 2 1 mg l in effluent corresponding to average removal of 94 the samples obtained every 4 h with a fraction collector largely confirmed the daily grab samples although it may be noted that these more frequent measurements revealed an even larger span in influent levels of ph ec turbidity and tss supplementary material v average cod in influent in the operation phase was 72 2 51 4 mg l which was reduced to 9 6 3 7 mg l in effluent corresponding to a removal efficiency of 87 the cod removal pattern is by large parallel to the turbidity and tss removal patterns fig s 4 and 6 regarding tn the average influent concentration of 7 02 3 51 mg l was reduced to 4 96 1 74 mg l in effluent corresponding to a removal efficiency of 29 while for tp the average influent concentration of 0 35 0 16 mg l was reduced to 0 14 0 12 mg l in effluent corresponding to a removal efficiency of 58 in both cases clear reductions were observed for only three out of six sampling days days 22 29 and 32 fig 4 and the overall patterns as reflected in effluent from individual reactors fig 6 are also not showing a clear pattern although the assessment may be biased due to rather low influent concentrations of nutrients on several days and although analytical errors or sample contamination especially likely for day 25 samples where tn effluent concentrations exceeded those of reactor 4 effluent and tp effluent exceeded both influent and reactor 4 effluent cannot be excluded the bottom line is that the data does not support an effective tn and tp removal total bacteria count which includes both dead and alive cells was reduced in all samples by an average of 55 and especially on the last two sampling days days 29 and 32 where more than 90 were removed fig 4 it is noted that the level of total bacteria in effluent during these last two days was still high with 4 106 and 2 106 cells ml respectively on average the measured influent concentration of total bacteria during operation phase was 3 5 107 9 x 106 cells ml which was reduced to 2 107 1 107 cells ml in effluent when looking into the group of coliform bacteria t coli and e coli it is seen that their effluent levels were reduced significantly on the days when their levels in influent were elevated most notably on days 22 25 29 and 32 average reduction over all measurements of t coli was from 3 07 104 2 29 104 cells ml in influent to 5 07 102 1 1 x 103 cells ml in effluent which corresponds to 98 removal and for e coli average reduction was from 1 66 102 3 59 102 cells ml in influent to 22 41 cells ml in effluent which corresponds to 87 removal a possible explanation for t coli and e coli levels in reactor 4 exceeding their influent levels on day 22 is scouring of biomass in between reactors 1 and 4 for the broad category of heterotrophic bacteria that can be grown at 21 c and 37 c a clear reduction was observed with average reduction rates of 98 at both temperatures fig 4 on average heterotrophic bacteria at 21 c was reduced from 2 13 106 1 78 106 cells ml in influent to 3 43 104 3 45 104 cells ml in effluent and at 37 c the average reduction was from 2 0 106 1 19 106 cells ml in influent to 3 73 104 3 53 104 cells ml in effluent as with t coli and e coli the heterotrophic bacteria concentration on day 22 was higher in effluent from reactor 4 than in influent which also supports the scouring mechanism explanation the general reduction in microbiological parameters is ascribed to microbial degradation and sedimentation as seen from fig 6 most of the reduction in microbial parameters takes place in the upper reactors which is comparable to the removal patterns for turbidity tss and cod the stability in effluent grey water quality was reflected by the narrow range of standard deviation as compared to influent table 2 the stability was more pronounced in the operation phase than in initializing phase for instance standard deviation of effluent do in initializing phase was 1 54 which narrowed to 0 49 in the operation phase a similar pattern can be seen for turbidity demonstrating the robustness of the system in terms of coping with varying composition of influent grey water to produce stable effluent 3 2 biofilm development and sedimentation post experiment observations of biofilm developed in reactors 2 8 confirmed the treatment profile of the dpf grey water tower as reflected by the differences in biofilm dependent parameters i e do redox turbidity cod and microbiological parameters between individual reactors fig s 5 and 6 as seen in fig 7 a strong gradient in biofilm development was found reactors 2 3 and 4 were fully covered in biofilm with grey slimy deposit reactors 5 and 6 were only slightly covered and reactors 7 and 8 almost resembled clean materials likewise the measurement of dry matter accumulation in individual reactors fig 8 showed that most of the sedimentation took place in the upper reactors as already suggested by the reduction in tss fig 5 additionally the tss mass balance supplementary material vi shows that the biofilm weight decreased gradually from influent to effluent through the longitudinal axis of the tower an observation that is also in line with the biomass deposited in rbc baban et al 2010 4 discussion 4 1 system assessment by adopting the dpf treatment concept of gravity driven flow through shallow treatment sandwiches jensen et al 2011 the dpf grey water tower provides a system without mechanically moving parts this reduces the risk of the kind of breakdowns observed in rbc systems metcalf and eddy 2014 sørensen 2014 and minimizes energy consumption energy is needed only for one time pumping of grey water to the inlet of reactor 1 and for opening and closing the valves further the upper corrugated plates with pockets facing upward trap air inside individual sandwiches thus giving birth to a space efficient passive aeration system this system is superior to constructed wetlands which are similarly environment friendly and cost effective but space inefficient de gisi et al 2016 masi et al 2010 in principle the dpf grey water tower allows for unlimited stacking of the biofilm laboratory measurements show that 4 025 l of air was trapped per reactor corresponding to air storage of 0 31 l m2 of sandwich supplementary material vii another novelty is the provision of space for accumulation of particulate matter over large areas in the downward facing corrugated plates allowing this fraction to have a long residence time compared to other systems e g rbc where sediment in flow through chambers requires frequent removal sørensen 2014 and thus improved conditions for degradation over multiple cycles multiple treatment layers within each reactor and the ability of stacking the reactors vertically enhanced the space efficiency of the dpf grey water tower 14 4 m2 of biofilm and 14 4 m2 of sediment accumulation area were created on only 0 42 m2 of floor area foot print and 0 75 m3 in terms of volume the suggested dpf grey water tower treatment process was based on aerobic degradation of easily degradable organic matter in biofilm and sedimentation of particles and thus not relying on addition of chemicals 4 2 optimization and perspectives overall the measured parameters confirm the improvement in water quality when passing through the eight reactors in the dpf grey water tower while turbidity and tss in effluent from reactor 7 were not much different from final effluent this was not the case for do where reactor 8 increased the do level markedly fig 5 reactor 8 was also seen to contribute to the reduction of cod and microbial parameters fig 6 the almost clean materials observed post experimentally in reactors 7 and 8 confirm that these two final reactors mainly served to polish the water in terms of do cod and microbial parameters a question is whether more efficient polishing could be obtained by replacing the net sandwiches in reactor 8 with a classical filtration through a filter substrate an initialization period of two weeks seems adequate in that the levels of biofilm dependent parameters like do turbidity and cod in the operation phase showed a clear shift in effluent towards steady levels irrespective of influent concentration compared to turbidity and tss cod was less reduced 95 and 94 versus 87 suggesting the remaining cod to be slowly non biodegradable organic matters in a dissolved form abu ghunmi et al 2011 as also stated in studies by eriksson et al 2009 friedler et al 2006 to prevent microbial re growth in the effluent storage tank eriksson et al 2009 extra treatment for improved removal of nutrients is needed the average reduction of ammonium nh4 from influent to effluent supplementary material viii suggests nitrification did take place pointing to denitrification as being missing this could be confirmed by measuring the separate nitrogen species no2 and no3 in a study on grey water treatment using a sequencing batch reactor lamine et al 2007 show that hydraulic retention time hrt can significantly affect the nitrification rate with reductions in nh4 from 6 7 mg l to 6 2 mg l at hrt 0 6 days but to 0 3 mg l at hrt 2 5 days in this system hrt was only 2 h 0 08 days which suggests the need for further studies on the relation between tn removal and hrt removal of tp which is likely to be present as inorganic phosphate may be obtained by adding a sorption step e g iron oxide coated sand loganathan et al 2014 compared to tn and tp values compiled in the review by de gisi et al 2016 and as observed in a study by atanasova et al 2017 the effluent concentration levels observed in this study are similar pointing to a general problem of nutrients removal to assess the potential of grey water reuse after treatment in dpf grey water tower the effluent quality measures obtained were compared with epa 2004 who 2006 and review of guidelines done by li et al 2009 pidou et al 2007 for different countries the values for ph 6 9 turbidity 2 20 and tss 3 30 fall within the guideline limits for toilet flushing irrigation and washing purposes however the effluent quality threshold for tn 15 and tp 0 5 as well as t coli 2 2 100 cfu ml and e coli 2 100 cfu ml were exceeded despite marked reductions in microbial parameters a separate disinfection unit mounted after an effluent storage tank is required for safe reuse of water for highest non potable reuse purposes i e personal hygiene as the effluent from dpf grey water tower had turbidity less than 5 fau fig 5 uv treatment is expected to be effective the risk that biomass flocks might be scoured and then escape through the final reactor also points to replacement of reactor 8 with classical filtration the dpf grey water tower treatment capacity can be optimized with custom made materials which would allow for full exploitation of box volume resulting in larger batches and for enhanced air trapping and sediment accumulation volumes longer operation periods are needed to observe the further development of biofilm into lower reactors as well as risk of scouring and to provide an operation and maintenance management scheme compared to ro which has removal efficiency of 100 for tss and 98 for cod ramona et al 2004 the dpf grey water tower falls behind a combination with pre treatment in dpf grey water tower followed by ro may however be advantageous in terms of reduction in ro membrane fouling and thus energy consumption compared to a rbc system preceded by sedimentation and followed by uv which has a removal efficiency of 84 for tss abdel kader 2013 the dpf grey water tower can match in terms of water quality this is also the case when compared to a rbc system preceded by screening followed by sand filter and chlorination which has removal efficiency of 82 for tss and 75 for cod travis et al 2010 the dpf grey water tower has additional advantages with no rotating parts and less energy consumption compared to constructed wetlands which has removal efficiency of 89 8 for tss and 82 for cod in one study travis et al 2010 and 98 for tss and 81 for cod in another study gross et al 2007 the dpf grey water tower can also match and has an additional advantage of better aerial footprint and no water loss during treatment 5 conclusions the suggested dpf grey water tower can turn light grey water into water that is clear and largely free of bulk contaminants and with a marked reduction in microbial parameters all in all suggesting the water to be reused for high level purposes including personal hygiene provided a final disinfection step is added and demonstrates as such the potential for decentralized low cost space efficient indoor solutions this study has shown that passive aeration of submersed biofilm is possible thus allowing for a space efficient treatment system by stacking of biofilm layers and adoption of batch operated flow with no moving parts the risk of mechanical breakdown is practically eliminated and so is the system complexity so laypersons can operate and maintain the system with gravity driven flow energy consumption is limited to pumping grey water into the upper reactor and opening and closing of valves the multi layer sandwich construction of filter material further reduces the risk of clogging as sediment is accumulated in a different layer from where water is flowing allowing for long term degradation of multiple cycles the dpf grey water tower needs further development before its use can be promoted on a large scale including adequate removal of tn and tp the addition of a final disinfection step

18687,in this study we examined eight typical and widely detected pharmaceuticals phas removal in an anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge system five antibiotics sulfadiazine sd sulfamethoxazole smx trimethoprim tmp ciprofloxacin cip and enoxacin eno and three nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids ibuprofen ibu ketoprofen ket and diclofenac dic the results showed that the srb sludge had the higher removal efficacy 20 to 90 for antibiotics sd smx tmp cip and eno than nsaids 20 via adsorption and biodegradation under different operating conditions based on a series of batch studies fluoroquinolone antibiotics cip and eno were instantly 15 min removed 98 via adsorption on srb sludge with adsorption coefficient kd as high as 25 3 1 8 l g suspended solids ss and thermodynamics results indicated that the adsorption of cip and eno on srb sludge was spontaneous gibbs free energy change δg 0 kj mol exothermic enthalpy change δh 0 kj mol and the adsorption process involved both physisorption and chemisorption absolute value of δh 20 to 80 kj mol three widely prescribed antibiotics smx tmp and cip were further investigated for their possible biodegradation pathways along with functional enzymes involved through a series of batch experiments the biotransformation intermediates indicated that biotransformations of smx and cip in srb sludge system could be initiated from the cleavage of isoxazole and piperazinyl rings catalyzed by sulfite reductase sr and cytochrome p450 cyp450 enzymes respectively tmp was likely biotransformed via o demethylation and n acetylation coupled with hydroxylation reactions with cyp450 enzymes as the main functional enzymes this study provided new insight into phas removal in srb sludge system and has significant potential of implementing sulfur mediated biological process for the treatment of phas containing wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate reducing bacteria srb pharmaceuticals removal biotransformation adsorption sulfate reduction 1 introduction pharmaceuticals phas mainly antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are extensively used by humans and for animal production wilkinson et al 2016 ben et al 2018 only a small fraction of the consumed administered phas is being metabolized by humans and animals and a large fraction 50 to 90 of phas is being excreted via urine and feces daughton and ternes 1999 kümmerer 2009b as a result phas as the emerging micro pollutants have been frequently detected in the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment

groundwater up to 78 3 ng l hu et al 2010 and drinking water up to 269 ng l zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 these antibiotic compounds and nsaids may potentially pose serious risk to human and animal health through chronic ecotoxicity and propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and genes args in the environment daughton and ternes 1999 fent et al 2006 kümmerer 2009a zhang et al 2015 one of the major sources of phas entering into the environment is the effluent of wwtps luo et al 2014 conventional activated sludge process is widely used for municipal wastewater treatment however the process is less effective in the removal of phas vieno et al 2007 moreover the process is highly energy intensive and generates large amount of biological sludge vieno et al 2007 similarly anaerobic methanogenic process also showed poor removal of phas joss et al 2004 huang et al 2008 thus there is a need to explore an energy efficient biological process for the effective removal of phas recently such biological process integrating sulfur carbon nitrogen and phosphorous removal has drawn significant research attention lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 the use of sulfate reducing bacteria srb presents an opportunity for the treatment of sulfur laden industrial and municipal wastewaters lu et al 2012 hao et al 2014 for example sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process is undergoing full scale demonstration in hong kong for saline sewage treatment wu et al 2016 flue gas desulfurization sani fgd sani jiang et al 2013 and denitrifying sulfur assisted enhanced biological phosphorous removal ds ebpr wu et al 2014 are some of other examples of srb mediated wastewater treatment processes recently srb sludge system has also been examined to treat sulfate laden pharmaceutical wastewater chelliapan and sallis 2015 and synthetic wastewater containing high concentrations of sulfamethoxazole smx and ciprofloxacin cip our previous studies showed that smx and cip could be effectively removed by srb sludge specific removal rates of 15 2 μg g suspended solids ss d at smx concentration of 100 μg l and 637 3 7 6 μg g ss d at cip concentration of 5 000 μg l jia et al 2017 2018 these studies clearly highlight the potential of srb based biological process for phas removal there are however very limited studies on phas removal by srb sludge system moreover to the best of our knowledge no studies have examined the removal mechanisms of phas in srb sludge system including the adsorption behavior kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics and the biodegradation kinetics functional enzymes involved and the pathways the overarching goal of this study was to investigate phas removal efficiency and their removal mechanisms in srb sludge system eight typical phas were selected as the target pollutants including two sulfonamide sa antibiotics sulfadiazine sd and smx two fluoroquinolone fq antibiotics cip and enoxacin eno one sa synergist trimethoprim tmp and three nsaids ibuprofen ibu ketoprofen ket and diclofenac dic removal of these phas in the srb sludge system was examined using four sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb bioreactors operating up to 300 days under different operating conditions the phas removal mechanisms via adsorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics and biodegradation kinetics intermediates and possible pathways catalyzed by functional enzymes by srb sludge system were further investigated through a series of batch experiments this study provided better understanding of phas removal in srb sludge system and opens up the potential of sulfur mediated biological process for the treatment of phas containing wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor set up and operation four lab scale sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb bioreactors namely r1 r2 r3 and r4 were fabricated using acrylic see fig s1 in supplementary information si for details and were continuously operated under different operating conditions see table s2 in si the bioreactors were fed with the synthetic wastewater see table s3 in si for composition the seed sludge enriched with srb no phas were detected in the sludge based on microbial community analysis as shown in fig s2 in si was collected from the anaerobic bioreactor of the sani process operating in our laboratory for over four years the average concentration of volatile suspended solids vss and the solids retention time srt in each srusb bioreactor were maintained at about 6 1 0 8 g l and 25 days jia et al 2018 respectively by regular withdrawal of sludge the vss ss ratio in each bioreactor was about 0 68 0 07 the influent and effluent samples from each srusb bioreactor were collected daily and analyzed for sulfate thiosulfate sulfite and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations as per the standard methods apha 2005 dissolved sulfide was measured with the methylene blue method apha 2005 the phas in aqueous phase influent and effluent were collected and determined daily by an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc with a diode array detector dad uplc dionex ultimate 3000 ca usa more details are given in pages s11 s12 in si the srb sludge samples were collected once a week from each bioreactor and analyzed for phas content in sludge following the protocol described elsewhere jia et al 2018 see pages s11 s12 in si for details the phas removal efficiency and specific removal rate were determined as per jia et al 2018 see pages s4 s5 in si for more details 2 2 batch experiments to investigate the removal mechanisms of phas by srb sludge system a series of batch tests were conducted using serum bottles with working volume of 500 ml see fig s3 in si the srb sludge used in the batch experiments was taken from the bioreactor r1 after 300 days of continuous operation and then washed three time using synthetic wastewater containing no phas see table s3 in si until no residual phas were detected in the srb sludge 2 2 1 phas removal by srb sludge the phas removal by srb sludge was also examined in a series of batch experiments and were classified into three groups see table s4 in si for detailed experimental plan group i designated as control without srb sludge was conducted for 5 days to examine the possible hydrolysis of phas in group ii 0 1 sodium azide nan3 was added to inhibit the microbial activity figs s4 and s5 in si to examine the adsorption of phas by inactivated srb sludge and the adsorption experiment was conducted for 24 hrs in group iii the batch experiment was conducted for 5 days to investigate the biodegradation of phas by a well acclimated srb sludge obtained from the srusb bioreactor each serum bottle containing 1 5 g ss l of srb sludge was wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation and purged with nitrogen gas 99 9 purity for 30 min to establish anaerobic condition and was then tightly sealed before the start of the experiment the batch experiments were conducted at an initial ph of 7 0 and continuous mixing at 200 rpm using magnetic stirring plates ika rct germany at room temperature 25 1 c the batch experiments of each group were conducted in three replicates to investigate the removal mechanism of each pharmaceutical in srb sludge system only one pharmaceutical was added into each serum bottle in the batch test and all eight phas were tested individually in each group two different ranges of phas concentrations were used in each group 1 for sd smx tmp dic ibu and ket concentrations of 25 50 100 150 and 200 μg l were used as these phas were widely detected in the concentration range of 1 to 221 μg l in wastewaters segura et al 2009 madikizela and chimuka 2017 yang et al 2017 and 2 for cip and eno higher concentrations of 100 300 500 1 000 3 000 and 5 000 μg l were used as these phas are quickly adsorbed within 15 min by biological sludge with adsorption capacity as high as 1 000 μg g ss polesel et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the samples uniformly mixed from each serum bottle were taken regularly for analyzing phas concentrations in aqueous phase and in solid phase srb sludge to determine the removal efficiencies and specific removal rates of eight target phas see pages s4 s5 in si moreover the adsorption kinetics of phas by srb sludge were investigated using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption models eqs 8 and 9 respectively in si and zero first and second order biodegradation models eqs 10 11 and 12 respectively in si were used to investigate the biodegradation kinetics and half lives of phas in srb sludge system 2 2 2 cip and eno adsorption thermodynamics based on our previous study on cip adsorption zhang et al 2018 and the results of our batch experiments on phas removal in this study group ii srb sludge had significantly higher adsorption capacity for cip and eno as discussed in section 3 2 compared to six other phas in order to gain insight into the adsorption mechanisms of the two above stated phas by srb sludge adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics of cip and eno were separately examined in a series of batch experiments competition between cip and eno for the adsorption sites on srb sludge was not considered in this study 1 the first set of experiment consisting of total of six cip concentrations 100 300 500 1 000 3 000 and 5 000 μg l was used to examine the adsorption behavior at different temperatures 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 c for each concentration and 2 the second set of experiment followed the same experimental design as the first set except that the cip was replaced with eno both sets of experiment followed the same procedure as that of group ii batch test for phas removal by srb sludge and each test was conducted in three replicates three adsorption isotherms namely henry equivalent to linear freundlich and langmuir were employed to evaluate cip and eno adsorption behavior and capacity of srb sludge the details of fitting methods are given in pages s8 s9 in si the thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy change δgo enthalpy change δho and entropy change δso which quantify the feasibility and nature of the adsorption process were calculated as per the methods described in wang et al 2017 details are given in pages s9 s10 in si 2 2 3 enzyme inhibition tests three widely prescribed phas i e smx tmp and cip were selected as the target compounds to examine the possible role of enzymes in their biodegradation in srb sludge system the enzymes such as cytochrome p450 cyp450 adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase apsr and sulfite reductase sr are commonly present as key functional enzymes in srb sludge and could play an important role in phas biodegradation jia et al 2018 prieto et al 2011 campanini et al 2015 rückert 2016 thus the inhibitors against these three enzymes were used to examine the roles these enzymes played in biodegradation of smx tmp and cip in srb sludge system through four sets of enzyme inhibition batch tests see pages s10 s11 and table s5 in si for detail experimental plan each batch test was conducted in three replicates 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out to examine the significant difference statistically between results multiple comparisons were based on one way analysis of variance anova in spss 16 0 ibm ny usa least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test was used for comparisons between treatment means the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of phas were the concentrations with signal to noise ratios of 3 and 10 respectively more details are given in pages s11 s12 and table s6 in si the solid phase extraction method used for the extraction of phas from the srb sludge was verified with the recovery 85 and with a good reproducibility relative standard deviation of 3 n 3 the method used for phas analysis in aqueous phase via uplc had a recovery 95 and the reproducibility was well within the relative standard deviation of 2 n 3 see table s6 in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 phas removal in srusb bioreactors four bench scale srusb bioreactors r1 r2 r3 and r4 were operated in parallel for up to 300 days under different operating conditions to examine phas removal by srb sludge systems and the influence of these operating conditions on phas removal see table s2 in si for experimental plan and table s7 and fig s6 in si for more discussion on results all bioreactors achieved average cod removal efficiency of 80 about 60 of the influent sulfate was reduced into dissolved sulfide and no sulfur intermediates e g sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were detected in the effluent of bioreactors the performance of four bioreactors is summarized in table s7 in si in order to examine the effect of phas on the microbial communities of srb sludge in four bioreactors the microbial communities in srb sludge samples from the four bioreactors and the seed sludge were characterized the microbial communities at phylum and genus levels are shown in fig s2 in si it is apparent that the relative abundance of srb especially desulfobacter in srb sludge samples of four bioreactors 24 8 to 27 1 after a long term exposure to phas did not significantly decrease compared to seed sludge 24 1 p 0 05 indicating that srb especially desulfobacter in srusb bioreactors showed high tolerance to phas during the long term operation this finding was in agreement with our previous study jia et al 2018 the removal efficiencies and specific removal rates of phas with stepwise increase in influent phas concentrations from 25 to 1 000 μg l were obtained from bioreactor r1 as shown in fig 1 note phas removal in bioreactors r2 r3 and r4 are presented in table s8 and fig s6 in si the specific removal rates of all eight phas increased significantly with increasing influent phas concentrations from 25 to 1 000 μg l the performance of bioreactor r1 in terms of phas removal was categorized into three groups depending on the removal efficiency for the first group over 50 of the influent cip and eno fq antibiotics was removed primarily due to high adsorption capacity of srb sludge for these antibiotics jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and this was further substantiated through a series of batch experiments as shown in fig 2 in the second group sd smx sa antibiotics and tmp removals were 20 to 40 in srb sludge system at different phas concentrations 25 to 1 000 μg l and the specific removal rates of smx and tmp were 6 09 0 7 μg g ss d and 9 42 0 4 μg g ss d respectively at the same initial concentration of 50 μg l hrt of 6 hrs temperature of 25 1 c and ss concentration of 9 0 0 7 g l alvarino et al 2016b investigated smx and tmp removal in aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludge systems using aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr and up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb bioreactor respectively at an initial concentration of 40 μg l for both smx and tmp the specific removal rates of smx and tmp were 3 07 and 2 69 μg g ss d respectively in aerobic mbr operating at hrt of 5 hrs and ss concentration of 5 to 7 g l whereas the specific removal rates of smx and tmp in uasb bioreactor operating at hrt of 12 hrs and ss concentration of 30 g l were 2 45 and 2 08 μg g ss d respectively alvarino et al 2016b the results apparently showed that the specific removal rates of smx and tmp in srb sludge system were much higher than those reported in aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludge systems under similar influent phas concentration ranges 40 to 50 μg l the specific removal rate of sd was 17 6 1 1 μg g ss d in the srb sludge system at initial concentration of 100 μg l which was higher than that in aerobic sludge system 12 9 μg g ss d at the same initial concentration of 100 μg l li and zhang 2010 however there is lack of study on sd removal in anaerobic sludge system the last group showed significantly low removal 20 of three nsaids dic ibu and ket by srb sludge similar findings were also reported by carballa et al 2007 and alvarino et al 2014 in which both ibu and ket removals were very low under anaerobic methanogenic condition several other studies also reported poor removal adsorption biodegradation of dic under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions carballa et al 2007 suarez et al 2010 alvarino et al 2014 thus srb sludge appears to be more effective in the removal of antibiotics i e sd smx tmp cip and eno than aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges however studies on their removal mechanisms by srb sludge are very limited here we conducted a series of batch experiments to gain an insight into the underlying removal mechanisms via adsorption and biodegradation of antibiotics by srb sludge as discussed in the following section 3 2 phas adsorption by srb sludge 3 2 1 phas adsorption behavior and kinetics by srb sludge a series of batch tests were conducted to investigate the adsorption behavior and coefficient kd of phas by inactivated srb sludge as described in section 2 2 see table s4 in si for details as shown in fig 2 the srb sludge had much lower adsorption efficiency 15 and much longer adsorption equilibrium time 12 hrs for sa antibiotics sd and smx tmp and nsaids dic ibu and ket compared to fq antibiotics cip and eno the adsorption coefficients kd calculated using eq 7 in page s6 in si of sa antibiotics sd and smx tmp and nsaids dic ibu and ket were all below 0 5 l g ss indicating a limited contribution of adsorption on their removal by srb sludge system similar findings were also reported for smx sd and tmp adsorption by aerobic sludge li and zhang 2010 and anaerobic methanogenic sludge alvarino et al 2014 2016b nearly no adsorption of nsaids dic ibu and ket was observed in aerobic activated sludge alvarino et al 2014 and anaerobic methanogenic sludge alvarino et al 2014 2016b the fq antibiotics cip and eno however had significantly different adsorption behavior in srb sludge system compared to six other phas fig 2 i e they were instantly adsorbed by srb sludge and achieved the adsorption equilibrium within 15 min with removal efficiency as high as 98 even though fq antibiotics cip and eno showed similar adsorption behavior in aerobic anoxic and anaerobic methanogenic sludge systems li and zhang 2010 zhou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 the adsorption coefficients kd of fq antibiotics cip and eno in aerobic kd 0 4 to 22 6 l g ss li and zhang 2010 zhou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 anoxic kd 0 4 to 2 1 l g ss zhou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 and anaerobic methanogenic kd 0 7 to 14 7 l g ss li and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2018 sludges were lower than those in the srb sludge kd 25 3 1 8 l g ss this further suggests that srb sludge had higher adsorption capacity for fq antibiotics cip and eno compared to aerobic anoxic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges our previous study also showed that srb sludge had higher adsorption capacity for cip than those of aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges zhang et al 2018 this could be attributed to speciation of the fq antibiotics and changes in sludge properties under different experimental conditions which may have affected the electrostatic interaction between fq antibiotics and sludges such as cation exchange ion bridging surface complexation ion dipole and hydrogen bonding conkle et al 2010 polesel et al 2015 the adsorption kinetics of eight phas were evaluated individually using pseudo first order and pseudo second order models see pages s6 s7 in si for more details the pseudo second order model provided a better fit for adsorption of all phas correlation coefficient r 2 0 96 than the pseudo first order model the equilibrium adsorption amounts q e calculated using pseudo second order model were close to the experimental values with relative error 5 see table s9 in si the pseudo second order adsorption rate constants k2 of cip 1 24 0 23 g ss μg cip hr and eno 1 73 0 11 g ss μg eno hr were significantly higher than those of other phas at the same initial concentration of 100 μg l p 0 05 see table s9 in si suggesting the unique adsorption mechanisms of fq antibiotics by srb sludge to further gain an insight into the adsorption mechanisms of cip and eno by srb sludge their adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics analyses were further carried out as discussed in the following section 3 2 2 cip and eno adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics by srb sludge three adsorption isotherms henry equivalent to linear freundlich and langmuir were examined for cip and eno adsorption in a series of batch experiments at temperatures of 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 c the adsorption of cip and eno by srb sludge conformed well to henry and freundlich isotherms correlation coefficients r 2 0 98 compared to langmuir isotherm the correlation coefficients of henry and freundlich isotherms were significantly higher p 0 05 than those of langmuir isotherm at all temperatures see table s10 in si the nonlinearity indexes n values from the freundlich isotherm were close to 1 0 0 82 to 0 90 table s10 in si indicating the linear adsorption between cip eno and srb sludge yang et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 also reported similar findings for cip adsorption by aerobic anoxic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges the thermodynamic analyses of cip eno adsorption by srb sludge were further conducted based on the henry adsorption coefficient kh since the cip eno adsorption by srb sludge conformed well to the linear adsorption behavior according to henry and freundlich isotherms at different temperatures see fig 3 table s11 and pages s9 s10 in si the negative gibbs free energy δg and enthalpy δh changes indicate that adsorption of cip and eno onto srb sludge was a spontaneous and an exothermic process respectively zhou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 the absolute value of δh distinguishes between physisorption in the range of 0 to 20 kj mol and chemisorption in the range of 80 to 400 kj mol weber and digiano 1996 doğan and alkan 2003 zhang et al 2014 the absolute values of enthalpy change of cip δh 48 kj mol and eno δh 52 kj mol adsorption by srb sludge in this study were within the range of 20 to 80 kj mol indicating that both physisorption and chemisorption contributed to adsorption of cip and eno onto srb sludge xu et al 2008 3 3 phas biodegradation by srb sludge 3 3 1 phas biodegradation behavior and kinetics in srb sludge system besides adsorption biodegradation also plays an important role on phas removal during biological wastewater treatment process alvarino et al 2018 biodegradation is a process that involves the breakdown of complex organic compounds including phas either through biotransformation resulting in formation of different intermediates achermann et al 2018 reis et al 2018 or through complete mineralization to co2 and or h2o by pure or mixed microbial culture bouju et al 2012 alvarino et al 2016a the biodegradation behavior and coefficient kbio of eight target phas in srb sludge system were investigated as shown in fig 4 compared to five antibiotics sd smx tmp cip and eno the three nsaids dic ibu and ket were poorly degraded biodegradation efficiency 15 and biodegradation coefficient kbio 0 03 l g vss d in srb sludge system about 20 of the fq antibiotics cip and eno was biodegraded by srb sludge with kbio of 0 08 l g vss d the sa antibiotics sd and smx showed higher biodegradation with efficiency over 40 and biodegradation coefficients kbio as high as 0 14 0 03 and 0 19 0 06 l g vss d respectively which were higher than those 0 05 to 0 12 and 0 08 to 0 17 l g vss d for sd and smx respectively in aerobic sludge system li and zhang 2010 several studies reported low biodegradability of tmp in aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges pérez et al 2005 li and zhang 2010 suarez et al 2010 lm et al 2016 however tmp was effectively biodegraded by anaerobic srb sludge with biodegradation efficiency and coefficient as high as 42 5 0 9 and 0 12 0 03 l g vss d respectively fig 4 in order to further substantiate that the high biodegradation efficiency of tmp by srb sludge was associated with the functional enzymes present in the srb sludge system a series of batch experiments the detail experimental plans are given in section 2 2 and table s5 in si were conducted and findings are discussed in the following section moreover the biodegradation rates of eight phas were also evaluated using three kinetic models see pages s7 s8 in si for more details the biodegradation processes of all phas were well correlated with the first order kinetic model with correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 88 to 0 99 see table s12 in si the biodegradation rate constants k1 of three nsaids dic ibu and ket were below 0 03 1 d at 100 μg l and their half lives t1 2 calculated using eqs 13 14 and 15 in si were more than 20 d the half lives increased significantly p 0 05 with increasing phas concentrations interestingly fq antibiotics cip and eno had the similar biodegradation rate constants k1 and half lives t1 2 with nsaids at 100 μg l but the k1 of cip and eno increased significantly p 0 05 with increasing cip and eno concentrations the k1 and t1 2 of sd and smx were around 0 15 1 d and 5 d respectively at 100 μg l and they did not vary significantly p 0 05 with increasing sd and smx concentrations the k1 and t1 2 of tmp were 0 05 1 d and 7 15 d respectively at 100 μg l and k1 decreased with increasing tmp concentration 3 3 2 functional enzymes and pathways of phas biodegradation by srb sludge three typical antibiotics i e sa antibiotic smx fq antibiotic cip and sa synergist tmp were selected to identify the functional enzymes involved in biotransformation pathways by srb sludge through a series of batch experiments three enzymes i e cytochrome p450 cyp450 adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase apsr and sulfite reductase sr are commonly present as key functional enzymes in the srb sludge and possibly play important roles in antibiotics biotransformation prieto et al 2011 campanini et al 2015 rückert 2016 jia et al 2018 thus three enzyme inhibitors i e 1 aminobenzotriazole inhibiting cyp450 enzymes prieto et al 2011 na2so3 inhibiting apsr minocha et al 2008 and fe iii inhibiting sr yin et al 2002 were used to identify the roles of three enzymes in biodegradation of smx cip and tmp by srb sludge see table s5 in si for details of the enzyme inhibition batch tests as shown in fig 5 the biodegradation of smx and cip was significantly p 0 05 inhibited in the presence of cyp450 enzymes and sr inhibitors compared to control without enzyme inhibitors indicating that both cyp450 enzymes and sr played an important role in biodegradation of smx and cip in srb sludge system contrary to smx and cip only cyp450 enzymes played an important role in the biodegradation of tmp in srb sludge and apsr did not involve in the biodegradation of smx cip and tmp fig 5 several studies reported that cyp450 enzymes catalyzed phas biotransformation via oxidation reduction hydroxylation ipso substitution reactions meunier et al 2004 ji et al 2018 and through cleavage of piperazinyl ring prieto et al 2011 the biotransformation products and possible pathways of smx cip and tmp were further investigated to better understand the catalytic functions of cyp450 enzymes and sr in their role in smx cip and tmp biotransformations in srb sludge system as discussed below the biotransformation products bps of smx cip and tmp in srb sludge system were analyzed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc qtof ms ms see pages s12 s13 in si for more details and table s13 in si for ms ms fragments and molecular structures of intermediates smx was possibly biotransformed in srb sludge system through three pathways which could be catalyzed by sr and cyp450 enzymes with five intermediates i e smx bp1 bp5 as shown in fig 6 smx biotransformation was initiated from the isoxazole ring cleavage in the n o bond via hydrogenation pathways a and b the biotransformation of isoxazole ring in reducing environment e g anaerobic sulfate reduction could be catalyzed by nadh dependent reductases such as sr in this study eschenbrenner et al 1995 zhang et al 2008 askenasy et al 2018 the hydroxylation in the isoxazole ring of smx was detected as shown in pathway c which could be catalyzed by cyp450 enzymes meunier et al 2004 shaik et al 2005 these results were consistent with that of the results of the enzyme inhibition batch tests as shown in fig 5 cip could be biotransformed via four pathways into six intermediates as shown in fig 6 in pathway a cip biotransformation was initiated from the cleavage of piperazinyl ring cip bp1 followed by the formation of cip bp2 by removing c2h5n fragment prieto et al 2011 in pathway b cip was transformed to cip bp3 via hydroxylation at c 8 position and cip bp3 was transformed to cip bp4 via hydroxylation at c 7 position with cyp450 enzymes as the main functional enzymes meunier et al 2004 shaik et al 2005 prieto et al 2011 in pathways c and d cip bp5 and cip bp6 respectively were produced through ipso substitution reactions at c 3 and c 6 positions of cip which could be attributed to catalytic function of cyp450 enzymes in the srb sludge shaik et al 2005 ricken et al 2015 ji et al 2018 tmp biotransformation by srb sludge was mainly catalyzed by cyp450 enzymes and produced total of six intermediates through three pathways via hydroxylation n acetylation and o demethylation meunier et al 2004 shaik et al 2005 in pathway a loss of ch3 groups at c 3 and c 4 positions of tmp coupled with hydroxylation resulted in the formation of intermediates tmp bp1 3 oh tmp tmp bp2 4 oh tmp and tmp bp3 in pathway b tmp was biotransformed in srb sludge by losing ch3 and nh3 groups at c 3 and n 4 positions respectively then n acetylation at n 2 position with production of tmp bp4 tmp was also biotransformed by losing ch3 group at c 3 position then n acetylation at n 4 position with production of tmp bp5 in pathway b moreover tmp could also be biotransformed into intermediate tmp bp6 though o demethylation at c 5 position and hydroxylation at c 3 and c 4 positions in pathway c which were mainly catalyzed by cyp450 enzymes meunier et al 2004 shaik et al 2005 all these pathways of tmp biotransformation in srb sludge system were catalyzed by cyp450 enzymes which further confirmed the results of the enzyme inhibition batch tests see fig 5 4 conclusions occurrence and fate of phas mainly antibiotics and nsaids in environment especially wwtps has become significant concerns in recent years recently srb sludge system has attracted attention due to their higher tolerance and better removal efficacy for several antibiotics than aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges this study evaluated eight typical phas removal in srb sludge system via a long term operation of bioreactors along with a series of batch experiments five antibiotics including sa antibiotics smx and sd fq antibiotics cip and eno and tmp were effectively removed compared to nsaids dic ibu and ket srb sludge showed higher adsorption capacity for fq antibiotics cip and eno than the six other phas and the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic involving both physisorption and chemisorption smx cip and tmp biodegradation mainly occurred via the cleavage of isoxazole and piperazinyl rings hydroxylation ipso substitution o demethylation and n acetylation reactions catalyzed by main functional enzymes i e cyp450 enzymes and sr this study for the first time provided a

18687,in this study we examined eight typical and widely detected pharmaceuticals phas removal in an anaerobic sulfate reducing bacteria srb sludge system five antibiotics sulfadiazine sd sulfamethoxazole smx trimethoprim tmp ciprofloxacin cip and enoxacin eno and three nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids ibuprofen ibu ketoprofen ket and diclofenac dic the results showed that the srb sludge had the higher removal efficacy 20 to 90 for antibiotics sd smx tmp cip and eno than nsaids 20 via adsorption and biodegradation under different operating conditions based on a series of batch studies fluoroquinolone antibiotics cip and eno were instantly 15 min removed 98 via adsorption on srb sludge with adsorption coefficient kd as high as 25 3 1 8 l g suspended solids ss and thermodynamics results indicated that the adsorption of cip and eno on srb sludge was spontaneous gibbs free energy change δg 0 kj mol exothermic enthalpy change δh 0 kj mol and the adsorption process involved both physisorption and chemisorption absolute value of δh 20 to 80 kj mol three widely prescribed antibiotics smx tmp and cip were further investigated for their possible biodegradation pathways along with functional enzymes involved through a series of batch experiments the biotransformation intermediates indicated that biotransformations of smx and cip in srb sludge system could be initiated from the cleavage of isoxazole and piperazinyl rings catalyzed by sulfite reductase sr and cytochrome p450 cyp450 enzymes respectively tmp was likely biotransformed via o demethylation and n acetylation coupled with hydroxylation reactions with cyp450 enzymes as the main functional enzymes this study provided new insight into phas removal in srb sludge system and has significant potential of implementing sulfur mediated biological process for the treatment of phas containing wastewater graphical abstract image 1 keywords sulfate reducing bacteria srb pharmaceuticals removal biotransformation adsorption sulfate reduction 1 introduction pharmaceuticals phas mainly antibiotics and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids are extensively used by humans and for animal production wilkinson et al 2016 ben et al 2018 only a small fraction of the consumed administered phas is being metabolized by humans and animals and a large fraction 50 to 90 of phas is being excreted via urine and feces daughton and ternes 1999 kümmerer 2009b as a result phas as the emerging micro pollutants have been frequently detected in the effluent of municipal wastewater treatment plants wwtps up to 211 0 μg l liu and wong 2013 secondary sludge and biosolids up to 126 0 μg g total solids ts dry weight yu et al 2011 gao et al 2012 surface water up to 6 8 μg l liu and wong 2013 groundwater up to 78 3 ng l hu et al 2010 and drinking water up to 269 ng l zhang et al 2012 zhao et al 2013 these antibiotic compounds and nsaids may potentially pose serious risk to human and animal health through chronic ecotoxicity and propagation of antibiotic resistant bacteria arb and genes args in the environment daughton and ternes 1999 fent et al 2006 kümmerer 2009a zhang et al 2015 one of the major sources of phas entering into the environment is the effluent of wwtps luo et al 2014 conventional activated sludge process is widely used for municipal wastewater treatment however the process is less effective in the removal of phas vieno et al 2007 moreover the process is highly energy intensive and generates large amount of biological sludge vieno et al 2007 similarly anaerobic methanogenic process also showed poor removal of phas joss et al 2004 huang et al 2008 thus there is a need to explore an energy efficient biological process for the effective removal of phas recently such biological process integrating sulfur carbon nitrogen and phosphorous removal has drawn significant research attention lu et al 2012 wu et al 2016 the use of sulfate reducing bacteria srb presents an opportunity for the treatment of sulfur laden industrial and municipal wastewaters lu et al 2012 hao et al 2014 for example sulfate reduction autotrophic denitrification and nitrification integrated sani process is undergoing full scale demonstration in hong kong for saline sewage treatment wu et al 2016 flue gas desulfurization sani fgd sani jiang et al 2013 and denitrifying sulfur assisted enhanced biological phosphorous removal ds ebpr wu et al 2014 are some of other examples of srb mediated wastewater treatment processes recently srb sludge system has also been examined to treat sulfate laden pharmaceutical wastewater chelliapan and sallis 2015 and synthetic wastewater containing high concentrations of sulfamethoxazole smx and ciprofloxacin cip our previous studies showed that smx and cip could be effectively removed by srb sludge specific removal rates of 15 2 μg g suspended solids ss d at smx concentration of 100 μg l and 637 3 7 6 μg g ss d at cip concentration of 5 000 μg l jia et al 2017 2018 these studies clearly highlight the potential of srb based biological process for phas removal there are however very limited studies on phas removal by srb sludge system moreover to the best of our knowledge no studies have examined the removal mechanisms of phas in srb sludge system including the adsorption behavior kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics and the biodegradation kinetics functional enzymes involved and the pathways the overarching goal of this study was to investigate phas removal efficiency and their removal mechanisms in srb sludge system eight typical phas were selected as the target pollutants including two sulfonamide sa antibiotics sulfadiazine sd and smx two fluoroquinolone fq antibiotics cip and enoxacin eno one sa synergist trimethoprim tmp and three nsaids ibuprofen ibu ketoprofen ket and diclofenac dic removal of these phas in the srb sludge system was examined using four sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb bioreactors operating up to 300 days under different operating conditions the phas removal mechanisms via adsorption kinetics isotherms and thermodynamics and biodegradation kinetics intermediates and possible pathways catalyzed by functional enzymes by srb sludge system were further investigated through a series of batch experiments this study provided better understanding of phas removal in srb sludge system and opens up the potential of sulfur mediated biological process for the treatment of phas containing wastewaters 2 materials and methods 2 1 bioreactor set up and operation four lab scale sulfate reducing up flow sludge bed srusb bioreactors namely r1 r2 r3 and r4 were fabricated using acrylic see fig s1 in supplementary information si for details and were continuously operated under different operating conditions see table s2 in si the bioreactors were fed with the synthetic wastewater see table s3 in si for composition the seed sludge enriched with srb no phas were detected in the sludge based on microbial community analysis as shown in fig s2 in si was collected from the anaerobic bioreactor of the sani process operating in our laboratory for over four years the average concentration of volatile suspended solids vss and the solids retention time srt in each srusb bioreactor were maintained at about 6 1 0 8 g l and 25 days jia et al 2018 respectively by regular withdrawal of sludge the vss ss ratio in each bioreactor was about 0 68 0 07 the influent and effluent samples from each srusb bioreactor were collected daily and analyzed for sulfate thiosulfate sulfite and chemical oxygen demand cod concentrations as per the standard methods apha 2005 dissolved sulfide was measured with the methylene blue method apha 2005 the phas in aqueous phase influent and effluent were collected and determined daily by an ultra performance liquid chromatography uplc with a diode array detector dad uplc dionex ultimate 3000 ca usa more details are given in pages s11 s12 in si the srb sludge samples were collected once a week from each bioreactor and analyzed for phas content in sludge following the protocol described elsewhere jia et al 2018 see pages s11 s12 in si for details the phas removal efficiency and specific removal rate were determined as per jia et al 2018 see pages s4 s5 in si for more details 2 2 batch experiments to investigate the removal mechanisms of phas by srb sludge system a series of batch tests were conducted using serum bottles with working volume of 500 ml see fig s3 in si the srb sludge used in the batch experiments was taken from the bioreactor r1 after 300 days of continuous operation and then washed three time using synthetic wastewater containing no phas see table s3 in si until no residual phas were detected in the srb sludge 2 2 1 phas removal by srb sludge the phas removal by srb sludge was also examined in a series of batch experiments and were classified into three groups see table s4 in si for detailed experimental plan group i designated as control without srb sludge was conducted for 5 days to examine the possible hydrolysis of phas in group ii 0 1 sodium azide nan3 was added to inhibit the microbial activity figs s4 and s5 in si to examine the adsorption of phas by inactivated srb sludge and the adsorption experiment was conducted for 24 hrs in group iii the batch experiment was conducted for 5 days to investigate the biodegradation of phas by a well acclimated srb sludge obtained from the srusb bioreactor each serum bottle containing 1 5 g ss l of srb sludge was wrapped with aluminum foil to avoid photodegradation and purged with nitrogen gas 99 9 purity for 30 min to establish anaerobic condition and was then tightly sealed before the start of the experiment the batch experiments were conducted at an initial ph of 7 0 and continuous mixing at 200 rpm using magnetic stirring plates ika rct germany at room temperature 25 1 c the batch experiments of each group were conducted in three replicates to investigate the removal mechanism of each pharmaceutical in srb sludge system only one pharmaceutical was added into each serum bottle in the batch test and all eight phas were tested individually in each group two different ranges of phas concentrations were used in each group 1 for sd smx tmp dic ibu and ket concentrations of 25 50 100 150 and 200 μg l were used as these phas were widely detected in the concentration range of 1 to 221 μg l in wastewaters segura et al 2009 madikizela and chimuka 2017 yang et al 2017 and 2 for cip and eno higher concentrations of 100 300 500 1 000 3 000 and 5 000 μg l were used as these phas are quickly adsorbed within 15 min by biological sludge with adsorption capacity as high as 1 000 μg g ss polesel et al 2016 wang et al 2017 zhang et al 2018 the samples uniformly mixed from each serum bottle were taken regularly for analyzing phas concentrations in aqueous phase and in solid phase srb sludge to determine the removal efficiencies and specific removal rates of eight target phas see pages s4 s5 in si moreover the adsorption kinetics of phas by srb sludge were investigated using the pseudo first order and pseudo second order adsorption models eqs 8 and 9 respectively in si and zero first and second order biodegradation models eqs 10 11 and 12 respectively in si were used to investigate the biodegradation kinetics and half lives of phas in srb sludge system 2 2 2 cip and eno adsorption thermodynamics based on our previous study on cip adsorption zhang et al 2018 and the results of our batch experiments on phas removal in this study group ii srb sludge had significantly higher adsorption capacity for cip and eno as discussed in section 3 2 compared to six other phas in order to gain insight into the adsorption mechanisms of the two above stated phas by srb sludge adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics of cip and eno were separately examined in a series of batch experiments competition between cip and eno for the adsorption sites on srb sludge was not considered in this study 1 the first set of experiment consisting of total of six cip concentrations 100 300 500 1 000 3 000 and 5 000 μg l was used to examine the adsorption behavior at different temperatures 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 c for each concentration and 2 the second set of experiment followed the same experimental design as the first set except that the cip was replaced with eno both sets of experiment followed the same procedure as that of group ii batch test for phas removal by srb sludge and each test was conducted in three replicates three adsorption isotherms namely henry equivalent to linear freundlich and langmuir were employed to evaluate cip and eno adsorption behavior and capacity of srb sludge the details of fitting methods are given in pages s8 s9 in si the thermodynamic parameters such as gibbs free energy change δgo enthalpy change δho and entropy change δso which quantify the feasibility and nature of the adsorption process were calculated as per the methods described in wang et al 2017 details are given in pages s9 s10 in si 2 2 3 enzyme inhibition tests three widely prescribed phas i e smx tmp and cip were selected as the target compounds to examine the possible role of enzymes in their biodegradation in srb sludge system the enzymes such as cytochrome p450 cyp450 adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase apsr and sulfite reductase sr are commonly present as key functional enzymes in srb sludge and could play an important role in phas biodegradation jia et al 2018 prieto et al 2011 campanini et al 2015 rückert 2016 thus the inhibitors against these three enzymes were used to examine the roles these enzymes played in biodegradation of smx tmp and cip in srb sludge system through four sets of enzyme inhibition batch tests see pages s10 s11 and table s5 in si for detail experimental plan each batch test was conducted in three replicates 2 3 statistical analysis statistical analysis was carried out to examine the significant difference statistically between results multiple comparisons were based on one way analysis of variance anova in spss 16 0 ibm ny usa least significant difference lsd p 0 05 test was used for comparisons between treatment means the limit of detection lod and limit of quantification loq of phas were the concentrations with signal to noise ratios of 3 and 10 respectively more details are given in pages s11 s12 and table s6 in si the solid phase extraction method used for the extraction of phas from the srb sludge was verified with the recovery 85 and with a good reproducibility relative standard deviation of 3 n 3 the method used for phas analysis in aqueous phase via uplc had a recovery 95 and the reproducibility was well within the relative standard deviation of 2 n 3 see table s6 in si 3 results and discussion 3 1 phas removal in srusb bioreactors four bench scale srusb bioreactors r1 r2 r3 and r4 were operated in parallel for up to 300 days under different operating conditions to examine phas removal by srb sludge systems and the influence of these operating conditions on phas removal see table s2 in si for experimental plan and table s7 and fig s6 in si for more discussion on results all bioreactors achieved average cod removal efficiency of 80 about 60 of the influent sulfate was reduced into dissolved sulfide and no sulfur intermediates e g sulfite thiosulfate and elemental sulfur were detected in the effluent of bioreactors the performance of four bioreactors is summarized in table s7 in si in order to examine the effect of phas on the microbial communities of srb sludge in four bioreactors the microbial communities in srb sludge samples from the four bioreactors and the seed sludge were characterized the microbial communities at phylum and genus levels are shown in fig s2 in si it is apparent that the relative abundance of srb especially desulfobacter in srb sludge samples of four bioreactors 24 8 to 27 1 after a long term exposure to phas did not significantly decrease compared to seed sludge 24 1 p 0 05 indicating that srb especially desulfobacter in srusb bioreactors showed high tolerance to phas during the long term operation this finding was in agreement with our previous study jia et al 2018 the removal efficiencies and specific removal rates of phas with stepwise increase in influent phas concentrations from 25 to 1 000 μg l were obtained from bioreactor r1 as shown in fig 1 note phas removal in bioreactors r2 r3 and r4 are presented in table s8 and fig s6 in si the specific removal rates of all eight phas increased significantly with increasing influent phas concentrations from 25 to 1 000 μg l the performance of bioreactor r1 in terms of phas removal was categorized into three groups depending on the removal efficiency for the first group over 50 of the influent cip and eno fq antibiotics was removed primarily due to high adsorption capacity of srb sludge for these antibiotics jia et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 and this was further substantiated through a series of batch experiments as shown in fig 2 in the second group sd smx sa antibiotics and tmp removals were 20 to 40 in srb sludge system at different phas concentrations 25 to 1 000 μg l and the specific removal rates of smx and tmp were 6 09 0 7 μg g ss d and 9 42 0 4 μg g ss d respectively at the same initial concentration of 50 μg l hrt of 6 hrs temperature of 25 1 c and ss concentration of 9 0 0 7 g l alvarino et al 2016b investigated smx and tmp removal in aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludge systems using aerobic membrane bioreactor mbr and up flow anaerobic sludge bed uasb bioreactor respectively at an initial concentration of 40 μg l for both smx and tmp the specific removal rates of smx and tmp were 3 07 and 2 69 μg g ss d respectively in aerobic mbr operating at hrt of 5 hrs and ss concentration of 5 to 7 g l whereas the specific removal rates of smx and tmp in uasb bioreactor operating at hrt of 12 hrs and ss concentration of 30 g l were 2 45 and 2 08 μg g ss d respectively alvarino et al 2016b the results apparently showed that the specific removal rates of smx and tmp in srb sludge system were much higher than those reported in aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludge systems under similar influent phas concentration ranges 40 to 50 μg l the specific removal rate of sd was 17 6 1 1 μg g ss d in the srb sludge system at initial concentration of 100 μg l which was higher than that in aerobic sludge system 12 9 μg g ss d at the same initial concentration of 100 μg l li and zhang 2010 however there is lack of study on sd removal in anaerobic sludge system the last group showed significantly low removal 20 of three nsaids dic ibu and ket by srb sludge similar findings were also reported by carballa et al 2007 and alvarino et al 2014 in which both ibu and ket removals were very low under anaerobic methanogenic condition several other studies also reported poor removal adsorption biodegradation of dic under aerobic anoxic and anaerobic conditions carballa et al 2007 suarez et al 2010 alvarino et al 2014 thus srb sludge appears to be more effective in the removal of antibiotics i e sd smx tmp cip and eno than aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges however studies on their removal mechanisms by srb sludge are very limited here we conducted a series of batch experiments to gain an insight into the underlying removal mechanisms via adsorption and biodegradation of antibiotics by srb sludge as discussed in the following section 3 2 phas adsorption by srb sludge 3 2 1 phas adsorption behavior and kinetics by srb sludge a series of batch tests were conducted to investigate the adsorption behavior and coefficient kd of phas by inactivated srb sludge as described in section 2 2 see table s4 in si for details as shown in fig 2 the srb sludge had much lower adsorption efficiency 15 and much longer adsorption equilibrium time 12 hrs for sa antibiotics sd and smx tmp and nsaids dic ibu and ket compared to fq antibiotics cip and eno the adsorption coefficients kd calculated using eq 7 in page s6 in si of sa antibiotics sd and smx tmp and nsaids dic ibu and ket were all below 0 5 l g ss indicating a limited contribution of adsorption on their removal by srb sludge system similar findings were also reported for smx sd and tmp adsorption by aerobic sludge li and zhang 2010 and anaerobic methanogenic sludge alvarino et al 2014 2016b nearly no adsorption of nsaids dic ibu and ket was observed in aerobic activated sludge alvarino et al 2014 and anaerobic methanogenic sludge alvarino et al 2014 2016b the fq antibiotics cip and eno however had significantly different adsorption behavior in srb sludge system compared to six other phas fig 2 i e they were instantly adsorbed by srb sludge and achieved the adsorption equilibrium within 15 min with removal efficiency as high as 98 even though fq antibiotics cip and eno showed similar adsorption behavior in aerobic anoxic and anaerobic methanogenic sludge systems li and zhang 2010 zhou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 the adsorption coefficients kd of fq antibiotics cip and eno in aerobic kd 0 4 to 22 6 l g ss li and zhang 2010 zhou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 anoxic kd 0 4 to 2 1 l g ss zhou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 and anaerobic methanogenic kd 0 7 to 14 7 l g ss li and zhang 2010 zhang et al 2018 sludges were lower than those in the srb sludge kd 25 3 1 8 l g ss this further suggests that srb sludge had higher adsorption capacity for fq antibiotics cip and eno compared to aerobic anoxic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges our previous study also showed that srb sludge had higher adsorption capacity for cip than those of aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges zhang et al 2018 this could be attributed to speciation of the fq antibiotics and changes in sludge properties under different experimental conditions which may have affected the electrostatic interaction between fq antibiotics and sludges such as cation exchange ion bridging surface complexation ion dipole and hydrogen bonding conkle et al 2010 polesel et al 2015 the adsorption kinetics of eight phas were evaluated individually using pseudo first order and pseudo second order models see pages s6 s7 in si for more details the pseudo second order model provided a better fit for adsorption of all phas correlation coefficient r 2 0 96 than the pseudo first order model the equilibrium adsorption amounts q e calculated using pseudo second order model were close to the experimental values with relative error 5 see table s9 in si the pseudo second order adsorption rate constants k2 of cip 1 24 0 23 g ss μg cip hr and eno 1 73 0 11 g ss μg eno hr were significantly higher than those of other phas at the same initial concentration of 100 μg l p 0 05 see table s9 in si suggesting the unique adsorption mechanisms of fq antibiotics by srb sludge to further gain an insight into the adsorption mechanisms of cip and eno by srb sludge their adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics analyses were further carried out as discussed in the following section 3 2 2 cip and eno adsorption isotherms and thermodynamics by srb sludge three adsorption isotherms henry equivalent to linear freundlich and langmuir were examined for cip and eno adsorption in a series of batch experiments at temperatures of 5 10 15 20 25 30 and 35 c the adsorption of cip and eno by srb sludge conformed well to henry and freundlich isotherms correlation coefficients r 2 0 98 compared to langmuir isotherm the correlation coefficients of henry and freundlich isotherms were significantly higher p 0 05 than those of langmuir isotherm at all temperatures see table s10 in si the nonlinearity indexes n values from the freundlich isotherm were close to 1 0 0 82 to 0 90 table s10 in si indicating the linear adsorption between cip eno and srb sludge yang et al 2011 zhou et al 2013 also reported similar findings for cip adsorption by aerobic anoxic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges the thermodynamic analyses of cip eno adsorption by srb sludge were further conducted based on the henry adsorption coefficient kh since the cip eno adsorption by srb sludge conformed well to the linear adsorption behavior according to henry and freundlich isotherms at different temperatures see fig 3 table s11 and pages s9 s10 in si the negative gibbs free energy δg and enthalpy δh changes indicate that adsorption of cip and eno onto srb sludge was a spontaneous and an exothermic process respectively zhou et al 2013 wang et al 2017 the absolute value of δh distinguishes between physisorption in the range of 0 to 20 kj mol and chemisorption in the range of 80 to 400 kj mol weber and digiano 1996 doğan and alkan 2003 zhang et al 2014 the absolute values of enthalpy change of cip δh 48 kj mol and eno δh 52 kj mol adsorption by srb sludge in this study were within the range of 20 to 80 kj mol indicating that both physisorption and chemisorption contributed to adsorption of cip and eno onto srb sludge xu et al 2008 3 3 phas biodegradation by srb sludge 3 3 1 phas biodegradation behavior and kinetics in srb sludge system besides adsorption biodegradation also plays an important role on phas removal during biological wastewater treatment process alvarino et al 2018 biodegradation is a process that involves the breakdown of complex organic compounds including phas either through biotransformation resulting in formation of different intermediates achermann et al 2018 reis et al 2018 or through complete mineralization to co2 and or h2o by pure or mixed microbial culture bouju et al 2012 alvarino et al 2016a the biodegradation behavior and coefficient kbio of eight target phas in srb sludge system were investigated as shown in fig 4 compared to five antibiotics sd smx tmp cip and eno the three nsaids dic ibu and ket were poorly degraded biodegradation efficiency 15 and biodegradation coefficient kbio 0 03 l g vss d in srb sludge system about 20 of the fq antibiotics cip and eno was biodegraded by srb sludge with kbio of 0 08 l g vss d the sa antibiotics sd and smx showed higher biodegradation with efficiency over 40 and biodegradation coefficients kbio as high as 0 14 0 03 and 0 19 0 06 l g vss d respectively which were higher than those 0 05 to 0 12 and 0 08 to 0 17 l g vss d for sd and smx respectively in aerobic sludge system li and zhang 2010 several studies reported low biodegradability of tmp in aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges pérez et al 2005 li and zhang 2010 suarez et al 2010 lm et al 2016 however tmp was effectively biodegraded by anaerobic srb sludge with biodegradation efficiency and coefficient as high as 42 5 0 9 and 0 12 0 03 l g vss d respectively fig 4 in order to further substantiate that the high biodegradation efficiency of tmp by srb sludge was associated with the functional enzymes present in the srb sludge system a series of batch experiments the detail experimental plans are given in section 2 2 and table s5 in si were conducted and findings are discussed in the following section moreover the biodegradation rates of eight phas were also evaluated using three kinetic models see pages s7 s8 in si for more details the biodegradation processes of all phas were well correlated with the first order kinetic model with correlation coefficient r 2 of 0 88 to 0 99 see table s12 in si the biodegradation rate constants k1 of three nsaids dic ibu and ket were below 0 03 1 d at 100 μg l and their half lives t1 2 calculated using eqs 13 14 and 15 in si were more than 20 d the half lives increased significantly p 0 05 with increasing phas concentrations interestingly fq antibiotics cip and eno had the similar biodegradation rate constants k1 and half lives t1 2 with nsaids at 100 μg l but the k1 of cip and eno increased significantly p 0 05 with increasing cip and eno concentrations the k1 and t1 2 of sd and smx were around 0 15 1 d and 5 d respectively at 100 μg l and they did not vary significantly p 0 05 with increasing sd and smx concentrations the k1 and t1 2 of tmp were 0 05 1 d and 7 15 d respectively at 100 μg l and k1 decreased with increasing tmp concentration 3 3 2 functional enzymes and pathways of phas biodegradation by srb sludge three typical antibiotics i e sa antibiotic smx fq antibiotic cip and sa synergist tmp were selected to identify the functional enzymes involved in biotransformation pathways by srb sludge through a series of batch experiments three enzymes i e cytochrome p450 cyp450 adenosine 5 phosphosulfate reductase apsr and sulfite reductase sr are commonly present as key functional enzymes in the srb sludge and possibly play important roles in antibiotics biotransformation prieto et al 2011 campanini et al 2015 rückert 2016 jia et al 2018 thus three enzyme inhibitors i e 1 aminobenzotriazole inhibiting cyp450 enzymes prieto et al 2011 na2so3 inhibiting apsr minocha et al 2008 and fe iii inhibiting sr yin et al 2002 were used to identify the roles of three enzymes in biodegradation of smx cip and tmp by srb sludge see table s5 in si for details of the enzyme inhibition batch tests as shown in fig 5 the biodegradation of smx and cip was significantly p 0 05 inhibited in the presence of cyp450 enzymes and sr inhibitors compared to control without enzyme inhibitors indicating that both cyp450 enzymes and sr played an important role in biodegradation of smx and cip in srb sludge system contrary to smx and cip only cyp450 enzymes played an important role in the biodegradation of tmp in srb sludge and apsr did not involve in the biodegradation of smx cip and tmp fig 5 several studies reported that cyp450 enzymes catalyzed phas biotransformation via oxidation reduction hydroxylation ipso substitution reactions meunier et al 2004 ji et al 2018 and through cleavage of piperazinyl ring prieto et al 2011 the biotransformation products and possible pathways of smx cip and tmp were further investigated to better understand the catalytic functions of cyp450 enzymes and sr in their role in smx cip and tmp biotransformations in srb sludge system as discussed below the biotransformation products bps of smx cip and tmp in srb sludge system were analyzed by liquid chromatography quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry mass spectrometry lc qtof ms ms see pages s12 s13 in si for more details and table s13 in si for ms ms fragments and molecular structures of intermediates smx was possibly biotransformed in srb sludge system through three pathways which could be catalyzed by sr and cyp450 enzymes with five intermediates i e smx bp1 bp5 as shown in fig 6 smx biotransformation was initiated from the isoxazole ring cleavage in the n o bond via hydrogenation pathways a and b the biotransformation of isoxazole ring in reducing environment e g anaerobic sulfate reduction could be catalyzed by nadh dependent reductases such as sr in this study eschenbrenner et al 1995 zhang et al 2008 askenasy et al 2018 the hydroxylation in the isoxazole ring of smx was detected as shown in pathway c which could be catalyzed by cyp450 enzymes meunier et al 2004 shaik et al 2005 these results were consistent with that of the results of the enzyme inhibition batch tests as shown in fig 5 cip could be biotransformed via four pathways into six intermediates as shown in fig 6 in pathway a cip biotransformation was initiated from the cleavage of piperazinyl ring cip bp1 followed by the formation of cip bp2 by removing c2h5n fragment prieto et al 2011 in pathway b cip was transformed to cip bp3 via hydroxylation at c 8 position and cip bp3 was transformed to cip bp4 via hydroxylation at c 7 position with cyp450 enzymes as the main functional enzymes meunier et al 2004 shaik et al 2005 prieto et al 2011 in pathways c and d cip bp5 and cip bp6 respectively were produced through ipso substitution reactions at c 3 and c 6 positions of cip which could be attributed to catalytic function of cyp450 enzymes in the srb sludge shaik et al 2005 ricken et al 2015 ji et al 2018 tmp biotransformation by srb sludge was mainly catalyzed by cyp450 enzymes and produced total of six intermediates through three pathways via hydroxylation n acetylation and o demethylation meunier et al 2004 shaik et al 2005 in pathway a loss of ch3 groups at c 3 and c 4 positions of tmp coupled with hydroxylation resulted in the formation of intermediates tmp bp1 3 oh tmp tmp bp2 4 oh tmp and tmp bp3 in pathway b tmp was biotransformed in srb sludge by losing ch3 and nh3 groups at c 3 and n 4 positions respectively then n acetylation at n 2 position with production of tmp bp4 tmp was also biotransformed by losing ch3 group at c 3 position then n acetylation at n 4 position with production of tmp bp5 in pathway b moreover tmp could also be biotransformed into intermediate tmp bp6 though o demethylation at c 5 position and hydroxylation at c 3 and c 4 positions in pathway c which were mainly catalyzed by cyp450 enzymes meunier et al 2004 shaik et al 2005 all these pathways of tmp biotransformation in srb sludge system were catalyzed by cyp450 enzymes which further confirmed the results of the enzyme inhibition batch tests see fig 5 4 conclusions occurrence and fate of phas mainly antibiotics and nsaids in environment especially wwtps has become significant concerns in recent years recently srb sludge system has attracted attention due to their higher tolerance and better removal efficacy for several antibiotics than aerobic and anaerobic methanogenic sludges this study evaluated eight typical phas removal in srb sludge system via a long term operation of bioreactors along with a series of batch experiments five antibiotics including sa antibiotics smx and sd fq antibiotics cip and eno and tmp were effectively removed compared to nsaids dic ibu and ket srb sludge showed higher adsorption capacity for fq antibiotics cip and eno than the six other phas and the adsorption process was spontaneous and exothermic involving both physisorption and chemisorption smx cip and tmp biodegradation mainly occurred via the cleavage of isoxazole and piperazinyl rings hydroxylation ipso substitution o demethylation and n acetylation reactions catalyzed by main functional enzymes i e cyp450 enzymes and sr this study for the first time provided a

18688,the property and release behavior of phosphorus in biochar derived from enhanced biological phosphorus removal sludge ebpr sludge were investigated a low temperature steam lts activation method was developed to increase the p availability in the biochar the results demonstrate that the p content in the biochar is comparable to that in typical p fertilizers the biochar contained a considerable portion of fast release p polyphosphates poly p were the predominant p species in the biochar lts greatly improved p availability in biochar produced at 700 c by hydrolyzing insoluble poly p to soluble pyro p and ortho p in addition the presence of ca2 could greatly reduce the p release from biochar produced at lower temperature e g 400 c due to that ca2 could facilitate the precipitation adsorption of orthophosohates pyrophosphates released from the low temperature biochars such phenomena was not observed with high temperature biochar as the soluble poly p released from 700 c biochar could complex with ca2 rather than precipitated with it other environmental conditions i e environmental ph ionic strength of the soil porewater and presence of low molecular weight acid only had minor or negligible effects on the p release of most studied biochars this study concludes that lts activated 700 c biochar could be a promising p fertilizer given its high rapid and unaffected p release under various environmentally relevant conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords ebpr sludge phosphorus recovery biochar phosphorus availability low temperature steam activation 31p nmr 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is an efficient economical and environmental friendly phosphorus p removal process which is being widely applied in many wastewater treatment plants worldwide liu et al 2007 martín et al 2006 the high p removal efficiency of ebpr is attributed to the luxury p uptake by a group of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos unlike ordinary heterotrophic organisms in sludge which acquire p only for the synthesis of their cells constituents hauduc et al 2013 paos can also store excess p inside their cell as polyphosphates poly p therefore ebpr sludge contains higher p than the conventional sludge 5 8 vs 1 2 huang and tang 2015 huang et al 2015 qian and jiang 2014 tchobanoglous et al 2003 so far many techniques were developed to recover p from ebpr sludge e g direct application of ebpr sludge on land chemical precipitation of p from anaerobic digester liquor melia et al 2017 and thermal treatment of ebpr sludge to release p for further recovery desmidt et al 2014 gerba and smith 2005 the p recovery efficiency of above methods are estimated to be 100 3 30 and 90 petzet and cornel 2013 respectively pyrolysis of ebpr sludge and then applying the solid products i e biochar to the soil could be a sustainable way for p recovery this approach has many advantages it can effectively deactivate the microorganisms in the sludge substantially reduce the sludge volume desmidt et al 2014 generate valuable products e g bio oil galandak and racstain 1979 samolada and zabaniotou 2014 avoid uncontrollable emissions of ch4 nh3 and n2o during the storage transport and application of sludge willén et al 2016 the produced biochar could be a useful soil remediation material to sequester carbon immobilize inorganic and organic pollutants in soil lehmann and joseph 2009 more importantly p in the sludge could be concentrated in the biochar during this process which enables the ebpr sludge biochar to be a potential p fertilizer so far numerous studies have investigated p in the conventional sludge biochars huang and tang 2015 qian and jiang 2014 steckenmesser et al 2017 sun et al 2018 xu et al 2015 however little is known about p in ebpr sludge biochar ebpr sludge contains higher p than conventional sludge does and the proportion of the poly p in ebpr sludge could be much higher than that in conventional sludge seviour et al 2003 thus the structures of p compounds in the ebpr sludge biochar and the release behavior of these p compounds may be also different from those p compounds in the conventional sludge biochar lehmann and joseph 2009 therefore it is crucial to understand the property of p species in ebpr sludge biochar for its application the speciation and release pattern of p in biochar are important factors in deciding the quality of biochar based p fertilizer it was found that the p species in conventional sludge biochar are orthophosphates ortho p pyrophosphates pyro p and poly p with different chain length among which ortho p and pyro p are the main p forms of the soluble and extractable p huang and tang 2015 qian and jiang 2014 the pyrolysis condition of the biochar especially the pyrolysis temperature plays a decisive role on the speciation of biochar p the higher the pyrolysis temperature the lower the availability of the biochar p qian and jiang 2014 in addition to p speciation the release pattern of the biochar p can also be affected by the environmental condition such as soil ph ionic strength of the porewater the type of co existing ions in the porewater and ambient temperature qian et al 2013 sun et al 2018 xu et al 2015 another critical concern for biochar p is that how to increase the availability of p in biochar if the availability of p could be significantly improved the feasibility of p recovery method by pyrolysis would be greatly enhanced however only a few studies have reported this issue matsuo 1996 thomsen et al 2017 matsuo 1996 found that hot water could substantially improve the solubility of p in the incineration ash of ebpr sludge although this is a green and effective method to increase the availability of p it is not suitable for land application of biochar p as it is problematic to operate onsite ideally the activation of the biochar p should be completed prior to the land application thomsen et al 2017 adopted a post oxidation method on municipal sewage sludge biochar to increase p availability however their method may not work on ebpr sludge biochar as the sludge p in their study was mainly composed of chemical precipitated p the p property of the resultant biochar in their study could be different from that of ebpr sludge biochar therefore new environmental friendly and cost effective activation techniques are still needed to enhance the p avaliability of ebpr sludge biochar to understand the p properties in ebpr sludge biochar two ebpr sludge biochars i e biochar produced at 400 c denoted as e400 and biochar produced at 700 c denoted as e700 were prepared field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and energy dispersive x ray spectrometry edx x ray powder diffraction xrd and sequential extraction combined with liquid state and solid state 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr were applied to reveal the structures of p compounds in ebpr sludge biochar soil ph is a pivotal factor that affecting nutrient availability schoenholtz et al 2000 ionic strength of the porewater and the cations and anions of low molecular weight acid in porewater are important ionic environments influencing p adsorption and desoption lü et al 2017 rajan and fox 1972 to explore the effects of these environmental conditions on the release of p the release amount of p in different simulated porewater was determined and several statistical analyses were conducted to enhance the availability of p in ebpr sludge biochar the low temperature steam lts 130 c which is easily accessible in industry was used to replace hot water to activate p in ebpr sludge biochar to investigate the feasibility of the activated ebpr sludge biochar as the p fertilizer the lts activated biochar was also subjected to all the above mentioned characterization methods and experiments this study provides essential information about p in ebpr sludge biochar investigates the potential of lts activation to promote p release and highlights the feasibility of ebpr sludge biochar as a p fertilizer 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and low temperature stream lts activation of biochar ebpr sludge was collected from two ebpr reactors shen et al 2017 the main composition of the simulated wastewater is shown in s1 in supporting information si after the supernatant was removed the sludge from the two reactors was mixed dried at 60 c ground and sieved through a 250 μm mesh the ebpr sludge biochars i e e400 and e700 were prepared by the methods listed in si s1 after cooling down the prepared biochar was also ground and passed through a 250 μm mesh the yield of e400 e700 was calculated from the weight of the ebpr sludge and the weight of the residual i e e400 or e700 after pyrolysis all chemicals in this study are analytical reagent and purchased from vwr unless otherwise described 2 2 low temperature steam lts activation of biochar the biochar i e e400 or e700 was added into a glass container and covered with aluminum foil to ensure being fully contacted with the steam biochar was evenly spread about 1 mm thick on the bottom of the container then the container was placed in an autoclave to conduct lts activation five activation temperatures i e 60 80 100 110 and 120 c were chosen for lts activation for the activation temperature of 60 80 and 100 c only one incubation time i e 0 5 h was applied while for the activation temperature of 110 and 120 c three duration times i e 0 5 1 and 2 h were applied after cooling down samples were taken out and used for experiments p release from biochar with different lts treatment was tested by the method s2 in si 2 3 p release kinetics from biochar thirty six erlenmeyer flasks containing 40 ml of 0 03 m nacl solution buffered with 10 mm 3 n morpholino propanesulfonic acid mops 99 5 sigma aldrich ph 7 0 were prepared 0 03 m nacl represents the typical ion strength of the soil solution chen et al 2017 cheng et al 2016 luo et al 2017 in each flask 20 0 5 mg of the raw biochar e400 or e700 was added the mixed samples were shaken at 130 rpm and 23 2 c in a shaker at certain time interval three flasks three replicates were taken out and the samples were settled down for several minutes the supernatant in each flask was withdrawn and passed through a 0 45 μm nylon filter and the solution was used for the determination of ortho p and total phosphates tp the determination methods of ortho p and tp are shown in si s2 the amount of released p at each time interval q i mg g 1 can be obtained by eq 1 1 q i c i v m where c i is the p i e ortho p or tp concentration at each time interval v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the amount of biochar in the solution 2 4 characterization of raw and lts treated biochar the content of p in ebpr sludge the content of p k ca na mg al fe in the biochar e400 and e700 was obtained by measuring the concentration of these elements in the digested solution of biochar the digestion method was according to epa 3050a and the elemental concentrations except for p concentration were determined by icp oes perkinelmer optima 8000 usa the concentration of p was determined by the molybdate ascorbic acid method morphology of biochar was characterized by fesem jeol jsm 7200f operated with the secondary electron detector under accelerating voltage of 15 kv and edx aztec standard xmax50 prior to imaging biochar sample was mounted on the sample support with carbon stick tape and sputter coated with a layer of platinum p compounds in the biochar were characterized by the xrd analysis using bruker axs d8 advance diffractometer with cu ka radiation 40 kv and 40 ma before analysis the biochar sample was ground to fine powder by agate mortar and pestle the xrd spectrum was analyzed by mdi jade 6 0 software functional groups of biochar were characterized by the fourier transform infrared ftir analysis using a ftir spectrometer perkinelmer spectrum gx detailed method for sample preparation can be found in si s3 2 5 sequential extraction and 31p nmr spectrometry analysis sequential extraction was performed according to the method of turner and leytem 2004 with some modification briefly the biochar was sequentially extracted by 0 5 m nahco3 solution 48 h 0 5 m naoh 0 05 m edta solution 16 h and 1 m hcl solution 16 h the solid to liquid ratio was 1 250 1 50 and 1 100 for nahco3 naoh edta and hcl extraction respectively the supernatant of each extraction was collected and passed through the 0 45 μm filter to obtain the solution for the liquid state 31p nmr analysis and tp determination to prepare the samples for liquid state 31p nmr analysis the solution was freeze dried for two days and the dried extract was re dissolved in a solution containing 1 m naoh and 0 1 m edta with the solid to liquid ratio of 1 10 deuterium oxide was used for the signal lock the 31p nmr spectrum of the liquid sample was obtained using a bruker 500 ultrashield nmr spectrometer operating at 500 mhz at 24 c the pulse width of 90 an acquisition time of 0 33 s a relaxation delay time of 5s and scan times of 600 were applied 85 h3po4 was used as the external standard to characterize the p species remaining in biochar alkali insoluble p after the first two extractions a portion of the solid sample was withdrawn after the first two extractions then washed with deionized water for several times and dried at 60 c and finally analyzed by solid state 31p nmr spectrometry 31p nmr spectra were recorded on a bruker avance iii 400 mhz wide bore nmr spectrometer operating at 162 0 mhz the spectra were collected using a 4 mm cp mas probe with the repetition time of 2s and 400 scans and 85 h3po4 solution was used as an external standard mestrenova version 12 0 4 software was used for data analysis integration and deconvolution were conducted with mestrenova to obtain the peak area of each p group 2 6 effects of environmental factors on the release of biochar p the effects of some common environmental factors i e environmental ph co existing ca2 ionic strength and co existing of low molecular organic acid were investigated in this experiment solid to liquid ratio oscillating speed of the shaker reaction temperature reaction time and sampling method were the same as those in the experiment of release of p from biochar with different lts treatment si s3 to investigate the ph effects two 0 03 m nacl solution with different ph i e 5 0 and 8 0 were prepared two buffers i e 4 morpholineethanesulfonic acid mes and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane hydrochloride tris hcl were added to the two nacl solution with the ultimate concentration of 0 01 m to control the solution ph at 5 0 and 8 0 respectively ca2 is a prevalent cation in soil porewater and ca2 and p species could have different affinity at different environmental ph thus the release of p with the presence of ca2 under different environmental ph was studied three types of solution containing 0 0015 m cacl2 and 0 026 m nacl buffered with mes ph 5 0 mops ph 7 0 and tris hcl ph 8 0 respectively were used the 0 0015 m cacl2 concentration is the medium value of ca2 concentration in the soil porewater ulrich and sumner 2012 and 0 026 m nacl was added to ensure the ionic strength of the solution was close to 0 03 m to study the effects from ionic strength as well as low molecular organic acid solution containing 0 1 m nacl buffered with 0 01 m mops ph 7 0 and solution containing 0 01 m citric acid and 0 03 m nacl and buffered with 0 01 m mops ph 7 0 were prepared 2 5 statistical analysis several parametric and non parametric statistical analysis were applied to the data according to the normality of the data and the homogeneity of the variance one way anova analysis tukey test welch s one way anova analysis games howell test or kruskal wallis anova analysis pairwise comparison were applied to screen lts activation and study the effect of ph on biochar p release two sample t test or mann whitney u test were used to investigate the changes on p fractions of biochar before and after the lts activation as well as the effect of ca2 ionic strength and low molecular organic acid on biochar p release all statistical analysis was conducted with spss 17 0 for windows significance was accepted at p 0 05 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 main elements in ebpr sludge biochar nutrient elemental content is an essential parameter to evaluate if the biochar is a suitable fertilizer the contents of the main elements in the biochar were determined and listed in table 1 the main nutrient elements in the ebpr sludge biochar are p k na ca and mg among which p is the most abundant nutrient element p content in ebpr sludge was 78 9 mg g 1 and the yield of e400 and e700 were 46 9 and 39 1 respectively the p content in e400 and e700 were estimated to be 168 1 and 201 8 mg g 1 respectively if no p was lost during the pyrolysis from table 1 it is found that p content in e400 and e700 were 157 2 and 192 1 mg g 1 respectively these results indicate that although there was minor p loss during the pyrolysis more than 90 of p in ebpr sludge could be retained in biochar the p content in e400 and e700 is much higher than that in other sludge derived biochar 10 80 mg g 1 huang and tang 2015 qian and jiang 2014 steckenmesser et al 2017 sun et al 2018 xu et al 2015 it is also comparable to the p content of typical p fertilizers 80 250 mg g 1 desmidt et al 2014 by comparing the molar quantity of each element in the biochar it is found that the molar quantities of k and mg are much higher than those of ca and na thus it can be deduced that mg and k could be the main metals associated with p in ebpr sludge biochar 3 2 release kinetics of p in e400 e700 and screening of the activation condition for lts activated biochars fig 1 depicts the release kinetics of ortho p and tp from e400 and e700 in 96 h the release of ortho p and tp from e400 and e700 almost reached the equilibrium at 48 h thus the reaction time for the following experiment was set to 48 h this result indicates that ebpr sludge biochar contained a considerable portion of fast release p the low release of ortho p from both e400 5 and e700 1 suggests that the p species in the ebpr sludge biochar were mainly condensed p i e pyrophosphates and poly p to improve the p availability in ebpr sludge biochar lts activation was performed on ebpr sludge biochar the amount of released ortho p and tp from each biochar with different activation temperature and time is shown in fig 2 generally there was an increase in the release of ortho p and tp from the biochar with the increase of activation temperature and time to screen the activation conditions for the biochar the multiple comparison table s1 was conducted on the data as shown in fig 2a and b no significant increase on ortho p and tp release from e400 when the activation temperature increased from 100 to 120 c thus 100 c and 0 5 h were chosen as the lts activation condition for e400 and e400 activated under this condition is denoted as e400lt fig 2d illustrates that the tp release from e700 with the activation temperature of 110 and 120 c was significantly higher than that from e700 with the activation temperature of 60 80 and 100 c moreover the tp release from e700 could be enhanced considerably when the activation time increased from 1 to 2 h thus 110 c and 2 h were chosen as the lts activation condition for e700 and e700 activated under this condition is denoted as e700lt at 48 h the released ortho p and tp from e400lt were 38 8 and 107 4 mg g 1 respectively fig 2a and b and the two types of p from e700lt were 49 6 and 112 3 mg g 1 respectively fig 2c and d compared with tp released from e400 and e700 tp released from e400lt and e700lt increased by 16 7 and 82 6 respectively these results indicate that the lts activation is an effective method to increase the availability of p in ebpr sludge biochar especially for the p in e700 the substantial increase on ortho p in each biochar after lts activation could be caused by the hydrolysis of the condensed p this hypothesis will be discussed further in the following sections 3 3 the morphology and xrd analysis of different biochars the morphology of e400 e700 e400lt and e700lt is shown in fig 3 plenty of round particles were embedded in the surface of e400 fig 3a the edx result figs s1 s4 shows that the elements in the particles were o c p k mg na and ca and the p content was more than 13 wt compared with e400 less p containing particles were observed on the surface of e700 fig 3b which suggests that some p containing particles could be trapped in the pores of the biochar after being activated round shape p containing particles became flower like structure fig 3c and d this could be due to the change on the crystal structure of the p containing compounds on the surface of e400lt many small pores which had been occupied by the p containing particles appeared this could facilitate the release of p located in the inner pores of the biochar however few pores could be found on the surface of e700lt this could be caused by the crack of the pore structure when the sludge was pyrolyzed at high temperature i e 700 c lehmann and joseph 2009 the p species in different biochars were preliminarily analyzed by xrd spectrometry for e400 and e400lt no peak was found in their xrd spectra data are not shown indicating that the p species in e400 and e400lt were amorphous for e700 and e700lt several peaks arose from their xrd spectra fig 3e these peaks except for the peak located at 29 5 were attributed to the characteristic peaks of kmg po3 3 fig 3f indicating the presence of kmg po3 3 in e700 and e700lt although the peak at 29 5 is obvious it is hard to identify the compound with a single peak as the xrd analysis cannot reveal the form of the amorphous p species in biochar advanced characterization methods i e liquid state and solid state 31p nmr spectrometry combined with the sequential extraction method were applied to characterize the p species in biochar details can be found in the next section 3 4 sequential extraction and 31p nmr combined analysis to simplify the extraction procedure three types of extraction solution i e 0 5 m nahco3 0 5 m naoh 0 05 m edta and 1 m hcl were used to categorize the biochar p into four fractions namely 1 readily soluble p nahco3 p i e nahco3 extractable p 2 p associated with amorphous iron aluminum and organic matter naoh edta p 3 insoluble ca containing phosphates hcl p and 4 stable organic p res p i e the p cannot be extracted by the solutions of 0 5 m nahco3 0 5 m naoh 0 05 m edta and 1 m hcl hedley et al 1982 pansu and gautheyrou 2006 according to p extractability nahco3 p and naoh edta p were characterized by liquid state 31p nmr as poly p can be easily hydrolyzed in acidic solution van wazer et al 1955 hcl p and res p were characterized by the solid state 31p nmr fig 4 shows the 31p nmr spectra of nahco3 p readily soluble p of different biochar the peaks are generally distributed in three locations they are assigned to ortho p from 3 6 to 6 0 ppm terminal p groups terminal p from 4 0 to 5 0 ppm and mid chain p groups of poly p from 18 2 to 22 7 ppm turner et al 2003 for the terminal p groups the two peaks at the low field from 4 0 to 4 7 ppm are assigned to the terminal p of poly p and the peak at the high field is attributed to pyro p from 4 25 to 5 0 ppm huang and tang 2015 the result indicates that the nahco3 p i e readily soluble p in the ebpr sludge biochar includes ortho p pyro p and poly p the peak area of an nmr signal is always used for semi quantification and quantification analysis as it is proportional to the amount of nuclei present james 1998 in this study as the specific structure of poly p in biochar is not clear semi quantification of the p groups rather than the specific p compounds was conducted given that the peaks of terminal p are not strong enough for deconvolution fig 4a the molar ratio of ortho p to terminal p plus pyro p ortho p terminal p pyro p which was obtained from the ratio of the peak area of ortho p to those of terminal p plus pyro p was applied to study the transformation of p species under different conditions fig 4a and b illustrate that the ortho p terminal p pyro p ratio of e700 0 08 is much lower than that of e400 0 23 suggesting that the poly p released from e700 had longer chain than that from e400 after lts activation the ortho p terminal p pyro p of e400 increased from 0 23 to 1 22 and that of e700 increased from 0 08 to 1 78 fig 4c and d indicating that a considerable proportion of poly p and pyro p in biochar could be hydrolyzed after lts activation the peaks assigned to terminal p in fig 4c and d illustrate that most of the nahco3 extractable poly p in e400 was hydrolyzed during lts activation while there still existed a portion of nahco3 extractable poly p remained in e700lt as the short chain poly p is much more easily hydrolyzed than the long chain poly p huang et al 2018 the nahco3 extractable poly p in e700 could have longer chain than that in e400 unlike the condition for readily soluble p only ortho p the peak around 6 1 ppm and pyro p the peak around 4 1 ppm were detected in the naoh edta p of these biochars fig s5 as the molar ratios of fe to p and al to p in each biochar are no more than 1 100 table 1 it is probably that most naoh edta p of the studied biochar belongs to the p adsorbed on the functional groups thus the absence of the poly p in this p fraction implies that poly p was hardly adsorbed on biochar surface fig s5 also displays that the molar ratio of ortho p to pyro p ortho p pyro p of e400lt 0 37 in the naoh edta solution was lower than that of e400 0 58 and the ortho p pyro p of e700lt 0 45 in the naoh edta solution was almost equal to that of e700 0 46 these results indicate that the proportion of pyro p adsorbed on the biochar did not decrease after lts activation which seems inconsistent with the substantial increase of the ortho p the possible explanation is that pyro p was more easily adsorbed on the biochar surface compared to ortho p as the charge of the pyro p species i e hp2o7 3 and p2o7 4 was higher than that of ortho p species i e h2po4 and hpo4 2 at the same environmental ph qian et al 2013 the p species which could not be released in the first two extractions i e hcl p and res p denoted as alkali insoluble p was analyzed by the solid state 31p nmr spectrometry as shown in fig 5 the solid state 31p nmr spectra of alkali insoluble p in each biochar can be deconvoluted into several peaks for e400 fig 5a pyro p 5 7 ppm and ortho p 5 7 ppm were the main alkali insoluble p as the proportion of the peak area 2 6 of the mid chain p 11 7 ppm is very low for e700 fig 5b only mid chain p the peaks between 11 3 and 21 8 ppm could be found in the spectrum which indicates that the dominant alkali insoluble p in e700 was the cyclic poly p when e400 was activated by lts the peak belongs to mid chain p cannot be observed fig 5c indicating the hydrolysis of the poly p occurred during lts activation by comparing the proportion of the peak area of ortho p and pyro p in e400 and e400lt it is found that lts activation only had limited effect on the alkali insoluble p in e400 when e700 was activated by lts the characteristic peak of terminal p 5 9 ppm arose from the spectrum and the characteristic peaks of mid chain p 11 3 and 24 5 ppm substantially reduced fig 5d this result indicates that lts activation could enable a large portion of cyclic poly p in e700 transformed into linear poly p and pyro p the characterization of the p species in ebpr sludge biochar demonstrates that poly p with different structure long chain short chain and cyclic structure accounted for a large share of the p species in ebpr sludge biochar which is different from the structures in conventional sludge biochar in previous studies for conventional sludge biochar the dominant p species are ortho p and pyro p huang and tang 2015 qian and jiang 2014 this phenomenon may be caused by the high tp and poly p content in ebpr sludge the characterization results also show that most poly p in e400 was readily soluble poly p nahco3 p and they could be easily transformed into ortho p and pyro p during lts activation while in e700 poly p could be presented in both readily soluble p fraction and alkali insoluble p fraction including hcl p and res p unlike the readily soluble poly p in e400 some readily soluble poly p in e700 could remain stable under lts activation the hydrolysis of alkali insoluble poly p in e700 in lts could be the main reason for the large increase of p availability in e700 3 5 mechanism of lts activation on the enhancement of p availability the liquid state and solid state 31p nmr analysis could only provide the structure change of the p species however the migration pattern of the p species among different fractions which induced by lts activation cannot be obtained by the two methods to further investigate the lts activation mechanism the amount of tp released from the biochar in each extraction step was determined fig 6 compared with e400 and e700 nahco3 p in e400lt and e700lt was significantly increased by 10 3 and 26 9 respectively this indicates that some stable p species in ebpr sludge biochar could be transformed into readily soluble p after lts activation it is observed that the increase rates of readily soluble p i e nahco3 p in e400 and e700 caused by lts activation were not as high as those in the experiment with 0 03 m nacl as extracting solution figs 1 and 2 in which the increase rates were 16 7 and 82 6 respectively this phenomenon could be due to the different release behavior of some p species in biochar in different solution this also implies that in addition to the activation conditions the enhancing effect of lts activation on biochar p release could also be affected by the property of soil solution for naoh edta p hcl p and res p in e400 no significant changes are observed after lts activation fig 6 and the inserted table this result indicates that only a small portion of naoh edta p hcl p or res p in e400 could be transformed into nahco3 p by lts activation the limited activation effect of lts on the p availability of e400 could be due to that most of the poly p in e400 was already in soluble form for e700 and e700lt amount of naoh edta p and res p was found similar in both e700 and e700lt the inserted table in fig 6 however the amount of hcl p in e700lt is statistically lower than that in e700 this indicates that the increased nahco3 p in e700lt was mainly derived from the alkali insoluble p in e700 which is also in agreement with the result of the solid the solid state 31p nmr from the noticeable decrease on the peaks located at 11 0 and 24 5 ppm in 31p nmr spectrum fig 5d it can be concluded that the hydrolysis of the insoluble cyclic poly p was the main reason for the increase of nahco3 p in e700 these results imply that lts activation could be more applicable to increase the p availability in ebpr sludge biochar produced at high temperature rather than those produced at low temperature and conventional sludge biochar as neither ebpr sludge biochar produced at low temperature nor conventional sludge biochar contains high proportion of insoluble poly p 3 6 effects of environmental factors on p release the effects of environmental conditions on the release of biochar p were investigated and shown in fig 7 fig s7 and table s2 as shown in fig 7 dash line and table s2 except for tp release from e400lt the environmental ph only had minor or little effect on the p release from the studied biochars the obvious decrease of tp released from e400lt with the increase of the enviromental ph could be caused by the adsorption of pyro p on the functional groups of biochar under ph 7 0 and 8 0 as ortho p and pyro p are the dominant soluble p species in e400lt fig 4c and the environmental ph had little effect on ortho p release from e400lt no significant changes on the p release from e700 and e700lt with the change of enviromental ph this could be caused by two factors on the one hand the amount of released pyro p from e700lt could be low or e700 contained less adsorption sites oxygen containing functional groups for pyro p compared to e400 which can be seen from the ftir spectra of e400 and e700 fig s6 given that the amount of released ortho p from e700 was less than 2 of the released tp in all the experiments in this study the ortho p release from e700 will not be discussed hereafter fig 7 the solid line and table s2 also display that the presence of 0 0015 m of ca2 simulated porewater had little effect on the release of ortho p and tp in e400 and e400lt when the environmental ph was at 5 0 when the environmental ph was at 7 0 the addition of ca2 significantly inhibited the release of ortho p and tp in e400 but still had little effect on the p release in e400lt this result shows that the p species in e400 could be more vulnerable to ca2 compared to that in e400lt by comparing the p species released from e400 and e400lt fig 4 it is found that e400 contained a large portion of soluble poly p while nearly no soluble poly p could be found in e400lt thus precipitation of the soluble poly p could be the main reason for the decrease of released tp from e400 lts activation could transform the poly p into ortho p and pyro p which could inhibit the formation of p precipitates when the environmental ph was at 8 0 the release of ortho p and tp in both e400 and e400lt was significantly inhibited by the addition of ca2 the results suggest the presence of ca2 is very crucial to the p availability under the slightly alkaline condition the ca2 induced reduction of ortho p and pyro p in e400lt could be caused by the precipitation and adsorption of the ortho p and pyro p on e400lt surface qian et al 2013 the addition of ca2 had little effect on the release of ortho p and tp from e700 and e700lt at any studied ph condition fig 7b and d and table s2 it is reported that some long chain poly p could provide the cage like sites to complex with ca2 dias filho et al 2005 van wazer and callis 1958 it is noted that there is only one type of poly p found in both e700 and e700lt fig 4 its complex with ca2 led to the unaffected p release for e700lt the complexation ability of the readily soluble poly p to ca2 is an advantage for e700 and e700lt as it could inhibit the p precipitation and enable e700 e700lt to be an efficient p fertilizer as e700lt had much higher available p than e700 did e700lt could be a more superior p fertilizer than e700 the effects of ionic strength of the soil porewater and the co existing low molecular weight acid on the p release can be found in fig s7 and table s2 it is clear that the change of the ionic strength from 0 03 to 0 1 m or the presence of the citric acid had little effect on the p release in all the tested biochars from the p release behavior of different biochar under the simulated environment conditions it is found that lts could not only substantially increase the soluble p in e700 but also remain enough long chain poly p in e700 to complex with ca2 in soil solution both of which could result in the increased p availability in e700 in this study the highest activation temperature was limited to 120 c as this temperature is easily accessible in industry higher steam activation temperature 120 c may lead to higher p availability in ebpr sludge biochar and higher amount of ortho p formed this can be further tested in future studies through this study the general release pattern of biochar p could be obtained given that the simulated environment cannot fully represent the actual environment the potential different effects on biochar p release are discussed here firstly the release rate of biochar p in simulated condition could be higher than that in actual condition as the batch experiment system was more cater to the mass transfer than the soil environment secondly our study focused on the p release from biochar to porewater and the re adsorption of the released p to soil was not considered here therefore soil composition and property could be a crucial factor that affects the fate of biochar p in soil thirdly microorganisms are indispensable component in soil and they could play a vital role on biochar p transformation qian et al 2018 thus the release behavior of biochar p in actual soil porewater could be more complicated 4 conclusions ebpr sludge biochar contains a considerable amount of poly p in addition to ortho p and pyro p most poly p was readily soluble p in e400 while for e700 poly p could be presented in both readily soluble p fraction and alkaline insoluble p fraction i e hcl p and res p lts activation could significantly increase the p availability in ebpr sludge biochar which mainly caused by the hydrolysis of the insoluble condensed p in biochar to soluble ortho p and pyro p except tp release from e400lt the release of p species in different biochar was hardly affected by the environmental ph the presence of ca2 substantially decreased the tp release from e400 under the neutral and slightly alkaline condition but it had no effect on the p release from e700 and e700lt ionic strength of the soil porewater and low molecular weight acid had negligible effect on the p release in all the tested biochars compared to other three types of biochar e700lt is considered the best candidate as p fertilizer due to its unaffected p release under various environmentally relevant conditions declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial

18688,the property and release behavior of phosphorus in biochar derived from enhanced biological phosphorus removal sludge ebpr sludge were investigated a low temperature steam lts activation method was developed to increase the p availability in the biochar the results demonstrate that the p content in the biochar is comparable to that in typical p fertilizers the biochar contained a considerable portion of fast release p polyphosphates poly p were the predominant p species in the biochar lts greatly improved p availability in biochar produced at 700 c by hydrolyzing insoluble poly p to soluble pyro p and ortho p in addition the presence of ca2 could greatly reduce the p release from biochar produced at lower temperature e g 400 c due to that ca2 could facilitate the precipitation adsorption of orthophosohates pyrophosphates released from the low temperature biochars such phenomena was not observed with high temperature biochar as the soluble poly p released from 700 c biochar could complex with ca2 rather than precipitated with it other environmental conditions i e environmental ph ionic strength of the soil porewater and presence of low molecular weight acid only had minor or negligible effects on the p release of most studied biochars this study concludes that lts activated 700 c biochar could be a promising p fertilizer given its high rapid and unaffected p release under various environmentally relevant conditions graphical abstract image 1 keywords ebpr sludge phosphorus recovery biochar phosphorus availability low temperature steam activation 31p nmr 1 introduction enhanced biological phosphorus removal ebpr is an efficient economical and environmental friendly phosphorus p removal process which is being widely applied in many wastewater treatment plants worldwide liu et al 2007 martín et al 2006 the high p removal efficiency of ebpr is attributed to the luxury p uptake by a group of polyphosphate accumulating organisms paos unlike ordinary heterotrophic organisms in sludge which acquire p only for the synthesis of their cells constituents hauduc et al 2013 paos can also store excess p inside their cell as polyphosphates poly p therefore ebpr sludge contains higher p than the conventional sludge 5 8 vs 1 2 huang and tang 2015 huang et al 2015 qian and jiang 2014 tchobanoglous et al 2003 so far many techniques were developed to recover p from ebpr sludge e g direct application of ebpr sludge on land chemical precipitation of p from anaerobic digester liquor melia et al 2017 and thermal treatment of ebpr sludge to release p for further recovery desmidt et al 2014 gerba and smith 2005 the p recovery efficiency of above methods are estimated to be 100 3 30 and 90 petzet and cornel 2013 respectively pyrolysis of ebpr sludge and then applying the solid products i e biochar to the soil could be a sustainable way for p recovery this approach has many advantages it can effectively deactivate the microorganisms in the sludge substantially reduce the sludge volume desmidt et al 2014 generate valuable products e g bio oil galandak and racstain 1979 samolada and zabaniotou 2014 avoid uncontrollable emissions of ch4 nh3 and n2o during the storage transport and application of sludge willén et al 2016 the produced biochar could be a useful soil remediation material to sequester carbon immobilize inorganic and organic pollutants in soil lehmann and joseph 2009 more importantly p in the sludge could be concentrated in the biochar during this process which enables the ebpr sludge biochar to be a potential p fertilizer so far numerous studies have investigated p in the conventional sludge biochars huang and tang 2015 qian and jiang 2014 steckenmesser et al 2017 sun et al 2018 xu et al 2015 however little is known about p in ebpr sludge biochar ebpr sludge contains higher p than conventional sludge does and the proportion of the poly p in ebpr sludge could be much higher than that in conventional sludge seviour et al 2003 thus the structures of p compounds in the ebpr sludge biochar and the release behavior of these p compounds may be also different from those p compounds in the conventional sludge biochar lehmann and joseph 2009 therefore it is crucial to understand the property of p species in ebpr sludge biochar for its application the speciation and release pattern of p in biochar are important factors in deciding the quality of biochar based p fertilizer it was found that the p species in conventional sludge biochar are orthophosphates ortho p pyrophosphates pyro p and poly p with different chain length among which ortho p and pyro p are the main p forms of the soluble and extractable p huang and tang 2015 qian and jiang 2014 the pyrolysis condition of the biochar especially the pyrolysis temperature plays a decisive role on the speciation of biochar p the higher the pyrolysis temperature the lower the availability of the biochar p qian and jiang 2014 in addition to p speciation the release pattern of the biochar p can also be affected by the environmental condition such as soil ph ionic strength of the porewater the type of co existing ions in the porewater and ambient temperature qian et al 2013 sun et al 2018 xu et al 2015 another critical concern for biochar p is that how to increase the availability of p in biochar if the availability of p could be significantly improved the feasibility of p recovery method by pyrolysis would be greatly enhanced however only a few studies have reported this issue matsuo 1996 thomsen et al 2017 matsuo 1996 found that hot water could substantially improve the solubility of p in the incineration ash of ebpr sludge although this is a green and effective method to increase the availability of p it is not suitable for land application of biochar p as it is problematic to operate onsite ideally the activation of the biochar p should be completed prior to the land application thomsen et al 2017 adopted a post oxidation method on municipal sewage sludge biochar to increase p availability however their method may not work on ebpr sludge biochar as the sludge p in their study was mainly composed of chemical precipitated p the p property of the resultant biochar in their study could be different from that of ebpr sludge biochar therefore new environmental friendly and cost effective activation techniques are still needed to enhance the p avaliability of ebpr sludge biochar to understand the p properties in ebpr sludge biochar two ebpr sludge biochars i e biochar produced at 400 c denoted as e400 and biochar produced at 700 c denoted as e700 were prepared field emission scanning electron microscopy fesem and energy dispersive x ray spectrometry edx x ray powder diffraction xrd and sequential extraction combined with liquid state and solid state 31p nuclear magnetic resonance 31p nmr were applied to reveal the structures of p compounds in ebpr sludge biochar soil ph is a pivotal factor that affecting nutrient availability schoenholtz et al 2000 ionic strength of the porewater and the cations and anions of low molecular weight acid in porewater are important ionic environments influencing p adsorption and desoption lü et al 2017 rajan and fox 1972 to explore the effects of these environmental conditions on the release of p the release amount of p in different simulated porewater was determined and several statistical analyses were conducted to enhance the availability of p in ebpr sludge biochar the low temperature steam lts 130 c which is easily accessible in industry was used to replace hot water to activate p in ebpr sludge biochar to investigate the feasibility of the activated ebpr sludge biochar as the p fertilizer the lts activated biochar was also subjected to all the above mentioned characterization methods and experiments this study provides essential information about p in ebpr sludge biochar investigates the potential of lts activation to promote p release and highlights the feasibility of ebpr sludge biochar as a p fertilizer 2 materials and methods 2 1 preparation and low temperature stream lts activation of biochar ebpr sludge was collected from two ebpr reactors shen et al 2017 the main composition of the simulated wastewater is shown in s1 in supporting information si after the supernatant was removed the sludge from the two reactors was mixed dried at 60 c ground and sieved through a 250 μm mesh the ebpr sludge biochars i e e400 and e700 were prepared by the methods listed in si s1 after cooling down the prepared biochar was also ground and passed through a 250 μm mesh the yield of e400 e700 was calculated from the weight of the ebpr sludge and the weight of the residual i e e400 or e700 after pyrolysis all chemicals in this study are analytical reagent and purchased from vwr unless otherwise described 2 2 low temperature steam lts activation of biochar the biochar i e e400 or e700 was added into a glass container and covered with aluminum foil to ensure being fully contacted with the steam biochar was evenly spread about 1 mm thick on the bottom of the container then the container was placed in an autoclave to conduct lts activation five activation temperatures i e 60 80 100 110 and 120 c were chosen for lts activation for the activation temperature of 60 80 and 100 c only one incubation time i e 0 5 h was applied while for the activation temperature of 110 and 120 c three duration times i e 0 5 1 and 2 h were applied after cooling down samples were taken out and used for experiments p release from biochar with different lts treatment was tested by the method s2 in si 2 3 p release kinetics from biochar thirty six erlenmeyer flasks containing 40 ml of 0 03 m nacl solution buffered with 10 mm 3 n morpholino propanesulfonic acid mops 99 5 sigma aldrich ph 7 0 were prepared 0 03 m nacl represents the typical ion strength of the soil solution chen et al 2017 cheng et al 2016 luo et al 2017 in each flask 20 0 5 mg of the raw biochar e400 or e700 was added the mixed samples were shaken at 130 rpm and 23 2 c in a shaker at certain time interval three flasks three replicates were taken out and the samples were settled down for several minutes the supernatant in each flask was withdrawn and passed through a 0 45 μm nylon filter and the solution was used for the determination of ortho p and total phosphates tp the determination methods of ortho p and tp are shown in si s2 the amount of released p at each time interval q i mg g 1 can be obtained by eq 1 1 q i c i v m where c i is the p i e ortho p or tp concentration at each time interval v l is the volume of the solution and m g is the amount of biochar in the solution 2 4 characterization of raw and lts treated biochar the content of p in ebpr sludge the content of p k ca na mg al fe in the biochar e400 and e700 was obtained by measuring the concentration of these elements in the digested solution of biochar the digestion method was according to epa 3050a and the elemental concentrations except for p concentration were determined by icp oes perkinelmer optima 8000 usa the concentration of p was determined by the molybdate ascorbic acid method morphology of biochar was characterized by fesem jeol jsm 7200f operated with the secondary electron detector under accelerating voltage of 15 kv and edx aztec standard xmax50 prior to imaging biochar sample was mounted on the sample support with carbon stick tape and sputter coated with a layer of platinum p compounds in the biochar were characterized by the xrd analysis using bruker axs d8 advance diffractometer with cu ka radiation 40 kv and 40 ma before analysis the biochar sample was ground to fine powder by agate mortar and pestle the xrd spectrum was analyzed by mdi jade 6 0 software functional groups of biochar were characterized by the fourier transform infrared ftir analysis using a ftir spectrometer perkinelmer spectrum gx detailed method for sample preparation can be found in si s3 2 5 sequential extraction and 31p nmr spectrometry analysis sequential extraction was performed according to the method of turner and leytem 2004 with some modification briefly the biochar was sequentially extracted by 0 5 m nahco3 solution 48 h 0 5 m naoh 0 05 m edta solution 16 h and 1 m hcl solution 16 h the solid to liquid ratio was 1 250 1 50 and 1 100 for nahco3 naoh edta and hcl extraction respectively the supernatant of each extraction was collected and passed through the 0 45 μm filter to obtain the solution for the liquid state 31p nmr analysis and tp determination to prepare the samples for liquid state 31p nmr analysis the solution was freeze dried for two days and the dried extract was re dissolved in a solution containing 1 m naoh and 0 1 m edta with the solid to liquid ratio of 1 10 deuterium oxide was used for the signal lock the 31p nmr spectrum of the liquid sample was obtained using a bruker 500 ultrashield nmr spectrometer operating at 500 mhz at 24 c the pulse width of 90 an acquisition time of 0 33 s a relaxation delay time of 5s and scan times of 600 were applied 85 h3po4 was used as the external standard to characterize the p species remaining in biochar alkali insoluble p after the first two extractions a portion of the solid sample was withdrawn after the first two extractions then washed with deionized water for several times and dried at 60 c and finally analyzed by solid state 31p nmr spectrometry 31p nmr spectra were recorded on a bruker avance iii 400 mhz wide bore nmr spectrometer operating at 162 0 mhz the spectra were collected using a 4 mm cp mas probe with the repetition time of 2s and 400 scans and 85 h3po4 solution was used as an external standard mestrenova version 12 0 4 software was used for data analysis integration and deconvolution were conducted with mestrenova to obtain the peak area of each p group 2 6 effects of environmental factors on the release of biochar p the effects of some common environmental factors i e environmental ph co existing ca2 ionic strength and co existing of low molecular organic acid were investigated in this experiment solid to liquid ratio oscillating speed of the shaker reaction temperature reaction time and sampling method were the same as those in the experiment of release of p from biochar with different lts treatment si s3 to investigate the ph effects two 0 03 m nacl solution with different ph i e 5 0 and 8 0 were prepared two buffers i e 4 morpholineethanesulfonic acid mes and tris hydroxymethyl aminomethane hydrochloride tris hcl were added to the two nacl solution with the ultimate concentration of 0 01 m to control the solution ph at 5 0 and 8 0 respectively ca2 is a prevalent cation in soil porewater and ca2 and p species could have different affinity at different environmental ph thus the release of p with the presence of ca2 under different environmental ph was studied three types of solution containing 0 0015 m cacl2 and 0 026 m nacl buffered with mes ph 5 0 mops ph 7 0 and tris hcl ph 8 0 respectively were used the 0 0015 m cacl2 concentration is the medium value of ca2 concentration in the soil porewater ulrich and sumner 2012 and 0 026 m nacl was added to ensure the ionic strength of the solution was close to 0 03 m to study the effects from ionic strength as well as low molecular organic acid solution containing 0 1 m nacl buffered with 0 01 m mops ph 7 0 and solution containing 0 01 m citric acid and 0 03 m nacl and buffered with 0 01 m mops ph 7 0 were prepared 2 5 statistical analysis several parametric and non parametric statistical analysis were applied to the data according to the normality of the data and the homogeneity of the variance one way anova analysis tukey test welch s one way anova analysis games howell test or kruskal wallis anova analysis pairwise comparison were applied to screen lts activation and study the effect of ph on biochar p release two sample t test or mann whitney u test were used to investigate the changes on p fractions of biochar before and after the lts activation as well as the effect of ca2 ionic strength and low molecular organic acid on biochar p release all statistical analysis was conducted with spss 17 0 for windows significance was accepted at p 0 05 level 3 results and discussion 3 1 main elements in ebpr sludge biochar nutrient elemental content is an essential parameter to evaluate if the biochar is a suitable fertilizer the contents of the main elements in the biochar were determined and listed in table 1 the main nutrient elements in the ebpr sludge biochar are p k na ca and mg among which p is the most abundant nutrient element p content in ebpr sludge was 78 9 mg g 1 and the yield of e400 and e700 were 46 9 and 39 1 respectively the p content in e400 and e700 were estimated to be 168 1 and 201 8 mg g 1 respectively if no p was lost during the pyrolysis from table 1 it is found that p content in e400 and e700 were 157 2 and 192 1 mg g 1 respectively these results indicate that although there was minor p loss during the pyrolysis more than 90 of p in ebpr sludge could be retained in biochar the p content in e400 and e700 is much higher than that in other sludge derived biochar 10 80 mg g 1 huang and tang 2015 qian and jiang 2014 steckenmesser et al 2017 sun et al 2018 xu et al 2015 it is also comparable to the p content of typical p fertilizers 80 250 mg g 1 desmidt et al 2014 by comparing the molar quantity of each element in the biochar it is found that the molar quantities of k and mg are much higher than those of ca and na thus it can be deduced that mg and k could be the main metals associated with p in ebpr sludge biochar 3 2 release kinetics of p in e400 e700 and screening of the activation condition for lts activated biochars fig 1 depicts the release kinetics of ortho p and tp from e400 and e700 in 96 h the release of ortho p and tp from e400 and e700 almost reached the equilibrium at 48 h thus the reaction time for the following experiment was set to 48 h this result indicates that ebpr sludge biochar contained a considerable portion of fast release p the low release of ortho p from both e400 5 and e700 1 suggests that the p species in the ebpr sludge biochar were mainly condensed p i e pyrophosphates and poly p to improve the p availability in ebpr sludge biochar lts activation was performed on ebpr sludge biochar the amount of released ortho p and tp from each biochar with different activation temperature and time is shown in fig 2 generally there was an increase in the release of ortho p and tp from the biochar with the increase of activation temperature and time to screen the activation conditions for the biochar the multiple comparison table s1 was conducted on the data as shown in fig 2a and b no significant increase on ortho p and tp release from e400 when the activation temperature increased from 100 to 120 c thus 100 c and 0 5 h were chosen as the lts activation condition for e400 and e400 activated under this condition is denoted as e400lt fig 2d illustrates that the tp release from e700 with the activation temperature of 110 and 120 c was significantly higher than that from e700 with the activation temperature of 60 80 and 100 c moreover the tp release from e700 could be enhanced considerably when the activation time increased from 1 to 2 h thus 110 c and 2 h were chosen as the lts activation condition for e700 and e700 activated under this condition is denoted as e700lt at 48 h the released ortho p and tp from e400lt were 38 8 and 107 4 mg g 1 respectively fig 2a and b and the two types of p from e700lt were 49 6 and 112 3 mg g 1 respectively fig 2c and d compared with tp released from e400 and e700 tp released from e400lt and e700lt increased by 16 7 and 82 6 respectively these results indicate that the lts activation is an effective method to increase the availability of p in ebpr sludge biochar especially for the p in e700 the substantial increase on ortho p in each biochar after lts activation could be caused by the hydrolysis of the condensed p this hypothesis will be discussed further in the following sections 3 3 the morphology and xrd analysis of different biochars the morphology of e400 e700 e400lt and e700lt is shown in fig 3 plenty of round particles were embedded in the surface of e400 fig 3a the edx result figs s1 s4 shows that the elements in the particles were o c p k mg na and ca and the p content was more than 13 wt compared with e400 less p containing particles were observed on the surface of e700 fig 3b which suggests that some p containing particles could be trapped in the pores of the biochar after being activated round shape p containing particles became flower like structure fig 3c and d this could be due to the change on the crystal structure of the p containing compounds on the surface of e400lt many small pores which had been occupied by the p containing particles appeared this could facilitate the release of p located in the inner pores of the biochar however few pores could be found on the surface of e700lt this could be caused by the crack of the pore structure when the sludge was pyrolyzed at high temperature i e 700 c lehmann and joseph 2009 the p species in different biochars were preliminarily analyzed by xrd spectrometry for e400 and e400lt no peak was found in their xrd spectra data are not shown indicating that the p species in e400 and e400lt were amorphous for e700 and e700lt several peaks arose from their xrd spectra fig 3e these peaks except for the peak located at 29 5 were attributed to the characteristic peaks of kmg po3 3 fig 3f indicating the presence of kmg po3 3 in e700 and e700lt although the peak at 29 5 is obvious it is hard to identify the compound with a single peak as the xrd analysis cannot reveal the form of the amorphous p species in biochar advanced characterization methods i e liquid state and solid state 31p nmr spectrometry combined with the sequential extraction method were applied to characterize the p species in biochar details can be found in the next section 3 4 sequential extraction and 31p nmr combined analysis to simplify the extraction procedure three types of extraction solution i e 0 5 m nahco3 0 5 m naoh 0 05 m edta and 1 m hcl were used to categorize the biochar p into four fractions namely 1 readily soluble p nahco3 p i e nahco3 extractable p 2 p associated with amorphous iron aluminum and organic matter naoh edta p 3 insoluble ca containing phosphates hcl p and 4 stable organic p res p i e the p cannot be extracted by the solutions of 0 5 m nahco3 0 5 m naoh 0 05 m edta and 1 m hcl hedley et al 1982 pansu and gautheyrou 2006 according to p extractability nahco3 p and naoh edta p were characterized by liquid state 31p nmr as poly p can be easily hydrolyzed in acidic solution van wazer et al 1955 hcl p and res p were characterized by the solid state 31p nmr fig 4 shows the 31p nmr spectra of nahco3 p readily soluble p of different biochar the peaks are generally distributed in three locations they are assigned to ortho p from 3 6 to 6 0 ppm terminal p groups terminal p from 4 0 to 5 0 ppm and mid chain p groups of poly p from 18 2 to 22 7 ppm turner et al 2003 for the terminal p groups the two peaks at the low field from 4 0 to 4 7 ppm are assigned to the terminal p of poly p and the peak at the high field is attributed to pyro p from 4 25 to 5 0 ppm huang and tang 2015 the result indicates that the nahco3 p i e readily soluble p in the ebpr sludge biochar includes ortho p pyro p and poly p the peak area of an nmr signal is always used for semi quantification and quantification analysis as it is proportional to the amount of nuclei present james 1998 in this study as the specific structure of poly p in biochar is not clear semi quantification of the p groups rather than the specific p compounds was conducted given that the peaks of terminal p are not strong enough for deconvolution fig 4a the molar ratio of ortho p to terminal p plus pyro p ortho p terminal p pyro p which was obtained from the ratio of the peak area of ortho p to those of terminal p plus pyro p was applied to study the transformation of p species under different conditions fig 4a and b illustrate that the ortho p terminal p pyro p ratio of e700 0 08 is much lower than that of e400 0 23 suggesting that the poly p released from e700 had longer chain than that from e400 after lts activation the ortho p terminal p pyro p of e400 increased from 0 23 to 1 22 and that of e700 increased from 0 08 to 1 78 fig 4c and d indicating that a considerable proportion of poly p and pyro p in biochar could be hydrolyzed after lts activation the peaks assigned to terminal p in fig 4c and d illustrate that most of the nahco3 extractable poly p in e400 was hydrolyzed during lts activation while there still existed a portion of nahco3 extractable poly p remained in e700lt as the short chain poly p is much more easily hydrolyzed than the long chain poly p huang et al 2018 the nahco3 extractable poly p in e700 could have longer chain than that in e400 unlike the condition for readily soluble p only ortho p the peak around 6 1 ppm and pyro p the peak around 4 1 ppm were detected in the naoh edta p of these biochars fig s5 as the molar ratios of fe to p and al to p in each biochar are no more than 1 100 table 1 it is probably that most naoh edta p of the studied biochar belongs to the p adsorbed on the functional groups thus the absence of the poly p in this p fraction implies that poly p was hardly adsorbed on biochar surface fig s5 also displays that the molar ratio of ortho p to pyro p ortho p pyro p of e400lt 0 37 in the naoh edta solution was lower than that of e400 0 58 and the ortho p pyro p of e700lt 0 45 in the naoh edta solution was almost equal to that of e700 0 46 these results indicate that the proportion of pyro p adsorbed on the biochar did not decrease after lts activation which seems inconsistent with the substantial increase of the ortho p the possible explanation is that pyro p was more easily adsorbed on the biochar surface compared to ortho p as the charge of the pyro p species i e hp2o7 3 and p2o7 4 was higher than that of ortho p species i e h2po4 and hpo4 2 at the same environmental ph qian et al 2013 the p species which could not be released in the first two extractions i e hcl p and res p denoted as alkali insoluble p was analyzed by the solid state 31p nmr spectrometry as shown in fig 5 the solid state 31p nmr spectra of alkali insoluble p in each biochar can be deconvoluted into several peaks for e400 fig 5a pyro p 5 7 ppm and ortho p 5 7 ppm were the main alkali insoluble p as the proportion of the peak area 2 6 of the mid chain p 11 7 ppm is very low for e700 fig 5b only mid chain p the peaks between 11 3 and 21 8 ppm could be found in the spectrum which indicates that the dominant alkali insoluble p in e700 was the cyclic poly p when e400 was activated by lts the peak belongs to mid chain p cannot be observed fig 5c indicating the hydrolysis of the poly p occurred during lts activation by comparing the proportion of the peak area of ortho p and pyro p in e400 and e400lt it is found that lts activation only had limited effect on the alkali insoluble p in e400 when e700 was activated by lts the characteristic peak of terminal p 5 9 ppm arose from the spectrum and the characteristic peaks of mid chain p 11 3 and 24 5 ppm substantially reduced fig 5d this result indicates that lts activation could enable a large portion of cyclic poly p in e700 transformed into linear poly p and pyro p the characterization of the p species in ebpr sludge biochar demonstrates that poly p with different structure long chain short chain and cyclic structure accounted for a large share of the p species in ebpr sludge biochar which is different from the structures in conventional sludge biochar in previous studies for conventional sludge biochar the dominant p species are ortho p and pyro p huang and tang 2015 qian and jiang 2014 this phenomenon may be caused by the high tp and poly p content in ebpr sludge the characterization results also show that most poly p in e400 was readily soluble poly p nahco3 p and they could be easily transformed into ortho p and pyro p during lts activation while in e700 poly p could be presented in both readily soluble p fraction and alkali insoluble p fraction including hcl p and res p unlike the readily soluble poly p in e400 some readily soluble poly p in e700 could remain stable under lts activation the hydrolysis of alkali insoluble poly p in e700 in lts could be the main reason for the large increase of p availability in e700 3 5 mechanism of lts activation on the enhancement of p availability the liquid state and solid state 31p nmr analysis could only provide the structure change of the p species however the migration pattern of the p species among different fractions which induced by lts activation cannot be obtained by the two methods to further investigate the lts activation mechanism the amount of tp released from the biochar in each extraction step was determined fig 6 compared with e400 and e700 nahco3 p in e400lt and e700lt was significantly increased by 10 3 and 26 9 respectively this indicates that some stable p species in ebpr sludge biochar could be transformed into readily soluble p after lts activation it is observed that the increase rates of readily soluble p i e nahco3 p in e400 and e700 caused by lts activation were not as high as those in the experiment with 0 03 m nacl as extracting solution figs 1 and 2 in which the increase rates were 16 7 and 82 6 respectively this phenomenon could be due to the different release behavior of some p species in biochar in different solution this also implies that in addition to the activation conditions the enhancing effect of lts activation on biochar p release could also be affected by the property of soil solution for naoh edta p hcl p and res p in e400 no significant changes are observed after lts activation fig 6 and the inserted table this result indicates that only a small portion of naoh edta p hcl p or res p in e400 could be transformed into nahco3 p by lts activation the limited activation effect of lts on the p availability of e400 could be due to that most of the poly p in e400 was already in soluble form for e700 and e700lt amount of naoh edta p and res p was found similar in both e700 and e700lt the inserted table in fig 6 however the amount of hcl p in e700lt is statistically lower than that in e700 this indicates that the increased nahco3 p in e700lt was mainly derived from the alkali insoluble p in e700 which is also in agreement with the result of the solid the solid state 31p nmr from the noticeable decrease on the peaks located at 11 0 and 24 5 ppm in 31p nmr spectrum fig 5d it can be concluded that the hydrolysis of the insoluble cyclic poly p was the main reason for the increase of nahco3 p in e700 these results imply that lts activation could be more applicable to increase the p availability in ebpr sludge biochar produced at high temperature rather than those produced at low temperature and conventional sludge biochar as neither ebpr sludge biochar produced at low temperature nor conventional sludge biochar contains high proportion of insoluble poly p 3 6 effects of environmental factors on p release the effects of environmental conditions on the release of biochar p were investigated and shown in fig 7 fig s7 and table s2 as shown in fig 7 dash line and table s2 except for tp release from e400lt the environmental ph only had minor or little effect on the p release from the studied biochars the obvious decrease of tp released from e400lt with the increase of the enviromental ph could be caused by the adsorption of pyro p on the functional groups of biochar under ph 7 0 and 8 0 as ortho p and pyro p are the dominant soluble p species in e400lt fig 4c and the environmental ph had little effect on ortho p release from e400lt no significant changes on the p release from e700 and e700lt with the change of enviromental ph this could be caused by two factors on the one hand the amount of released pyro p from e700lt could be low or e700 contained less adsorption sites oxygen containing functional groups for pyro p compared to e400 which can be seen from the ftir spectra of e400 and e700 fig s6 given that the amount of released ortho p from e700 was less than 2 of the released tp in all the experiments in this study the ortho p release from e700 will not be discussed hereafter fig 7 the solid line and table s2 also display that the presence of 0 0015 m of ca2 simulated porewater had little effect on the release of ortho p and tp in e400 and e400lt when the environmental ph was at 5 0 when the environmental ph was at 7 0 the addition of ca2 significantly inhibited the release of ortho p and tp in e400 but still had little effect on the p release in e400lt this result shows that the p species in e400 could be more vulnerable to ca2 compared to that in e400lt by comparing the p species released from e400 and e400lt fig 4 it is found that e400 contained a large portion of soluble poly p while nearly no soluble poly p could be found in e400lt thus precipitation of the soluble poly p could be the main reason for the decrease of released tp from e400 lts activation could transform the poly p into ortho p and pyro p which could inhibit the formation of p precipitates when the environmental ph was at 8 0 the release of ortho p and tp in both e400 and e400lt was significantly inhibited by the addition of ca2 the results suggest the presence of ca2 is very crucial to the p availability under the slightly alkaline condition the ca2 induced reduction of ortho p and pyro p in e400lt could be caused by the precipitation and adsorption of the ortho p and pyro p on e400lt surface qian et al 2013 the addition of ca2 had little effect on the release of ortho p and tp from e700 and e700lt at any studied ph condition fig 7b and d and table s2 it is reported that some long chain poly p could provide the cage like sites to complex with ca2 dias filho et al 2005 van wazer and callis 1958 it is noted that there is only one type of poly p found in both e700 and e700lt fig 4 its complex with ca2 led to the unaffected p release for e700lt the complexation ability of the readily soluble poly p to ca2 is an advantage for e700 and e700lt as it could inhibit the p precipitation and enable e700 e700lt to be an efficient p fertilizer as e700lt had much higher available p than e700 did e700lt could be a more superior p fertilizer than e700 the effects of ionic strength of the soil porewater and the co existing low molecular weight acid on the p release can be found in fig s7 and table s2 it is clear that the change of the ionic strength from 0 03 to 0 1 m or the presence of the citric acid had little effect on the p release in all the tested biochars from the p release behavior of different biochar under the simulated environment conditions it is found that lts could not only substantially increase the soluble p in e700 but also remain enough long chain poly p in e700 to complex with ca2 in soil solution both of which could result in the increased p availability in e700 in this study the highest activation temperature was limited to 120 c as this temperature is easily accessible in industry higher steam activation temperature 120 c may lead to higher p availability in ebpr sludge biochar and higher amount of ortho p formed this can be further tested in future studies through this study the general release pattern of biochar p could be obtained given that the simulated environment cannot fully represent the actual environment the potential different effects on biochar p release are discussed here firstly the release rate of biochar p in simulated condition could be higher than that in actual condition as the batch experiment system was more cater to the mass transfer than the soil environment secondly our study focused on the p release from biochar to porewater and the re adsorption of the released p to soil was not considered here therefore soil composition and property could be a crucial factor that affects the fate of biochar p in soil thirdly microorganisms are indispensable component in soil and they could play a vital role on biochar p transformation qian et al 2018 thus the release behavior of biochar p in actual soil porewater could be more complicated 4 conclusions ebpr sludge biochar contains a considerable amount of poly p in addition to ortho p and pyro p most poly p was readily soluble p in e400 while for e700 poly p could be presented in both readily soluble p fraction and alkaline insoluble p fraction i e hcl p and res p lts activation could significantly increase the p availability in ebpr sludge biochar which mainly caused by the hydrolysis of the insoluble condensed p in biochar to soluble ortho p and pyro p except tp release from e400lt the release of p species in different biochar was hardly affected by the environmental ph the presence of ca2 substantially decreased the tp release from e400 under the neutral and slightly alkaline condition but it had no effect on the p release from e700 and e700lt ionic strength of the soil porewater and low molecular weight acid had negligible effect on the p release in all the tested biochars compared to other three types of biochar e700lt is considered the best

introduction antibiotics are considered the most effective pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases the application of modern technologies and laboratory techniques has led to the development of many synthetically modified derivatives of known antibiotics and the discovery of several fully synthetic broad spectrum antibiotics unrelated to compounds in the natural environment e g sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones bérdy 2012 however only one really novel antibiotic i e teixobactin has been discovered in the last 30 years piddock 2015 the great success of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections in medicine prompted their extensive use in several other fields this has resulted in the usage of millions of metric tons of antibiotics in the last 60 years davies and davies 2010 various classes of antibiotics are widely used in agricultural practice as therapeutic or prophylactic agents or as growth promoters in animal husbandry lipsitch et al 2002 there is now considerable evidence for the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in medicine and veterinary practice arnold and straus 2005 wayne et al 2011 unfortunately high market demands coupled with poorly controlled utilization of these pharmaceuticals has led to the accelerated development and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args amongst bacteria antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotics are now considered a novel class of emerging pollutants that pose a serious risk to both animal and public health petrie et al 2015 pruden et al 2006 von wintersdorff et al 2016 bacterial resistance to antibiotics can be intrinsic and non specific which is mainly a consequence of the cell wall structure jarlier and nikaido 1994 type of cellular respiration meylan et al 2017 or capsule production campos et al 2004 on the other hand specific resistance is linked to the presence of args von wintersdorff et al 2016 antibiotic resistance genes have become highly abundant mainly due to their mobility within bacterial microbiocenoses their frequent association with mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids integrons and transposable elements assists their dissemination frost et al 2005 mges can even translocate between taxonomically remote strains of bacteria and thus horizontal gene transfer is considered the most important factor responsible for the spread of args in the environment hegstad et al 2010 moreover it has been shown that distinct stress factors like toxic metals or antibacterial biocides may also promote the dispersal of various args via the phenomenon of co selection since genes conferring resistance to these compounds frequently co localize with args within mges kiran et al 2015 amongst various pristine and anthropogenically shaped environments wastewater treatment plants wwtps are recognized as a location where microorganisms are subjected to numerous environmental stressors this leads to the selection of microbial opportunists including multidrug resistant bacteria that can survive exposure to various toxic compounds tello et al 2012 wwtps are considered point sources of accumulated and diverse emerging pollutants including antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria and args guo et al 2017 these plants are also important interfaces between the human population and the environment akiba et al 2015 therefore there is a great need for the surveillance of args in wwtps in order to assess the epidemiological risk of these emerging pollutants in urban environments research examining the occurrence and diversity of args in other environments including pristine regions e g arctic permafrost deep oceans and subsurface waters can provide some insight into the evolutionary origin of antibiotic resistance such studies are becoming increasingly popular d costa et al 2011 martínez 2008 zhang et al 2018 thus suitable scientific tools are needed to give reliable results that may provide a broader view of this phenomenon in the future two main methodological approaches have been employed for the identification of args and resistant bacteria classical i e culture based and molecular i e culture independent since less than 1 of known bacterial species can be cultivated culture based methods are strongly biased which is a major limitation amann et al 1995 in contrast molecular based techniques like metagenomics or polymerase chain reaction pcr screening are significantly less biased these methods permit a detailed insight into microbial diversity and the occurrence of particular genes including args in different environments following the introduction of pcr in 1983 the rapid identification of args in nosocomial and non nosocomial environments and bacteria became possible templeton 1992 in these early studies individual nucleotide sequences of args were used as a template to design primers for pcr which strongly influenced the results obtained the development of next generation sequencing methods two decades later led to the discovery of numerous arg variants hugenholtz and tyson 2008 schmieder and edwards 2012 multiple alignments of related arg sequences identified conserved regions to which consensus primers were designed which significantly increased the chances of amplifying more arg variants and reduced overall pcr bias currently the presence of antibiotic resistance genes is mainly monitored by applying pcr based methods after several years of using pcr to screen for args hundreds of primer pairs have been described in the scientific literature a common question from microbiologists in various fields is how do i choose the best pcr primer pair for the detection of particular args in light of the emerging threats linked with the environmental dissemination of antimicrobial resistance we believe that it is crucial to gather args specific pcr primers and systematically analyze them to determine which are most suitable to reliably monitor the distribution of these genes in various environments therefore the aim of this study was to develop a literature based and curated primers database for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes lcpdb arg this primers database available at the following urls lcpdb ddg biol uw edu pl and lcpdb ddlemb com was designed to facilitate pcr monitoring of the occurrence and diversity of various args in environmental and clinical samples moreover for each analyzed primer pair values for the specificity efficacy and taxonomic efficacy were calculated these parameters were used applying a developed model success metric to prepare primer pair rankings that facilitate the selection of the optimal primers for the identification of particular args by pcr the lcpdb arg database is addressed to the needs of i scientists working in the area of antibiotic resistance surveillance in various environments including wwtps urban areas and pristine environments ii medical centers and public health institutes that routinely track args e g in clinical samples and food products using pcr based methods and iii institutions working on the development of strategies to reduce the abundance of args in the environment we believe that the lcpdb arg project fits into the one health perspective as an initiative enabling the further development of reliable arg monitoring strategies that can be applied in various sectors although there are several databases gathering pcr primers e g pattyn et al 2006 wang et al 2012 to our knowledge the lcpdb arg is the only one comprised of primers for the detection of args in addition none of the other databases offers an internal validation model that enables the quantified ranking of primer pairs that facilitates selection of the best possible pcr primers for a particular purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 literature review for the identification of pcr primers for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes initially scientific literature in the pubmed google scholar and google graphics databases was screened using text searches with queries created from combinations of the words pcr and the names of particular antibiotic resistance genes e g teta for which a reference sequence is available in the bacterial antimicrobial resistance reference gene database barrgdb ncbi resource coordinators 2017 this led to the creation of a database of publications potentially containing data concerning pcr screening for args we then performed a thorough manual inspection of the gathered publications to extract metadata concerning arg specific pcr primers including the identity of the target gene the nucleotide sequence of the primers pcr conditions and the pcr amplicon size this step reduced the number of publications and primers significantly as in many published articles including their supplementary materials primer characteristics crucial for repeating the experiment were missing in the next step the list of primer pairs with complete metadata was filtered to remove duplicates and unique numbers were assigned to each primer this manually curated list of primers was used for all analyses described in this study original literature references for each pcr primer pair included in the lcpdb arg are presented online in the database 2 2 development of the uniprival universal primer validator tool for primer pair benchmarking to perform in silico benchmarking of pcr primer pairs the uniprival tool was developed in python v3 4 this tool instructs nucleotide basic local alignment search tool blastn altschul et al 1990 to use primer sequences as queries to search selected databases or fasta files with parameters optimized for short query sequences i e word size 6 e value 10 000 reward for positive match 1 penalty for mismatch 2 penalty for gap opening 5 penalty for gap extension 3 maximum number of aligned sequences to keep 10 000 minimum query coverage per high scoring segment pair hsp 75 as an input uniprival takes a tab delimited mapping file that consists of primer pairs with their names corresponding sequences acquired product size and its possible deviation this file is parsed and each primer from each pair is used as an individual query during the blastn search for degenerate primers all variant sequences are submitted individually to allow appropriate blastn searches next the search results are screened so that only genuine products of in silico amplification 3 end of each primer aligned both primers aligned in correct orientation and the pcr product has the anticipated size are retained and provided in the resulting summary file 2 3 calculating specificity s efficacy e and taxonomic efficacy te parameters while running the uniprival tool two public databases were used the bacteria antibiotic resistance reference gene database barrgdb and ncbi nt database as of august 8th 2018 further referred to as the r and nt databases respectively the r database was extended through the blastn search against the nt database with 90 sequence identity and 90 query coverage as hsp thresholds this allowed us to identify homologous arg sequences in the nt database and expanded the sequence diversity for each arg resulting in an extended reference sequence set named er this also permitted the identification of bacterial taxa possessing particular args and resulted in a database of taxa carrying the reference sequences named ert unique sequence variants for each arg were distinguished using vsearch v2 7 rognes et al 2016 and used to create a non redundant reference sequence database named nrer the benchmarking of primer pairs was then performed using uniprival with the reference datasets the specificity s efficacy e and taxonomic efficacy te parameters were calculated as follows a s i j is the specificity of primer pair i for the amplification of targeted arg j this parameter gives the percentage of the obtained pcr products that represents a variant of a targeted arg gene and not a random dna fragment it is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct in silico pcr products for particular primer pair i amplifying arg j using the nt database as a matrix cp i j nt i e true positives and the number of all in silico pcr products observed for this particular primer pair using the nt database as a matrix p i j nt i e true positives plus false positives 1 s i j c p i j n t p i j n t the correctness of in silico pcr products was verified through blastn searches using each pcr product as the query against er j in this search thresholds of 90 sequence identity and 90 query coverage per hsp were applied b e i j is the efficacy parameter of pcr primer pair i for amplification of the targeted arg j reflecting the effective amplification of all possible variants of the particular arg it is calculated as the ratio of the number of amplified variants of a particular arg using non redundant reference sequence database cp i j nrer j as a matrix and the number of variants of that gene present in the non redundant reference sequence database nrer j 2 e i j c p i j n r e r j n r e r j c te i j is the taxonomic efficacy parameter of primer pair i for the amplification of arg j reflecting the usefulness of the selected pcr primer pair for amplification of the targeted arg in bacteria classified within particular taxa it is calculated as the ratio of the number of taxa for which correct in silico pcr products were obtained for a particular arg using the nt database as a matrix cpt i j nt and the number of bacterial taxa carrying all possible variants of arg j within the extended reference sequences taxa database ert j 3 t e i j c p t i j nt e r t j currently the taxonomic efficacy parameter is calculated based on bacterial taxonomy at the family level moreover plasmids carrying args are considered as an additional group taxon during the calculations since these genetic elements may be hosted by bacteria belonging to various taxa a flowchart describing the implementation of the uniprival tool to obtain the specificity s efficacy e and taxonomic efficacy te parameters of each pcr primer pair is presented in fig 1 2 4 calculating the model success metric for the collected primer pairs to rank primer pairs collected in the lcpdb arg based on the s e and

the modified in reference to the confusion matrix accuracy parameter a i j the modified accuracy parameter itself is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct in silico pcr products for

metagenomes complete bacterial genomes and ncbi nt datasets for the validation of pcr primer pairs gathered in the lcpdb arg validations of the analyzed pcr primer pairs were conducted using metagenomic datasets downloaded from the ebi metagenomics database cook et al 2016 a dataset comprising 13 807 complete bacterial genomes retrieved from the ncbi genbank database as of march 25th 2019 and the ncbi nt database as of august 8th 2018 the metagenomes used are presented in table 1 all metagenomes were preprocessed with the program fastp v0 12 5 with trim poly x flag and subsequently assembled using metaspades v3 11 1 via spades py script with meta flag nurk et al 2017 the obtained contigs were then searched with the uniprival tool to check for the presence of the selected args 2 6 sample collection a sample of primary sludge was collected from the municipal and industrial wwtp located in oswiecim poland in november 2014 the wwtp has the capacity of about 53 400 m3 waste per day the sample 500 g in total was collected into sterile falcon tubes frozen in a portable freezer 20 c and transferred to the laboratory after centrifugation and removal of the supernatant the sludge sample was stored frozen 80 c before further processing 2 7 dna extraction total dna was extracted from 100 mg of primary sludge using a fast dna spin kit for feces mp biomedicals illkirch france according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna concentration was determined using the qubit 2 0 fluorometer invitrogen carlsbad ca usa 2 8 screening for antibiotic resistance genes in samples from oswiecim wwtp the occurrence of selected antibiotic resistance genes in oswiecim wwtp samples was investigated using pcr assays all pcrs were performed using 150 ng of template dna 10 pmol of each primer appendix table s1 with dreamtaq pcr master mix thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the pcr thermocycle program employed depended on the recommended annealing temperature for each primer pair appendix table s1 pcr products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1 5 agarose gels 2 9 standard molecular biology techniques it was impossible to perform direct sanger sequencing of pcr products obtained during screening for antibiotic resistance genes in oswiecim wwtp samples since they potentially represented a heterogenous mixture of dna fragments therefore pcr products of the correct size were excised from the agarose gel after electrophoresis purified using an agarose out dna purification kit eurx gdansk poland and then ligated to vector ptz57 r t thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and introduced into e coli dh5α via chemical transformation kushner 1978 dna of recombinant plasmids carrying the cloned pcr products was purified using a plasmid miniprep dna purification kit eurx gdansk poland and the inserts of several clones were sequenced using universal primers m13 puc with an abi prism 377 capillary dna analyzer applied biosystem foster city ca usa at the institute of biochemistry and biophysics polish academy of science oligo pl 3 results and discussion 3 1 construction and overall structure of the literature based and curated primers database for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes lcpdb arg the aim of this study was to create a database of pcr primers enabling the rapid and reliable detection of antibiotic resistance genes in various environmental and clinical samples this was assembled following a thorough scientific literature review and manual verification of each primer pair the literature based and curated primers database lcpdb arg is available under the following links lcpdb ddg biol uw edu pl and lcpdb ddlemb com currently the database contains 607 primer pairs for the amplification of 169 args conferring resistance to various classes of antibiotics including i aminoglycosides 16 pcr primer pairs ii amphenicols 20 iii β lactams 171 iv glycopeptides 33 v macrolides lincosamides streptogramines mls group 80 vi polymixins 8 vii quinolones 34 viii sulfonamides 59 and ix tetracyclines 171 other primer pairs were designed for the amplification of genes encoding multidrug efflux pumps conferring resistance to various antibiotics 15 pairs fig 2 the lcpdb arg is currently supplemented with literature references for all the gathered primers it also includes basic parameters of the primers length gc content and melting temperature in the future we plan to extend the database by adding further information such as whether a primer pair is suitable for qpcr analysis the database is also equipped with an internal ranking of the primer pairs according to their specificity s efficacy e and taxonomic efficacy te these parameters have been revalidated using the developed model success metric msm this information will facilitate selection of the most appropriate pcr primer pair for reliable experimental screening for args in various environments 3 1 1 the specificity s parameter the specificity s parameter gives the information about the fraction of the obtained pcr products that represent a variant of desired target gene rather than a randomly amplified dna fragment the specificity parameter ranges from 0 to 1 in value where 0 means a total lack of specificity and 1 reflects the highest specificity we found that 92 of the 607 analyzed primers have a specificity value of 0 which indicates that many published reports contain errors in most cases a low specificity value is due to an incorrectly annotated arg e g some teta gene primers are in fact specific for the tetc gene see section 3 3 another possible explanation for a low s parameter value is incorrect assignment of the pcr product size 24 607 primer pairs the correct amplicon size is crucial for determining whether the obtained pcr products correspond to the gene of interest and should be further analyzed the uniprival tool used for estimation of the s parameter can determine whether the amplicon size given in the literature is correct otherwise it returns a wrong product size w ps note in this situation we performed manual recalculation and correction of this value all of the other tested pcr primer pairs 491 607 have s parameter values of between 0 03 and 1 based on our observations we recommend that lcpdb arg users employ primers with the highest possible s parameter value in their experiments ideally 0 95 441 out of 607 tested primer pairs 3 1 2 the efficacy e parameter in the lcpdb arg the efficacy e parameter was established for every pcr primer pair to give the percentage of homologs of the particular arg that can be amplified efficacy e was calculated as the ratio of the correct in silico pcr products produced by a primer pair to the total number of homologs identified in the nt database fig 1 this parameter ranges in value between 0 and 1 and can vary significantly between different primer pairs designed to amplify a particular arg it is worth mentioning that during this analysis we found several primer pairs with an efficacy value of 0 even though the value of the s parameter was high this situation occurred when the expected amplicon size was at least 10 larger than the complete gene sequence e g when researchers wished to amplify the gene for further study and designed primers based on the proximal intergenic regions chatterjee et al 2016 hussein et al 2009 in these cases 18 607 primer pairs the e parameter values in the lcpdb arg were changed from 0 into the note binds outside the gene for the purpose of accurate arg screening we recommend the selection of primer pairs with the highest possible efficacy values or those with the note binds outside the gene if other parameters are satisfied this significantly reduces the chances of obtaining false negative results 3 1 3 the taxonomic efficacy te parameter environmental conditions can influence the taxonomic composition of a microbial community and the distribution of bacterial taxa between various environments fierer and jackson 2006 on the other hand taxon specific genomic features like distinct codon usage or gc content strongly influence the efficacy of pcr screening for genes of interest using particular primer pairs hildebrand et al 2010 to show how the efficacy of particular pcr primer pairs may be biased by the taxonomic composition within the analyzed environment the taxonomic efficacy te parameter was added to the lcpdb arg the te is a derivative of the efficacy parameter and quantifies the number of taxa in which a particular arg may be amplified using the selected primer pair taxonomic efficacy was calculated as the ratio of the number of taxa at the family level for which the pcr products amplified using a particular primer pair were assigned to the total number of taxa in which variants of the particular arg occur according to the extended bacterial antimicrobial resistance reference gene database fig 1 the te and e parameters are positively correlated appendix fig s1 and the former ranges in value from 0 to 1 a high te value indicates that a primer pair can detect a given arg in a greater number of bacterial taxa in addition the lcpdb arg is equipped with an option to list the taxa covered by a particular primer pair this will be useful in experimental design i e whether the goal is to detect args associated with specific strains or a general screen for args in a particular environment some arg variants found in taxonomically distinct strains may vary significantly in their nucleotide sequences ito et al 2017 in these cases it is often impossible to design universal primers to cover all taxonomic groups of bacteria encoding a specific arg the lcpdb arg includes information on which taxa carrying a particular arg are covered by each primer pair we recommend the selection of primer pairs that cover the broadest possible range of taxa or a set of primer pairs specific to various taxonomic groups to cover all putative hosts of the particular arg this approach may significantly reduce the pcr bias i e the number of false negative observations 3 1 4 model success metric the aforementioned parameters s e and te provide complementary information concerning each primer pair and its usefulness for specific applications however to permit selection of the best and the most universal primer pair it was necessary to derive an additional parameter i e a model success metric msm that validates the ranking of pcr primer pairs specific for a particular arg the msm ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 is the highest possible value and indicates the best primer pair the msm value is directly proportional to the number of correct in silico pcr products i e true positives and inversely proportional to the number of incorrectly omitted in silico pcr products i e false negatives appendix fig s2 it is important to mention that due to the correlation between e and te parameters the msm metric is biased toward primer pairs with higher e te values relative to s values all primer pairs collected in the lcpdb arg are ranked based on their msm value 3 2 analysis of the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in various datasets in silico testing of the lcpdb arg application to test the utility of the s e and te parameters and internal rankings based on msm of the lcpdb arg primer pairs to assist experimental design an in silico analysis was conducted using 33 diverse metagenomes table 1 a dataset comprising 13 807 complete bacterial genomes retrieved from the ncbi genbank and the ncbi nt database each dataset was screened with the uniprival tool for the presence of args selected pcr primer pairs available in the lcpdb arg were used for this screening this permitted a comparison of the utility of both the lowest and highest ranked primers fig 3 and revealed the overall occurrence of args in the various datasets appendix fig s3 comparison of the efficiency of the lowest and highest ranked pcr primer pairs in the amplification of args allowed to establish whether parameters and rankings calculated for each primer pair may be used as reliable criteria for selecting the most appropriate primers for pcr screening for these genes concentrating on args for which at least two primer pairs are available in the lcpdb arg in silico pcr results of primer pairs with the highest and lowest values of the msm which is strictly linked to the values of the s e and te parameters were compiled fig 3 in total 192 primer pairs specific for 96 particular args were analyzed appendix table s2 the uniprival tool was used to perform in silico amplification of these args using selected primer pairs and the aforementioned datasets see section 2 5 as the matrices therefore in total 6720 screening experiments in silico pcr analyses were performed in each case the obtained pcr products were verified manually by blast searches this analysis showed that the highest ranked primers permitted the detection of 93 args in 18 tested datasets in contrast the lowest ranked primers allowed the detection of only 40 args in 16 datasets these results indicated that primers with the highest lcpdb arg internal ranking are over twice more effective therefore to ensure a reliable analysis of the distribution of args only pcr primer pairs with the highest possible parameter values should be selected in the benchmarking exercise that we performed it was notable that three args qnrd stra and strb were detected in four metagenomes exclusively by the lowest ranked primer pairs detailed analysis of these results showed that all primer pairs for these particular genes available in the lcpdb arg have high values of the s e and te parameters so even the lowest ranked primers are still very good the slightly relaxed specificity parameter for a primer pair specific to the qnrd gene 0 94 in comparison with 1 00 for the highest rank primers and efficacy parameters for stra and strb gene primers 0 98 and 0 88 respectively resulted in the identification of a higher total number of in silico pcr products but also gave an increased number of false positives therefore this analysis indicated that using primers with slightly lower parameter values may lead to the identification of a higher number of variants of particular args but at the price of an increased number of false positive to supplement the presented analysis we investigated the overall occurrence of args in all of the aforementioned datasets for this purpose all primer pairs in the lcpdb arg were used for in silico pcr using as matrices the 33 metagenomes 13 807 complete bacterial genomes and the ncbi nt database appendix fig s3 all obtained pcr products were manually verified this analysis led to the detection of 42 args in anthropogenically shaped environments and 31 args in the metagenomes of pristine environments appendix fig s3 the especially prevalent args i e ermb ermf qace stra strb sul1 sul2 teto tetc and tetw were detected in 27 42 of the analyzed metagenomes appendix fig s3 moreover we tested all primer pairs collected in the lcpdb arg against the reference datasets i e 13 807 complete bacterial genomes and the ncbi nt database to reduce the possibility that the particular arg is simply not present in any tested metagenome this benchmarking clearly indicated a number of args for which all reported primer pairs have been incorrectly designed these were bla oxa 4 bla oxa 24 cata erea lina mcr 3 mecc mefa msrd tet 31 and vatc appendix fig s3 this finding is consistent with the observation that the primer pairs for these particular genes in the lcpdb arg have the lowest possible parameter values it is important to mention that the performed metagenome analyses although highly complex have a significant limitation due to the depth of the dna sequencing while the chosen metagenomic datasets were subjected to preliminary filtering to select those from deep sequencing projects it is still likely that the analyzed dna sequences and their further assemblies do not reflect the full genetic diversity of the examined environments it has been estimated that the highest possible sequencing saturation that can be currently achieved is around 80 of the overall genetic information present in a particular environment rodriguez r et al 2018 3 3 analysis of the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes in the wastewater treatment plant in oswiecim poland experimental testing the lcpdb arg application the utility and correctness of information collected in the lcpdb arg were validated using an experimental wet lab approach eighteen primer pairs designed to amplify genes conferring resistance to mls group antibiotics ermf gene sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 and tetracyclines teta tetb tetc tetg teto and tetx were selected for this analysis appendix table s1 according to the calculated parameters s e and te and model success metric for each gene the highest ranked and lowest ranked primer pairs were chosen standard pcr screening for args was then conducted using total dna extracted from primary sludge collected from the wastewater treatment plant in oswiecim poland and the selected primer pairs the obtained results showed that the pcr product profiles obtained using the highest ranked and lowest ranked primers differ significantly pcrs using the highest ranked primer pairs resulted in products of the desired length for all tested genes fig 4 dna sequencing of three independent pcr products from each amplification revealed that all of them were specific and matched the appropriate args in contrast use of the lowest ranked primer pairs resulted in only two pcr products for the tetb and teto genes of the predicted length and with dna sequences matching the appropriate args however it is noteworthy that in the case of the teto gene we obtained a second pcr product of the incorrect size with a dna sequence that did not match this arg fig 4 interestingly pcr products of the predicted length were obtained using the lowest ranked primers for the detection of the teta and sul1 genes fig 4 however dna sequencing revealed that these products were non specific the obtained dna sequences displayed homology with genes encoding a tetracycline efflux pump belonging to the c family tetc instead of the teta gene and a multidrug efflux pump gene instead of sul1 these false positive results emphasize the importance of sequencing dna fragments amplified during screening experiments and demonstrate that errors may be present in the scientific literature so that primers utilized in a study may have mistaken characteristics or even target the wrong gene we have made considerable efforts to check the characteristics of pcr primers included in the lcpdb arg and correct errors by comparing results obtained using the highest and lowest ranked primers we found that false negative results were generated when using the latter for the detection of the ermf sul2 tetc tetg and tetx genes no pcr product was obtained for the sul2 and tetx genes fig 4 while for ermf tetc and tetg fragments that differed from the predicted size were produced sequencing revealed that the pcr products obtained for the ermf and tetg genes were specific for tetg two dna fragments were obtained and only one of approx 470 bp in size was specific while the products amplified with the lowest ranked tetc primers displayed no homology to this arg it is worth emphasizing that frequently during arg screening experiments pcr products that are different in size to the literature predictions are simply ignored which may generate false negative results on the other hand checking each amplicon regardless of its size would significantly increase the overall cost of an experiment thus there is an urgent need for a database with manually curated primers for the detection of args our analyses demonstrated that pcr primers with the highest possible s e and te parameters should be used in experiments to screen for the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in various environments and their epidemiological risk assessment the use of primers with lower values for these parameters increases the possibility of obtaining false positive or false negative results to facilitate the selection of the best primers to use for a particular arg we introduced a msm parameter that permits quantified ranking of pcr primer pairs 4 conclusion pcr screening is one of the most common approaches for assessing the epidemiological risk of antibiotic resistance genes as emerging pollutants in wwtps and other environments we have shown that additional manual validation of pcr primer pairs described in the literature is crucial for obtaining reliable results from such experiments the lcpdb arg enables and simplifies this step as it contains internal rankings for all pcr primer pairs established by quantitative analysis of three separate parameters i e specificity efficacy and taxonomic efficacy using a model success metric parameterization and internal ranking of pcr primers significantly reduces the chance of obtaining biased results it was shown that the median percentage contribution of false negative pcr products drops from nearly 92 when the msm value is in the range between 0 and 0 1 to zero when the value of the msm is from 0 9 to 1 therefore the msm value is directly proportional to the number of correct pcr products true positives and inversely proportional to the number of pcr products that are incorrectly omitted i e not amplified false negatives the use of uniprival and the construction of the lcpdb arg highlight the fact that the selection of pcr primer pairs especially for use in screening for args needs careful attention and validation it is planned that future development of the lcpdb arg will include i frequent updating of this database by repeating the systematic review of literature to progressively increase the number of available primers ii extension of the database with the inclusion of new primer pairs for the detection of other groups of bacterial genes e g metal resistance genes and taxonomic marker genes iii further development of uniprival to improve performance in the evaluation of primer pairs iv adaptation of the website layout in response to user requirements and feedback although we performed thorough literature review to identify args specific pcr primers we are aware that the lcpdb arg is still incomplete and needs further development therefore users are invited to directly contact using the submit webpage the database developers to add missing primers as well as to test their own primer pairs with the uniprival tool in summary the constructed database lcpdb arg is a user friendly web application which gathers information concerning pcr primer pairs for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes in various environments most importantly the lcpdb arg is a

18689,a literature based manually curated database of pcr primers for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes in various environments was constructed lcpdb arg lcpdb ddg biol uw edu pl and lcpdb ddlemb com currently this database is comprised of 607 pcr primer pairs designed for the amplification of various genes conferring resistance to antibiotics representing 10 classes of antimicrobial agents three parameters were assigned for each primer pair specificity efficacy and taxonomic efficacy these parameters were evaluated using a novel bioinformatic tool uniprival developed for this study uniprival was used to validate each primer pair against various databases including the bacterial antimicrobial resistance reference gene database barrgdb and those of the national center of

pcr primer pairs which assists selection of the best primers for each application graphical abstract image 1 keywords antibiotic antibiotic resistance gene emerging pollutant lcpdb arg pcr screening 1 introduction antibiotics are considered the most effective pharmaceuticals used in the treatment of bacterial infectious diseases the application of modern technologies and laboratory techniques has led to the development of many synthetically modified derivatives of known antibiotics and the discovery of several fully synthetic broad spectrum antibiotics unrelated to compounds in the natural environment e g sulfonamides and fluoroquinolones bérdy 2012 however only one really novel antibiotic i e teixobactin has been discovered in the last 30 years piddock 2015 the great success of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections in medicine prompted their extensive use in several other fields this has resulted in the usage of millions of metric tons of antibiotics in the last 60 years davies and davies 2010 various classes of antibiotics are widely used in agricultural practice as therapeutic or prophylactic agents or as growth promoters in animal husbandry lipsitch et al 2002 there is now considerable evidence for the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in medicine and veterinary practice arnold and straus 2005 wayne et al 2011 unfortunately high market demands coupled with poorly controlled utilization of these pharmaceuticals has led to the accelerated development and spread of antibiotic resistance genes args amongst bacteria antibiotic resistant bacteria antibiotic resistance genes and antibiotics are now considered a novel class of emerging pollutants that pose a serious risk to both animal and public health petrie et al 2015 pruden et al 2006 von wintersdorff et al 2016 bacterial resistance to antibiotics can be intrinsic and non specific which is mainly a consequence of the cell wall structure jarlier and nikaido 1994 type of cellular respiration meylan et al 2017 or capsule production campos et al 2004 on the other hand specific resistance is linked to the presence of args von wintersdorff et al 2016 antibiotic resistance genes have become highly abundant mainly due to their mobility within bacterial microbiocenoses their frequent association with mobile genetic elements mges such as plasmids integrons and transposable elements assists their dissemination frost et al 2005 mges can even translocate between taxonomically remote strains of bacteria and thus horizontal gene transfer is considered the most important factor responsible for the spread of args in the environment hegstad et al 2010 moreover it has been shown that distinct stress factors like toxic metals or antibacterial biocides may also promote the dispersal of various args via the phenomenon of co selection since genes conferring resistance to these compounds frequently co localize with args within mges kiran et al 2015 amongst various pristine and anthropogenically shaped environments wastewater treatment plants wwtps are recognized as a location where microorganisms are subjected to numerous environmental stressors this leads to the selection of microbial opportunists including multidrug resistant bacteria that can survive exposure to various toxic compounds tello et al 2012 wwtps are considered point sources of accumulated and diverse emerging pollutants including antibiotics antibiotic resistant bacteria and args guo et al 2017 these plants are also important interfaces between the human population and the environment akiba et al 2015 therefore there is a great need for the surveillance of args in wwtps in order to assess the epidemiological risk of these emerging pollutants in urban environments research examining the occurrence and diversity of args in other environments including pristine regions e g arctic permafrost deep oceans and subsurface waters can provide some insight into the evolutionary origin of antibiotic resistance such studies are becoming increasingly popular d costa et al 2011 martínez 2008 zhang et al 2018 thus suitable scientific tools are needed to give reliable results that may provide a broader view of this phenomenon in the future two main methodological approaches have been employed for the identification of args and resistant bacteria classical i e culture based and molecular i e culture independent since less than 1 of known bacterial species can be cultivated culture based methods are strongly biased which is a major limitation amann et al 1995 in contrast molecular based techniques like metagenomics or polymerase chain reaction pcr screening are significantly less biased these methods permit a detailed insight into microbial diversity and the occurrence of particular genes including args in different environments following the introduction of pcr in 1983 the rapid identification of args in nosocomial and non nosocomial environments and bacteria became possible templeton 1992 in these early studies individual nucleotide sequences of args were used as a template to design primers for pcr which strongly influenced the results obtained the development of next generation sequencing methods two decades later led to the discovery of numerous arg variants hugenholtz and tyson 2008 schmieder and edwards 2012 multiple alignments of related arg sequences identified conserved regions to which consensus primers were designed which significantly increased the chances of amplifying more arg variants and reduced overall pcr bias currently the presence of antibiotic resistance genes is mainly monitored by applying pcr based methods after several years of using pcr to screen for args hundreds of primer pairs have been described in the scientific literature a common question from microbiologists in various fields is how do i choose the best pcr primer pair for the detection of particular args in light of the emerging threats linked with the environmental dissemination of antimicrobial resistance we believe that it is crucial to gather args specific pcr primers and systematically analyze them to determine which are most suitable to reliably monitor the distribution of these genes in various environments therefore the aim of this study was to develop a literature based and curated primers database for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes lcpdb arg this primers database available at the following urls lcpdb ddg biol uw edu pl and lcpdb ddlemb com was designed to facilitate pcr monitoring of the occurrence and diversity of various args in environmental and clinical samples moreover for each analyzed primer pair values for the specificity efficacy and taxonomic efficacy were calculated these parameters were used applying a developed model success metric to prepare primer pair rankings that facilitate the selection of the optimal primers for the identification of particular args by pcr the lcpdb arg database is addressed to the needs of i scientists working in the area of antibiotic resistance surveillance in various environments including wwtps urban areas and pristine environments ii medical centers and public health institutes that routinely track args e g in clinical samples and food products using pcr based methods and iii institutions working on the development of strategies to reduce the abundance of args in the environment we believe that the lcpdb arg project fits into the one health perspective as an initiative enabling the further development of reliable arg monitoring strategies that can be applied in various sectors although there are several databases gathering pcr primers e g pattyn et al 2006 wang et al 2012 to our knowledge the lcpdb arg is the only one comprised of primers for the detection of args in addition none of the other databases offers an internal validation model that enables the quantified ranking of primer pairs that facilitates selection of the best possible pcr primers for a particular purpose 2 materials and methods 2 1 literature review for the identification of pcr primers for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes initially scientific literature in the pubmed google scholar and google graphics databases was screened using text searches with queries created from combinations of the words pcr and the names of particular antibiotic resistance genes e g teta for which a reference sequence is available in the bacterial antimicrobial resistance reference gene database barrgdb ncbi resource coordinators 2017 this led to the creation of a database of publications potentially containing data concerning pcr screening for args we then performed a thorough manual inspection of the gathered publications to extract metadata concerning arg specific pcr primers including the identity of the target gene the nucleotide sequence of the primers pcr conditions and the pcr amplicon size this step reduced the number of publications and primers significantly as in many published articles including their supplementary materials primer characteristics crucial for repeating the experiment were missing in the next step the list of primer pairs with complete metadata was filtered to remove duplicates and unique numbers were assigned to each primer this manually curated list of primers was used for all analyses described in this study original literature references for each pcr primer pair included in the lcpdb arg are presented online in the database 2 2 development of the uniprival universal primer validator tool for primer pair benchmarking to perform in silico benchmarking of pcr primer pairs the uniprival tool was developed in python v3 4 this tool instructs nucleotide basic local alignment search tool blastn altschul et al 1990 to use primer sequences as queries to search selected databases or fasta files with parameters optimized for short query sequences i e word size 6 e value 10 000 reward for positive match 1 penalty for mismatch 2 penalty for gap opening 5 penalty for gap extension 3 maximum number of aligned sequences to keep 10 000 minimum query coverage per high scoring segment pair hsp 75 as an input uniprival takes a tab delimited mapping file that consists of primer pairs with their names corresponding sequences acquired product size and its possible deviation this file is parsed and each primer from each pair is used as an individual query during the blastn search for degenerate primers all variant sequences are submitted individually to allow appropriate blastn searches next the search results are screened so that only genuine products of in silico amplification 3 end of each primer aligned both primers aligned in correct orientation and the pcr product has the anticipated size are retained and provided in the resulting summary file 2 3 calculating specificity s efficacy e and taxonomic efficacy te parameters while running the uniprival tool two public databases were used the bacteria antibiotic resistance reference gene database barrgdb and ncbi nt database as of august 8th 2018 further referred to as the r and nt databases respectively the r database was extended through the blastn search against the nt database with 90 sequence identity and 90 query coverage as hsp thresholds this allowed us to identify homologous arg sequences in the nt database and expanded the sequence diversity for each arg resulting in an extended reference sequence set named er this also permitted the identification of bacterial taxa possessing particular args and resulted in a database of taxa carrying the reference sequences named ert unique sequence variants for each arg were distinguished using vsearch v2 7 rognes et al 2016 and used to create a non redundant reference sequence database named nrer the benchmarking of primer pairs was then performed using uniprival with the reference datasets the specificity s efficacy e and taxonomic efficacy te parameters were calculated as follows a s i j is the specificity of primer pair i for the amplification of targeted arg j this parameter gives the percentage of the obtained pcr products that represents a variant of a targeted arg gene and not a random dna fragment it is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct in silico pcr products for particular primer pair i amplifying arg j using the nt database as a matrix cp i j nt i e true positives and the number of all in silico pcr products observed for this particular primer pair using the nt database as a matrix p i j nt i e true positives plus false positives 1 s i j c p i j n t p i j n t the correctness of in silico pcr products was verified through blastn searches using each pcr product as the query against er j in this search thresholds of 90 sequence identity and 90 query coverage per hsp were applied b e i j is the efficacy parameter of pcr primer pair i for amplification of the targeted arg j reflecting the effective amplification of all possible variants of the particular arg it is calculated as the ratio of the number of amplified variants of a particular arg using non redundant reference sequence database cp i j nrer j as a matrix and the number of variants of that gene present in the non redundant reference sequence database nrer j 2 e i j c p i j n r e r j n r e r j c te i j is the taxonomic efficacy parameter of primer pair i for the amplification of arg j reflecting the usefulness of the selected pcr primer pair for amplification of the targeted arg in bacteria classified within particular taxa it is calculated as the ratio of the number of taxa for which correct in silico pcr products were obtained for a particular arg using the nt database as a matrix cpt i j nt and the number of bacterial taxa carrying all possible variants of arg j within the extended reference sequences taxa database ert j 3 t e i j c p t i j nt e r t j currently the taxonomic efficacy parameter is calculated based on bacterial taxonomy at the family level moreover plasmids carrying args are considered as an additional group taxon during the calculations since these genetic elements may be hosted by bacteria belonging to various taxa a flowchart describing the implementation of the uniprival tool to obtain the specificity s efficacy e and taxonomic efficacy te parameters of each pcr primer pair is presented in fig 1 2 4 calculating the model success metric for the collected primer pairs to rank primer pairs collected in the lcpdb arg based on the s e and

the modified in reference to the confusion matrix accuracy parameter a i j the modified accuracy parameter itself is calculated as the ratio of the number of correct in silico pcr products for

metagenomes complete bacterial genomes and ncbi nt datasets for the validation of pcr primer pairs gathered in the lcpdb arg validations of the analyzed pcr primer pairs were conducted using metagenomic datasets downloaded from the ebi metagenomics database cook et al 2016 a dataset comprising 13 807 complete bacterial genomes retrieved from the ncbi genbank database as of march 25th 2019 and the ncbi nt database as of august 8th 2018 the metagenomes used are presented in table 1 all metagenomes were preprocessed with the program fastp v0 12 5 with trim poly x flag and subsequently assembled using metaspades v3 11 1 via spades py script with meta flag nurk et al 2017 the obtained contigs were then searched with the uniprival tool to check for the presence of the selected args 2 6 sample collection a sample of primary sludge was collected from the municipal and industrial wwtp located in oswiecim poland in november 2014 the wwtp has the capacity of about 53 400 m3 waste per day the sample 500 g in total was collected into sterile falcon tubes frozen in a portable freezer 20 c and transferred to the laboratory after centrifugation and removal of the supernatant the sludge sample was stored frozen 80 c before further processing 2 7 dna extraction total dna was extracted from 100 mg of primary sludge using a fast dna spin kit for feces mp biomedicals illkirch france according to the manufacturer s instructions the dna concentration was determined using the qubit 2 0 fluorometer invitrogen carlsbad ca usa 2 8 screening for antibiotic resistance genes in samples from oswiecim wwtp the occurrence of selected antibiotic resistance genes in oswiecim wwtp samples was investigated using pcr assays all pcrs were performed using 150 ng of template dna 10 pmol of each primer appendix table s1 with dreamtaq pcr master mix thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa the pcr thermocycle program employed depended on the recommended annealing temperature for each primer pair appendix table s1 pcr products were resolved by electrophoresis in 1 5 agarose gels 2 9 standard molecular biology techniques it was impossible to perform direct sanger sequencing of pcr products obtained during screening for antibiotic resistance genes in oswiecim wwtp samples since they potentially represented a heterogenous mixture of dna fragments therefore pcr products of the correct size were excised from the agarose gel after electrophoresis purified using an agarose out dna purification kit eurx gdansk poland and then ligated to vector ptz57 r t thermo fisher scientific waltham ma usa and introduced into e coli dh5α via chemical transformation kushner 1978 dna of recombinant plasmids carrying the cloned pcr products was purified using a plasmid miniprep dna purification kit eurx gdansk poland and the inserts of several clones were sequenced using universal primers m13 puc with an abi prism 377 capillary dna analyzer applied biosystem foster city ca usa at the institute of biochemistry and biophysics polish academy of science oligo pl 3 results and discussion 3 1 construction and overall structure of the literature based and curated primers database for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes lcpdb arg the aim of this study was to create a database of pcr primers enabling the rapid and reliable detection of antibiotic resistance genes in various environmental and clinical samples this was assembled following a thorough scientific literature review and manual verification of each primer pair the literature based and curated primers database lcpdb arg is available under the following links lcpdb ddg biol uw edu pl and lcpdb ddlemb com currently the database contains 607 primer pairs for the amplification of 169 args conferring resistance to various classes of antibiotics including i aminoglycosides 16 pcr primer pairs ii amphenicols 20 iii β lactams 171 iv glycopeptides 33 v macrolides lincosamides streptogramines mls group 80 vi polymixins 8 vii quinolones 34 viii sulfonamides 59 and ix tetracyclines 171 other primer pairs were designed for the amplification of genes encoding multidrug efflux pumps conferring resistance to various antibiotics 15 pairs fig 2 the lcpdb arg is currently supplemented with literature references for all the gathered primers it also includes basic parameters of the primers length gc content and melting temperature in the future we plan to extend the database by adding further information such as whether a primer pair is suitable for qpcr analysis the database is also equipped with an internal ranking of the primer pairs according to their specificity s efficacy e and taxonomic efficacy te these parameters have been revalidated using the developed model success metric msm this information will facilitate selection of the most appropriate pcr primer pair for reliable experimental screening for args in various environments 3 1 1 the specificity s parameter the specificity s parameter gives the information about the fraction of the obtained pcr products that represent a variant of desired target gene rather than a randomly amplified dna fragment the specificity parameter ranges from 0 to 1 in value where 0 means a total lack of specificity and 1 reflects the highest specificity we found that 92 of the 607 analyzed primers have a specificity value of 0 which indicates that many published reports contain errors in most cases a low specificity value is due to an incorrectly annotated arg e g some teta gene primers are in fact specific for the tetc gene see section 3 3 another possible explanation for a low s parameter value is incorrect assignment of the pcr product size 24 607 primer pairs the correct amplicon size is crucial for determining whether the obtained pcr products correspond to the gene of interest and should be further analyzed the uniprival tool used for estimation of the s parameter can determine whether the amplicon size given in the literature is correct otherwise it returns a wrong product size w ps note in this situation we performed manual recalculation and correction of this value all of the other tested pcr primer pairs 491 607 have s parameter values of between 0 03 and 1 based on our observations we recommend that lcpdb arg users employ primers with the highest possible s parameter value in their experiments ideally 0 95 441 out of 607 tested primer pairs 3 1 2 the efficacy e parameter in the lcpdb arg the efficacy e parameter was established for every pcr primer pair to give the percentage of homologs of the particular arg that can be amplified efficacy e was calculated as the ratio of the correct in silico pcr products produced by a primer pair to the total number of homologs identified in the nt database fig 1 this parameter ranges in value between 0 and 1 and can vary significantly between different primer pairs designed to amplify a particular arg it is worth mentioning that during this analysis we found several primer pairs with an efficacy value of 0 even though the value of the s parameter was high this situation occurred when the expected amplicon size was at least 10 larger than the complete gene sequence e g when researchers wished to amplify the gene for further study and designed primers based on the proximal intergenic regions chatterjee et al 2016 hussein et al 2009 in these cases 18 607 primer pairs the e parameter values in the lcpdb arg were changed from 0 into the note binds outside the gene for the purpose of accurate arg screening we recommend the selection of primer pairs with the highest possible efficacy values or those with the note binds outside the gene if other parameters are satisfied this significantly reduces the chances of obtaining false negative results 3 1 3 the taxonomic efficacy te parameter environmental conditions can influence the taxonomic composition of a microbial community and the distribution of bacterial taxa between various environments fierer and jackson 2006 on the other hand taxon specific genomic features like distinct codon usage or gc content strongly influence the efficacy of pcr screening for genes of interest using particular primer pairs hildebrand et al 2010 to show how the efficacy of particular pcr primer pairs may be biased by the taxonomic composition within the analyzed environment the taxonomic efficacy te parameter was added to the lcpdb arg the te is a derivative of the efficacy parameter and quantifies the number of taxa in which a particular arg may be amplified using the selected primer pair taxonomic efficacy was calculated as the ratio of the number of taxa at the family level for which the pcr products amplified using a particular primer pair were assigned to the total number of taxa in which variants of the particular arg occur according to the extended bacterial antimicrobial resistance reference gene database fig 1 the te and e parameters are positively correlated appendix fig s1 and the former ranges in value from 0 to 1 a high te value indicates that a primer pair can detect a given arg in a greater number of bacterial taxa in addition the lcpdb arg is equipped with an option to list the taxa covered by a particular primer pair this will be useful in experimental design i e whether the goal is to detect args associated with specific strains or a general screen for args in a particular environment some arg variants found in taxonomically distinct strains may vary significantly in their nucleotide sequences ito et al 2017 in these cases it is often impossible to design universal primers to cover all taxonomic groups of bacteria encoding a specific arg the lcpdb arg includes information on which taxa carrying a particular arg are covered by each primer pair we recommend the selection of primer pairs that cover the broadest possible range of taxa or a set of primer pairs specific to various taxonomic groups to cover all putative hosts of the particular arg this approach may significantly reduce the pcr bias i e the number of false negative observations 3 1 4 model success metric the aforementioned parameters s e and te provide complementary information concerning each primer pair and its usefulness for specific applications however to permit selection of the best and the most universal primer pair it was necessary to derive an additional parameter i e a model success metric msm that validates the ranking of pcr primer pairs specific for a particular arg the msm ranges between 0 and 1 where 1 is the highest possible value and indicates the best primer pair the msm value is directly proportional to the number of correct in silico pcr products i e true positives and inversely proportional to the number of incorrectly omitted in silico pcr products i e false negatives appendix fig s2 it is important to mention that due to the correlation between e and te parameters the msm metric is biased toward primer pairs with higher e te values relative to s values all primer pairs collected in the lcpdb arg are ranked based on their msm value 3 2 analysis of the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes in various datasets in silico testing of the lcpdb arg application to test the utility of the s e and te parameters and internal rankings based on msm of the lcpdb arg primer pairs to assist experimental design an in silico analysis was conducted using 33 diverse metagenomes table 1 a dataset comprising 13 807 complete bacterial genomes retrieved from the ncbi genbank and the ncbi nt database each dataset was screened with the uniprival tool for the presence of args selected pcr primer pairs available in the lcpdb arg were used for this screening this permitted a comparison of the utility of both the lowest and highest ranked primers fig 3 and revealed the overall occurrence of args in the various datasets appendix fig s3 comparison of the efficiency of the lowest and highest ranked pcr primer pairs in the amplification of args allowed to establish whether parameters and rankings calculated for each primer pair may be used as reliable criteria for selecting the most appropriate primers for pcr screening for these genes concentrating on args for which at least two primer pairs are available in the lcpdb arg in silico pcr results of primer pairs with the highest and lowest values of the msm which is strictly linked to the values of the s e and te parameters were compiled fig 3 in total 192 primer pairs specific for 96 particular args were analyzed appendix table s2 the uniprival tool was used to perform in silico amplification of these args using selected primer pairs and the aforementioned datasets see section 2 5 as the matrices therefore in total 6720 screening experiments in silico pcr analyses were performed in each case the obtained pcr products were verified manually by blast searches this analysis showed that the highest ranked primers permitted the detection of 93 args in 18 tested datasets in contrast the lowest ranked primers allowed the detection of only 40 args in 16 datasets these results indicated that primers with the highest lcpdb arg internal ranking are over twice more effective therefore to ensure a reliable analysis of the distribution of args only pcr primer pairs with the highest possible parameter values should be selected in the benchmarking exercise that we performed it was notable that three args qnrd stra and strb were detected in four metagenomes exclusively by the lowest ranked primer pairs detailed analysis of these results showed that all primer pairs for these particular genes available in the lcpdb arg have high values of the s e and te parameters so even the lowest ranked primers are still very good the slightly relaxed specificity parameter for a primer pair specific to the qnrd gene 0 94 in comparison with 1 00 for the highest rank primers and efficacy parameters for stra and strb gene primers 0 98 and 0 88 respectively resulted in the identification of a higher total number of in silico pcr products but also gave an increased number of false positives therefore this analysis indicated that using primers with slightly lower parameter values may lead to the identification of a higher number of variants of particular args but at the price of an increased number of false positive to supplement the presented analysis we investigated the overall occurrence of args in all of the aforementioned datasets for this purpose all primer pairs in the lcpdb arg were used for in silico pcr using as matrices the 33 metagenomes 13 807 complete bacterial genomes and the ncbi nt database appendix fig s3 all obtained pcr products were manually verified this analysis led to the detection of 42 args in anthropogenically shaped environments and 31 args in the metagenomes of pristine environments appendix fig s3 the especially prevalent args i e ermb ermf qace stra strb sul1 sul2 teto tetc and tetw were detected in 27 42 of the analyzed metagenomes appendix fig s3 moreover we tested all primer pairs collected in the lcpdb arg against the reference datasets i e 13 807 complete bacterial genomes and the ncbi nt database to reduce the possibility that the particular arg is simply not present in any tested metagenome this benchmarking clearly indicated a number of args for which all reported primer pairs have been incorrectly designed these were bla oxa 4 bla oxa 24 cata erea lina mcr 3 mecc mefa msrd tet 31 and vatc appendix fig s3 this finding is consistent with the observation that the primer pairs for these particular genes in the lcpdb arg have the lowest possible parameter values it is important to mention that the performed metagenome analyses although highly complex have a significant limitation due to the depth of the dna sequencing while the chosen metagenomic datasets were subjected to preliminary filtering to select those from deep sequencing projects it is still likely that the analyzed dna sequences and their further assemblies do not reflect the full genetic diversity of the examined environments it has been estimated that the highest possible sequencing saturation that can be currently achieved is around 80 of the overall genetic information present in a particular environment rodriguez r et al 2018 3 3 analysis of the occurrence of antibiotic resistance genes in the wastewater treatment plant in oswiecim poland experimental testing the lcpdb arg application the utility and correctness of information collected in the lcpdb arg were validated using an experimental wet lab approach eighteen primer pairs designed to amplify genes conferring resistance to mls group antibiotics ermf gene sulfonamides sul1 and sul2 and tetracyclines teta tetb tetc tetg teto and tetx were selected for this analysis appendix table s1 according to the calculated parameters s e and te and model success metric for each gene the highest ranked and lowest ranked primer pairs were chosen standard pcr screening for args was then conducted using total dna extracted from primary sludge collected from the wastewater treatment plant in oswiecim poland and the selected primer pairs the obtained results showed that the pcr product profiles obtained using the highest ranked and lowest ranked primers differ significantly pcrs using the highest ranked primer pairs resulted in products of the desired length for all tested genes fig 4 dna sequencing of three independent pcr products from each amplification revealed that all of them were specific and matched the appropriate args in contrast use of the lowest ranked primer pairs resulted in only two pcr products for the tetb and teto genes of the predicted length and with dna sequences matching the appropriate args however it is noteworthy that in the case of the teto gene we obtained a second pcr product of the incorrect size with a dna sequence that did not match this arg fig 4 interestingly pcr products of the predicted length were obtained using the lowest ranked primers for the detection of the teta and sul1 genes fig 4 however dna sequencing revealed that these products were non specific the obtained dna sequences displayed homology with genes encoding a tetracycline efflux pump belonging to the c family tetc instead of the teta gene and a multidrug efflux pump gene instead of sul1 these false positive results emphasize the importance of sequencing dna fragments amplified during screening experiments and demonstrate that errors may be present in the scientific literature so that primers utilized in a study may have mistaken characteristics or even target the wrong gene we have made considerable efforts to check the characteristics of pcr primers included in the lcpdb arg and correct errors by comparing results obtained using the highest and lowest ranked primers we found that false negative results were generated when using the latter for the detection of the ermf sul2 tetc tetg and tetx genes no pcr product was obtained for the sul2 and tetx genes fig 4 while for ermf tetc and tetg fragments that differed from the predicted size were produced sequencing revealed that the pcr products obtained for the ermf and tetg genes were specific for tetg two dna fragments were obtained and only one of approx 470 bp in size was specific while the products amplified with the lowest ranked tetc primers displayed no homology to this arg it is worth emphasizing that frequently during arg screening experiments pcr products that are different in size to the literature predictions are simply ignored which may generate false negative results on the other hand checking each amplicon regardless of its size would significantly increase the overall cost of an experiment thus there is an urgent need for a database with manually curated primers for the detection of args our analyses demonstrated that pcr primers with the highest possible s e and te parameters should be used in experiments to screen for the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes in various environments and their epidemiological risk assessment the use of primers with lower values for these parameters increases the possibility of obtaining false positive or false negative results to facilitate the selection of the best primers to use for a particular arg we introduced a msm parameter that permits quantified ranking of pcr primer pairs 4 conclusion pcr screening is one of the most common approaches for assessing the epidemiological risk of antibiotic resistance genes as emerging pollutants in wwtps and other environments we have shown that additional manual validation of pcr primer pairs described in the literature is crucial for obtaining reliable results from such experiments the lcpdb arg enables and simplifies this step as it contains internal rankings for all pcr primer pairs established by quantitative analysis of three separate parameters i e specificity efficacy and taxonomic efficacy using a model success metric parameterization and internal ranking of pcr primers significantly reduces the chance of obtaining biased results it was shown that the median percentage contribution of false negative pcr products drops from nearly 92 when the msm value is in the range between 0 and 0 1 to zero when the value of the msm is from 0 9 to 1 therefore the msm value is directly proportional to the number of correct pcr products true positives and inversely proportional to the number of pcr products that are incorrectly omitted i e not amplified false negatives the use of uniprival and the construction of the lcpdb arg highlight the fact that the selection of pcr primer pairs especially for use in screening for args needs careful attention and validation it is planned that future development of the lcpdb arg will include i frequent updating of this database by repeating the systematic review of literature to progressively increase the number of available primers ii extension of the database with the inclusion of new primer pairs for the detection of other groups of bacterial genes e g metal resistance genes and taxonomic marker genes iii further development of uniprival to improve performance in the evaluation of primer pairs iv adaptation of the website layout in response to user requirements and feedback although we performed thorough literature review to identify args specific pcr primers we are aware that the lcpdb arg is still incomplete and needs further development therefore users are invited to directly contact using the submit webpage the database developers to add missing primers as well as to test their own primer pairs with the uniprival tool in summary the constructed database lcpdb arg is a user friendly web application which gathers information concerning pcr primer pairs for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes in various environments most importantly the lcpdb arg is a quick and easy way of selecting the best pcr primer pairs for a particular experiment declaration of interests the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal
