17215,both the benefits of bacterial quorum sensing qs and cross feeding for bio reactor performance in wastewater treatment have been recently reported as the social traits of microbial communities how bacterial qs regulating bacterial trade off by cross feeding remains unclear here we find diffusion signal factor dsf a kind of qs molecules can bridge bacterial interactions through regulating public goods extracellular polymeric substances eps amino acids for metabolic cross feedings it showed that exogenous dsf addition leads to change of public goods level and community structure dynamics in the anammox consortia approaches involving meta omics clarified that anammox and a lautropia affiliated species in the phylum proteobacteria can supply costly public goods for dsf secretor species via secondary messenger c di gmp regulator clp after sensing dsf meanwhile dsf secretor species help anammox bacteria scavenge extracellular detritus which creates a more suitable environment for the anammox species enhances the anammox activity and improves the nitrogen removal rate of anammox reactor the trade off induces discrepant metabolic loads of different microbial clusters which were responsible for the community succession it illustrated the potential to artificially alleviate metabolic loads for certain bacteria deciphering microbial interactions via qs not only provides insights for understanding the social behavior of microbial community but also creates new thought for enhancing treatment performance through regulating bacterial social traits via quorum sensing mediated public goods graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords quorum sensing diffusion signal factor dsf public good anammox consortia nitrogen removal 1 introduction quorum sensing qs a prevalent interaction or communication avenue in the microbial community can coordinate bacterial behaviors at the population level via qs signal molecules these molecules have been the focus of research on pathogenic bacteria diggle et al 2007 fuqua et al 1994 keller and surette 2006 recently the qs phenomenon has been found in natural and artificial ecosystems and has attracted widespread attention feng et al 2013 tan et al 2014 importantly the qs signal could help bacteria resist the unfavorable environmental stresses low temperature and ph guo et al 2017b through regulating the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps and formation of sludge granular in biological wastewater treatment zhang et al 2020a meanwhile it has the ability to increase the microcystins removing efficiency zeng et al 2020 and shorten the recovery period of anaerobic digestion processes after toxic shock xiao et al 2019 via tuning the bacterial growth and activity herein bacteria always existed in the type of consortia or biofilm regulated by qs confining different kinds of bacteria that are taxonomically distinct in a limited space it greatly abridges the spatial distances and affects ecological interactions based on the exchange of small molecules or metabolites in the vicinity hall stoodley et al 2004 in microbial ecosystem bacteria trades with each other through resource allocation namely cross feeding mee et al 2014 of the exchanged molecules public goods are substances that are produced at a cost to provide shared benefits for a local neighborhood of cells previous studies demonstrated that digestive enzymes darch et al 2012 greig and travisano 2004 polymeric substances van gestel et al 2014 chelating compounds luján et al 2015 or amino acids pande et al 2016 could be secreted into extracellular environments as public goods importantly the exchange of public good is both beneficial for the producers and customers pande et al 2016 it has been reported that the public good secretion contributed for the bacterial fitness and reproduce nadell et al 2016 additionally studies have suggested that amino acid auxotrophy potentially shapes the community composition embree et al 2015 mee et al 2014 the researchers also focused on the regulation of public goods metabolism theoretical analysis and empirical studies have revealed that the secretion of public goods is more beneficial at higher cell densities in the aquatic environment heilmann et al 2015 nadell et al 2016 pai and you 2009 meanwhile it showed that the appropriate spatial segregation of bacteria in the microbial biofilm affected the exchange of public goods cordero et al 2012 of note qs has been found to be able to regulate the cross feeding of public goods for example as a kind of resource allocation the secretion of extracellular digestive enzymes was shown to be regulated by qs as a result to coordinate the cooperative behaviors in pseudomonas aeruginosa allen et al 2016 darch et al 2012 nadell et al 2016 and an antibiotic degrading enzyme in a synthetic qs system pai et al 2012 the cooperative social traits from qs is attractive not only in the pure culture but also in the complex microbial community recently anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process that directly converts nitrite and ammonium to nitrogen gas has attracted widespread attention for its high nitrogen removal capability and low energy consumption kartal et al 2010 lawson et al 2017 the qs signaling was shown playing an important role in the anammox community signal messenger bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp for example was identified in anammox culture guo et al 2017b and it was found likely to be an important regulator for anammox consortia against environmental stresses guo et al 2017a besides a recent study found that among the multiple qs signal systems diffusible signal factor dsf signaling shows great potential in the anammox community at anammox reactor start up tang et al 2018 furthermore it is known that among distinct classes of sensor kinases involved in dsf perception a best studied of these sensory systems is related to the turnover of c di gmp ryan et al 2011 this enlightens us to investigate whether there is a bridge between dsf and c di gmp involving the regulation of public good cross feeding in the anammox community here we utilized the approach of exogenous dsf addition to obtain conditions with coercive inducement of the dsf signal levels of public goods reactor performance and the composition of the microbial community were compared between with and without addition of dsf the mechanism of dsf regulated interactions within the complex community via public goods was further explored combining with metagenomes metatranscriptomes and hierarchical signaling network construction c di gmp receptor clp regulon the results emphasized the role of public goods in bridging the microbial communication regulated by qs it provided a valuable avenue for understanding the social traits of qs and trade off in the microbial community and a new concept for regulating the reactor performance in biological wastewater treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 batch assays batch assays were performed in 250 ml serum bottles each vial was inoculated with anammox consortia guo et al 2017a to a final concentration of 1 45 gvss l 1 the biomass was washed using anammox medium text s1 without nitrogen and re suspended in the cultivation medium the cultivation medium contained 100 mg no2 n l 1 and 100 mg nh4 n l 1 and the other components text s1 the vials were made anoxic by flushing with n2 for 10 min and the serum bottles were sealed tightly with rubber caps to avoid any influent of external oxygen to study the effects of dsf on anammox biomass we conducted successive 5 cycle batch assays that lasted fifty hours six vials were separated into two groups each group with three replicates 0 05 μm dsf molecule the determined optimal concentration details in text s2 and fig s1 was added to one group called dsf addition the same volume of medium without dsf was added to the other group called control group once the no2 was degraded completely it was considered as the end of each cycle of the batch assays all the supernatants were collected for amino acid detection and 1 ml of biomass ca 10 mgvss l 1 was harvested for eps and c di gmp detection details in texts s3 s6 since there was significant difference of extracellular protein concentration between two groups after the final cycle of batch assays fig s2 the biomass was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis 2 2 reactor operation two identical sequencing batch reactors sbrs r control and r dsf with a working volume of 1 0 l were operated for 95 days both sbrs were inoculated with 0 29 gvss l 1 anammox consortia guo et al 2017a stock solution of dsf was artificially added to the r dsf reactor with syringes after influent feeding every hydraulic retention time hrt to a final concentration of 0 05 μm in the reactor medium while the same volume of medium without dsf was added to the r control reactor after every hrt other settings in the two reactors were the same their hrts were initially set as 24 h with the influent nitrogen concentration at 50 mg no2 n l 1 and 50 mg nh4 n l 1 when no2 n in effluent was below 10 mg n l 1 the nitrogen load was increased by increasing the influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations the composition of media solution is presented in text s1 the ph of the sbrs was not controlled but it remained within the range of 7 5 to 8 0 and the temperature was maintained at 37 1 c the influent medium of sbrs was flushed with a gas mixture of n2 co2 95 5 to maintain anaerobic conditions the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were measured with uv visible spectrophotometry uv 1750 shimadzu according to the standard methods apha 1999 bacteria samples 3 biological replicates were taken from the sbrs at days 0 30 55 75 and 95 for the eps determination and 16s rrna gene sequencing 2 3 dna and rna sequencing the anammox biomass harvested from the batch assays and sbrs was used for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing and from reactor for 16s rrna sequencing respectively total genomic dna was isolated from each sample using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biotechnology solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s protocol for metagenomic sequencing the isolated dna was fragmented pair end library was constructed and adapters were prepared following which the samples were sequenced on the illumina hiseq4000 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa for 16s rrna sequencing primers 338f and 806r targeting the v3 v4 region were used which was then sequenced using the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa total rnas were extracted using the e z n a soil rna midi kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa according to the manufacturer s protocols after quality determination rrna in the total rna of samples were removed cdna libraries were constructed and samples were sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa all sequencing was performed at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the detailed information for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencings and analyses are given in texts s7 s11 to match the species annotated by 16s sequencing with the species of mags we extracted 16s sequences from the mags using rnammer 1 2 server lagesen et al 2007 and compared the 16s sequences to the otu sequences in 16s rrna sequencing dataset then we used the matched otus to represent the mags in this way 16s rrna samples taken at different timepoints along with the reactor development were able to track the succession of the anammox community here focusing on the species of the mags during the long term reactor development 2 4 prediction of dsf perception transition and biosynthesis genes two types of dsf perception and transition gene cluster or genes rpfc rpfg and rpfr and biosynthesis gene rpff were predicted based on the domain search against hmmer web server 2015 update finn et al 2015 using the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data the overall profile of the prediction is shown in fig s3 briefly rpfc rpfg gene cluster was first predicted by hd domain the hd gyp domain was used to find rpfg and accordingly rpfc was next to rpfg in the genome the rpfr genes were predicted with intact pas ggdef eal domains putative rpff genes were searched for enoyl coa hydratase using hmmer website server and then aligned to filter the orfs with conservative sites two well conserved glutamate residues glu141 and glu161 for xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc rpff gene cheng et al 2010 details are provided in text s12 2 5 prediction of regulator clp protein and genome scale searching of clp binding sites clp is an important dsf signal regulator with a characteristic cnmp binding domain he et al 2007 the first work was to search cnmp binding domain for orfs after that sequence alignment was conducted to filter orfs with conservative sites a glutamic acid residue e99 for xcc clp gene as reported earlier tao et al 2010 the final orfs were the homologs of clp genes a python script was used to parse and match the promoter sequences of the clp regulated genes using the putative clp binding motif tgtga n6 tcaca dong and ebright 1992 the promoter region sequence which was arbitrarily defined as a 500 bp region upstream of an orf was obtained from a previous study he et al 2007 a confidence of 60 match to the non variable sequences i e tgtga and tcaca of the putative clp binding motif is taken as the cut off value only the best match was listed if more than one putative motif were located per promoter 2 6 data availability statement all data associated with 16s rrna can be found in ncbi under

under the accession numbers listed in table s1 3 results 3 1 altered levels of eps and amino acids as public goods and reactor performance in response to exogenous dsf addition dsf signals were first detected and confirmed in the anammox culture text s13 and fig s4 which suggests that dsf works as an intrinsic signal in the anammox consortia to insight into the mechanism of dsf signaling in the complex anammox community exogenous addition of dsf was proposed to mimic a stimulus response working frame the public goods eps and free amino acids were emphasized here considering they are important types of public goods that were well studied in either the research of quorum sensing or the anammox consortia guo et al 2017a tang et al 2018 in the study the contents of eps in the batch assays were determined fig 1 a and b the level of pn concentration was significantly increased when exogenous dsf was added p 0 0051 kruskal wallis anova on the contrary exogenous dsf induced significantly lower levels of ps p 0 0045 kruskal wallis anova c di gmp has been shown to be a global regulatory molecule that modulates the reciprocal responses of bacteria to activate extracellular components production lee et al 2007 to investigate the response of c di gmp levels to the addition of dsf and further relationship between c di gmp and eps we found the reduction of ps was coupled to a significant decline in of intracellular c di gmp levels p 0 019 kruskal wallis anova fig 1c we also detected the eps contents and reactor performance during the reactor operation fig s5 the pn contents increased in the two reactors compared to the inoculum surprisingly pn levels in dsf addition reactor were significantly lower than those of control which was contrary to the results of the short term batch assays fig 1a the ps contents in the dsf addition reactor presented an obvious decline during the reactor development and showed significantly lower levels than those of control which was consistent with the profiles of short term batch assays fig 1b for reactor performance the reactor with dsf addition had higher nitrogen removal rate nrr than reactor without dsf addition fig s6 in detail the nrr of reactor without and with dsf addition was 486 8 and 603 6 mg n l 1 d 1 on day 95 respectively importantly the specific anammox activity of reactor without and with dsf addition was 73 86 and 91 19 g n g vss 1 d 1 respectively it indicated that the anammox activity increased 23 46 after dsf addition which contributed to the nrr improving during the long term reactor operation to determine the levels of amino acids released and traded in the anammox culture amino acid concentrations in the supernatants were also detected fig 1d we found a significant difference in the levels of the essential amino acids in the dsf addition and control reactors higher levels of asparagine were detected under dsf addition condition fold change 2 07 p 0 038 kruskal wallis anova whereas lower levels of valine were detected under dsf addition condition fold change 0 58 p 0 019 kruskal wallis anova 3 2 community overview based on metagenomes and metatranscriptomes to decipher the mechanism of dsf regulation within the anammox community meta omics approaches were utilized assembly and binning of the metagenomic sequencing reads resulted in 12 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags fig 2 and table s2 the 12 draft genomes accounted for 59 3 of the sequencing data from the samples without dsf addition table s3 at least 87 2 of mrna reads from the metatranscriptomic samples were mapped to the assembly above indicating that these mags to be analyzed were able to capture a majority of the transcriptomic activities the relative abundance and gene transcription for each mag are shown in fig s7 supplementary data 1 in all two anammox strains were recovered jettenia amx1 and brocadia amx2 fig 2 the amx1 strain dominated with a relative abundance of 71 8 and gene transcription of over 95 9 both in control and dsf addition samples fig s7 the results indicated that amx1 contributed almost all of the anammox activity in the community other organisms with an abundance of 1 were cyn1 pro1 pro2 cfx1 cfx2 and atm1 affiliated to the phyla cyanobacteria proteobacteria chloroflexi and armatimonadetes fig s7 3 3 dsf signaling in the anammox community and changes of the community structure under long term addition of dsf the next question was to investigate the turnover of dsf signal in the anammox community biosynthesis of the dsf family of signals is dependent on the synthase rpff barber et al 1997 which has amino acid sequence relatedness to enoyl coa hydratase cheng et al 2010 after domain research totally 36 putative enoyl coa genes were found that were allocated to 7 mags in the anammox community further multiple sequence alignment identified 13 out of 36 putative rpff genes in the 7 mags amx1 pro1 cdk1 amx2 cfx3 cfx2 and cfx1 three categories of dsf dependent qs systems have been explored zhou et al 2017 the first category was originally identified in x campestris pv campestris xcc consisting of rpfc rpfg responsible for signal perception and transduction he and zhang 2008 after conservative domain search and multiple sequence alignment interestingly the analogous rpfc rpfg synthetic genes were identified only in the amx1 genome fig s8 here it should be emphasized that rpfg protein contains a conservative hd gyp domain which has phosphodiesterase activity and is able to degrade c di gmp deng et al 2012 a universal bacterial secondary messenger regulating a wide range of functions hengge 2009 thus it indicates a potentially hierarchical dsf signaling network via c di gmp for amx1 the second category of dsf dependent signaling has only a sensor protein rpfr which is able to perceive and transduce the dsf signal deng et al 2012 interestingly the rpfr protein contains a conservative eal domain which negatively controls the intracellular c di gmp level ryan et al 2006 it indicates that dsf signal is transduced downstream via c di gmp by the rpfr protein importantly this type of dsf signal sensor was found only in the pro1 genome fig s8 the third category is a cluster of genes involved in the signaling of another diffusible signal factor family molecule cis 2 decenoic acid bdsf no putative gene clusters were found in all the 12 mags in the metagenome in this study we emphasized on the diffusible signal factor family molecule cis 11 methyl dodecenoic acid dsf and thus bdsf type signaling will not be discussed based on these results we categorized the recovered mags according to whether they had genes for dsf biosynthesis or perception or signal transduction since amx1 and pro1 had all the three functional genes they were named as dsf qs species another group including cdk1 amx2 cfx3 cfx2 and cfx1 was only able to synthesize dsf and was categorized as dsf secretors the other mags without any of these functions were named as dsf null species table s4 the 16s rrna sequences were extracted from the mags in order to monitor the changes of the community structure in the long term reactor development fig 3 we found an obvious decrease in relative abundance during the reactor operation for dsf qs species amx1 and pro1 for most dsf secretor mags like amx2 cfx3 cfx1 and pro4 relatively higher abundance was found during the reactor operation for dsf null mags e g pro2 atm1 and pro3 the exogenous dsf addition had little influence on their abundance fig 3a in addition we found obvious clusters for the different samples using sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis spls da lê cao et al 2011 fig s9 there was no difference between control and dsf addition reactor until day 30 interestingly on days 55 75 and 95 the samples from each reactor were clustered together resulting in an obvious distinction between the two reactors this indicated that dsf acts as a motor to make a difference in the community structure and the effect was a relatively long term process 3 4 genome scale search for dsf dependent c di gmp effector clp regulon clp regulon was mediated by dsf cell cell communication signal he et al 2007 and also identified as a novel class of c di gmp effectors tao et al 2010 therefore the dsf dependent downstream regulatory networks by the global regulation factor clp within the anammox community especially for the dsf qs species were investigated we found a total of 155 and 143 genes for amx1 and pro1 respectively which were predicted to be directly regulated by clp these genes regulated by clp regulon encode proteins with multiple functions including energy production and conversion signal transition mechanisms replication recombination and repair cell wall membrane envelope biogenesis posttranslational modification protein turnover chaperones and particularly mass transport and metabolism like amino acids nucleotide carbohydrate coenzyme lipid and inorganic ion cog database fig s10 and supplementary data 2 3 5 genes for eps production and degradation regulated by dsf notably the genes for eps production and degradation in the dsf qs species were found within the clp regulon in fig 4 a significantly higher levels of two peptidase genes amx1 186 4 and amx1 276 20 were observed in amx1 genome for dsf addition for other mags more genes with significantly higher expression levels count 26 vs 16 were also found after dsf addition text s14 and supplementary data 3 diverse genes involved in the hydrolysis of carbohydrate bonds were also expressed in the anammox community fig 4b for dsf qs species no orf was found to be extracellular but 4 genes that were up regulated pro1 223 31 pro1 256 56 pro1 83 4 and pro1 13 152 in the pro1 genome were predicted periplasmic localizations on the contrary many genes from the other mags were up regulated count 32 vs 23 and predicted extracellular outer membrane and periplasmic localizations these genes were predicted to be responsible for the ps levels 3 6 genes for amino acid production and exchange regulated by dsf amino acid exchange is an important mechanism that shapes the microbial community mee et al 2014 the amino acid auxotrophy profile was found in the anammox community fig 5 a surprisingly we observed that pro1 is able to biosynthesize all the essential amino acids in addition pro1 genome has the highest number of genes for amino acid transporters which indicated the critical role of pro1 in the amino acid trade for the whole community after dsf addition the average gene expression of amino acid biosynthetic pathway encoded by each mag was calculated as seen in fig 5a and table s4 for dsf qs species biosynthetic pathways of tryptophan and lysine for amx1 and phenylalanine for pro1 were significantly up regulated whereas the methionine biosynthetic pathway for pro1 was significantly down regulated these pathways were within the clp regulon and directly regulated by dsf interestingly the synthesis of these four amino acids is metabolically expensive as reported earlier akashi and gojobori 2002 the indirect impact of dsf on the amino acid synthetic pathways is also shown in fig 5a importantly we found that almost all these dsf indirectly affected amino acids cost less to synthesize akashi and gojobori 2002 e g serine for amx1 cyn1 and pro3 glycine for amx2 pro3 alanine for cdk1 and cfx3 and asparagine for pro2 combined with the amino acid transporter profiles we found the up regulated genes mediated by the clp regulon included transporting amino acids for amx1 and pro1 fig 5b it illustrated that dsf directly regulates certain amino acid transporters for other mags except cdk1 and cfx1 dsf had little impact on the amino acid transporters 4 discussion 4 1 eps and amino acids as public goods regulated by dsf in anammox community dsf signal transition pathways were confirmed within the anammox community and can be maintained in the bacterial culture for hours newman et al 2008 which provided the foundation for analysis of the dsf regulation mechanism though dsf family molecules belong to short chain fatty acids that are a kind of carbon source with non signaling properties schertzer et al 2009 zhou et al 2017 few genes were found to have increased expression levels in the pathway of fatty acid degradation fig s11 this indicated that exogenous dsf functioned as signals and not as nutrients during our experiment two typical dsf signal transition pathways rpfc rpfg like and rpfr like were found in amx1 and pro1 genome meanwhile the levels of c di gmp were significantly lower under dsf addition condition fig 1c which agreed with the proteins rpfg and rpfr were able to degrade the second messenger c di gmp deng et al 2012 ryan et al 2006 accordingly we searched for the dsf dependent c di gmp receptors and thus the clp protein was emphasized here as reported earlier he et al 2007 tao et al 2010 the degradation of c di gmp releases free clp proteins which further activates the downstream genes the genes that are regulated by dsf signaling for public goods production utilization and exchange were tracked based on the clp regulon during short term dsf addition assays the genes for peptidases and carbohydrate bonds hydrolases were up regulated especially in the extracellular environments as a result these proteins contribute to the total amount of pn it has been reported these peptidases were active and could further degrade the pn into small peptides and amino acids during relatively longer periods for bacterial growth greig and travisano 2004 lawson et al 2017 which is responsible for the lower pn concentrations during long term detection similarly up regulated levels of the carbohydrate bond hydrolases activate the hydrolysis of extracellular ps which contributed to the lower levels of ps as for amino acids besides the degradation of proteins by peptidases we found that dsf directly induces the dsf qs species amx1 and pro1 to produce costly amino acids like tryptophan lysine and phenylalanine further controlled the expression of transporters to exchange amino acids through cellular membrane into the outer environments considering these genes have active binding sites within the clp regulon this process could be an important source of amino acids as extracellular public goods 4 2 dsf regulated public goods interactions among anammox community dsf as a signal molecule could mediate the exchange of public goods and metabolic energy which agreed that it regulate the certain communication between species ryan and dow 2011 interestingly dsf qs and dsf secretor species were predicted to biosynthesize dsf but not the dsf null species and different categories of mags had different responses towards public goods production and exchange under the dsf signal the coupling suggested that different categories of mags use dsf as a signal for different purposes for dsf qs species amx1 uses dsf to communicate with other species in a coordinated manner like synthesizing certain amino acids for each other or amx1 uses dsf for obtaining amino acids such as tyrosine histidine and methionine which were auxotrophic for amx1 amino acid biosynthesis is an energy intensive process and supplementation by bacteria might enable microbes to focus their metabolism on the uptake of reducing equivalents rather than biosynthesis embree et al 2015 the dsf acts as an important messenger between dsf qs and dsf secretor species which would enhance their interactions and stabilize the community fig 6 as reported previously hense et al 2012 bacteria within a complex structured community like the anammox community did not distribute randomly but spatially within the complex biofilm dsf signal thus presents a spatial heterogeneity it can act as a timer schluter et al 2016 which can be utilized by the bacteria to sense the signal and infer the relatedness to their neighbors the bacteria thus tune their investment into costly and exploitable cooperation in a coordinated manner and also fight against the cheaters allen et al 2016 darch et al 2012 the dsf secretor species were also able to produce and secrete dsf which was perceived by amx1 and pro1 fig 6 as a result costly amino acids and other auxotrophic amino acids were released as pubic goods the supplementation of costly amino acids would ease the energetic burden of the mags embree et al 2015 in return dsf secretor species might secrete certain peptidases and carbohydrate bond hydrolases which would degrade the organic molecules within anammox community and create a more suitable environment for the anammox species jin et al 2012 it agreed with the enhancing bacterial activity and increasing nrr after dsf addition in summary the dsf based regulation of public goods trade off benefited for the anammox bacterial activity and reactor performance 4 3 effect of dsf mediated public goods trade off on community structure succession here we proposed that the accumulated effect from different metabolic strategies of dsf regulated public goods of mags was an important cause for community structure shift first multiple pathways were found to be regulated by dsf including public goods metabolism and transport which suggested that other factors could also be responsible for the changes in the community structure however previous studies have shown that amino acids as public goods used for cross feeding within community were able to shape the community structure embree et al 2015 mee et al 2014 and eps played an important role in community assembly regulated by qs tan et al 2014 additionally we found significant changes in the levels of eps and amino acids as public goods during short term assays but the community structure did not alter until 30 days anammox community structure changed in a dsf coordinated manner under long term artificial exogenous dsf inducement overloaded metabolism for public goods under dsf regulation decreased the abundance of dsf qs species during reactor operation exogenous dsf directly induced amx1 and pro1 to produce higher levels of pn and costly amino acids that needed substantial energy to biosynthesize akashi and gojobori 2002 pande et al 2016 polz and cordero 2016 the rate yield trade off in microbial metabolism emerges because some molecules are costly to manufacture like proteins and that the bacteria needs to make decisions about resource allocation molenaar et al 2009 in this study exogenous dsf induced the dsf qs species to produce costly metabolites persistently thus decreasing the fraction of metabolic resources for growth similar trade offs in bacterial cellular economics causing shifts in growth strategies were also discussed using models molenaar et al 2009 and experiments basan et al 2015 positive trade offs in public goods for dsf secretor species contributed to the increase in their abundance under long term exogenous dsf addition dsf sector bacteria had the ability to degrade macromolecules like pn or ps into peptides amino acids or monosaccharides these metabolites could then be transported into the bacterial cells for energy or as carbon c or nitrogen n source for metabolism and growth especially for cdk1 cfx2 and cfx1 lawson et al 2017 which is also supported by the relatively higher levels of carbohydrate metabolism the small metabolite utilization has been also discussed in anammox community lawson et al 2017 furthermore only cheap amino acids such as alanine and glycine akashi and gojobori 2002 were influenced by dsf signal for cdk1 amx2 and cfx3 and the expression of amino acid transporters for cdk1 and cfx1 showed higher levels under dsf addition condition it can be deduced that these bacteria trade cheap amino acids for some costly amino acids without spending energy cheap amino acids as an ideal source of protein synthesis and energy generation were used for growth under dsf addition similar phenomena have been found previously for pure cultures and natural environments polz and cordero 2016 roller et al 2016 no obvious changes in the production or availability of dsf regulated public goods for dsf null species led to neutral or even less advantageous existence within the complex community lower levels of gene cluster were found for atm1 cyn1 and pro3 which indicated the lower levels of metabolic status under dsf signal condition fig s11 down regulation in the levels of peptidases and lack of activated amino acids transporters in the dsf null mags under dsf addition implied their inability to produce or trade public goods in a word the dsf plays an important timer role in bridging the interactions among different members in the anammox community once the timer is disrupted like artificial addition of dsf to the anammox culture or even persistently for long period its regulation would fail and then the balance of the community structure would be altered 4 4 significance of this study and prospects for the future bacteria coexist in nature with other microorganisms as consortia where interactions occur to build an advanced society haruta et al 2009 this study investigated the mechanism of qs regulated public goods in the anammox community it provided useful information for further research on bacterial communication especially in complex communities unlike previous reports focusing on the qs controlled pathways or functions the present study emphasized the critical role of qs regulated public goods of complex communities which increases our current understanding of the social behavior of the microbial community importantly these interactions allow the microorganisms to cooperate with symbiotic bacteria and alleviate their metabolic burdens brenner et al 2008 here dsf played a critical role in bridging interactions via regulating public goods cross feeding in anammox community the proper use of dsf would potentially ease the metabolic loads of the bacterial communities meanwhile deciphering the pathways and effect of their regulation would enable us to artificially regulate the activities of certain species for better cooperation in enhancing the performance of the anammox technology like the enhanced anammox activity after dsf addition here currently there is a growing number of studies focusing on the investigation of applying qs to the anammox related wastewater treatment zhang et al 2020b zhao et al 2020 for instance using qs molecules containing anammox supernatant to quick recovery of anammox process zhou et al 2020 likewise this study provides a new path to enhance the bacterial activity and reactor performance in biological wastewater treatment and also guide studies in the future when some advanced and promising technologies are proposed e g super resolution imaging and crispr cas9 genome editing for complex environmental microbes 5 conclusions in this study we found that exogenous dsf a kind of qs molecules can act as a critical signal to regulate the trade off of public goods via secondary messenger c di gmp regulator clp for metabolic purposes in these cultures dsf addition induces different responses in three clusters of the anammox community resulting in different metabolic and energetic loads for the production and cross feeding of public goods in detail dsf qs species anammox and proteobacteria affiliated bacteria can supply costly public goods eps and amino acids for dsf secretor species after sensing dsf in return dsf secretor species help anammox bacteria scavenge extracellular detritus which benefited for enhancing anammox activity and increasing the reactor nrr meanwhile the

17215,both the benefits of bacterial quorum sensing qs and cross feeding for bio reactor performance in wastewater treatment have been recently reported as the social traits of microbial communities how bacterial qs regulating bacterial trade off by cross feeding remains unclear here we find diffusion signal factor dsf a kind of qs molecules can bridge bacterial interactions through regulating public goods extracellular polymeric substances eps amino acids for metabolic cross feedings it showed that exogenous dsf addition leads to change of public goods level and community structure dynamics in the anammox consortia approaches involving meta omics clarified that anammox and a lautropia affiliated species in the phylum proteobacteria can supply costly public goods for dsf secretor species via secondary messenger c di gmp regulator clp after sensing dsf meanwhile dsf secretor species help anammox bacteria scavenge extracellular detritus which creates a more suitable environment for the anammox species enhances the anammox activity and improves the nitrogen removal rate of anammox reactor the trade off induces discrepant metabolic loads of different microbial clusters which were responsible for the community succession it illustrated the potential to artificially alleviate metabolic loads for certain bacteria deciphering microbial interactions via qs not only provides insights for understanding the social behavior of microbial community but also creates new thought for enhancing treatment performance through regulating bacterial social traits via quorum sensing mediated public goods graphical abstracts image graphical abstract keywords quorum sensing diffusion signal factor dsf public good anammox consortia nitrogen removal 1 introduction quorum sensing qs a prevalent interaction or communication avenue in the microbial community can coordinate bacterial behaviors at the population level via qs signal molecules these molecules have been the focus of research on pathogenic bacteria diggle et al 2007 fuqua et al 1994 keller and surette 2006 recently the qs phenomenon has been found in natural and artificial ecosystems and has attracted widespread attention feng et al 2013 tan et al 2014 importantly the qs signal could help bacteria resist the unfavorable environmental stresses low temperature and ph guo et al 2017b through regulating the production of extracellular polymeric substances eps and formation of sludge granular in biological wastewater treatment zhang et al 2020a meanwhile it has the ability to increase the microcystins removing efficiency zeng et al 2020 and shorten the recovery period of anaerobic digestion processes after toxic shock xiao et al 2019 via tuning the bacterial growth and activity herein bacteria always existed in the type of consortia or biofilm regulated by qs confining different kinds of bacteria that are taxonomically distinct in a limited space it greatly abridges the spatial distances and affects ecological interactions based on the exchange of small molecules or metabolites in the vicinity hall stoodley et al 2004 in microbial ecosystem bacteria trades with each other through resource allocation namely cross feeding mee et al 2014 of the exchanged molecules public goods are substances that are produced at a cost to provide shared benefits for a local neighborhood of cells previous studies demonstrated that digestive enzymes darch et al 2012 greig and travisano 2004 polymeric substances van gestel et al 2014 chelating compounds luján et al 2015 or amino acids pande et al 2016 could be secreted into extracellular environments as public goods importantly the exchange of public good is both beneficial for the producers and customers pande et al 2016 it has been reported that the public good secretion contributed for the bacterial fitness and reproduce nadell et al 2016 additionally studies have suggested that amino acid auxotrophy potentially shapes the community composition embree et al 2015 mee et al 2014 the researchers also focused on the regulation of public goods metabolism theoretical analysis and empirical studies have revealed that the secretion of public goods is more beneficial at higher cell densities in the aquatic environment heilmann et al 2015 nadell et al 2016 pai and you 2009 meanwhile it showed that the appropriate spatial segregation of bacteria in the microbial biofilm affected the exchange of public goods cordero et al 2012 of note qs has been found to be able to regulate the cross feeding of public goods for example as a kind of resource allocation the secretion of extracellular digestive enzymes was shown to be regulated by qs as a result to coordinate the cooperative behaviors in pseudomonas aeruginosa allen et al 2016 darch et al 2012 nadell et al 2016 and an antibiotic degrading enzyme in a synthetic qs system pai et al 2012 the cooperative social traits from qs is attractive not only in the pure culture but also in the complex microbial community recently anaerobic ammonium oxidation anammox process that directly converts nitrite and ammonium to nitrogen gas has attracted widespread attention for its high nitrogen removal capability and low energy consumption kartal et al 2010 lawson et al 2017 the qs signaling was shown playing an important role in the anammox community signal messenger bis 3 5 cyclic dimeric guanosine monophosphate c di gmp for example was identified in anammox culture guo et al 2017b and it was found likely to be an important regulator for anammox consortia against environmental stresses guo et al 2017a besides a recent study found that among the multiple qs signal systems diffusible signal factor dsf signaling shows great potential in the anammox community at anammox reactor start up tang et al 2018 furthermore it is known that among distinct classes of sensor kinases involved in dsf perception a best studied of these sensory systems is related to the turnover of c di gmp ryan et al 2011 this enlightens us to investigate whether there is a bridge between dsf and c di gmp involving the regulation of public good cross feeding in the anammox community here we utilized the approach of exogenous dsf addition to obtain conditions with coercive inducement of the dsf signal levels of public goods reactor performance and the composition of the microbial community were compared between with and without addition of dsf the mechanism of dsf regulated interactions within the complex community via public goods was further explored combining with metagenomes metatranscriptomes and hierarchical signaling network construction c di gmp receptor clp regulon the results emphasized the role of public goods in bridging the microbial communication regulated by qs it provided a valuable avenue for understanding the social traits of qs and trade off in the microbial community and a new concept for regulating the reactor performance in biological wastewater treatment 2 material and methods 2 1 batch assays batch assays were performed in 250 ml serum bottles each vial was inoculated with anammox consortia guo et al 2017a to a final concentration of 1 45 gvss l 1 the biomass was washed using anammox medium text s1 without nitrogen and re suspended in the cultivation medium the cultivation medium contained 100 mg no2 n l 1 and 100 mg nh4 n l 1 and the other components text s1 the vials were made anoxic by flushing with n2 for 10 min and the serum bottles were sealed tightly with rubber caps to avoid any influent of external oxygen to study the effects of dsf on anammox biomass we conducted successive 5 cycle batch assays that lasted fifty hours six vials were separated into two groups each group with three replicates 0 05 μm dsf molecule the determined optimal concentration details in text s2 and fig s1 was added to one group called dsf addition the same volume of medium without dsf was added to the other group called control group once the no2 was degraded completely it was considered as the end of each cycle of the batch assays all the supernatants were collected for amino acid detection and 1 ml of biomass ca 10 mgvss l 1 was harvested for eps and c di gmp detection details in texts s3 s6 since there was significant difference of extracellular protein concentration between two groups after the final cycle of batch assays fig s2 the biomass was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analysis 2 2 reactor operation two identical sequencing batch reactors sbrs r control and r dsf with a working volume of 1 0 l were operated for 95 days both sbrs were inoculated with 0 29 gvss l 1 anammox consortia guo et al 2017a stock solution of dsf was artificially added to the r dsf reactor with syringes after influent feeding every hydraulic retention time hrt to a final concentration of 0 05 μm in the reactor medium while the same volume of medium without dsf was added to the r control reactor after every hrt other settings in the two reactors were the same their hrts were initially set as 24 h with the influent nitrogen concentration at 50 mg no2 n l 1 and 50 mg nh4 n l 1 when no2 n in effluent was below 10 mg n l 1 the nitrogen load was increased by increasing the influent ammonium and nitrite concentrations the composition of media solution is presented in text s1 the ph of the sbrs was not controlled but it remained within the range of 7 5 to 8 0 and the temperature was maintained at 37 1 c the influent medium of sbrs was flushed with a gas mixture of n2 co2 95 5 to maintain anaerobic conditions the concentrations of nh4 n no3 n and no2 n were measured with uv visible spectrophotometry uv 1750 shimadzu according to the standard methods apha 1999 bacteria samples 3 biological replicates were taken from the sbrs at days 0 30 55 75 and 95 for the eps determination and 16s rrna gene sequencing 2 3 dna and rna sequencing the anammox biomass harvested from the batch assays and sbrs was used for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencing and from reactor for 16s rrna sequencing respectively total genomic dna was isolated from each sample using the fastdna spin kit for soil mp biotechnology solon oh usa according to the manufacturer s protocol for metagenomic sequencing the isolated dna was fragmented pair end library was constructed and adapters were prepared following which the samples were sequenced on the illumina hiseq4000 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa for 16s rrna sequencing primers 338f and 806r targeting the v3 v4 region were used which was then sequenced using the illumina miseq platform illumina inc san diego ca usa total rnas were extracted using the e z n a soil rna midi kit omega bio tek norcross ga usa according to the manufacturer s protocols after quality determination rrna in the total rna of samples were removed cdna libraries were constructed and samples were sequenced on the illumina hiseq 2500 platform illumina inc san diego ca usa all sequencing was performed at majorbio bio pharm technology co ltd shanghai china the detailed information for metagenomic and metatranscriptomic sequencings and analyses are given in texts s7 s11 to match the species annotated by 16s sequencing with the species of mags we extracted 16s sequences from the mags using rnammer 1 2 server lagesen et al 2007 and compared the 16s sequences to the otu sequences in 16s rrna sequencing dataset then we used the matched otus to represent the mags in this way 16s rrna samples taken at different timepoints along with the reactor development were able to track the succession of the anammox community here focusing on the species of the mags during the long term reactor development 2 4 prediction of dsf perception transition and biosynthesis genes two types of dsf perception and transition gene cluster or genes rpfc rpfg and rpfr and biosynthesis gene rpff were predicted based on the domain search against hmmer web server 2015 update finn et al 2015 using the metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data the overall profile of the prediction is shown in fig s3 briefly rpfc rpfg gene cluster was first predicted by hd domain the hd gyp domain was used to find rpfg and accordingly rpfc was next to rpfg in the genome the rpfr genes were predicted with intact pas ggdef eal domains putative rpff genes were searched for enoyl coa hydratase using hmmer website server and then aligned to filter the orfs with conservative sites two well conserved glutamate residues glu141 and glu161 for xanthomonas campestris pv campestris xcc rpff gene cheng et al 2010 details are provided in text s12 2 5 prediction of regulator clp protein and genome scale searching of clp binding sites clp is an important dsf signal regulator with a characteristic cnmp binding domain he et al 2007 the first work was to search cnmp binding domain for orfs after that sequence alignment was conducted to filter orfs with conservative sites a glutamic acid residue e99 for xcc clp gene as reported earlier tao et al 2010 the final orfs were the homologs of clp genes a python script was used to parse and match the promoter sequences of the clp regulated genes using the putative clp binding motif tgtga n6 tcaca dong and ebright 1992 the promoter region sequence which was arbitrarily defined as a 500 bp region upstream of an orf was obtained from a previous study he et al 2007 a confidence of 60 match to the non variable sequences i e tgtga and tcaca of the putative clp binding motif is taken as the cut off value only the best match was listed if more than one putative motif were located per promoter 2 6 data availability statement all data associated with 16s rrna can be found in ncbi under

under the accession numbers listed in table s1 3 results 3 1 altered levels of eps and amino acids as public goods and reactor performance in response to exogenous dsf addition dsf signals were first detected and confirmed in the anammox culture text s13 and fig s4 which suggests that dsf works as an intrinsic signal in the anammox consortia to insight into the mechanism of dsf signaling in the complex anammox community exogenous addition of dsf was proposed to mimic a stimulus response working frame the public goods eps and free amino acids were emphasized here considering they are important types of public goods that were well studied in either the research of quorum sensing or the anammox consortia guo et al 2017a tang et al 2018 in the study the contents of eps in the batch assays were determined fig 1 a and b the level of pn concentration was significantly increased when exogenous dsf was added p 0 0051 kruskal wallis anova on the contrary exogenous dsf induced significantly lower levels of ps p 0 0045 kruskal wallis anova c di gmp has been shown to be a global regulatory molecule that modulates the reciprocal responses of bacteria to activate extracellular components production lee et al 2007 to investigate the response of c di gmp levels to the addition of dsf and further relationship between c di gmp and eps we found the reduction of ps was coupled to a significant decline in of intracellular c di gmp levels p 0 019 kruskal wallis anova fig 1c we also detected the eps contents and reactor performance during the reactor operation fig s5 the pn contents increased in the two reactors compared to the inoculum surprisingly pn levels in dsf addition reactor were significantly lower than those of control which was contrary to the results of the short term batch assays fig 1a the ps contents in the dsf addition reactor presented an obvious decline during the reactor development and showed significantly lower levels than those of control which was consistent with the profiles of short term batch assays fig 1b for reactor performance the reactor with dsf addition had higher nitrogen removal rate nrr than reactor without dsf addition fig s6 in detail the nrr of reactor without and with dsf addition was 486 8 and 603 6 mg n l 1 d 1 on day 95 respectively importantly the specific anammox activity of reactor without and with dsf addition was 73 86 and 91 19 g n g vss 1 d 1 respectively it indicated that the anammox activity increased 23 46 after dsf addition which contributed to the nrr improving during the long term reactor operation to determine the levels of amino acids released and traded in the anammox culture amino acid concentrations in the supernatants were also detected fig 1d we found a significant difference in the levels of the essential amino acids in the dsf addition and control reactors higher levels of asparagine were detected under dsf addition condition fold change 2 07 p 0 038 kruskal wallis anova whereas lower levels of valine were detected under dsf addition condition fold change 0 58 p 0 019 kruskal wallis anova 3 2 community overview based on metagenomes and metatranscriptomes to decipher the mechanism of dsf regulation within the anammox community meta omics approaches were utilized assembly and binning of the metagenomic sequencing reads resulted in 12 high quality draft metagenome assembled genomes mags fig 2 and table s2 the 12 draft genomes accounted for 59 3 of the sequencing data from the samples without dsf addition table s3 at least 87 2 of mrna reads from the metatranscriptomic samples were mapped to the assembly above indicating that these mags to be analyzed were able to capture a majority of the transcriptomic activities the relative abundance and gene transcription for each mag are shown in fig s7 supplementary data 1 in all two anammox strains were recovered jettenia amx1 and brocadia amx2 fig 2 the amx1 strain dominated with a relative abundance of 71 8 and gene transcription of over 95 9 both in control and dsf addition samples fig s7 the results indicated that amx1 contributed almost all of the anammox activity in the community other organisms with an abundance of 1 were cyn1 pro1 pro2 cfx1 cfx2 and atm1 affiliated to the phyla cyanobacteria proteobacteria chloroflexi and armatimonadetes fig s7 3 3 dsf signaling in the anammox community and changes of the community structure under long term addition of dsf the next question was to investigate the turnover of dsf signal in the anammox community biosynthesis of the dsf family of signals is dependent on the synthase rpff barber et al 1997 which has amino acid sequence relatedness to enoyl coa hydratase cheng et al 2010 after domain research totally 36 putative enoyl coa genes were found that were allocated to 7 mags in the anammox community further multiple sequence alignment identified 13 out of 36 putative rpff genes in the 7 mags amx1 pro1 cdk1 amx2 cfx3 cfx2 and cfx1 three categories of dsf dependent qs systems have been explored zhou et al 2017 the first category was originally identified in x campestris pv campestris xcc consisting of rpfc rpfg responsible for signal perception and transduction he and zhang 2008 after conservative domain search and multiple sequence alignment interestingly the analogous rpfc rpfg synthetic genes were identified only in the amx1 genome fig s8 here it should be emphasized that rpfg protein contains a conservative hd gyp domain which has phosphodiesterase activity and is able to degrade c di gmp deng et al 2012 a universal bacterial secondary messenger regulating a wide range of functions hengge 2009 thus it indicates a potentially hierarchical dsf signaling network via c di gmp for amx1 the second category of dsf dependent signaling has only a sensor protein rpfr which is able to perceive and transduce the dsf signal deng et al 2012 interestingly the rpfr protein contains a conservative eal domain which negatively controls the intracellular c di gmp level ryan et al 2006 it indicates that dsf signal is transduced downstream via c di gmp by the rpfr protein importantly this type of dsf signal sensor was found only in the pro1 genome fig s8 the third category is a cluster of genes involved in the signaling of another diffusible signal factor family molecule cis 2 decenoic acid bdsf no putative gene clusters were found in all the 12 mags in the metagenome in this study we emphasized on the diffusible signal factor family molecule cis 11 methyl dodecenoic acid dsf and thus bdsf type signaling will not be discussed based on these results we categorized the recovered mags according to whether they had genes for dsf biosynthesis or perception or signal transduction since amx1 and pro1 had all the three functional genes they were named as dsf qs species another group including cdk1 amx2 cfx3 cfx2 and cfx1 was only able to synthesize dsf and was categorized as dsf secretors the other mags without any of these functions were named as dsf null species table s4 the 16s rrna sequences were extracted from the mags in order to monitor the changes of the community structure in the long term reactor development fig 3 we found an obvious decrease in relative abundance during the reactor operation for dsf qs species amx1 and pro1 for most dsf secretor mags like amx2 cfx3 cfx1 and pro4 relatively higher abundance was found during the reactor operation for dsf null mags e g pro2 atm1 and pro3 the exogenous dsf addition had little influence on their abundance fig 3a in addition we found obvious clusters for the different samples using sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis spls da lê cao et al 2011 fig s9 there was no difference between control and dsf addition reactor until day 30 interestingly on days 55 75 and 95 the samples from each reactor were clustered together resulting in an obvious distinction between the two reactors this indicated that dsf acts as a motor to make a difference in the community structure and the effect was a relatively long term process 3 4 genome scale search for dsf dependent c di gmp effector clp regulon clp regulon was mediated by dsf cell cell communication signal he et al 2007 and also identified as a novel class of c di gmp effectors tao et al 2010 therefore the dsf dependent downstream regulatory networks by the global regulation factor clp within the anammox community especially for the dsf qs species were investigated we found a total of 155 and 143 genes for amx1 and pro1 respectively which were predicted to be directly regulated by clp these genes regulated by clp regulon encode proteins with multiple functions including energy production and conversion signal transition mechanisms replication recombination and repair cell wall membrane envelope biogenesis posttranslational modification protein turnover chaperones and particularly mass transport and metabolism like amino acids nucleotide carbohydrate coenzyme lipid and inorganic ion cog database fig s10 and supplementary data 2 3 5 genes for eps production and degradation regulated by dsf notably the genes for eps production and degradation in the dsf qs species were found within the clp regulon in fig 4 a significantly higher levels of two peptidase genes amx1 186 4 and amx1 276 20 were observed in amx1 genome for dsf addition for other mags more genes with significantly higher expression levels count 26 vs 16 were also found after dsf addition text s14 and supplementary data 3 diverse genes involved in the hydrolysis of carbohydrate bonds were also expressed in the anammox community fig 4b for dsf qs species no orf was found to be extracellular but 4 genes that were up regulated pro1 223 31 pro1 256 56 pro1 83 4 and pro1 13 152 in the pro1 genome were predicted periplasmic localizations on the contrary many genes from the other mags were up regulated count 32 vs 23 and predicted extracellular outer membrane and periplasmic localizations these genes were predicted to be responsible for the ps levels 3 6 genes for amino acid production and exchange regulated by dsf amino acid exchange is an important mechanism that shapes the microbial community mee et al 2014 the amino acid auxotrophy profile was found in the anammox community fig 5 a surprisingly we observed that pro1 is able to biosynthesize all the essential amino acids in addition pro1 genome has the highest number of genes for amino acid transporters which indicated the critical role of pro1 in the amino acid trade for the whole community after dsf addition the average gene expression of amino acid biosynthetic pathway encoded by each mag was calculated as seen in fig 5a and table s4 for dsf qs species biosynthetic pathways of tryptophan and lysine for amx1 and phenylalanine for pro1 were significantly up regulated whereas the methionine biosynthetic pathway for pro1 was significantly down regulated these pathways were within the clp regulon and directly regulated by dsf interestingly the synthesis of these four amino acids is metabolically expensive as reported earlier akashi and gojobori 2002 the indirect impact of dsf on the amino acid synthetic pathways is also shown in fig 5a importantly we found that almost all these dsf indirectly affected amino acids cost less to synthesize akashi and gojobori 2002 e g serine for amx1 cyn1 and pro3 glycine for amx2 pro3 alanine for cdk1 and cfx3 and asparagine for pro2 combined with the amino acid transporter profiles we found the up regulated genes mediated by the clp regulon included transporting amino acids for amx1 and pro1 fig 5b it illustrated that dsf directly regulates certain amino acid transporters for other mags except cdk1 and cfx1 dsf had little impact on the amino acid transporters 4 discussion 4 1 eps and amino acids as public goods regulated by dsf in anammox community dsf signal transition pathways were confirmed within the anammox community and can be maintained in the bacterial culture for hours newman et al 2008 which provided the foundation for analysis of the dsf regulation mechanism though dsf family molecules belong to short chain fatty acids that are a kind of carbon source with non signaling properties schertzer et al 2009 zhou et al 2017 few genes were found to have increased expression levels in the pathway of fatty acid degradation fig s11 this indicated that exogenous dsf functioned as signals and not as nutrients during our experiment two typical dsf signal transition pathways rpfc rpfg like and rpfr like were found in amx1 and pro1 genome meanwhile the levels of c di gmp were significantly lower under dsf addition condition fig 1c which agreed with the proteins rpfg and rpfr were able to degrade the second messenger c di gmp deng et al 2012 ryan et al 2006 accordingly we searched for the dsf dependent c di gmp receptors and thus the clp protein was emphasized here as reported earlier he et al 2007 tao et al 2010 the degradation of c di gmp releases free clp proteins which further activates the downstream genes the genes that are regulated by dsf signaling for public goods production utilization and exchange were tracked based on the clp regulon during short term dsf addition assays the genes for peptidases and carbohydrate bonds hydrolases were up regulated especially in the extracellular environments as a result these proteins contribute to the total amount of pn it has been reported these peptidases were active and could further degrade the pn into small peptides and amino acids during relatively longer periods for bacterial growth greig and travisano 2004 lawson et al 2017 which is responsible for the lower pn concentrations during long term detection similarly up regulated levels of the carbohydrate bond hydrolases activate the hydrolysis of extracellular ps which contributed to the lower levels of ps as for amino acids besides the degradation of proteins by peptidases we found that dsf directly induces the dsf qs species amx1 and pro1 to produce costly amino acids like tryptophan lysine and phenylalanine further controlled the expression of transporters to exchange amino acids through cellular membrane into the outer environments considering these genes have active binding sites within the clp regulon this process could be an important source of amino acids as extracellular public goods 4 2 dsf regulated public goods interactions among anammox community dsf as a signal molecule could mediate the exchange of public goods and metabolic energy which agreed that it regulate the certain communication between species ryan and dow 2011 interestingly dsf qs and dsf secretor species were predicted to biosynthesize dsf but not the dsf null species and different categories of mags had different responses towards public goods production and exchange under the dsf signal the coupling suggested that different categories of mags use dsf as a signal for different purposes for dsf qs species amx1 uses dsf to communicate with other species in a coordinated manner like synthesizing certain amino acids for each other or amx1 uses dsf for obtaining amino acids such as tyrosine histidine and methionine which were auxotrophic for amx1 amino acid biosynthesis is an energy intensive process and supplementation by bacteria might enable microbes to focus their metabolism on the uptake of reducing equivalents rather than biosynthesis embree et al 2015 the dsf acts as an important messenger between dsf qs and dsf secretor species which would enhance their interactions and stabilize the community fig 6 as reported previously hense et al 2012 bacteria within a complex structured community like the anammox community did not distribute randomly but spatially within the complex biofilm dsf signal thus presents a spatial heterogeneity it can act as a timer schluter et al 2016 which can be utilized by the bacteria to sense the signal and infer the relatedness to their neighbors the bacteria thus tune their investment into costly and exploitable cooperation in a coordinated manner and also fight against the cheaters allen et al 2016 darch et al 2012 the dsf secretor species were also able to produce and secrete dsf which was perceived by amx1 and pro1 fig 6 as a result costly amino acids and other auxotrophic amino acids were released as pubic goods the supplementation of costly amino acids would ease the energetic burden of the mags embree et al 2015 in return dsf secretor species might secrete certain peptidases and carbohydrate bond hydrolases which would degrade the organic molecules within anammox community and create a more suitable environment for the anammox species jin et al 2012 it agreed with the enhancing bacterial activity and increasing nrr after dsf addition in summary the dsf based regulation of public goods trade off benefited for the anammox bacterial activity and reactor performance 4 3 effect of dsf mediated public goods trade off on community structure succession here we proposed that the accumulated effect from different metabolic strategies of dsf regulated public goods of mags was an important cause for community structure shift first multiple pathways were found to be regulated by dsf including public goods metabolism and transport which suggested that other factors could also be responsible for the changes in the community structure however previous studies have shown that amino acids as public goods used for cross feeding within community were able to shape the community structure embree et al 2015 mee et al 2014 and eps played an important role in community assembly regulated by qs tan et al 2014 additionally we found significant changes in the levels of eps and amino acids as public goods during short term assays but the community structure did not alter until 30 days anammox community structure changed in a dsf coordinated manner under long term artificial exogenous dsf inducement overloaded metabolism for public goods under dsf regulation decreased the abundance of dsf qs species during reactor operation exogenous dsf directly induced amx1 and pro1 to produce higher levels of pn and costly amino acids that needed substantial energy to biosynthesize akashi and gojobori 2002 pande et al 2016 polz and cordero 2016 the rate yield trade off in microbial metabolism emerges because some molecules are costly to manufacture like proteins and that the bacteria needs to make decisions about resource allocation molenaar et al 2009 in this study exogenous dsf induced the dsf qs species to produce costly metabolites persistently thus decreasing the fraction of metabolic resources for growth similar trade offs in bacterial cellular economics causing shifts in growth strategies were also discussed using models molenaar et al 2009 and experiments basan et al 2015 positive trade offs in public goods for dsf secretor species contributed to the increase in their abundance under long term exogenous dsf addition dsf sector bacteria had the ability to degrade macromolecules like pn or ps into peptides amino acids or monosaccharides these metabolites could then be transported into the bacterial cells for energy or as carbon c or nitrogen n source for metabolism and growth especially for cdk1 cfx2 and cfx1 lawson et al 2017 which is also supported by the relatively higher levels of carbohydrate metabolism the small metabolite utilization has been also discussed in anammox community lawson et al 2017 furthermore only cheap amino acids such as alanine and glycine akashi and gojobori 2002 were influenced by dsf signal for cdk1 amx2 and cfx3 and the expression of amino acid transporters for cdk1 and cfx1 showed higher levels under dsf addition condition it can be deduced that these bacteria trade cheap amino acids for some costly amino acids without spending energy cheap amino acids as an ideal source of protein synthesis and energy generation were used for growth under dsf addition similar phenomena have been found previously for pure cultures and natural environments polz and cordero 2016 roller et al 2016 no obvious changes in the production or availability of dsf regulated public goods for dsf null species led to neutral or even less advantageous existence within the complex community lower levels of gene cluster were found for atm1 cyn1 and pro3 which indicated the lower levels of metabolic status under dsf signal condition fig s11 down regulation in the levels of peptidases and lack of activated amino acids transporters in the dsf null mags under dsf addition implied their inability to produce or trade public goods in a word the dsf plays an important timer role in bridging the interactions among different members in the anammox community once the timer is disrupted like artificial addition of dsf to the anammox culture or even persistently for long period its regulation would fail and then the balance of the community structure would be altered 4 4 significance of this study and prospects for the future bacteria coexist in nature with other microorganisms as consortia where interactions occur to build an advanced society haruta et al 2009 this study investigated the mechanism of qs regulated public goods in the anammox community it provided useful information for further research on bacterial communication especially in complex communities unlike previous reports focusing on the qs controlled pathways or functions the present study emphasized the critical role of qs regulated public goods of complex communities which increases our current understanding of the social behavior of the microbial community importantly these interactions allow the microorganisms to cooperate with symbiotic bacteria and alleviate their metabolic burdens brenner et al 2008 here dsf played a critical role in bridging interactions via regulating public goods cross feeding in anammox community the proper use of dsf would potentially ease the metabolic loads of the bacterial communities meanwhile deciphering the pathways and effect of their regulation would enable us to artificially regulate the activities of certain species for better cooperation in enhancing the performance of the anammox technology like the enhanced anammox activity after dsf addition here currently there is a growing number of studies focusing on the investigation of applying qs to the anammox related wastewater treatment zhang et al 2020b zhao et al 2020 for instance using qs molecules containing anammox supernatant to quick recovery of anammox process zhou et al 2020 likewise this study provides a new path to enhance the bacterial activity and reactor performance in biological wastewater treatment and also guide studies in the future when some advanced and promising technologies are proposed e g super resolution imaging and crispr cas9 genome editing for complex environmental microbes 5 conclusions in this study we found that exogenous dsf a kind of qs molecules can act as a critical signal to regulate the trade off of public goods via secondary messenger c di gmp regulator clp for metabolic purposes in these cultures dsf addition induces different responses in three clusters of the anammox community resulting in different metabolic and energetic loads for the production and cross feeding of public goods in detail dsf qs species anammox and proteobacteria affiliated bacteria can supply costly public goods eps and amino acids for dsf secretor species after sensing dsf in return dsf secretor species help anammox bacteria scavenge extracellular detritus which benefited for enhancing anammox activity and increasing the reactor nrr meanwhile the discrepant metabolic loads of different microbial clusters were responsible for the community succession it illustrated the potential to artificially alleviate the metabolic loads and thus increase

17216,rapid enrichment of anaerobic ammonia oxidation bacteria anaob is highly associated with the granulation process however the interactive mechanism remains unclear especially for the initial granulation process a single stage partial nitritation anammox pn a bioreactor combined with granular floc sludge was operated for 400 days during the experimental period the nitrogen removal rate increased from 0 60 to 1 21 kg n m 3 d 1 and the nitrogen removal capability improved primarily during a transition period days 200 250 which was accompanied by a particle size increase and anaob proliferation 4 9 1 7 days moreover as observed by the biomass physio morphology the size distribution and the microbial community shift small flocs 200 μm aggregated due to the addition of excess sodium acetate the emerging floc aggregates represented an early form of granules providing the initial biological carrier and necessary anaerobic microenvironment for the growth of attached anaob resulting in a high anaob growth rate these results are the first direct evidence that floc aggregates are essential to anaob enrichment and that they can be affected by operational conditions this study provides an in depth understanding of the link between floc aggregations and anaob enrichment and broadens the feasibility of optimizing pn a applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox bacteria enrichment floc aggregates initial carrier anaerobic microenvironment partial nitritation anammox 1 introduction biological nitrogen remediation via anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob combined with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob jetten et al 1998 is known as the partial nitritation anammox pn a process in single reactor pn a variants aob oxidize a portion of the influent ammonium to nitrite subsequently anaob directly converts the residual ammonium and nitrite into nitrogen gas the pn a process is a promising alternative for conventional nitrification denitrification processes since it does not require organics and has a low oxygen demand kartal et al 2010 mccarty 2018 to date the successful implementation of full scale pn a has been demonstrated and its applications have continued to increase lackner et al 2014 despite the increasing global importance of pn a its utilization is still difficult with anaob enrichment remaining one of the major bottlenecks anaob have a low growth rate 0 065 0 33 day 1 and a pronounced sensitivity to various environments lackner et al 2014 van der star et al 2007 numerous strategies have been used to enrich the slow growing anaob and enhance biomass cultivation of which sludge granulation is a workable and economical method vlaeminck et al 2010 for the pn a process the occurrence of granular sludge is highly associated with anaob enrichment and is thus simply referred to as anammox granulation chen et al 2019 anaob enrichment during granulation is attributed to the distinctive physical characteristics of the granular sludge specifically granular sludge has a higher biomass density and settling velocity than flocs thereby providing a longer biomass retention time to avoid anaob washout zhang et al 2017 additionally the spatial concentration gradient inside the granular sludge provides a suitable microenvironment for anaob growth by avoiding the restraint of oxygen and nitrite joss et al 2011 lawson et al 2017 vlaeminck et al 2010 recently researchers have focused on revealing the mechanism of anammox granulation to enhance anaob enrichment two major mechanisms have been proposed to illustrate the initial anammox granulation process first previous research has suggested that initial anammox granulation is caused by the superior self aggregation tendency of anaob which is associated with 1 the initial adhesion ali et al 2018 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020 2 an enlarged hydrophobic surface 3 less hydrophilic functional groups on the extracellular polymeric substances eps ali et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 and 4 quorum sensing guo et al 2017 ali et al 2018 found that planktonic free living anaob cells that were cultured in up flow column reactors self aggregated in addition to self aggregation feasible engineering strategies are believed to enhance anammox granulation through floc aggregation as the initial aggregates different theories have been established in the literature such as selecting the appropriate bioreactor configurations controlling hydrodynamic forces e g air and water flows and selection pressure sarma et al 2017 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 or physically immobilizing biomass as an initial aggregate ali et al 2015 zhang and okabe 2017 van der star et al 2007 showed that anammox granulation can be obtained through a high specific surface area and they achieved the successful start up of the first full scale anammox reactor additionally ali et al 2015 reported that immobilizing a minimal quantity of biomass on polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate gel beads as the initial aggregates could rapidly initiate an anammox bioreactor within 35 days of operation in a pn a bioreactor the initial anammox granulation process is a complicated microbial aggregation process that is influenced by operational conditions and bacterial interactions as previously reported hypothesized granulation pathways include gradual replication by division and budding based on the inoculation and special operation mode vlaeminck et al 2010 however the link between sludge granulation and anaob enrichment remains debatable because dynamic anammox granulation has been rarely observed and investigated so far the initial anammox granulation process and its effect on anaob enrichment have been primarily understood based on molecular investigations using mature anammox granular sludge thus more direct experimental evidence during the initial anammox granulation process is still required to address the initial anammox granulation mechanism in this study a granular floc pn a process was operated for 400 days in a sequencing batch reactor sbr changes in the bioreactor performance i e anaob abundance maximum bioactivity and nitrogen removal performance were monitored over time the nitrogen removal rate remained stable except during a short transition period in which a quick increase occurred over 50 days during the critical transition period aggregates with varied physio morphologies were used to understand the anammox granulation by measuring their distinctive characteristics including mixed liquor suspended solids mlss diameter distribution and microscopic architecture furthermore microbial communities were studied using quantitative real time pcr qpcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing to provide more information on the difference and relationship between the different aggregates finally the anaob enrichment and its link to floc aggregates were comprehensively discussed the findings of this study are useful for understanding the underlying mechanism of anammox granulation and facilitating various pn a applications for wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up

manually discharge flocs 200 μm and retain particles 200 μm every day the sludge retention time was approximately 30 days as previously reported li et al 2019 the entire bioreactor operation periods were divided into 3 sub periods according to the different underlying operational conditions during the initial stable period days 1 200 the pn a performance gradually stabilized after adaptation during the transition period days 201 250 a sizable amount of sodium acetate was added into the sbr during the first cycle of this period causing an immediate crash of nitrogen performance over the following 50 days the nitrogen removal performance rapidly recovered during the new stable period days 251 400 the sbr returned to a new stable state with a stable nitrogen removal performance 2 2

sludge and operated under a low do 0 25 0 1 mg l 1 during the 400 day experiment the ammonium concentrations at the beginning of each cycle were maintained at an average of 112 7 mg l 1 while the effluent ammonium concentrations varied by adjusting the aeration time figure s1 during the initial stable period 200 days the nitrogen removal rate remained stable at an average of 0 60 kg n m 3 d 1 with a stable anaob bioactivity of 8 8 kg n m 3 d 1 fig 1 a the anaob abundance remained at an average 1 9 109 copies g 1 ss fig 1b according to the accumulated ammonium and nitrite in the bioreactor figure s1 the improvement in the nitrogen removal rate was primarily limited by anaob growth on day 200 excess sodium acetate was added into the bioreactor this resulted in a sharp decrease in the nitrogen removal rate to 0 22 kg n m 3 d 1 during the following 50 day period a transition period the nitrogen removal rate rapidly increased nearly 1 7 fold peaking at 1 21 kg n m 3 d 1 and the anaob bioactivity sharply increased 2 0 fold to 16 1 kg n m 3 d 1 moreover the anaob abundance increased to 2 1 1011 copies g 1 ss during the transition period a 4 fold increase fig 1b the anaob multiplication time was 4 9 1 7 days for days 1 248 after the quick increase in the anaob abundance the nitrogen removal became stable again during this new stable period the nitrogen removal rate remained stable for 150 days at 1 03 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 along with a stable anaob bioactivity and abundance the anaob growth rate was limited during the 2 stable periods but was high during the transition period 1 µ 4 9 1 7 days thus the rapid anaob enrichment was achieved in the pn a bioreactor under specific conditions and the associated underlying mechanism was worthy of further investigation 3 2 variations in the physical morphology of the granular and floc sludge during the transition period the microscopic architecture was observed as was the physical morphology of the 4 different sludges large granules small granules floc aggregations and flocs on day 245 figs 2 c and 2d and table 1 as previously reported large granules and small granules are compact and densely aggregated with a spherical shape hubaux et al 2015 in contrast flocs are defined as loose and permeable aggregations composed of microcolonies enmeshed in exocellular polymers vlaeminck et al 2010 interestingly along with flocs and granules floc aggregations featuring both flocs and granules were observed compared with the granules the floc aggregations had a rough surface similar to the flocs but their diameter exceeded that of the flocs and remained close to that of the small granules to further explore the sludge characteristics the distributions of the weight and the volume for the different biomass sizes were measured and compared fig 2 during the transition period as the floc aggregations formed the diameter distribution significantly changed as 2 peak values merged to a single peak value of 271 µm day 209 fig 2b more importantly the volume proportion of the particles 200 µm increased from 44 4 to 62 6 the granule sludge weight particles 200 µm showed a similar trend increasing from 3020 to 3924 mg l 1 in contrast the diameter distribution of the particles 200 µm decreased from 55 6 to 37 4 and the weight decreased from 3013 to 2705 mg l 1 these results strongly suggested that flocs were combined into the floc aggregations which remarkably increased the percentage g to 59 5 1 5 in a short period figure s3 the floc aggregation phenomenon and the increased granule percentage were only observed during the transition period prior to this period as shown in the diameter distribution 2 distinct peak values of 543 and 68 µm were observed suggesting the co existence of granules and flocs these peak values gradually increased to 913 and 80 µm respectively fig 2b in contrast to the transition period the volume proportion of the large particles 200 µm decreased from 55 to 44 4 fig 2b moreover because the weight of the larger particles 200 µm decreased while that of the smaller particles increased the percentage g gradually decreased and eventually stabilized at an average of 47 1 2 fig 2 figure s3 during the new stable period the weight of the small particles 200 µm increased again and the percentage g gradually returned to a long term and steady ratio that averaged 47 1 5 a comparison of the transition and stable periods revealed that the physical morphology of the granular and floc sludge rapidly transformed in this pn a bioreactor during the transition period the floc aggregations as an early form of the granules originated from the flocs this resulted in a dramatic increase in both granule weight and volume and promoted the anaob enrichment comparatively during both stable periods the particle diameter increased but the granule weight and proportion slightly decreased which might have caused the limited anaob growth accordingly it is hypothesized that floc transformation into floc aggregations is critical to anaob enrichment because they are an early form of anammox granules in the present study the pn a process was comprised of granules and flocs as previously reported li et al 2017b in both stable periods the distribution of the diameters and weights of flocs and the granules remained basically unchanged suggesting that the granules and flocs had an overall stability and separability only under appropriate conditions flocs would transform into granules over a short time and promote anaob enrichment this indicates that the anammox granulation process is not continuous but an occasional and short term event in the present study taken together the variable sludge physical morphology from flocs to granular sludge was not obvious which was probably associated with the limited anaob enrichment in the present study 3 3 microbial communities of the 4 sludges with different physical morphologies to further investigate the correlation between floc aggregations and granules flocs the microbial communities of the floc aggregations were evaluated and compared to the other sludges with different physical morphologies the otus from the microbial communities of all the samples were clustered using a principal coordinate analysis pcoa fig 3 a and hierarchical clustering based on the bray curtis dissimilarities fig 3b the pcoa identified robust clustering of the otus according to the 4 sludges with different physical morphologies at the otu level comp1 and comp2 explained 51 2 and 10 2 of the total variation respectively fig 3a the results indicated that flocs and floc aggregations were the closest but the microbial characteristics of the floc aggregations were closer to the granules comp 1 hierarchical clustering further supported these conclusions fig 3b the microbial diversity within each sample was then analyzed at the otu level using the simpson diversity index and the simpson evenness figure s4 the simpson index of the large granules 0 07 and small granules 0 14 showed a clear separation between that of the floc aggregations 0 28 and flocs 0 22 the simpson index indicated that the microbial diversity of the floc aggregations was similar to that of the flocs but quite different from the large and small granules which was agreed with the results of the simpson evenness these results further suggested that the flocs transformed into floc aggregations during the transition period and eventually developed into mature granules 3 4 distribution of functional bacteria in the different sludge morphologies to provide insights into the rapid anaob enrichment microorganisms from the different sludge morphologies were assessed using 16s rrna gene sequencing and qpcr functional bacteria associated with the primary nitrogen conversion pathways are shown in fig 4 candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia and nitrosomonas were all significantly enriched p 0 05 in the 4 samples fig 4a nitrosomonas was the dominant aob in the floc aggregations with a relative abundance of 3 4 which was similar to that in the flocs 4 3 but much higher than in the large and small granules 0 01 similar results were observed for the gene copy number of amoa fig 4b moreover the dominant anaob candidatus brocadia in the floc aggregations exhibited a relative abundance of 4 1 which was higher than that of the flocs 1 3 in this study floc aggregations formed by flocs resulted in abundant nitrifying bacteria being encased in the floc aggregations as well as anaob enrichment it was also noticed that the small granules had the highest relative abundance of anaob 22 4 followed by large granules 13 0 further analysis showed that the small granules had the highest anaob abundance approximately 1 6 0 1 1012 copies g 1 ss followed by floc aggregations large granules and flocs fig 4b according to these results nitrifying bacteria were enriched in the flocs and anaob in the granules in the pn a bioreactor which agreed with previous reports li et al 2020 2019 vlaeminck et al 2010 this study also suggests that floc aggregations could be an early form of granule thereby resulting in the enrichment of anaob 4 discussion 4 1 rapid anaob enrichment mechanism linked to floc aggregations the results of this study provide an alternative theory for developing anammox granules that involves 4 stages generation flocs growth floc aggregations maturity small granules and decay large granules flocs forming into floc aggregations is a critical transient period for the initial anammox granulation floc aggregations like the early form of granules showed spatial concentration gradients that promoted the proliferation of anaob because of the favorable micro environment and macro retention a significant red area was observed inside the floc aggregations fig 2 d3 presenting a high specific number of anaob fig 4 the enriched anaob further accelerated granule formation and increased the diameter of the anammox granules anammox granules contain high levels of eps especially proteins jia et al 2017 that are primarily responsible for the structural and functional integrity of the aggregates and are essential to the physicochemical and biological properties li et al 2016 compared with the transition period the floc aggregation process was limited during the stable periods however the diameter of the granules increased suggesting that small granules grew into larger granules the weight of the anammox granules particles 200 µm decreased slightly figure s3 and both anaob relative abundance and absolute abundance also deceased as revealed by the qpcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing results this may have been because a dead zone formed in the larger diameter anammox granules resulting in a low mass transfer efficiency between the anammox granules and substrates vlaeminck et al 2010 the large aggregates in the bioreactor became progressively looser and disassociated into smaller flocs likely with poorer settling properties which may have resulted in anaob washout and a slight decrease in the nitrogen removal rate laureni et al 2015 mitigating anammox granule segregation has been suggested for pn as to avoid process failure sarma et al 2017 winkler et al 2011 recent studies have shown that micro granular sludge is increasingly important for the anammox process chen et al 2019 wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 demonstrated the feasibility of treating 50 mg l 1 ammonium wastewater in a micro granule based pn a bioreactor in which the size range of most of the granules was 265 536 µm anammox granules of an appropriate diameter have a high mass transfer efficiency inside the granules chen et al 2019 which resulted in the highest anaob abundance fig 4 thus this confirmed that the appropriate granule size was preferable to a larger size 4 2 possible triggers of microbial aggregations during the pn a processes and future study the growth rate of anaob has been identified as a major obstacle for mainstream anammox application van der star et al 2007 it is currently believed that providing a favorable anaerobic micro environment and effective retention are the basic and critical parameters for rapid anaob enrichment as shown in table s2 the specific growth rate of anaob is approximately 10 12 days during the anammox process in an sbr under completely anaerobic conditions to date several studies have reported that the maximum anaob multiplication time could be as low as 2 1 3 9 days in a membrane bioreactor zhang et al 2017 zhang and okabe 2017 which is attributed to the effective hold and strict anaerobic conditions for the anaob in a pn a anaob inhibition could be caused by a comparatively high dissolved oxygen do concentration triggered by reducing the loading rate over aeration or the partial inhibition of aob joss et al 2011 lackner et al 2014 in the present study however during the transition period anaob was rapidly enriched 1 µ 4 9 1 7 days with both an increased anaob bioactivity and nitrogen removal rate fig 1 anaob enrichment was highly related to the floc aggregations further analysis suggested that floc aggregation occurred immediately after the excess sodium acetate was pulse fed the addition of soluble organics triggered the rapid transformation of flocs into to floc aggregations and further facilitated anammox granulation this theory for the initial anaob aggregations is similar to that for accelerating anaob enrichment using aerobic granular sludge winkler et al 2012 as previously reported the availability of easily biodegradable organics due to acetate pulse feeding increased eps content in anaerobic granular sludge beun et al 2002 cydzik kwiatkowska et al 2016 which promoted the granulation from suspended activated sludge so far the effects of organics on single stage pn a process have been widely studied laureni et al 2015 li et al 2018 winkler et al 2012 but the mechanism of organic addition on enhancing the anammox granulation remains unclear lotti et al 2014 sarma et al 2017 since organics potentially affect anammox granules in different ways including via the microbial community synthesis of eps and the metabolic pathways of anaob feng et al 2018 speth et al 2016 further research is still required to gain more insight to the influence of organics on granulation as well as engineering application of anammox 5 conclusions in this study rapid anaob enrichment in granular sludge was explored during the initial 200 day period the bioreactor operated with a stable anaob abundance and bioactivity and nitrogen removal performance during the 50 day transition period anaob proliferated 4 9 1 7 days along with an increasing anaob bioactivity 2 0 fold further increased the nitrogen removal rate from 0 60 to 1 21 kg n m 3 d 1 anammox granulation was not likely triggered by anaob growth and self aggregation in the short term but flocs formed into floc aggregations which was triggered by the excess sodium acetate that was pulse fed into the pn a bioreactor floc aggregations acting as the initial carrier caused

17216,rapid enrichment of anaerobic ammonia oxidation bacteria anaob is highly associated with the granulation process however the interactive mechanism remains unclear especially for the initial granulation process a single stage partial nitritation anammox pn a bioreactor combined with granular floc sludge was operated for 400 days during the experimental period the nitrogen removal rate increased from 0 60 to 1 21 kg n m 3 d 1 and the nitrogen removal capability improved primarily during a transition period days 200 250 which was accompanied by a particle size increase and anaob proliferation 4 9 1 7 days moreover as observed by the biomass physio morphology the size distribution and the microbial community shift small flocs 200 μm aggregated due to the addition of excess sodium acetate the emerging floc aggregates represented an early form of granules providing the initial biological carrier and necessary anaerobic microenvironment for the growth of attached anaob resulting in a high anaob growth rate these results are the first direct evidence that floc aggregates are essential to anaob enrichment and that they can be affected by operational conditions this study provides an in depth understanding of the link between floc aggregations and anaob enrichment and broadens the feasibility of optimizing pn a applications graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords anammox bacteria enrichment floc aggregates initial carrier anaerobic microenvironment partial nitritation anammox 1 introduction biological nitrogen remediation via anaerobic ammonia oxidizing bacteria anaob combined with ammonia oxidizing bacteria aob jetten et al 1998 is known as the partial nitritation anammox pn a process in single reactor pn a variants aob oxidize a portion of the influent ammonium to nitrite subsequently anaob directly converts the residual ammonium and nitrite into nitrogen gas the pn a process is a promising alternative for conventional nitrification denitrification processes since it does not require organics and has a low oxygen demand kartal et al 2010 mccarty 2018 to date the successful implementation of full scale pn a has been demonstrated and its applications have continued to increase lackner et al 2014 despite the increasing global importance of pn a its utilization is still difficult with anaob enrichment remaining one of the major bottlenecks anaob have a low growth rate 0 065 0 33 day 1 and a pronounced sensitivity to various environments lackner et al 2014 van der star et al 2007 numerous strategies have been used to enrich the slow growing anaob and enhance biomass cultivation of which sludge granulation is a workable and economical method vlaeminck et al 2010 for the pn a process the occurrence of granular sludge is highly associated with anaob enrichment and is thus simply referred to as anammox granulation chen et al 2019 anaob enrichment during granulation is attributed to the distinctive physical characteristics of the granular sludge specifically granular sludge has a higher biomass density and settling velocity than flocs thereby providing a longer biomass retention time to avoid anaob washout zhang et al 2017 additionally the spatial concentration gradient inside the granular sludge provides a suitable microenvironment for anaob growth by avoiding the restraint of oxygen and nitrite joss et al 2011 lawson et al 2017 vlaeminck et al 2010 recently researchers have focused on revealing the mechanism of anammox granulation to enhance anaob enrichment two major mechanisms have been proposed to illustrate the initial anammox granulation process first previous research has suggested that initial anammox granulation is caused by the superior self aggregation tendency of anaob which is associated with 1 the initial adhesion ali et al 2018 jia et al 2017 wang et al 2020 2 an enlarged hydrophobic surface 3 less hydrophilic functional groups on the extracellular polymeric substances eps ali et al 2018 zhao et al 2018 and 4 quorum sensing guo et al 2017 ali et al 2018 found that planktonic free living anaob cells that were cultured in up flow column reactors self aggregated in addition to self aggregation feasible engineering strategies are believed to enhance anammox granulation through floc aggregation as the initial aggregates different theories have been established in the literature such as selecting the appropriate bioreactor configurations controlling hydrodynamic forces e g air and water flows and selection pressure sarma et al 2017 wang et al 2017 yang et al 2019 or physically immobilizing biomass as an initial aggregate ali et al 2015 zhang and okabe 2017 van der star et al 2007 showed that anammox granulation can be obtained through a high specific surface area and they achieved the successful start up of the first full scale anammox reactor additionally ali et al 2015 reported that immobilizing a minimal quantity of biomass on polyvinyl alcohol sodium alginate gel beads as the initial aggregates could rapidly initiate an anammox bioreactor within 35 days of operation in a pn a bioreactor the initial anammox granulation process is a complicated microbial aggregation process that is influenced by operational conditions and bacterial interactions as previously reported hypothesized granulation pathways include gradual replication by division and budding based on the inoculation and special operation mode vlaeminck et al 2010 however the link between sludge granulation and anaob enrichment remains debatable because dynamic anammox granulation has been rarely observed and investigated so far the initial anammox granulation process and its effect on anaob enrichment have been primarily understood based on molecular investigations using mature anammox granular sludge thus more direct experimental evidence during the initial anammox granulation process is still required to address the initial anammox granulation mechanism in this study a granular floc pn a process was operated for 400 days in a sequencing batch reactor sbr changes in the bioreactor performance i e anaob abundance maximum bioactivity and nitrogen removal performance were monitored over time the nitrogen removal rate remained stable except during a short transition period in which a quick increase occurred over 50 days during the critical transition period aggregates with varied physio morphologies were used to understand the anammox granulation by measuring their distinctive characteristics including mixed liquor suspended solids mlss diameter distribution and microscopic architecture furthermore microbial communities were studied using quantitative real time pcr qpcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing to provide more information on the difference and relationship between the different aggregates finally the anaob enrichment and its link to floc aggregates were comprehensively discussed the findings of this study are useful for understanding the underlying mechanism of anammox granulation and facilitating various pn a applications for wastewater treatment 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental set up

manually discharge flocs 200 μm and retain particles 200 μm every day the sludge retention time was approximately 30 days as previously reported li et al 2019 the entire bioreactor operation periods were divided into 3 sub periods according to the different underlying operational conditions during the initial stable period days 1 200 the pn a performance gradually stabilized after adaptation during the transition period days 201 250 a sizable amount of sodium acetate was added into the sbr during the first cycle of this period causing an immediate crash of nitrogen performance over the following 50 days the nitrogen removal performance rapidly recovered during the new stable period days 251 400 the sbr returned to a new stable state with a stable nitrogen removal performance 2 2

sludge and operated under a low do 0 25 0 1 mg l 1 during the 400 day experiment the ammonium concentrations at the beginning of each cycle were maintained at an average of 112 7 mg l 1 while the effluent ammonium concentrations varied by adjusting the aeration time figure s1 during the initial stable period 200 days the nitrogen removal rate remained stable at an average of 0 60 kg n m 3 d 1 with a stable anaob bioactivity of 8 8 kg n m 3 d 1 fig 1 a the anaob abundance remained at an average 1 9 109 copies g 1 ss fig 1b according to the accumulated ammonium and nitrite in the bioreactor figure s1 the improvement in the nitrogen removal rate was primarily limited by anaob growth on day 200 excess sodium acetate was added into the bioreactor this resulted in a sharp decrease in the nitrogen removal rate to 0 22 kg n m 3 d 1 during the following 50 day period a transition period the nitrogen removal rate rapidly increased nearly 1 7 fold peaking at 1 21 kg n m 3 d 1 and the anaob bioactivity sharply increased 2 0 fold to 16 1 kg n m 3 d 1 moreover the anaob abundance increased to 2 1 1011 copies g 1 ss during the transition period a 4 fold increase fig 1b the anaob multiplication time was 4 9 1 7 days for days 1 248 after the quick increase in the anaob abundance the nitrogen removal became stable again during this new stable period the nitrogen removal rate remained stable for 150 days at 1 03 0 2 kg n m 3 d 1 along with a stable anaob bioactivity and abundance the anaob growth rate was limited during the 2 stable periods but was high during the transition period 1 µ 4 9 1 7 days thus the rapid anaob enrichment was achieved in the pn a bioreactor under specific conditions and the associated underlying mechanism was worthy of further investigation 3 2 variations in the physical morphology of the granular and floc sludge during the transition period the microscopic architecture was observed as was the physical morphology of the 4 different sludges large granules small granules floc aggregations and flocs on day 245 figs 2 c and 2d and table 1 as previously reported large granules and small granules are compact and densely aggregated with a spherical shape hubaux et al 2015 in contrast flocs are defined as loose and permeable aggregations composed of microcolonies enmeshed in exocellular polymers vlaeminck et al 2010 interestingly along with flocs and granules floc aggregations featuring both flocs and granules were observed compared with the granules the floc aggregations had a rough surface similar to the flocs but their diameter exceeded that of the flocs and remained close to that of the small granules to further explore the sludge characteristics the distributions of the weight and the volume for the different biomass sizes were measured and compared fig 2 during the transition period as the floc aggregations formed the diameter distribution significantly changed as 2 peak values merged to a single peak value of 271 µm day 209 fig 2b more importantly the volume proportion of the particles 200 µm increased from 44 4 to 62 6 the granule sludge weight particles 200 µm showed a similar trend increasing from 3020 to 3924 mg l 1 in contrast the diameter distribution of the particles 200 µm decreased from 55 6 to 37 4 and the weight decreased from 3013 to 2705 mg l 1 these results strongly suggested that flocs were combined into the floc aggregations which remarkably increased the percentage g to 59 5 1 5 in a short period figure s3 the floc aggregation phenomenon and the increased granule percentage were only observed during the transition period prior to this period as shown in the diameter distribution 2 distinct peak values of 543 and 68 µm were observed suggesting the co existence of granules and flocs these peak values gradually increased to 913 and 80 µm respectively fig 2b in contrast to the transition period the volume proportion of the large particles 200 µm decreased from 55 to 44 4 fig 2b moreover because the weight of the larger particles 200 µm decreased while that of the smaller particles increased the percentage g gradually decreased and eventually stabilized at an average of 47 1 2 fig 2 figure s3 during the new stable period the weight of the small particles 200 µm increased again and the percentage g gradually returned to a long term and steady ratio that averaged 47 1 5 a comparison of the transition and stable periods revealed that the physical morphology of the granular and floc sludge rapidly transformed in this pn a bioreactor during the transition period the floc aggregations as an early form of the granules originated from the flocs this resulted in a dramatic increase in both granule weight and volume and promoted the anaob enrichment comparatively during both stable periods the particle diameter increased but the granule weight and proportion slightly decreased which might have caused the limited anaob growth accordingly it is hypothesized that floc transformation into floc aggregations is critical to anaob enrichment because they are an early form of anammox granules in the present study the pn a process was comprised of granules and flocs as previously reported li et al 2017b in both stable periods the distribution of the diameters and weights of flocs and the granules remained basically unchanged suggesting that the granules and flocs had an overall stability and separability only under appropriate conditions flocs would transform into granules over a short time and promote anaob enrichment this indicates that the anammox granulation process is not continuous but an occasional and short term event in the present study taken together the variable sludge physical morphology from flocs to granular sludge was not obvious which was probably associated with the limited anaob enrichment in the present study 3 3 microbial communities of the 4 sludges with different physical morphologies to further investigate the correlation between floc aggregations and granules flocs the microbial communities of the floc aggregations were evaluated and compared to the other sludges with different physical morphologies the otus from the microbial communities of all the samples were clustered using a principal coordinate analysis pcoa fig 3 a and hierarchical clustering based on the bray curtis dissimilarities fig 3b the pcoa identified robust clustering of the otus according to the 4 sludges with different physical morphologies at the otu level comp1 and comp2 explained 51 2 and 10 2 of the total variation respectively fig 3a the results indicated that flocs and floc aggregations were the closest but the microbial characteristics of the floc aggregations were closer to the granules comp 1 hierarchical clustering further supported these conclusions fig 3b the microbial diversity within each sample was then analyzed at the otu level using the simpson diversity index and the simpson evenness figure s4 the simpson index of the large granules 0 07 and small granules 0 14 showed a clear separation between that of the floc aggregations 0 28 and flocs 0 22 the simpson index indicated that the microbial diversity of the floc aggregations was similar to that of the flocs but quite different from the large and small granules which was agreed with the results of the simpson evenness these results further suggested that the flocs transformed into floc aggregations during the transition period and eventually developed into mature granules 3 4 distribution of functional bacteria in the different sludge morphologies to provide insights into the rapid anaob enrichment microorganisms from the different sludge morphologies were assessed using 16s rrna gene sequencing and qpcr functional bacteria associated with the primary nitrogen conversion pathways are shown in fig 4 candidatus brocadia candidatus kuenenia and nitrosomonas were all significantly enriched p 0 05 in the 4 samples fig 4a nitrosomonas was the dominant aob in the floc aggregations with a relative abundance of 3 4 which was similar to that in the flocs 4 3 but much higher than in the large and small granules 0 01 similar results were observed for the gene copy number of amoa fig 4b moreover the dominant anaob candidatus brocadia in the floc aggregations exhibited a relative abundance of 4 1 which was higher than that of the flocs 1 3 in this study floc aggregations formed by flocs resulted in abundant nitrifying bacteria being encased in the floc aggregations as well as anaob enrichment it was also noticed that the small granules had the highest relative abundance of anaob 22 4 followed by large granules 13 0 further analysis showed that the small granules had the highest anaob abundance approximately 1 6 0 1 1012 copies g 1 ss followed by floc aggregations large granules and flocs fig 4b according to these results nitrifying bacteria were enriched in the flocs and anaob in the granules in the pn a bioreactor which agreed with previous reports li et al 2020 2019 vlaeminck et al 2010 this study also suggests that floc aggregations could be an early form of granule thereby resulting in the enrichment of anaob 4 discussion 4 1 rapid anaob enrichment mechanism linked to floc aggregations the results of this study provide an alternative theory for developing anammox granules that involves 4 stages generation flocs growth floc aggregations maturity small granules and decay large granules flocs forming into floc aggregations is a critical transient period for the initial anammox granulation floc aggregations like the early form of granules showed spatial concentration gradients that promoted the proliferation of anaob because of the favorable micro environment and macro retention a significant red area was observed inside the floc aggregations fig 2 d3 presenting a high specific number of anaob fig 4 the enriched anaob further accelerated granule formation and increased the diameter of the anammox granules anammox granules contain high levels of eps especially proteins jia et al 2017 that are primarily responsible for the structural and functional integrity of the aggregates and are essential to the physicochemical and biological properties li et al 2016 compared with the transition period the floc aggregation process was limited during the stable periods however the diameter of the granules increased suggesting that small granules grew into larger granules the weight of the anammox granules particles 200 µm decreased slightly figure s3 and both anaob relative abundance and absolute abundance also deceased as revealed by the qpcr and 16s rrna gene sequencing results this may have been because a dead zone formed in the larger diameter anammox granules resulting in a low mass transfer efficiency between the anammox granules and substrates vlaeminck et al 2010 the large aggregates in the bioreactor became progressively looser and disassociated into smaller flocs likely with poorer settling properties which may have resulted in anaob washout and a slight decrease in the nitrogen removal rate laureni et al 2015 mitigating anammox granule segregation has been suggested for pn as to avoid process failure sarma et al 2017 winkler et al 2011 recent studies have shown that micro granular sludge is increasingly important for the anammox process chen et al 2019 wang et al 2017 zhu et al 2018 chen et al 2019 demonstrated the feasibility of treating 50 mg l 1 ammonium wastewater in a micro granule based pn a bioreactor in which the size range of most of the granules was 265 536 µm anammox granules of an appropriate diameter have a high mass transfer efficiency inside the granules chen et al 2019 which resulted in the highest anaob abundance fig 4 thus this confirmed that the appropriate granule size was preferable to a larger size 4 2 possible triggers of microbial aggregations during the pn a processes and future study the growth rate of anaob has been identified as a major obstacle for mainstream anammox application van der star et al 2007 it is currently believed that providing a favorable anaerobic micro environment and effective retention are the basic and critical parameters for rapid anaob enrichment as shown in table s2 the specific growth rate of anaob is approximately 10 12 days during the anammox process in an sbr under completely anaerobic conditions to date several studies have reported that the maximum anaob multiplication time could be as low as 2 1 3 9 days in a membrane bioreactor zhang et al 2017 zhang and okabe 2017 which is attributed to the effective hold and strict anaerobic conditions for the anaob in a pn a anaob inhibition could be caused by a comparatively high dissolved oxygen do concentration triggered by reducing the loading rate over aeration or the partial inhibition of aob joss et al 2011 lackner et al 2014 in the present study however during the transition period anaob was rapidly enriched 1 µ 4 9 1 7 days with both an increased anaob bioactivity and nitrogen removal rate fig 1 anaob enrichment was highly related to the floc aggregations further analysis suggested that floc aggregation occurred immediately after the excess sodium acetate was pulse fed the addition of soluble organics triggered the rapid transformation of flocs into to floc aggregations and further facilitated anammox granulation this theory for the initial anaob aggregations is similar to that for accelerating anaob enrichment using aerobic granular sludge winkler et al 2012 as previously reported the availability of easily biodegradable organics due to acetate pulse feeding increased eps content in anaerobic granular sludge beun et al 2002 cydzik kwiatkowska et al 2016 which promoted the granulation from suspended activated sludge so far the effects of organics on single stage pn a process have been widely studied laureni et al 2015 li et al 2018 winkler et al 2012 but the mechanism of organic addition on enhancing the anammox granulation remains unclear lotti et al 2014 sarma et al 2017 since organics potentially affect anammox granules in different ways including via the microbial community synthesis of eps and the metabolic pathways of anaob feng et al 2018 speth et al 2016 further research is still required to gain more insight to the influence of organics on granulation as well as engineering application of anammox 5 conclusions in this study rapid anaob enrichment in granular sludge was explored during the initial 200 day period the bioreactor operated with a stable anaob abundance and bioactivity and nitrogen removal performance during the 50 day transition period anaob proliferated 4 9 1 7 days along with an increasing anaob bioactivity 2 0 fold further increased the nitrogen removal rate from 0 60 to 1 21 kg n m 3 d 1 anammox granulation was not likely triggered by anaob growth and self aggregation in the short term but flocs formed into floc aggregations which was triggered by the excess sodium acetate that was pulse fed into the pn a bioreactor floc aggregations acting as the initial carrier caused effective retention and provided a favorable anaerobic microenvironment for the anaob finally the anaob enrichment further facilitated mature anammox granules 6 ethical approval this article does not

recombination li et al 2019 shao et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 for instance so4 serves as the dominant oxidant in bisphenol a bpa degradation when peroxymonosulfate pms is added to the pec system that use co bivo4 as photoanode bacha et al 2020 a valence band vb hole has been suggested as a major oxidizing species in oxidative bpa treatment with an identical pec system shao et al 2020 implying that the overriding role of ps is the enhancement of charge separation as demonstrated by zeng et al 2016 the dual roles of ps are involved simultaneously in kinetically enhanced decomposition of cu edta by tio2 based pec and operate through the augmented formation yields of both oh and so4 however despite pec performance improvement upon addition of ps the prevalent use of miscellaneous heavy metals as constituents of photoanode and cathode materials e g co bacha et al 2020 cufe2o4 guo et al 2018 and mnfe2o4 zhang et al 2020 would likely cause secondary environmental contamination oh and lim 2019 wacławek et al 2017 such secondary environmental contamination is likely as metal based components undergo leaching when exposed to electrochemically or photocatalytically driven redox reactions tio2 is recognized as a suitable material for pec systems because of its non toxicity low cost environmental friendliness and high physical and chemical stability cho et al 2019 among various tio2 based nanomaterials tio2 nanotube arrays tnas are characterized by a highly ordered open channel structure marien et al 2016 and are employed widely for environmental energy production and storage applications liu et al 2008 park et al 2006 wang et al 2005 further tnas undergo in situ ti3 self doping through cathodic polarization kim et al 2014 without requiring toxic metal dopant or components this process transforms these nanotube arrays into dark blue colored tnas hereafter bl tnas with highly improved electrocatalytic activity for anodic oxidation and enhanced photocatalytic activity in ultraviolet uv and visible light due to the change of the electronic state in the band gap liao et al 2014 several recent studies cho et al 2019 koo et al 2017 liao et al 2014 xu et al 2020 explored bl tnas for photoelectrochemical degradation of specific recalcitrant compounds the results showed that they outperformed pristine tnas because of their remarkably enhanced oxidant generation ability this improvement stems from the pronounced charge separation in bl tnas and from the charge transfer rate at the electrode electrolyte interface there is a high likelihood that adding ps would also improve the performance of bl tna based pec systems with two primary expected benefits namely i enhanced oxidant generation capability through accelerated charge separation and ii formation of so4 activated mainly by uv light and conduction band cb electrons however the impact of ps on the kinetics and mechanisms of photoelectrochemical organic oxidation for bl tnas has not been elucidated yet in this study we examined a pec system that used bl tnas as an anode with the addition of peroxydisulfate pec pds for the oxidative degradation of bpa as a model compound pds was selected as the radical precursor instead of pms because of its cost effectiveness high solubility and chemical stability wacławek et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 in addition the enhancing effect of pds in various processes such as chemical injection pds only and uva photolysis ec pc and pec was evaluated comparatively the treatment performance of the pec pds system was monitored by varying the operating parameters including pds concentration applied potential bias initial ph and background inorganic and organic constituents the role of pds in promoting treatment efficiency was assessed based on electrochemical analysis and radical scavenger experiments finally to assess its practicability the pec pds system was tested for oxidative treatment of multiple organic mixtures such as bpa

anodization was performed at 10 0 v for 5 min to reduce the residual stress created during the anodization process which enhanced the interfacial adhesion of the tna layers to the ti mesh cao et al

photoelectrochemical experiments for organic pollutant degradation were conducted using the three electrode configuration bl tnas as the working electrode ti mesh as the counter electrode and a saturated ag agcl electrode as the reference electrode in a reactor working volume 90 ml with a quartz window to optimize the operating parameters 10 0 µm bpa was used as the target compound and 0 1 m nh4 2so4 was used as the electrolyte ph i 5 5 the sulfate solution is commonly used as an electrolyte to investigate photoelectrochemical activity due to its lower retarding effect on photocatalytic reaction compared to chloride based electrolytes abdullah et al 1990 further the reusability of bl tnas was investigated by conducting 10 consecutive experiments against the bpa target between each experiment the bl tnas were rinsed with di water to investigate the main reactive oxidant species ros in this system 1 0 m methanol meoh and tert butanol tba were used as scavengers the applicability

1 a b visually confirmed the successful growth of highly ordered open end tubes on the ti mesh as well as the production of vertically aligned individual structures the average outer diameter inner diameter length and wall thickness of these structures were approximately 110 8 nm 84 8 nm 11 9 µm and 13 0 nm respectively structural characteristics i e large internal voids and 10 µm tubes facilitated effective uv light absorption and easy access of target pollutants to active catalytic surfaces thereby enhancing electro or photocatalytic activity marien et al 2016 comparison between pristine tnas and bl tnas in terms of ti2p xps spectral features showed no clear distinction in the ti oxidation state peaks commonly emerged at 458 8 and 464 5 ev assignable to ti4 fig 1c failure to detect ti3 peak s at the top surface of the bl tnas in xps spectra which is in agreement with previous study zhang et al 2018 is attributable to heterogeneous doping of ti3 on the inner tube wall the marginal effect of cathodic polarization on the crystalline nature of tio2 supports earlier reports on bl tna characterization kim et al 2014 wu et al 2014 indicating similarities in the xrd patterns of untreated tnas and bl tnas fig 1d diffraction patterns unique to the anatase phase occurred exclusively regardless of whether cathodic polarization was applied in contrast the electrochemical measurements suggested that the cathodic polarization process achieved the fabrication of ti3 self doped or oxygen deficient tnas distinctively differentiated from the cv curve of pristine tnas the bl tnas produced a larger quasi rectangular and symmetric cv profile than pristine tnas fig 1e indicating marked improvement in electrical double layer capacitance because of cathodic reduction induced ti3 formation kim et al 2014 further the bl tnas exhibited an inverse square of the capacitance csc 2 which very slowly changed with respect to the electrode potential in the mott schottky analysis clearly contrasting with a steeper slope indicating csc 2 dependence on the applied bias fig 1f the donor density of the bl tnas calculated from the mott schottky plot was nearly five orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine tnas the superior electrocatalytic activity of the bl tnas associated with donor density enhancement suggested the occurrence of ti3 or oxygen vacancies through cathodic reduction kim et al 2014 liao et al 2014 3 2 photoelectrochemical activity 3 2 1 performance of tnas on bpa degradation fig 2 shows the extent of improvement in the treatment performance of the four oxidation processes including direct photolysis with uva ec pc and pec upon persulfate addition bpa was barely removed through adsorption and bpa oxidation by unactivated pds was minor with a degradation efficiency of 8 after 1 h of treatment whereas the enhancing effect of pds was marginal with ec photon driven oxidation processes such as photolysis pc and pec usually experienced performance enhancement when persulfate was added externally this implied the marginal contribution of cathodic reduction as a possible route for so4 production the pseudo first order reaction rate constant ranked in the order table s2 of photolysis pds 0 37 h 1 pc pds 0 79 h 1 pec pds 1 86 h 1 confirming the potential of pec as a strategy for pds activation we hypothesize that the kinetic acceleration in organic oxidation observed with the pec pds system occurred because pds impeded charge recombination and generated so4 under uva irradiation and underwent reductive conversion via cb electrons the current density increased after pds injection implied that pds could facilitate charge separation fig 3 a which would favor photoanodic organic oxidation or oh production on the bl tnas in addition in the presence of bpa the photocurrent peak was increased by direct oxidation of bpa on bl tnas the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis confirmed that photo irradiation caused a marked increase in the charge transfer efficiency of the bl tnas with a drastic decrease in charge transfer resistance rct for water oxidation fig 3b more importantly the nyquist plot indicated that ec and pec processes had different rct responses to pds addition these responses included the substantial reduction of rct under photo irradiated conditions with pds addition i e pec pds whereas rct barely changed in ec pds system this result supported the aforementioned action of pds as an electron acceptor in improving the charge separation efficiency of bl nta cho et al 2019 koo et al 2017 further it is in agreement with the negligible enhancement of bpa treatment performance by ec pds fig 2 to examine the likelihood of so4 generation in the pec pds system we explored the changes in esr spectral features while operating the pec process in the absence and the presence of pds fig s1 the esr detection of so4 even in the absence of pds resulted from the photoanodic oxidation of sulfate as an electrolyte the intensities of the specific peaks assignable to the dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts increased upon pds addition which confirmed that pds was reductively transformed into so4 in the pec process whereas oh formed more effectively because of the enhanced charge separation although it is difficult to distinguish the formation pathways of dmpo oh that can be generated by either oh or vb hole lei et al 2020 the increased peak intensity of dmpo oh might be attributable to the high formation yield of oh under pec system using bl tnas koo et al 2017 in particular peak patterns corresponding to the dmpo so4 adduct were much lower than those of the dmpo oh adduct indicating high oh production tang et al 2018 this could indicate that the effect of pds on the photo electrochemical behaviors of bl nta was primarily responsible for enhanced bpa oxidation by pec pds although pds could also be activated through the ti mesh cathode during the potential bias fig s2 its contribution to system performance was insignificant as observed from the marginal improvement in bpa removal efficiency of ec with addition of pds fig 2 3 2 2 effect of parameters on bpa degradation decomposition of bpa by the pec pds system accelerated gradually as the initial pds dosage was increased fig 4 a increasing the pds dosage to 1 0 mm nearly doubled the pseudo first order reaction rate constant with kobs 1 02 h 1 for pec alone versus 1 86 h 1 for pec at a pds dosage of 1 0 mm table s3 the bpa degradation efficiency did not reach saturation point over the applied pds concentration range in addition the effect of the anodic formation of pds from the electrolyte on bpa decomposition was negligible because of the low applied potential and electrolyte concentration used in this system the efficiency of the pec pds system monitored by varying the electric energy input fig 4b showed a positive correlation between potential bias and bpa treatment efficiency the bpa decay rate continued increasing until the applied potential bias reached 1 0 v although it declined slightly after reaching maximum efficiency a further increase above the optimal bias of 1 0 v would cause oxygen evolution as an undesirable side reaction that would diminish the current efficiency of anodic oxidation oturan et al 2013 and concurrently hinder the organic substance from accessing the electrochemical reactive surface guo et al 2018 the efficiency of the pec pds system for bpa oxidation as a function of the initial ph fig 4c showed that the treatment performance barely changed depending on the applied ph with variation of only 2 6 occurring over a wide range 3 0 10 0 of ph the minor but noticeable kinetic retardation under alkaline conditions likely resulted from the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged tio2 and the phenoxide anion derived from bpa dominating the speciation at ph pka of 9 6 liao et al 2013 yang et al 2019 3 2 3 repeatabilityofthe pec pds system for bpa degradation to explore the catalytic application of the bl tnas as photoanode in the pec pds system we monitored the kinetic rate of photoelectrochemical bpa degradation on the bl tnas in the presence of pds during 10 catalytic cycles fig 5 the bpa treatment efficiency barely decreased with increasing catalytic cycles although the likelihood of re oxidation of ti3 upon exposure to oxygen has been reported in the literature wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 the consecutive runs in the same batch i e repetition tests performed by replacing the electrolyte in each cycle did not lead to any reduction in the electrocatalytic activity of the bl tnas this result suggests that the intermediates that would kinetically inhibit bpa degradation through competition for anodic or so4 induced oxidation were also decomposed effectively in the pec pds system along with negligible performance retardation the rct value of the bl tnas remained nearly constant after use in 10 repeated cycles of the pec process fig s3 suggesting the structural durability of bl tnas 3 3 identification of the main ros and degradation mechanisms these experiments were carried out to identify the dominant oxidant in the pec pds system that likely varied depending on the selection of photoanode and operating conditions bacha et al 2020 guo et al 2018 li et al 2019 shao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 identification was conducted by repeating bpa degradation by the pec pds system utilizing the bl tnas in the presence of radical scavengers such as meoh and tba fig 6 the efficiency of the pec pds system for bpa decomposition decreased severely with the addition of tba which is selectively oxidizable by oh with e 85 90 and 38 41 in the absence and presence of tba respectively in particular further kinetic retardation in bpa decay was marginal when meoh served as a quencher of all potential oxidants i e oh so4 and vb hole the results collectively support that oh acted as a major oxidant in photoelectrochemical bpa oxidation which agrees with the esr spectra in which the highest intensity peaks assigned to the dmpo oh adduct emerged upon pds addition fig s1 adding either tba or meoh caused radical adducts i e dmpo oh and dmpo so4 to vanish in the spectra fig s4 validating the selection of alcohols as radical scavengers however it could not suppress bpa degradation completely this result could be associated with the involvement of surface bound oxidizing species such as a surficial oh and so4 lei et al 2015 3 4 effect of background constituents on the bl tnas pec pes system these experiments were carried out to examine the water matrix effect that generally arises from the competitive reactions between target pollutants and naturally occurring organic and inorganic impurities for oxidants chong et al 2010 khan et al 2013 xie et al 2015 this was done by observing bpa degradation using pec pds at ph i 8 0 in the presence of humic acid ha cl and hco3 as model background substances fig 7 the bpa removal efficiency decreased from 78 2 to 69 9 75 2 66 9 and 66 8 in the presence of cl hco3 ha and the mixture of cl hco3 and ha respectively the removal efficiency of mixture was only 14 4 lower than that of the control bpa degradation efficiency in the mixtures was almost similar to that with ha suggesting that ha could be the dominant factor among background constituents in this system these results are in agreement with those of zhang et al 2019 who reported surface modified tio2 mediated activation of pds for bpa decomposition indicating that the so4 induced system showed less water matrix effect to further evaluate the practical application of the pec pds system photoelectrochemical treatment in the absence and the presence of pds was conducted to simultaneously decompose multiple organics spiked in the pond water matrix fig 8 a the mixtures consisting of several organic contaminants including bpa 4 cp smx and cbz in real pond water mimicked real wastewater influent ayoub et al 2018 furthermore compared to the pec system operated in pond water approximately a fivefold increase in bpa removal was observed with the addition of 4 mm pds note that no additional supporting electrolyte i e nh4 2so4 was included in the pond water regardless of whether pds was externally added the photoelectrochemical degradation efficiency increased in the order of cbz smx 4 cp bpa which corresponded with the rate constants of bimolecular reactions involving oh fabbri et al 2019 as shown in fig s5 significant kinetic retardation of organic contaminants degradation in the pec pds system was observed in the presence of tba it was observed that the pseudo first order reaction rate constants were in the order of cbz smx 4 cp bpa although both oh and so4 were responsible for the oxidation of organic pollutants the dominant oxidant was found to be oh this finding implied that a switch in the primary oxidant from oh to so4 did not occur substantially with pds addition aligned with the observed enhancing effect of pds in di water spiked with a single pollutant the pec pds system degraded all the tested organics in the mixture of the pec system a noticeable increase in treatment efficiency occurred in both the pec and pec pds systems when photoelectrochemical oxidation proceeded alternatively in the aqueous sulfate solutions to remove the water matrix effect based on the measured water quality parameters shown in table s1 the kinetic retardation observed in the pond water likely resulted from the presence of organic matter that behaved as a quencher similar to ha fig 8 the extent of performance reduction was more pronounced with the pec system without pds addition this finding could reflect the selective nature of so4 and enhanced oh production by externally adding pds which enabled the pec pds system to improve the removal of target organic pollutants in complex water matrices zhang et al 2019 unlike the other model pollutants smx treatment resulted in insignificant efficiency loss in the pond water matrix which could be linked with the role of so4 as the secondary oxidant smx could be deprotonated in the pond water because of its unadjusted ph 7 90 pka2 of smx 6 16 making it more susceptible to attack by so4 milh et al 2020 similar to the kinetic variation with increasing pds dosage observed in di water fig 4a the organic treatment efficiency increased in proportion to the pds dosage in the pond water fig 4b finally a moderate decline in degradation efficiency was observed at pds dosage exceeding 4 0 mm irrespective of pollutant type which could be attributable to radical scavenging by pds fig 8b 4 conclusion the pec pds system using bl tnas as a photoanode enhanced organic contaminant degradation efficiencies because of the following i increase in the capability for charge separation on bl tnas and ii assistance of so4 production via photo activation and cb electrons among various energy input conditions the pec pds system was found to be the most efficient for oxidative treatment of bpa whereas oh was confirmed as a primary oxidant so4 also contributed to organic oxidation as verified by radical scavenging experiments and esr spectra furthermore the pec pds system not only maintained high removal efficiency of bpa even in the presence of inorganic ions and ha compared to the condition without background constituents but also showed high stability during 10 repeated cycles the pseudo first order reaction rate constant was in the order of cbz smx 4 cp bpa in both the pec and pec pds systems however the pec pds system was less susceptible to the water matrices because the rate constants for bpa and other pollutants were three and twofold higher respectively in comparison with the pec system despite the highly stable oxidation capability of the pec pds system over a wide range of ph values and various background constituents further improvements such as more suitable electrodes and system configuration would be required for scale up to facilitate the practicability of the pec pds system

17217,this study investigated the influence of adding peroxydisulfate pds to a photoelectrocatalysis pec system using self doped tio2 nanotube arrays bl tnas for organic pollutant degradation the addition of 1 0 mm pds increased the bisphenol a bpa removal efficiency of pec pec pds from 65 0 to 85 9 within 1 h the enhancement could be attributed to the high formation yield of hydroxyl radicals oh increased charge separation and assistance of the sulfate radicals so4 the pds concentration and applied potential bias were influential operating parameters for the pec pds system in addition the system exhibited a highly stable performance over a wide range of ph values and background inorganic and organic constituents such as chloride ions bicarbonate and humic acid further the degradation performance of the organic pollutant mixture including bpa 4 chlorophenol 4 cp sulfamethoxazole smx and carbamazepine cbz was evaluated in 0 1 m nh4 2so4 solution and real surface water the degradation efficiency increased in the order of cbz smx 4 cp bpa in the pec and pec pds systems with both water matrices compared with the pec system the pec pds 1 0 mm system showed a threefold higher pseudo first order reaction rate constant for bpa among pollutant mixtures in surface water this was attributed to enhanced oh production and the selective nature of so4 the pseudo first order reaction rate constants of other pollutants i e 4 cp smx and cbz increased ca twofold in the pec pds system the results of this study showed that the pec pds system with bl tnas is a viable technology for oxidative treatment graphical abstract image graphical abstract keywords organic pollutant peroxydisulfate photoelectrochemical reactive oxidant species self doped tio2nanotube array 1 introduction over the past decade advanced oxidation processes aops assisted by persulfate ps have gained increasing attention as viable technology to degrade toxic and recalcitrant organic pollutants by utilizing highly oxidizing radicals such as hydroxyl oh and sulfate so4 radicals in addition to oh e0 oh oh 1 89 2 72 vnhe half life 10 3 1 µs so4 has also been investigated extensively for its unique characteristics such as i high redox potential with low ph dependence e0 so4 so4 2 2 5 3 1 vnhe ii prolonged half life of 30 40 µs in water and iii electron abstraction as a preferred reaction mode that can cause rapid oxidative destruction of a specific class of organic contaminants lee et al 2020 oh et al 2016 ps activation is performed by cleaving the peroxide bond in a homolytic or heterolytic fashion through energy and electron transfers using activators such as heat transition metals electricity and photo irradiation yang et al 2019 the photoelectrochemical pec process is a synergetic combination of photocatalysis pc and electrocatalysis ec carried out by applying an external electric bias to a semiconductor based photoanode which facilitates the separation of photogenerated charge carriers the enhancing effect of ps on pec performance relates to its twofold actions observed in ec and pc i e reductive transformation into so4 and inhibition of charge recombination li et al 2019 shao et al 2020 zeng et al 2016 for instance so4 serves as the dominant oxidant in bisphenol a bpa degradation when peroxymonosulfate pms is added to the pec system that use co bivo4 as photoanode bacha et al 2020 a valence band vb hole has been suggested as a major oxidizing species in oxidative bpa treatment with an identical pec system shao et al 2020 implying that the overriding role of ps is the enhancement of charge separation as demonstrated by zeng et al 2016 the dual roles of ps are involved simultaneously in kinetically enhanced decomposition of cu edta by tio2 based pec and operate through the augmented formation yields of both oh and so4 however despite pec performance improvement upon addition of ps the prevalent use of miscellaneous heavy metals as constituents of photoanode and cathode materials e g co bacha et al 2020 cufe2o4 guo et al 2018 and mnfe2o4 zhang et al 2020 would likely cause secondary environmental contamination oh and lim 2019 wacławek et al 2017 such secondary environmental contamination is likely as metal based components undergo leaching when exposed to electrochemically or photocatalytically driven redox reactions tio2 is recognized as a suitable material for pec systems because of its non toxicity low cost environmental friendliness and high physical and chemical stability cho et al 2019 among various tio2 based nanomaterials tio2 nanotube arrays tnas are characterized by a highly ordered open channel structure marien et al 2016 and are employed widely for environmental energy production and storage applications liu et al 2008 park et al 2006 wang et al 2005 further tnas undergo in situ ti3 self doping through cathodic polarization kim et al 2014 without requiring toxic metal dopant or components this process transforms these nanotube arrays into dark blue colored tnas hereafter bl tnas with highly improved electrocatalytic activity for anodic oxidation and enhanced photocatalytic activity in ultraviolet uv and visible light due to the change of the electronic state in the band gap liao et al 2014 several recent studies cho et al 2019 koo et al 2017 liao et al 2014 xu et al 2020 explored bl tnas for photoelectrochemical degradation of specific recalcitrant compounds the results showed that they outperformed pristine tnas because of their remarkably enhanced oxidant generation ability this improvement stems from the pronounced charge separation in bl tnas and from the charge transfer rate at the electrode electrolyte interface there is a high likelihood that adding ps would also improve the performance of bl tna based pec systems with two primary expected benefits namely i enhanced oxidant generation capability through accelerated charge separation and ii formation of so4 activated mainly by uv light and conduction band cb electrons however the impact of ps on the kinetics and mechanisms of photoelectrochemical organic oxidation for bl tnas has not been elucidated yet in this study we examined a pec system that used bl tnas as an anode with the addition of peroxydisulfate pec pds for the oxidative degradation of bpa as a model compound pds was selected as the radical precursor instead of pms because of its cost effectiveness high solubility and chemical stability wacławek et al 2017 wang and wang 2018 in addition the enhancing effect of pds in various processes such as chemical injection pds only and uva photolysis ec pc and pec was evaluated comparatively the treatment performance of the pec pds system was monitored by varying the operating parameters including pds concentration applied potential bias initial ph and background inorganic and organic constituents the role of pds in promoting treatment efficiency was assessed based on electrochemical analysis and radical scavenger experiments finally to assess its practicability the pec pds system was tested for oxidative treatment of multiple organic mixtures such as bpa

anodization was performed at 10 0 v for 5 min to reduce the residual stress created during the anodization process which enhanced the interfacial adhesion of the tna layers to the ti mesh cao et al

saturated ag agcl electrode as the reference electrode in a reactor working volume 90 ml with a quartz window to optimize the operating parameters 10 0 µm bpa was used as the target compound and 0 1 m nh4 2so4 was used as the electrolyte ph i 5 5 the sulfate solution is commonly used as an electrolyte to investigate photoelectrochemical activity due to its lower retarding effect on photocatalytic reaction compared to chloride based electrolytes abdullah et al 1990 further the reusability of bl tnas was investigated by conducting 10 consecutive experiments against the bpa target between each

1 a b visually confirmed the successful growth of highly ordered open end tubes on the ti mesh as well as the production of vertically aligned individual structures the average outer diameter inner diameter length and wall thickness of these structures were approximately 110 8 nm 84 8 nm 11 9 µm and 13 0 nm respectively structural characteristics i e large internal voids and 10 µm tubes facilitated effective uv light absorption and easy access of target pollutants to active catalytic surfaces thereby enhancing electro or photocatalytic activity marien et al 2016 comparison between pristine tnas and bl tnas in terms of ti2p xps spectral features showed no clear distinction in the ti oxidation state peaks commonly emerged at 458 8 and 464 5 ev assignable to ti4 fig 1c failure to detect ti3 peak s at the top surface of the bl tnas in xps spectra which is in agreement with previous study zhang et al 2018 is attributable to heterogeneous doping of ti3 on the inner tube wall the marginal effect of cathodic polarization on the crystalline nature of tio2 supports earlier reports on bl tna characterization kim et al 2014 wu et al 2014 indicating similarities in the xrd patterns of untreated tnas and bl tnas fig 1d diffraction patterns unique to the anatase phase occurred exclusively regardless of whether cathodic polarization was applied in contrast the electrochemical measurements suggested that the cathodic polarization process achieved the fabrication of ti3 self doped or oxygen deficient tnas distinctively differentiated from the cv curve of pristine tnas the bl tnas produced a larger quasi rectangular and symmetric cv profile than pristine tnas fig 1e indicating marked improvement in electrical double layer capacitance because of cathodic reduction induced ti3 formation kim et al 2014 further the bl tnas exhibited an inverse square of the capacitance csc 2 which very slowly changed with respect to the electrode potential in the mott schottky analysis clearly contrasting with a steeper slope indicating csc 2 dependence on the applied bias fig 1f the donor density of the bl tnas calculated from the mott schottky plot was nearly five orders of magnitude higher than that of pristine tnas the superior electrocatalytic activity of the bl tnas associated with donor density enhancement suggested the occurrence of ti3 or oxygen vacancies through cathodic reduction kim et al 2014 liao et al 2014 3 2 photoelectrochemical activity 3 2 1 performance of tnas on bpa degradation fig 2 shows the extent of improvement in the treatment performance of the four oxidation processes including direct photolysis with uva ec pc and pec upon persulfate addition bpa was barely removed through adsorption and bpa oxidation by unactivated pds was minor with a degradation efficiency of 8 after 1 h of treatment whereas the enhancing effect of pds was marginal with ec photon driven oxidation processes such as photolysis pc and pec usually experienced performance enhancement when persulfate was added externally this implied the marginal contribution of cathodic reduction as a possible route for so4 production the pseudo first order reaction rate constant ranked in the order table s2 of photolysis pds 0 37 h 1 pc pds 0 79 h 1 pec pds 1 86 h 1 confirming the potential of pec as a strategy for pds activation we hypothesize that the kinetic acceleration in organic oxidation observed with the pec pds system occurred because pds impeded charge recombination and generated so4 under uva irradiation and underwent reductive conversion via cb electrons the current density increased after pds injection implied that pds could facilitate charge separation fig 3 a which would favor photoanodic organic oxidation or oh production on the bl tnas in addition in the presence of bpa the photocurrent peak was increased by direct oxidation of bpa on bl tnas the electrochemical impedance spectroscopy eis analysis confirmed that photo irradiation caused a marked increase in the charge transfer efficiency of the bl tnas with a drastic decrease in charge transfer resistance rct for water oxidation fig 3b more importantly the nyquist plot indicated that ec and pec processes had different rct responses to pds addition these responses included the substantial reduction of rct under photo irradiated conditions with pds addition i e pec pds whereas rct barely changed in ec pds system this result supported the aforementioned action of pds as an electron acceptor in improving the charge separation efficiency of bl nta cho et al 2019 koo et al 2017 further it is in agreement with the negligible enhancement of bpa treatment performance by ec pds fig 2 to examine the likelihood of so4 generation in the pec pds system we explored the changes in esr spectral features while operating the pec process in the absence and the presence of pds fig s1 the esr detection of so4 even in the absence of pds resulted from the photoanodic oxidation of sulfate as an electrolyte the intensities of the specific peaks assignable to the dmpo oh and dmpo so4 adducts increased upon pds addition which confirmed that pds was reductively transformed into so4 in the pec process whereas oh formed more effectively because of the enhanced charge separation although it is difficult to distinguish the formation pathways of dmpo oh that can be generated by either oh or vb hole lei et al 2020 the increased peak intensity of dmpo oh might be attributable to the high formation yield of oh under pec system using bl tnas koo et al 2017 in particular peak patterns corresponding to the dmpo so4 adduct were much lower than those of the dmpo oh adduct indicating high oh production tang et al 2018 this could indicate that the effect of pds on the photo electrochemical behaviors of bl nta was primarily responsible for enhanced bpa oxidation by pec pds although pds could also be activated through the ti mesh cathode during the potential bias fig s2 its contribution to system performance was insignificant as observed from the marginal improvement in bpa removal efficiency of ec with addition of pds fig 2 3 2 2 effect of parameters on bpa degradation decomposition of bpa by the pec pds system accelerated gradually as the initial pds dosage was increased fig 4 a increasing the pds dosage to 1 0 mm nearly doubled the pseudo first order reaction rate constant with kobs 1 02 h 1 for pec alone versus 1 86 h 1 for pec at a pds dosage of 1 0 mm table s3 the bpa degradation efficiency did not reach saturation point over the applied pds concentration range in addition the effect of the anodic formation of pds from the electrolyte on bpa decomposition was negligible because of the low applied potential and electrolyte concentration used in this system the efficiency of the pec pds system monitored by varying the electric energy input fig 4b showed a positive correlation between potential bias and bpa treatment efficiency the bpa decay rate continued increasing until the applied potential bias reached 1 0 v although it declined slightly after reaching maximum efficiency a further increase above the optimal bias of 1 0 v would cause oxygen evolution as an undesirable side reaction that would diminish the current efficiency of anodic oxidation oturan et al 2013 and concurrently hinder the organic substance from accessing the electrochemical reactive surface guo et al 2018 the efficiency of the pec pds system for bpa oxidation as a function of the initial ph fig 4c showed that the treatment performance barely changed depending on the applied ph with variation of only 2 6 occurring over a wide range 3 0 10 0 of ph the minor but noticeable kinetic retardation under alkaline conditions likely resulted from the electrostatic repulsion between negatively charged tio2 and the phenoxide anion derived from bpa dominating the speciation at ph pka of 9 6 liao et al 2013 yang et al 2019 3 2 3 repeatabilityofthe pec pds system for bpa degradation to explore the catalytic application of the bl tnas as photoanode in the pec pds system we monitored the kinetic rate of photoelectrochemical bpa degradation on the bl tnas in the presence of pds during 10 catalytic cycles fig 5 the bpa treatment efficiency barely decreased with increasing catalytic cycles although the likelihood of re oxidation of ti3 upon exposure to oxygen has been reported in the literature wang et al 2013 yang et al 2018 the consecutive runs in the same batch i e repetition tests performed by replacing the electrolyte in each cycle did not lead to any reduction in the electrocatalytic activity of the bl tnas this result suggests that the intermediates that would kinetically inhibit bpa degradation through competition for anodic or so4 induced oxidation were also decomposed effectively in the pec pds system along with negligible performance retardation the rct value of the bl tnas remained nearly constant after use in 10 repeated cycles of the pec process fig s3 suggesting the structural durability of bl tnas 3 3 identification of the main ros and degradation mechanisms these experiments were carried out to identify the dominant oxidant in the pec pds system that likely varied depending on the selection of photoanode and operating conditions bacha et al 2020 guo et al 2018 li et al 2019 shao et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 identification was conducted by repeating bpa degradation by the pec pds system utilizing the bl tnas in the presence of radical scavengers such as meoh and tba fig 6 the efficiency of the pec pds system for bpa decomposition decreased severely with the addition of tba which is selectively oxidizable by oh with e 85 90 and 38 41 in the absence and presence of tba respectively in particular further kinetic retardation in bpa decay was marginal when meoh served as a quencher of all potential oxidants i e oh so4 and vb hole the results collectively support that oh acted as a major oxidant in photoelectrochemical bpa oxidation which agrees with the esr spectra in which the highest intensity peaks assigned to the dmpo oh adduct emerged upon pds addition fig s1 adding either tba or meoh caused radical adducts i e dmpo oh and dmpo so4 to vanish in the spectra fig s4 validating the selection of alcohols as radical scavengers however it could not suppress bpa degradation completely this result could be associated with the involvement of surface bound oxidizing species such as a surficial oh and so4 lei et al 2015 3 4 effect of background constituents on the bl tnas pec pes system these experiments were carried out to examine the water matrix effect that generally arises from the competitive reactions between target pollutants and naturally occurring organic and inorganic impurities for oxidants chong et al 2010 khan et al 2013 xie et al 2015 this was done by observing bpa degradation using pec pds at ph i 8 0 in the presence of humic acid ha cl and hco3 as model background substances fig 7 the bpa removal efficiency decreased from 78 2 to 69 9 75 2 66 9 and 66 8 in the presence of cl hco3 ha and the mixture of cl hco3 and ha respectively the removal efficiency of mixture was only 14 4 lower than that of the control bpa degradation efficiency in the mixtures was almost similar to that with ha suggesting that ha could be the dominant factor among background constituents in this system these results are in agreement with those of zhang et al 2019 who reported surface modified tio2 mediated activation of pds for bpa decomposition indicating that the so4 induced system showed less water matrix effect to further evaluate the practical application of the pec pds system photoelectrochemical treatment in the absence and the presence of pds was conducted to simultaneously decompose multiple organics spiked in the pond water matrix fig 8 a the mixtures consisting of several organic contaminants including bpa 4 cp smx and cbz in real pond water mimicked real wastewater influent ayoub et al 2018 furthermore compared to the pec system operated in pond water approximately a fivefold increase in bpa removal was observed with the addition of 4 mm pds note that no additional supporting electrolyte i e nh4 2so4 was included in the pond water regardless of whether pds was externally added the photoelectrochemical degradation efficiency increased in the order of cbz smx 4 cp bpa which corresponded with the rate constants of bimolecular reactions involving oh fabbri et al 2019 as shown in fig s5 significant kinetic retardation of organic contaminants degradation in the pec pds system was observed in the presence of tba it was observed that the pseudo first order reaction rate constants were in the order of cbz smx 4 cp bpa although both oh and so4 were responsible for the oxidation of organic pollutants the dominant oxidant was found to be oh this finding implied that a switch in the primary oxidant from oh to so4 did not occur substantially with pds addition aligned with the observed enhancing effect of pds in di water spiked with a single pollutant the pec pds system degraded all the tested organics in the mixture of the pec system a noticeable increase in treatment efficiency occurred in both the pec and pec pds systems when photoelectrochemical oxidation proceeded alternatively in the aqueous sulfate solutions to remove the water matrix effect based on the measured water quality parameters shown in table s1 the kinetic retardation observed in the pond water likely resulted from the presence of organic matter that behaved as a quencher similar to ha fig 8 the extent of performance reduction was more pronounced with the pec system without pds addition this finding could reflect the selective nature of so4 and enhanced oh production by externally adding pds which enabled the pec pds system to improve the removal of target organic pollutants in complex water matrices zhang et al 2019 unlike the other model pollutants smx treatment resulted in insignificant efficiency loss in the pond water matrix which could be linked with the role of so4 as the secondary oxidant smx could be deprotonated in the pond water because of its unadjusted ph 7 90 pka2 of smx 6 16 making it more susceptible to attack by so4 milh et al 2020 similar to the kinetic variation with increasing pds dosage observed in di water fig 4a the organic treatment efficiency increased in proportion to the pds dosage in the pond water fig 4b finally a moderate decline in degradation efficiency was observed at pds dosage exceeding 4 0 mm irrespective of pollutant type which could be attributable to radical scavenging by pds fig 8b 4 conclusion the pec pds system using bl tnas as a photoanode enhanced organic contaminant degradation efficiencies because of the following i increase in the capability for charge separation on bl tnas and ii assistance of so4 production via photo activation and cb electrons among various energy input conditions the pec pds system was found to be the most efficient for oxidative treatment of bpa whereas oh was confirmed as a primary oxidant so4 also contributed to organic oxidation as verified by radical scavenging experiments and esr spectra furthermore the pec pds system not only maintained high removal efficiency of bpa even in the presence of inorganic ions and ha compared to the condition without background constituents but also showed high stability during 10 repeated cycles the pseudo first order reaction rate constant was in the order of cbz smx 4 cp bpa in both the pec and pec pds systems however the pec pds system was less susceptible to the water matrices because the rate constants for bpa and other pollutants were three and twofold higher respectively in comparison with the pec system despite the highly stable oxidation capability of the pec pds system over a wide range of ph values and various background constituents further improvements such as more suitable electrodes and system configuration would be required for scale up to facilitate the practicability of the pec pds system

early june median values remained high varying between 4 8 and 5 7 log10 gc 100 ml and from mid june to beginning of august a decreasing trend in sars cov 2 rna concentration in sewage samples was observed median values from 3 6 to 4 6 log10 gc 100 ml in the last two weeks of august sars cov 2 rna titers in sewage increased again in some areas with median values of 4 9 and 4 2 log10 gc 100 ml fig 2a we analysed sars cov 2 rna titers by median values with confirmed covid 19 cases and deaths registered in niterói by the municipal health secretariat fig 2b to calculate median values we included all the samples collected in 12 weeks using a value equal to the lod of n2 assay 3 1 log10 divided by square root of 2 croghan and egeghy 2003 when a sample was non detected bellow the lod overall high titers of sars cov 2 rna in sewage samples coincided with the period when the city registered the highest numbers of covid 19 cases and related deaths end of april to mid june fig 3 shows the expansion of the affected areas in niterói by detection of sars cov 2 rna from sewerage system along the studied period these heat maps were designed based on sars cov 2 sewage titers and used as an environmental indicator of viral spread through different areas of the city fig 3 the maps were built using arcgis pro with the colour s scales varying from lowest viral rna titer value blue colour moderate risk areas to maximum value white colour higher risk areas colours gradations between the minimum and maximum viral concentrations were calculated according to the program s algorithm https

region where the first cases were registered in the municipality 15th april sars cov 2 spread to other regions and reached 100 of detection on 19th may during the peak of the epidemic in the subsequent weeks a reduction of positive rates and viral concentrations were observed between june and july on 18th august viruses were detected again in the sewers from five regions of the municipality with an increase in viral concentration fig 3 geodetic reference sirgas2000 projection system utm spindle 23s scale 1 220 000 3 3 findings according to collection points fig 4 illustrates sars cov 2 rna monitoring during the course of the epidemic through wwtp and decentralized sewage collection networks sp including areas with different socio economic conditions neighbourhoods slums considered of interest by the municipal health secretary we analysed rna titers by 3 ct intervals from 25 to 40 that correspond to 1 log10 gc decrease it is possible to observe that low ct values high sars cov 2 rna titers for all five administrative regions of niterói were concentrated between april and mid june thus coinciding with the high numbers of covid 19 confirmed cases in each region fig 4 collection points were also grouped in wwtps neighbourhoods and slums for descriptive statistics table 1 results demonstrated that positive rates were higher in wwtps compared to sewer pipes neighbourhoods and slums table 1 median viral concentrations were significantly higher in wwtps compared to slums p 0 036 but no significant difference was found between wwtps and neighbourhoods p 0 05 in the same way no significant difference was observed between the median viral concentrations obtained between neighbourhoods and slums 3 4 genomic surveillance strains detected in the sewage twenty seven sars cov 2 positive samples were submitted to the protocol for genome amplification however only four of them presented enough viral material to assemble the library lineage of three genomes b 1 1 33 clade g containing the nucleotide substitutions described were recovered table 2 details of the four partial genomes recovered are described in the supplementary material table s2 4 discussion 4 1 environmental surveillance of sars cov 2 in the present study we successfully used an environmental approach to track sars cov 2 presence concentration and genetic diversity from wastewater samples obtained in different areas of niterói municipality brazil following biosafety measures previously recommended wastewater samples were thermal inactivated prior to viral concentration once there is no evidence that this procedure causes a considerable loss of viral rna in these samples wu et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020b the mean recovery rate of brsv used as a surrogate of sars cov 2 obtained in our study was 27 4 similar to values ranging from 6 to 33 5 previously obtained for enveloped viruses using the ultracentrifugation based method ye et al 2016 ahmed et al 2020b rusiñol et al 2020 for pp7 the mean recovery rate found was of 18 5 similar to the one found for mengovirus 11 2 1 a non enveloped picornavirus randazzo et al 2020 other concentration methods resulted in lower recovery rates range 6 6 to 11 using surrogates for human coronavirus randazzo et al 2020 gonzales et al 2020 although variable rates were observed by ahmed et al 2020b comparing different types of viral concentration methods the confirmation of positive rt qpcr signals by sequencing analysis or the use or more than one target region is highly recommended until assay specificities have been validated for environmental samples kitajima et al 2020 michael kordatou et al 2020 despite no consensus on the best methodology to detect sars cov 2 we used n2 primes and probe based on studies that described this target region as the most suitable to detect these viruses nalla et al 2020 gonzalez et al 2020 over the period of five months we analysed 223 raw sewage samples weekly collected from different sampling collection points wwtp and sp and sars cov 2 was detected in 84 3 of them presenting ct values ranging from 24 8 and 39 8 and detection frequencies between 42 and 100 during the surveillance viral concentrations ranged from 3 1 to 7 1 log10 gc 100 ml concentrations found in our study were higher than those found in australia usa india israel and turkey ahmed et al 2020a gonzalez et al 2020 kocamemi et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 however it is worth mentioning that most of these studies analysed a limited number of samples in australia and turkey nine samples were analysed and two and seven were positive for sars cov 2 respectively presenting ct values higher than 34 ahmed et al 2020a kocamemi et al 2020 our results are more aligned with sars cov 2 concentrations found in spain and france randazzo et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 as stated by gonzalez et al 2020 we believe that several factors affect different findings of viral concentration in sewage samples especially the ongoing circumstances of covid 19 pandemic in the studied region from 188 sars cov 2 positive samples we selected 27 samples based on lower ct values to perform whole genome sequencing from these we successfully obtained the almost complete genome of four samples all presenting ct values 30 three out of four genomic sequences were identified as lineage b 1 1 33 clade g this lineage was the most prevalent sars cov 2 lineage in rio de janeiro state in the early phase of the pandemic late february to late april resende et al 2020b probably established before the detection of the first reported sars cov 2 case in the country comparing sars cov 2 genomes obtained from our samples with other genomes available in epicov gisaid we observed that the strains recovered from sewage samples in niterói held a close identity with sars cov 2 strains circulating locally in rio de janeiro capital interestingly brazilian sars cov 2 strains were clustered into three major clades 1 2 and 3 and currently clade 2 also characterized as lineage b 1 1 33 b 1 1 br is described by two nucleotide substitutions in orf6 t27299c and nucleoprotein t29148c resende et al 2020b lineage b 1 1 33 is considered the most spatially widespread lineage in rio de janeiro state resende et al 2020b in this study three complete genome of the strains recovered from sewage samples showed the same nucleotide mutations the most recent common ancestor of the brazilian lineage b 1 1 33 was dated from 22nd february indicating that the community driven transmission was already stablished in brazil by early march resende et al 2020b 4 2 wastewater based epidemiology to support public health policies during the pandemic of covid 19 several studies have demonstrated how an environmental approach was useful to monitor sars cov 2 spread in a given geographic area gonzalez et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 however there are few examples reporting how wbe data were used by local authorities to assist public health interventions at controlling the epidemic or how sewage monitoring programs could be incorporated into public health policies this intersectional project initiated by the city hall of niterói involved several municipal government departments environment health planning and transport as well as the water and sanitation company águas de niterói and fiocruz as a research institute throughout this study the interaction of these groups took place through weekly meetings with the participation of different representatives of these institutions to discuss the data obtained and plan health interventions in the first week of sewage monitoring higher covid 19 number of cases was found in praias da baía guanabara bay beaches central one of the regions with the highest hdi and population density in the municipality at this moment we also tested raw sewage from two hospitals in this area however sars cov 2 rna was not detected data not shown the use of diapers in patients and or hospital cleaning procedures may explain the absence of detectable viruses in hospital sewage after the first week the other regions eastern and northern reported an increase in the number of cases reaching lower income populations and several poorer communities in the municipality the expansion of the disease to more vulnerable communities was accompanied by virus research in sewers which explains the increase in sps analyzed and in relation to the pilot project prado et al 2020 the idea of investigating sp in addition to wwtp was supported by the need for new indicators to guide allocation of resources and investments to control the spread of the disease promoting interventions in the most affected areas one example of this action plan took place in a specific area located at the oceânica region boa esperança community the community houses 610 families 2083 people registered in the fmp sars cov 2 was firstly detected in sewage ct value of 26 on april 22 when no covid 19 cases had been reported in this community based on sewage findings the first intervention was to launch an active surveillance to search for individuals showing covid 19 related symptoms identifying infected individuals by testing and to implement measures to control the spread of the disease based on this scenario supplementary assistance services were conducted such as guidance of appropriate support treatment as well as tracking contacts and advising of family members on disease prevention in addition payment for hotel accommodation was also offered to families without physical spaces in their homes to promote social isolation the ongoing environmental surveillance in niterói demonstrated an increase of sars cov 2 concentration in sewage followed by progressive decrease that reflected the epidemic control measures implemented by niterói city hall however from august towards the progressive lifting of social distancing and re opening of commerce and services have promoted an increase of sars cov 2 concentration observed in the last monitoring campaign carried out on 18th august 2020 when the city presented average values of social isolation below 50 however the increase of sars cov 2 in sewage did not follow a proportionally great number of reported covid 19 cases or related deaths by the niterói health system in this case we have two hypotheses it is likely that a large part of the new wave of infection is occurring in young people who usually have mild symptoms and who attend bars gyms and collective sports activities dispensing medical or hospital care in most cases the second hypothesis is related to underreporting or delay in updating the number of daily weekly cases reported by the health system our findings highlight the use of wbe approach as an early warning system for the emergence of new covid 19 cases enabling faster prevention and public health actions by the state as emphasized recently farkas et al 2020 medema et al 2020 polo et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 the success of the intervention carried out in the boa esperança community resulted in the inclusion of sars cov 2 sewage data as a complementary indicator to other traditionally health indicators used such as growth rates of new cases and hospitalizations mortality rate number of available hospital beds and bed occupancy rate moreover sars cov 2 environmental data as well as heat maps showing a time line were published and weekly updated in the official control panel of the niterói city hall webpage https experience arcgis com experience 305269f3cdd24839b263c5ab346e1aa7sed as an additional information tool encouraging disease prevention actions although national or municipal responses to control covid 19 are different according to institutional arrangements that compounds the public policies of each government capano et al 2020 the decision to include the investigaton of sars cov 2 in sewage to support strategies for controlling the epidemic in niterói was pionner in the country this action provides evidences to identify regions with unreported cases of the disease mainly in areas of social vulnerability and to define regionalized coping strategies in priority areas to focus on the distribution of tests and other resources the development of geoinformation management system sigeo including smart cities tools citizen service mobile app was implemented to share scientific information among the general public scientific evidence based public actions supported by multilevel partnership between public health research institution sanitation company and government secretariats were fundamental to the success of this project 5 conclusion in this study we demonstrated comprehensive aspects of wbe and how its results have been converted into more effective public health policies for the population environmental monitoring during the course of the epidemic through decentralized sewage collection networks sp including areas of uneven socio economic conditions neighbourhoods and slums considered of interest by municipal health secretariat allowed quick and targeted actions carried out in areas of greatest risk and social vulnerability wwtps does not offer the same accuracy for identifying outbreaks and rapid intervention for controlling of the disease but their higher detection rates 100 during monitoring program are more effective for monitoring trends that is for assessing whether sars cov 2 concentrations are increasing or decreasing in a broader population indicating a risk for the occurrence of the disease in communities moreover whole genome sequencing demonstrated that sars cov 2 lineage circulating in niteroi municipality is closest related to the brazilian strains more specifically with strains circulating in rio de janeiro community transmission should have occurred before the first cases were notified in the city the successful experience of wbe and public health interventions adopted by niterói municipality could be replicated at the national level as well as in other countries interested in using sars cov 2 environmental surveillance data as part of the covid 19 combat strategies funding this study was supported by instituto oswaldo cruz paef 2 ação 21c0 and carlos chagas filho

to polo et al 2020 wbe consists on the assumption that any stable substance that is excreted by humans and in wastewater can be used to back calculate the original concentration excreted by the serviced population the same concept can be used for analysis of pathogens circulation in sanitary sewers in a given population when excreted in the faeces urine of infected people mao et al 2020 polo et al 2020 such an approach is a useful tool especially where resources for clinical diagnosis are limited and when reporting systems are unavailable or inefficient kitajima et al 2020 hart and halden 2020 thompson et al 2020 since the beginning of the covid 19 pandemic this environmental approach for tracking sars cov 2 has been used in several countries such as australia netherlands france spain

2020 wurtzer et al 2020 based on this concept and in addition to rapid action to face the epidemic in niterói this municipality established a partnership with oswaldo cruz foundation fiocruz under the brazilian ministry of health aiming at promoting an environmental surveillance project based on detection of sars cov 2 in sewers the intention was to provide data on the spread of these viruses in the municipality alone and to assist actions carried out by the local health secretariat niterói reported the first covid 19 case on march 12th a few weeks after the first confirmed case in the country the success in detecting sars cov 2 in sewerage samples in this pilot project prado et al 2020 led us to expand sampling throughout the city thus adding environmental surveillance data to support decision making of local public health policies in this study we present data from sars cov 2 detected in the sewerage system over a 20 week monitoring period in samples obtained from wastewater treatment plants wwtps and sewer pipes sp in locations with demographic density and of variable income levels neighbourhoods and slums throughout covid 19 epidemic in niterói the sars cov 2

early june median values remained high varying between 4 8 and 5 7 log10 gc 100 ml and from mid june to beginning of august a decreasing trend in sars cov 2 rna concentration in sewage samples was observed median values from 3 6 to 4 6 log10 gc 100 ml in the last two weeks of august sars cov 2 rna titers in sewage increased again in some areas with median values of 4 9 and 4 2 log10 gc 100 ml fig 2a we analysed sars cov 2 rna titers by median values with confirmed covid 19 cases and deaths registered in niterói by the municipal health secretariat fig 2b to calculate median values we included all the samples collected in 12 weeks using a value equal to the lod of n2 assay 3 1 log10 divided by square root of 2 croghan and egeghy 2003 when a sample was non detected bellow the lod overall high titers of sars cov 2 rna in sewage samples coincided with the period when the city registered the highest numbers of covid 19 cases and related deaths end of april to mid june fig 3 shows the expansion of the affected areas in niterói by detection of sars cov 2 rna from sewerage system along the studied period these heat maps were designed based on sars cov 2 sewage titers and used as an environmental indicator of viral spread through different areas of the city fig 3 the maps were built using arcgis pro with the colour s scales varying from lowest viral rna titer value blue colour moderate risk areas to maximum value white colour higher risk areas colours gradations between the minimum and maximum viral concentrations were calculated according to the program s algorithm https

region where the first cases were registered in the municipality 15th april sars cov 2 spread to other regions and reached 100 of detection on 19th may during the peak of the epidemic in the subsequent weeks a reduction of positive rates and viral concentrations were observed between june and july on 18th august viruses were detected again in the sewers from five regions of the municipality with an increase in viral concentration fig 3 geodetic reference sirgas2000 projection system utm spindle 23s scale 1 220 000 3 3 findings according to collection points fig 4 illustrates sars cov 2 rna monitoring during the course of the epidemic through wwtp and decentralized sewage collection networks sp including areas with different socio economic conditions neighbourhoods slums considered of interest by the municipal health secretary we analysed rna titers by 3 ct intervals from 25 to 40 that correspond to 1 log10 gc decrease it is possible to observe that low ct values high sars cov 2 rna titers for all five administrative regions of niterói were concentrated between april and mid june thus coinciding with the high numbers of covid 19 confirmed cases in each region fig 4 collection points were also grouped in wwtps neighbourhoods and slums for descriptive statistics table 1 results demonstrated that positive rates were higher in wwtps compared to sewer pipes neighbourhoods and slums table 1 median viral concentrations were significantly higher in wwtps compared to slums p 0 036 but no significant difference was found between wwtps and neighbourhoods p 0 05 in the same way no significant difference was observed between the median viral concentrations obtained between neighbourhoods and slums 3 4 genomic surveillance strains detected in the sewage twenty seven sars cov 2 positive samples were submitted to the protocol for genome amplification however only four of them presented enough viral material to assemble the library lineage of three genomes b 1 1 33 clade g containing the nucleotide substitutions described were recovered table 2 details of the four partial genomes recovered are described in the supplementary material table s2 4 discussion 4 1 environmental surveillance of sars cov 2 in the present study we successfully used an environmental approach to track sars cov 2 presence concentration and genetic diversity from wastewater samples obtained in different areas of niterói municipality brazil following biosafety measures previously recommended wastewater samples were thermal inactivated prior to viral concentration once there is no evidence that this procedure causes a considerable loss of viral rna in these samples wu et al 2020 la rosa et al 2020b the mean recovery rate of brsv used as a surrogate of sars cov 2 obtained in our study was 27 4 similar to values ranging from 6 to 33 5 previously obtained for enveloped viruses using the ultracentrifugation based method ye et al 2016 ahmed et al 2020b rusiñol et al 2020 for pp7 the mean recovery rate found was of 18 5 similar to the one found for mengovirus 11 2 1 a non enveloped picornavirus randazzo et al 2020 other concentration methods resulted in lower recovery rates range 6 6 to 11 using surrogates for human coronavirus randazzo et al 2020 gonzales et al 2020 although variable rates were observed by ahmed et al 2020b comparing different types of viral concentration methods the confirmation of positive rt qpcr signals by sequencing analysis or the use or more than one target region is highly recommended until assay specificities have been validated for environmental samples kitajima et al 2020 michael kordatou et al 2020 despite no consensus on the best methodology to detect sars cov 2 we used n2 primes and probe based on studies that described this target region as the most suitable to detect these viruses nalla et al 2020 gonzalez et al 2020 over the period of five months we analysed 223 raw sewage samples weekly collected from different sampling collection points wwtp and sp and sars cov 2 was detected in 84 3 of them presenting ct values ranging from 24 8 and 39 8 and detection frequencies between 42 and 100 during the surveillance viral concentrations ranged from 3 1 to 7 1 log10 gc 100 ml concentrations found in our study were higher than those found in australia usa india israel and turkey ahmed et al 2020a gonzalez et al 2020 kocamemi et al 2020 kumar et al 2020 however it is worth mentioning that most of these studies analysed a limited number of samples in australia and turkey nine samples were analysed and two and seven were positive for sars cov 2 respectively presenting ct values higher than 34 ahmed et al 2020a kocamemi et al 2020 our results are more aligned with sars cov 2 concentrations found in spain and france randazzo et al 2020 wurtzer et al 2020 as stated by gonzalez et al 2020 we believe that several factors affect different findings of viral concentration in sewage samples especially the ongoing circumstances of covid 19 pandemic in the studied region from 188 sars cov 2 positive samples we selected 27 samples based on lower ct values to perform whole genome sequencing from these we successfully obtained the almost complete genome of four samples all presenting ct values 30 three out of four genomic sequences were identified as lineage b 1 1 33 clade g this lineage was the most prevalent sars cov 2 lineage in rio de janeiro state in the early phase of the pandemic late february to late april resende et al 2020b probably established before the detection of the first reported sars cov 2 case in the country comparing sars cov 2 genomes obtained from our samples with other genomes available in epicov gisaid we observed that the strains recovered from sewage samples in niterói held a close identity with sars cov 2 strains circulating locally in rio de janeiro capital interestingly brazilian sars cov 2 strains were clustered into three major clades 1 2 and 3 and currently clade 2 also characterized as lineage b 1 1 33 b 1 1 br is described by two nucleotide substitutions in orf6 t27299c and nucleoprotein t29148c resende et al 2020b lineage b 1 1 33 is considered the most spatially widespread lineage in rio de janeiro state resende et al 2020b in this study three complete genome of the strains recovered from sewage samples showed the same nucleotide mutations the most recent common ancestor of the brazilian lineage b 1 1 33 was dated from 22nd february indicating that the community driven transmission was already stablished in brazil by early march resende et al 2020b 4 2 wastewater based epidemiology to support public health policies during the pandemic of covid 19 several studies have demonstrated how an environmental approach was useful to monitor sars cov 2 spread in a given geographic area gonzalez et al 2020 medema et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 however there are few examples reporting how wbe data were used by local authorities to assist public health interventions at controlling the epidemic or how sewage monitoring programs could be incorporated into public health policies this intersectional project initiated by the city hall of niterói involved several municipal government departments environment health planning and transport as well as the water and sanitation company águas de niterói and fiocruz as a research institute throughout this study the interaction of these groups took place through weekly meetings with the participation of different representatives of these institutions to discuss the data obtained and plan health interventions in the first week of sewage monitoring higher covid 19 number of cases was found in praias da baía guanabara bay beaches central one of the regions with the highest hdi and population density in the municipality at this moment we also tested raw sewage from two hospitals in this area however sars cov 2 rna was not detected data not shown the use of diapers in patients and or hospital cleaning procedures may explain the absence of detectable viruses in hospital sewage after the first week the other regions eastern and northern reported an increase in the number of cases reaching lower income populations and several poorer communities in the municipality the expansion of the disease to more vulnerable communities was accompanied by virus research in sewers which explains the increase in sps analyzed and in relation to the pilot project prado et al 2020 the idea of investigating sp in addition to wwtp was supported by the need for new indicators to guide allocation of resources and investments to control the spread of the disease promoting interventions in the most affected areas one example of this action plan took place in a specific area located at the oceânica region boa esperança community the community houses 610 families 2083 people registered in the fmp sars cov 2 was firstly detected in sewage ct value of 26 on april 22 when no covid 19 cases had been reported in this community based on sewage findings the first intervention was to launch an active surveillance to search for individuals showing covid 19 related symptoms identifying infected individuals by testing and to implement measures to control the spread of the disease based on this scenario supplementary assistance services were conducted such as guidance of appropriate support treatment as well as tracking contacts and advising of family members on disease prevention in addition payment for hotel accommodation was also offered to families without physical spaces in their homes to promote social isolation the ongoing environmental surveillance in niterói demonstrated an increase of sars cov 2 concentration in sewage followed by progressive decrease that reflected the epidemic control measures implemented by niterói city hall however from august towards the progressive lifting of social distancing and re opening of commerce and services have promoted an increase of sars cov 2 concentration observed in the last monitoring campaign carried out on 18th august 2020 when the city presented average values of social isolation below 50 however the increase of sars cov 2 in sewage did not follow a proportionally great number of reported covid 19 cases or related deaths by the niterói health system in this case we have two hypotheses it is likely that a large part of the new wave of infection is occurring in young people who usually have mild symptoms and who attend bars gyms and collective sports activities dispensing medical or hospital care in most cases the second hypothesis is related to underreporting or delay in updating the number of daily weekly cases reported by the health system our findings highlight the use of wbe approach as an early warning system for the emergence of new covid 19 cases enabling faster prevention and public health actions by the state as emphasized recently farkas et al 2020 medema et al 2020 polo et al 2020 randazzo et al 2020 thompson et al 2020 the success of the intervention carried out in the boa esperança community resulted in the inclusion of sars cov 2 sewage data as a complementary indicator to other traditionally health indicators used such as growth rates of new cases and hospitalizations mortality rate number of available hospital beds and bed occupancy rate moreover sars cov 2 environmental data as well as heat maps showing a time line were published and weekly updated in the official control panel of the niterói city hall webpage https experience arcgis com experience 305269f3cdd24839b263c5ab346e1aa7sed as an additional information tool encouraging disease prevention actions although national or municipal responses to control covid 19 are different according to institutional arrangements that compounds the public policies of each government capano et al 2020 the decision to include the investigaton of sars cov 2 in sewage to support strategies for controlling the epidemic in niterói was pionner in the country this action provides evidences to identify regions with unreported cases of the disease mainly in areas of social vulnerability and to define regionalized coping strategies in priority areas to focus on the distribution of tests and other resources the development of geoinformation management system sigeo including smart cities tools citizen service mobile app was implemented to share scientific information among the general public scientific evidence based public actions supported by multilevel partnership between public health research institution sanitation company and government secretariats were fundamental to the success of this project 5 conclusion in this study we demonstrated comprehensive aspects of wbe and how its results have been converted into more effective public health policies for the population environmental monitoring during the course of the epidemic through decentralized sewage collection networks sp including areas of uneven socio economic conditions neighbourhoods and slums considered of interest by municipal health secretariat allowed quick and targeted actions carried out in areas of greatest risk and social vulnerability wwtps does not offer the same accuracy for identifying outbreaks and rapid intervention for controlling of the disease but their higher detection rates 100 during monitoring program are more effective for monitoring trends that is for assessing whether sars cov 2 concentrations are increasing or decreasing in a broader population indicating a risk for the occurrence of the disease in communities moreover whole genome sequencing demonstrated that sars cov 2 lineage circulating in niteroi municipality is closest related to the brazilian strains more specifically with strains circulating in rio de janeiro community transmission should have occurred before the first cases were notified in the city the successful experience of wbe and public health interventions adopted by niterói municipality could be replicated at the national level as well as in other countries interested in using sars cov 2 environmental surveillance data as part of the covid 19 combat strategies funding this study was supported by instituto oswaldo cruz paef 2 ação 21c0 and carlos chagas filho

17219,peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops for wastewater treatment have recently attracted widespread interests however the degradation of organic pollutants via traditional radical dominated pathway is severely limited by the side reactions between radicals and the co existing inorganic anions especially under high salinity conditions herein an efficient fe o co doped g c3n4nanosheet catalyst was synthesized to dominantly activate pms through a dual non radical pathway with the singlet oxygen and high valent iron oxo species fe v o the rapid degradation of model pollutant bisphenol a bpa was achieved by dosing pms 1 mm catalyst 0 1 g l in a simulated high salt wastewater 200 mm of the developed fe o doped g c3n4 pms system with a reaction rate constant of 1204 fold higher than that in g c3n4 pms system the o and fe co dopants could reconfigurate the electronic structure of pristine g c3n4 to produce more non radical active species the formed fe v o played a main role in the bpa degradation by promoting electron transfer from bpa molecule to the metastable pms catalyst complex which was verified by electrochemical tests and density functional theory calculations the auxiliary transient productions of oh so4 species were also favorable for the pollutant degradation excellent reusability in a wide ph range confirmed the practical application prospects of the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system the successive addition of pms with a low dosage into the system rich in pollutants was confirmed to favor the pms utilization our work unveils the potential applications of a non radical dominated process for the decontamination of organic pollutants in saline water keywords peroxymonosulfate fe v o high salinity nonradical pathway water treatment 1 introduction in advanced oxidation processes aops highly reactive oxygen species e g oh so4 are generated for the elimination of organic pollutants in the catalytic reactions the pollutant degradation has been widely recognized as a radical dominated pathway duan et al 2018 ghosh et al 2008 li et al 2018b liao et al 2020 wang et al 2019b recently the activation of peroxymonosulfate hso5 pms has shown a great application potential in water treatment when compared with the conventional fe2 h2o2 system pms based aops exhibit several compelling advantages of destroying pollutants such as the formed so4 with a higher oxidation potential 2 5 3 1 v vs 1 8 2 7 v for oh and long half life period 30 40 μs vs 1 μs for oh in a wider ph range 2 10 vs 2 5 for oh cheng et al 2019 li et al 2017 lyu et al 2018 ren et al 2019 wang et al 2018 yin et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 zhao et al 2019 in the present pms oriented studies the pollutant degradation at a laboratory scale is a focus and a high efficiency is easily achieved in the de ionized water and the generated so4 oh radicals with excellent oxidative capacity could quickly attack the target pollutants chen et al 2019b huang and zhang 2019 lee et al 2016 however for practical wastewater the coexisting inorganic ions especially at higher ionic strength are still a big challenge these ions could pose adverse effects on the treatment performance as they may quickly react with the high powered oxidative species to boost the formation of byproducts with a lower oxidation capacity and accordingly slow down the pollutant decomposition rate fan et al 2019 among them co3 2 hco3 and cl have been mostly found to be a robust radical inactivator owing to their more obvious negative effects chen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 dong et al 2019 although the coexisting halides have been proved to be partially effective in removing organic contaminants due to the formation of secondary radicals parker et al 2016 yang et al 2014 they also reduce the oxidation potential of active species and produce hazardous halogenated by products undoubtedly the performance of the so4 oh dominated aops under high salinity conditions should be examined the inhibitory effects by the reactions between the radicals and inorganic ions could be relieved by the non radical aops huang et al 2018 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2019a yang et al 2019 the high valent metal oxo species and singlet oxygen are reported as the two main non radicals chen et al 2019a cheng et al 2019 dong et al 2020 to date the nitrogen rich carbonaceous materials such as graphene li et al 2018b carbon nanotubes cheng et al 2019 yun et al 2018 nanodiamonds lee et al 2016 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 gao et al 2018 li et al 2018a miao et al 2020 are reported heterogeneous materials to activate pms with a 1o2 dominated non radical pathway for pollutant degradation among these activators g c3n4 shows unique advantages e g facile synthesis low cost chemical stability and easiness to large scale production thus it has been extensively applied in photocatalysis cai et al 2019 chu et al 2020 xia et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 electrocatalysis ong et al 2016 sensing lakhi et al 2017 membrane separation lan et al 2019 and heterogeneous catalysis liao et al 2019 wei et al 2018 but for pristine g c3n4 the low electron transport ability with a low degree of pms activation affects its catalytic activity to address this issue the proper regulations of electronic structure such as the metal or non metal doping li et al 2018a visible light irradiation qiao et al 2020 and support with good conductivity lyu et al 2018 seem to be necessary among these approaches the introduction of oxygen atom could regulate the electronic structure of pristine g c3n4 because of its strong electron attracting ability 1o2 was testified as one of the main active species in the o doped g c3n4 pms system implying that the introduction of oxygen into the g c3n4 framework might meet our experimental goals nevertheless the catalytic capability of 1o2 alone toward saline wastewater degradation is still limited by its low oxidative potential g c3n4 has n rich ligands to coordinate with metal fe as complexes where the redox properties of the centered fe atoms could accelerate the oxidant activation through a non radical pathway wu et al 2017 with this in mind we hypothesize the co dopants fe and o into g c3n4 nanosheets might efficiently activate pms such a heterogeneous catalyst may have some merits firstly the efficient electron transport from the catalyst to pms is realized due to the electron attracting of o atom and an autonomous cycle of different fe species secondly the powerful fe iv o or fe v o intermediate with highly oxidative ability will be generated and the emergence of o can facilitate the redox reaction between fe iv fe v o and fe3 thirdly 1o2 and fe iv fe v o involving in the catalytic reaction belong to active species in non radical pathways which is beneficial to accelerate the pollutant degradation regardless of the co existing inorganic ions fourthly the synergistic effects of the co embedded fe and non metal o can reconfigure the intrinsic electronic structure of g c3n4 and reduce the leaching of fe in single fe doped g c3n4 pms system resulting in mutual benefits as an efficient pollutant removal and pms utilization with high proportion thus the fe o co doped g c3n4 might be an efficient activator for pms activation however the internal electron transfer of the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system the assignment of the primary active sites and the catalytic performance of the system for high salinity wastewater treatment remain unclear therefore the main objective of this work is to explore the inhibitory effects of anions on the pollutant degradation in the developed fe o doped g c3n4 pms process first fe and o were embedded into g c3n4 nanosheets by using a simple one step calcination method and the resultant catalyst was employed to activate pms then the catalytic performance toward the degradation of bisphenol a bpa in the fe o doped g c3n4 system under high salinity conditions was investigated the radical non radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance esr were used to examine the reactive active species separate or synergistic roles of fe and o dopants were investigated with experiments and density functional theory dft calculations finally such a fe v o and 1o2 based dual non radical mechanism was elucidated 2 experimental sections 2 1

all of the degradation experiments were conducted via a 40 ml suspension composed of 0 1 g l catalyst 1 mm pms and 10 mg l bpa at ambient temperature 25 2 c briefly 4 mg of the prepared catalyst was firstly dispersed into a 40 ml bpa solution with a 30 s ultrasonic treatment and the mixture was stirred for an additional 20 min to establish an adsorption desorption equilibrium after pms 1 mm was

catalysts for pristine g c3n4 two diffraction peaks at 12 6 and 27 7 were indexed as the 100 and 002 planes which corresponded to the in plane repeating units of the continuous heptazine framework and interlayer stacking of the conjugated aromatic structure respectively han et al 2016 tong et al 2017 for the fe doped g c3n4 samples a slight shift to higher diffraction angle and a weak intensity of the characteristic peaks were observed indicating that fe was successfully invaded into the framework of g c3n4 chen et al 2009 the diffraction peaks of the two o doped g c3n4 composites were broadened with the attenuated intensities because of the incorporation of o atom gao et al 2018 no redundant characteristics peaks of fe oxides were found in the fe or fe o doped g c3n4 reflecting that fe might exist in the form of fe n bond rather than fe o bond in the composites the morphologies of the catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem imaging as illustrated in fig 1c e the pristine g c3n4 and fe doped g c3n4 samples exhibited a two dimensional nanosheet like structure after the introduction of oxygen the general nanosheets remained and numerous broken holes were formed on the surface of the g c3n4 nanosheet substrate fig 1d f dosing h2c2o4 in the synthesis process not only provided an oxygen source to create a rich electronic region but also favored the exposure of active sites other characterizations e g pore size distribution fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps are provided in the supplementary material fig s2 and s3 3 2 catalytic activity evaluation as an endocrine disrupting compound bisphenol a bpa released into the water could lead to adverse effects in both aquatic wildlife and human beings through hindering orinterfering functions of hormones thus bpa in our study was selected as a representative organic contaminant to evaluate the catalytic performance of the developed heterogeneous systems when sole pms or catalysts g c3n4 or fe o doped g c3n4 was added into the reaction solution fig s4 the bpa degradation efficiency was less than 4 indicating that the direct oxidation of pms and adsorptive capacity of the catalysts were negligible besides an inappreciable removal 1 was achieved in the g c3n4 pms system which might be ascribed to the poor electron transfer property of the pristine g c3n4 doping o or fe substantially stimulated the catalytic performance of g c3n4 as 18 0 and 88 7 of bpa were respectively degraded in the o doped g c3n4 pms and fe doped g c3n4 pms systems within 4 min fig 2 a especially for the fe o co doped g c3n4 pms system a 100 bpa removal was achieved under identical conditions the bpa degradation kinetics fitted well with a pseudo first order model fig 2b fig s5 and table s2 and the kapp values of the fe o co doped g c3n4 pms was estimated to be 1 204 min 1 which was higher than that of the g c3n4 pms by 1204 fold o doped g c3n4 pms by 32 5 fold and fe doped g c3n4 pms by 2 3 fold in terms of oxidant dose catalyst loading pollutant concentration and removal efficiency the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system exhibited great superiority over the catalytic systems reported previously table s3 thus the fe o co doped g c3n4 was an efficient pms activator 3 3 effects of different operational parameters on bpa degradation the effects of fe3 amount and oxidant concentration on bpa degradation were also examined as the initial fe3 loading was increased from 0 005 to 0 05 g the bpa degradation efficiency significantly increased from 63 7 to 100 fig 2c however after a further increase in fecl3 loading no obvious increase was observed similarly increasing the pms concentration from 0 to 1 mm also remarkably promoted bpa degradation but the elevation was insignificant when the additive pms dosage was over 1 mm fig 2d these results suggest that the suitable fe loading and pms dosage were beneficial to the active species generation and pms utilization trade off between costs bpa degradation performance and secondary contamination concern of the final pms product as sulfate ions fecl3 loading of 0 05 g an actual fe weight ratio of 1 23 wt in the composite in the material synthesis and pms of 1 mm was selected in the subsequent experiments as shown in fig s7a the bpa degradation rates were slightly retarded when increasing initial ph from 3 12 to 11 96 in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system apart from bpa various organic molecules e g sulfamethoxazole smz tetracycline tc phenol methyl blue mb rhodamine b rhb and methyl orange mo were also chosen as the model pollutants to validate its generality over 95 of all pollutants were rapidly degraded within 6 min fig s7b as a result the ph independence and high oxidation capacity for the degradation of multiple organic pollutants reveal that the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system could be potentially applied for wastewater treatment 3 4 bpa degradation under high salinity conditions inorganic anions are ubiquitous in actual wastewaters and pose negative effects on the radical based aops but no substantial effects on the non radical aops as a proof of concept eight common anions so4 2 hco3 no3 h2po4 co3 2 no2 po4 3 and cl with different concentrations were representatively added into the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system with the analogical orderliness the negligible effects of so4 2 hco3 no3 h2po4 and co3 2 on the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system were observed even at an initial anion concentration of 200 mm fig 3 a i the co existing no2 slightly consumed pms resulting in a decrease in the bpa removal from 100 at 0 mm no2 to 82 9 at 200 mm no2 within 6 min the presence of po4 3 might coordinate with fe3 to reduce the catalytic activity but the bpa removal could keep at a high level 68 7 at a po4 3 concentration of 200 mm fig 3i as the cl concentration was increased from nil to 200 mm the bpa degradation rate was strengthened by a 6 9 fold likely due to its feedback effects of pms activation fig s8 9 the molecular mechanisms for the effects of the various anions on the catalytic performance were elucidatedby dft calculations the adsorption capability of po4 3 fig s10a pms table s6 h2po4 fig s10b cl fig s10c and no2 fig s10d at fe iii site follow the order of po4 3 pms cl no2 h2po4 owing to the lower adsorption energies δe ads of po4 3 3 81 ev on fe iii sites compared with that of pms 2 83 ev the catalytic active site was preferentially coordinated by po4 3 through two o fe bonds fig s10a this reduced the possibility of pms being activated resulting in a decrease in bpa removal by contrast it is difficult to inhibit the activation of pms in the presence of h2po4 on the basis of δe ads thus no obvious adverse effects similar to po4 3 were found although the adsorption capability of no2 at the fe iii site was weaker than that of pms this anion still had an impact on the catalytic activity because the direct reaction between no2 and pms could spontaneously occur g 1 30 ev to consume a certain amount of pms eq 3 similar to no2 cl itself also had the ability to react with pms eq 4 g 0 58 ev but the hclo species were generated with a relatively high oxidation ability favorably accelerating the bpa degradation 3 hso5 no2 so4 2 no3 h 4 hso5 cl so4 2 hclo generally the coexisting anions especially co3 2 and hco3 in the radical dominated aops could transform the high oxidative radicals into a lower oxidation capacity state encouragingly the inhibitory effects of anions were not detected in our work even in the presence of high concentration anions furthermore the developed fe o doped g c3n4 pms system also exhibited high resistance to actual wastewaters with a relatively high ionic strength from practical wastewater and natural organic matter nom containing water table s4 and fig s11 12 natural organic matters nom in actual water have an adverse impact on wastewater treatment herein humic acid ha a typical nom was taken as an example as shown in fig s11 no noticeable decrease was found when ha concentration was increased from 0 to 200 mg l suggesting that the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system displayed high resistance to the nom containing water further to assess its catalytic performance tap water raw and tail wastewater jingkaiqu municipal wastewater plant hefei city china table s4 were separately used as the water sources to prepare bpa reaction solution relatively high bpa removal efficiencies 98 fig s12 remained even in the raw wastewater containing plenty of inorganic ions and other competitive pollutants favorably indicating the promising potentials of the system accordingly these results indicate that the non radical pathway should work in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system with a high efficiency 3 5 contributions of radical pathway to bpa degradation after excluding the contribution of physical adsorption and pms direct oxidation on the bpa degradation some highly reactive species that might be responsible for bpa degradation were examined first tba for oh k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and k so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 and meoh etoh and ipa for both oh k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 were applied to confirm the contribution of oh and so4 to bpa degradation as shown in fig 4 tba meoh etoh and ipa with a series of dosages 0 120 mm all failed to produce an obvious inhibition on the bpa degradation indicating that oh and so4 were not the main active species in the reaction the degradation experiment of sodium benzoate 1 a typical radical probe by the fe o doped g c3n4 pms fig s13a was also conduced after the exposure to visible light with a 300 w xe arc lamp pls sxe 300d 300duv beijing perfectlight co ltd as the light source the fe o doped g c3n4 a typical photocatalyst achieved a 19 1 degradation of sodium benzoate within 6 min through the production of oh and o2 radicals fig s13b which is in line with the previous reports thus the radical pathway was not dominant in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system it should be mentioned that the electron spin resonance esr signals of dmpo oh so4 fig s14a and onehydroxylated product of bpa product p1 table s5 were observed simultaneously thereby the transient generation of oh so4 species also accelerated the bpa decomposition as an auxiliary promoter this observation was interesting and useful to guide us to re examine the traditional catalytic degradation process besides dosing 10 mm bq a quencher for o2 fig 5 a into the reaction system didn t affect the bpa removal suggesting that o2 also had a smaller contribution to the bpa degradation these results above highlight that the radical pathway didn t play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system 3 6 contributions of 1o2 to bpa degradation the presence of 10 mm temp decreased the bpa removal efficiency from 100 to 80 73 after 4 min reaction fig 5a this result implies that 1o2 species contributed to the bpa degradation process which was further validated by a 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp spin trapping esr technique as shown in fig 5b and fig s14b compared with the temp itself pms and fe doped g c3n4 alone a typical three line temp 1o2 signal in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system was much higher and the signal intensity decreased substantially in the presence of bpa thus more 1o2 species were generated in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system to participate in the bpa degradation notably dosing temp reduced the bpa removal efficiency by 20 only suggesting that some currently unknown species with a high activity should be responsible for the residual 80 of bpa degradation 3 7 contributions of fe v o to bpa degradation acid treatment was first used to determine the role of fe iii in the composite catalyst after 0 5 h pretreatment with 1 m hcl the bpa removal efficiency in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system decreased from 100 to 93 9 fig s15 further increasing the hcl treatment time to 1 0 h the bpa removal declined to 79 6 within 6 min reaction this result suggests that fe iii served as a primary active site for pms activation considering that the carboxyl groups of oxalate can coordinate with fe iii to form the metal carboxyl complex xue et al 2009 chelating agent of oxalate was then dosed into the catalytic degradation system to reconfirm the role of fe iii a set of batch experiments with an oxalate concentration of 0 10 20 and 40 mm were conducted as displayed in fig s16a the bpa removal efficiency declined from 100 to 55 0 when increasing the oxalate concentration from nil to 40 mm excluding the negligible effect of oxalate itself fig s16b the coordinated fe iii confined in the nitrogen pots of the g c3n4 framework was proven to be one main active site for pms activation besides the o atom with a strong electron attracting effect could also facilitate the internal circulation of fe based species as reported previously the oxidants such as pms pds or h2o2 favor the generation of the high valent iron oxo species e g fe iv o and fe v o when the fe iii coordinated with n rich ligands was used as a heterogeneous catalyst ghosh et al 2008 wang et al 2017 undoubtedly it was possible that the high valent iron oxo species were also involved in the bpa degradation in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system to confirm this assumption the dmso dimethyl sulfoxide was selected as a probe and synchronously dosed into the catalytic system fig 5c as the dmso concentration was increased from nil to 160 mm the bpa degradation efficiency significantly declined from 100 to 35 8 furthermore the liquid chromagraphy mass spectrometry lc ms data in fig 5d also indicate that the pmso methyl phenyl sulfoxide was oxidized into pmso2 methyl phenyl sulfone the oxidation product of pmso by fe v o through an oxygen atom transfer step after the comparisons between the standard and oxidized pmso samples by the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system the m z 141 04 in a positive mode was observed for the standard pmso fig s17a b while another peak with a m z value of 157 03 corresponding to the pmso2 fig s18 19 was also detected after the reaction time of 6 min in the pmso fe o doped g c3n4 pms system further extending the reaction time to 30 min the characteristic peak of pmso disappeared and was almost transformed into that of pmso2 fig 6 a b the formation of pmso2 was an indicator for the determination of fe v o species furthermore the δe ad values of psmo at the fe iv o and fe v o sites were calculated to be 0 32 fig s20a and 0 73 ev fig s20b respectively suggesting that pmso could be efficiently adsorbed by the fe v o species and further achieve in situ oxidation these results demonstrate that fe iii was coordinated with n atoms in the nitrogen pots of g c3n4 framework and then the formed fe n bond was transformed into fe v o species in the catalytic reaction therefore the high valent iron species fe v o as another non radical species also contributed to the enhanced bpa degradation in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system 3 8 contributions of electron transfer to bpa degradation the foregoing electron transfer between bpa catalysts and pms was examined by electrochemical impedance spectra eis i t curves and linear sweep voltammetry lsv tests as shown in fig 7 a a smaller semicircle diameter was observed in the fe o doped g c3n4 system compared with those of g c3n4 o doped g c3n4 and fe doped g c3n4 systems indicating that the fe o co doped g c3n4 led to a higher conductivity and facilitated the inner electron transfer for pms activation chronoamperometry test was carried out to investigate the intrinsic electron transfer kinetics when bpa was initially added into the electrochemical system fig 7c no electron transfer occurred between bpa and the catalysts dosing pms in advance fig 7d the current output was drastically enhanced after the introduction of successive pms and bpa these observations indicate that the direct electron transfer from bpa molecules occurred after the possibly pre generated metastable pms catalyst surface complex to eliminate the impacts of other factors e g f doped sno2 fto nafion and operating parameters the control experiments of current outputs were also conducted a transient current response was found after dosing pms into the fto substrate nafion fto and nafion fto fe o doped g c3n4 systems under bias free conditions fig s22a however a current response again after the injection of stored bpa was detected only in the nafion fto fe o doped g c3n4 system consistent results were also obtained by applying an open circuit voltage fig s22b thus electron transfer from bpa molecule to the metastable pms catalyst complex was confirmed besides the current density in the lsv curves fig 7b increased in the presence of pms and another substantial elevation of current densitywas observed after dosing bpa these results suggest that the reactive complexes were initially formed between pms and fe o doped g c3n4 and then bpa molecules could provide electrons to accelerate pms activation and favor the degradation process 3 9 dft calculations to further reveal the reaction mechanism of pollutant degradation in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system at the molecular level dft calculations were performed with the results shown in fig 8 and table s6 7 the adsorption of pms on the g c3n4 o doped g c3n4 fe doped g c3n4 and fe o doped g c3n4 with the lowest energy configuration is illustrated in fig 8a d the average bond length of fe n bonds in the fe o doped g c3n4 2 18 å was shorter than that in the fe doped g c3n4 2 33 å suggesting a more stable geometry structure with four coordinated fe active site in the fe o doped g c3n4 composite this might be attributed to the carbon nitrogen heterocycle warping after the doping of o atoms which reduced the steric hindrance of fe n coordination pms was likely to locate at the surface of all the catalysts with the so4 group as summarized in table s6 the bond length of o o l o o of free pms was 1 47 å and kept almost unchanged after pms was adsorbed on the g c3n4 fig 8a and o doped g c3n4 fig 8b whereas l o o was remarkably stretched and broken when pms was anchored on fe site of the fe doped g c3n4 fig 8c and fe o doped g c3n4 fig 8d thereby generating the metastable pms catalyst surface complex and even producing so4 and oh the adsorption between pms and surface was enhanced by the doped fe to trigger the more electron transfer leading to an elongation of l o o to better understand the interaction and activation between the surfaces and pms the adsorption energy fig 8e and charge transfer of pms on the different surfaces were investigated the adsorption energies of pms on the g c3n4 and o doped g c3n4 were 0 98 ev and 1 05 ev respectively table s6 with almost no charge transfer with pms fig s23a and s23b corresponding to weak activation performance however the adsorption energies of pms on the fe doped g c3n4 2 29 ev and fe o doped g c3n4 2 83 ev were much higher than those on the g c3n4 and o doped g c3n4 simultaneously an obvious charge transfer at the interface of pms and fe doped g c3n4 fig s23c or fe o doped g c3n4 fig s23d was observed implying their strong activation ability these results are in good agreement with the bpa degradation efficiencies of these four catalytic systems table s2 in addition the mulliken population analysis based on the electron density difference results demonstrates that about 0 38 electron was transferred from fe atom on the surface of fe o doped g c3n4 to pms indicating that fe atom was oxidized to form the high valent iron oxo species as fe v o which was also consistent well with the experimental results moreover the adsorption of bpa as the initial step in the bpa degradation process would govern the reactivity of the catalysts on the basis of the sabatier principle the adsorption energy of bpa on the fe o doped g c3n4 surface was moderate fig 8f table s7 in other words the interaction of bpa on the surface of fe o doped g c3n4 was neither too strong nor too weak the rational surface structure and elemental doping grant the optimal adsorption energy of bpa molecules thus improving the degradation activity of the fe o doped g c3n4 system with the above analyses a dual non radical dominated mechanism is proposed for the pollutant degradation in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system fig 7e and fig s24 after the co doping fe and o atoms into g c3n4 nanosheets the electronic structure of pristine g c3n4 was re adjusted and more adsorptive or active catalytic sites were formed in the catalytic reaction a metastable fe o doped g c3n4 pms intermediate was initially formed after pms ions were adsorbed on the fe o doped g c3n4 1o2 could be boosted by the reaction between water molecules and so5 radical that was produced through the electron transfer from pms to the electron deficient c atoms in fe o doped g c3n4 subsequently the metastable pms fe o doped g c3n4 intermediate either returned to its original state by the dissociation of fe iii o bond or was converted to fe v o afterward these two non radicals 1o2 and fe v o mainly contributed to bpa degradation and bpa or o active site served as an electron donor to promote the pms decomposition besides the formation of oh so4 as the temporary contributors accelerated bpa degradation in this way a high efficient bpa degradation and mineralization were achieved even under high salinity conditions 3 10 stability and reusability of the developed catalytic systems the stability of the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system in the degradation of bpa was evaluated by six consecutive runs under identical conditions after each run the used catalyst was recycled by filtration and washing with deionized water and ethanol the 100 efficiency of bpa degradation remained within 6 min after six cycles indicating that the fe o doped g c3n4 composite was an efficient and stable heterogeneous catalyst for pms activation fig 9 a the leakage amount of fe3 in solution after one cycle was respectively 0 35 and 0 18 mg l for the fe doped g c3n4 and fe o doped g c3n4 systems fig 9e the co doped o could favor the stabilization of fe and reduce its leaching level which is consistent with dft results after six repeated experiments the total amount of leached fe in the fe o doped g c3n4 system reached 0 45 mg l which was only 2 9 wt of total fe content in the composite fig 9f furthermore almost no bpa degradation fig s29 was found by the homogeneous fe3 pms system demonstrating that the formed fe n in the fe o doped g c3n4 composite was crucial tem images of the used fe o doped g c3n4 in fig s30 show the broken nanosheets as the fresh sample as shown in fig s31 no significant characteristic peaks changes in ftir spectra after the dark adsorption and catalytic degradation were also observed except for one new peak appeared at 622 cm 1 assigned to the asymmetric angular vibration of so4 2 in pms structure indicating the adsorptive interaction of pms onto the fe o doped g c3n4 composite no obvious xps spectra variations in fig s32 were found after six cyclic reactions further confirming the outstanding reusability of the fe o doped g c3n4 the illustration of the s 2p xps spectrum in fig s32f also well verifies the formed catalyst pms complex 3 11 efficient pms utilization the pms decomposition in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system was 19 8 only after the first cycle and nearly 80 of pms was not utilized to find out the possible reason for this observation we tentatively dosed a quantitative of the stored bpa solution 300 mg l into the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system to maintain the concentration of bpa suspension at 10 mg l fig 9b after a 6 min catalytic reaction 100 of bpa degradation was also achieved after repeating the above experiment for nine times the bpa degradation efficiency was still 60 2 and the catalytic activity disappeared at the tenth cycle the pms utilization was enhanced after being treated with bpa as an electron donor in other words an equivalent removal efficiency could be achieved with theless consumption of pms after one cycle besides a 40 ml aqueous solution containing 100 mg l bpa was used the target and the initial pms dosage 0 1 mm was sequentially dosed into the catalytic system after 6 min as shown in fig 9c 61 7 of bpa was degraded within 6 min and 100 removal efficiency was received after dosing pms of 0 1 mm for five times these results reveal that the successive additions of pms at a low dose level into the bpa solution under high pollutant concentration conditions was favorable for the maximum utilization of pms more electrons were transferred to the fe o doped g c3n4 pms complex which promoted the generation of reactive active species comparison degradation experiments with a bpa concentration of 100 mg l were conducted under the conditions of a single 1 mm and successive additions of pms 10 0 1 mm fig 9d after 36 min reaction bpa was eliminated but the total pms consumption was only 0 5 mm in the sequential additions considering the pms cost and bpa degradation efficiency a successive of pms addition is more cost effective and eco friendly in the actual wastewater treatment 4 conclusion in this work a simple calcination approach for the synthesis of fe and o co doped g c3n4 nanosheets is developed which is suitable for large scale production of catalysts differing from the conventional pms based aops two non radicals 1o2 and fe v o in the fe o doped g c3n4 system are unveiled by analysis suite of experiments and dft calculations the electronic structure of g c3n4 is regulated by doping fe and o to accelerate the electron transport and generate highly active non radicals resulting in efficient pollutant degradation under high salinity conditions upon the formation of metastable fe o doped g c3n4 pms complexes in the catalytic reaction a signification elevation of electron transfer between the complexes and bpa is achieved the applicability of the developed fe o doped g c3n4 pms system in a wide ph range of 3 11 and various organic pollutants validates its application potentials which is further enhanced in the presence of cl the successive addition of pms with a low dosage into the high concentration of bpa solution favors the efficient utilization of pms this work provides a novel approach to relieve the inhibitory effects of anions in conventional radical dominated aops by the co doped metal and non metal atoms onto carbon based materials for pms activation with the non radical pathway this approach is

17219,peroxymonosulfate pms based advanced oxidation processes aops for wastewater treatment have recently attracted widespread interests however the degradation of organic pollutants via traditional radical dominated pathway is severely limited by the side reactions between radicals and the co existing inorganic anions especially under high salinity conditions herein an efficient fe o co doped g c3n4nanosheet catalyst was synthesized to dominantly activate pms through a dual non radical pathway with the singlet oxygen and high valent iron oxo species fe v o the rapid degradation of model pollutant bisphenol a bpa was achieved by dosing pms 1 mm catalyst 0 1 g l in a simulated high salt wastewater 200 mm of the developed fe o doped g c3n4 pms system with a reaction rate constant of 1204 fold higher than that in g c3n4 pms system the o and fe co dopants could reconfigurate the electronic structure of pristine g c3n4 to produce more non radical active species the formed fe v o played a main role in the bpa degradation by promoting electron transfer from bpa molecule to the metastable pms catalyst complex which was verified by electrochemical tests and density functional theory calculations the auxiliary transient productions of oh so4 species were also favorable for the pollutant degradation excellent reusability in a wide ph range confirmed the practical application prospects of the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system the successive addition of pms with a low dosage into the system rich in pollutants was confirmed to favor the pms utilization our work unveils the

efficiency is easily achieved in the de ionized water and the generated so4 oh radicals with excellent oxidative capacity could quickly attack the target pollutants chen et al 2019b huang and zhang 2019 lee et al 2016 however for practical wastewater the coexisting inorganic ions especially at higher ionic strength are still a big challenge these ions could pose adverse effects on the treatment performance as they may quickly react with the high powered oxidative species to boost the formation of byproducts with a lower oxidation capacity and accordingly slow down the pollutant decomposition rate fan et al 2019 among them co3 2 hco3 and cl have been mostly found to be a robust radical inactivator owing to their more obvious negative effects chen et al 2017 chen et al 2020 dong et al 2019 although the coexisting halides have been proved to be partially effective in removing organic contaminants due to the formation of secondary radicals parker et al 2016 yang et al 2014 they also reduce the oxidation potential of active species and produce hazardous halogenated by products undoubtedly the performance of the so4 oh dominated aops under high salinity conditions should be examined the inhibitory effects by the reactions between the radicals and inorganic ions could be relieved by the non radical aops huang et al 2018 luo et al 2019 wang et al 2019a yang et al 2019 the high valent metal oxo species and singlet oxygen are reported as the two main non radicals chen et al 2019a cheng et al 2019 dong et al 2020 to date the nitrogen rich carbonaceous materials such as graphene li et al 2018b carbon nanotubes cheng et al 2019 yun et al 2018 nanodiamonds lee et al 2016 and graphitic carbon nitride g c3n4 gao et al 2018 li et al 2018a miao et al 2020 are reported heterogeneous materials to activate pms with a 1o2 dominated non radical pathway for pollutant degradation among these activators g c3n4 shows unique advantages e g facile synthesis low cost chemical stability and easiness to large scale production thus it has been extensively applied in photocatalysis cai et al 2019 chu et al 2020 xia et al 2020 xiao et al 2020 electrocatalysis ong et al 2016 sensing lakhi et al 2017 membrane separation lan et al 2019 and heterogeneous catalysis liao et al 2019 wei et al 2018 but for pristine g c3n4 the low electron transport ability with a low degree of pms activation affects its catalytic activity to address this issue the proper regulations of electronic structure such as the metal or non metal doping li et al 2018a visible light irradiation qiao et al 2020 and support with good conductivity lyu et al 2018 seem to be necessary among these approaches the introduction of oxygen atom could regulate the electronic structure of pristine g c3n4 because of its strong electron attracting ability 1o2 was testified as one of the main active species in the o doped g c3n4 pms system implying that the introduction of oxygen into the g c3n4 framework might meet our experimental goals nevertheless the catalytic capability of 1o2 alone toward saline wastewater degradation is still limited by its low oxidative potential g c3n4 has n rich ligands to coordinate with metal fe as complexes where the redox properties of the centered fe atoms could accelerate the oxidant activation through a non radical pathway wu et al 2017 with this in mind we hypothesize the co dopants fe and o into g c3n4 nanosheets might efficiently activate pms such a heterogeneous catalyst may have some merits firstly the efficient electron transport from the catalyst to pms is realized due to the electron attracting of o atom and an autonomous cycle of different fe species secondly the powerful fe iv o or fe v o intermediate with highly oxidative ability will be generated and the emergence of o can facilitate the redox reaction between fe iv fe v o and fe3 thirdly 1o2 and fe iv fe v o involving in the catalytic reaction belong to active species in non radical pathways which is beneficial to accelerate the pollutant degradation regardless of the co existing inorganic ions fourthly the synergistic effects of the co embedded fe and non metal o can reconfigure the intrinsic electronic structure of g c3n4 and reduce the leaching of fe in single fe doped g c3n4 pms system resulting in mutual benefits as an efficient pollutant removal and pms utilization with high proportion thus the fe o co doped g c3n4 might be an efficient activator for pms activation however the internal electron transfer of the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system the assignment of the primary active sites and the catalytic performance of the system for high salinity wastewater treatment remain unclear therefore the main objective of this work is to explore the inhibitory effects of anions on the pollutant degradation in the developed fe o doped g c3n4 pms process first fe and o were embedded into g c3n4 nanosheets by using a simple one step calcination method and the resultant catalyst was employed to activate pms then the catalytic performance toward the degradation of bisphenol a bpa in the fe o doped g c3n4 system under high salinity conditions was investigated the radical non radical quenching experiments and electron paramagnetic resonance esr were used to examine the reactive active species separate or synergistic roles of fe and o dopants were investigated with experiments and density functional theory dft calculations finally such a fe v o and 1o2 based dual non radical mechanism was elucidated 2 experimental sections 2 1

obtained mixture was put in a crucible with a lid then closely sealed the whole crucible with a 4 layer aluminum foil a thickness of 20 μm this sealing method could effectively increase the output of target g c3n4 and slow down the release rate of nh3 gas facilitating the formation of holes on the surface of g c3n4 nanosheets the well sealed crucible was put into a muffle furnace ksl 1200x hefei

all of the degradation experiments were conducted via a 40 ml suspension composed of 0 1 g l catalyst 1 mm pms and 10 mg l bpa at ambient temperature 25 2 c briefly 4 mg of the prepared catalyst was firstly dispersed into a 40 ml bpa solution with a 30 s ultrasonic treatment and the mixture was stirred for an additional 20 min to establish an adsorption desorption equilibrium after pms 1 mm was dosed to trigger the catalytic reaction the resultant solution of 1 ml was withdrawn and na2s2o3 1 ml 100 mm was mixed immediately to terminate the degradation and then centrifuged at 10000 rpm for 10

catalysts for pristine g c3n4 two diffraction peaks at 12 6 and 27 7 were indexed as the 100 and 002 planes which corresponded to the in plane repeating units of the continuous heptazine framework and interlayer stacking of the conjugated aromatic structure respectively han et al 2016 tong et al 2017 for the fe doped g c3n4 samples a slight shift to higher diffraction angle and a weak intensity of the characteristic peaks were observed indicating that fe was successfully invaded into the framework of g c3n4 chen et al 2009 the diffraction peaks of the two o doped g c3n4 composites were broadened with the attenuated intensities because of the incorporation of o atom gao et al 2018 no redundant characteristics peaks of fe oxides were found in the fe or fe o doped g c3n4 reflecting that fe might exist in the form of fe n bond rather than fe o bond in the composites the morphologies of the catalysts were characterized by transmission electron microscopy tem imaging as illustrated in fig 1c e the pristine g c3n4 and fe doped g c3n4 samples exhibited a two dimensional nanosheet like structure after the introduction of oxygen the general nanosheets remained and numerous broken holes were formed on the surface of the g c3n4 nanosheet substrate fig 1d f dosing h2c2o4 in the synthesis process not only provided an oxygen source to create a rich electronic region but also favored the exposure of active sites other characterizations e g pore size distribution fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ftir and x ray photoelectron spectroscopy xps are provided in the supplementary material fig s2 and s3 3 2 catalytic activity evaluation as an endocrine disrupting compound bisphenol a bpa released into the water could lead to adverse effects in both aquatic wildlife and human beings through hindering orinterfering functions of hormones thus bpa in our study was selected as a representative organic contaminant to evaluate the catalytic performance of the developed heterogeneous systems when sole pms or catalysts g c3n4 or fe o doped g c3n4 was added into the reaction solution fig s4 the bpa degradation efficiency was less than 4 indicating that the direct oxidation of pms and adsorptive capacity of the catalysts were negligible besides an inappreciable removal 1 was achieved in the g c3n4 pms system which might be ascribed to the poor electron transfer property of the pristine g c3n4 doping o or fe substantially stimulated the catalytic performance of g c3n4 as 18 0 and 88 7 of bpa were respectively degraded in the o doped g c3n4 pms and fe doped g c3n4 pms systems within 4 min fig 2 a especially for the fe o co doped g c3n4 pms system a 100 bpa removal was achieved under identical conditions the bpa degradation kinetics fitted well with a pseudo first order model fig 2b fig s5 and table s2 and the kapp values of the fe o co doped g c3n4 pms was estimated to be 1 204 min 1 which was higher than that of the g c3n4 pms by 1204 fold o doped g c3n4 pms by 32 5 fold and fe doped g c3n4 pms by 2 3 fold in terms of oxidant dose catalyst loading pollutant concentration and removal efficiency the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system exhibited great superiority over the catalytic systems reported previously table s3 thus the fe o co doped g c3n4 was an efficient pms activator 3 3 effects of different operational parameters on bpa degradation the effects of fe3 amount and oxidant concentration on bpa degradation were also examined as the initial fe3 loading was increased from 0 005 to 0 05 g the bpa degradation efficiency significantly increased from 63 7 to 100 fig 2c however after a further increase in fecl3 loading no obvious increase was observed similarly increasing the pms concentration from 0 to 1 mm also remarkably promoted bpa degradation but the elevation was insignificant when the additive pms dosage was over 1 mm fig 2d these results suggest that the suitable fe loading and pms dosage were beneficial to the active species generation and pms utilization trade off between costs bpa degradation performance and secondary contamination concern of the final pms product as sulfate ions fecl3 loading of 0 05 g an actual fe weight ratio of 1 23 wt in the composite in the material synthesis and pms of 1 mm was selected in the subsequent experiments as shown in fig s7a the bpa degradation rates were slightly retarded when increasing initial ph from 3 12 to 11 96 in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system apart from bpa various organic molecules e g sulfamethoxazole smz tetracycline tc phenol methyl blue mb rhodamine b rhb and methyl orange mo were also chosen as the model pollutants to validate its generality over 95 of all pollutants were rapidly degraded within 6 min fig s7b as a result the ph independence and high oxidation capacity for the degradation of multiple organic pollutants reveal that the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system could be potentially applied for wastewater treatment 3 4 bpa degradation under high salinity conditions inorganic anions are ubiquitous in actual wastewaters and pose negative effects on the radical based aops but no substantial effects on the non radical aops as a proof of concept eight common anions so4 2 hco3 no3 h2po4 co3 2 no2 po4 3 and cl with different concentrations were representatively added into the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system with the analogical orderliness the negligible effects of so4 2 hco3 no3 h2po4 and co3 2 on the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system were observed even at an initial anion concentration of 200 mm fig 3 a i the co existing no2 slightly consumed pms resulting in a decrease in the bpa removal from 100 at 0 mm no2 to 82 9 at 200 mm no2 within 6 min the presence of po4 3 might coordinate with fe3 to reduce the catalytic activity but the bpa removal could keep at a high level 68 7 at a po4 3 concentration of 200 mm fig 3i as the cl concentration was increased from nil to 200 mm the bpa degradation rate was strengthened by a 6 9 fold likely due to its feedback effects of pms activation fig s8 9 the molecular mechanisms for the effects of the various anions on the catalytic performance were elucidatedby dft calculations the adsorption capability of po4 3 fig s10a pms table s6 h2po4 fig s10b cl fig s10c and no2 fig s10d at fe iii site follow the order of po4 3 pms cl no2 h2po4 owing to the lower adsorption energies δe ads of po4 3 3 81 ev on fe iii sites compared with that of pms 2 83 ev the catalytic active site was preferentially coordinated by po4 3 through two o fe bonds fig s10a this reduced the possibility of pms being activated resulting in a decrease in bpa removal by contrast it is difficult to inhibit the activation of pms in the presence of h2po4 on the basis of δe ads thus no obvious adverse effects similar to po4 3 were found although the adsorption capability of no2 at the fe iii site was weaker than that of pms this anion still had an impact on the catalytic activity because the direct reaction between no2 and pms could spontaneously occur g 1 30 ev to consume a certain amount of pms eq 3 similar to no2 cl itself also had the ability to react with pms eq 4 g 0 58 ev but the hclo species were generated with a relatively high oxidation ability favorably accelerating the bpa degradation 3 hso5 no2 so4 2 no3 h 4 hso5 cl so4 2 hclo generally the coexisting anions especially co3 2 and hco3 in the radical dominated aops could transform the high oxidative radicals into a lower oxidation capacity state encouragingly the inhibitory effects of anions were not detected in our work even in the presence of high concentration anions furthermore the developed fe o doped g c3n4 pms system also exhibited high resistance to actual wastewaters with a relatively high ionic strength from practical wastewater and natural organic matter nom containing water table s4 and fig s11 12 natural organic matters nom in actual water have an adverse impact on wastewater treatment herein humic acid ha a typical nom was taken as an example as shown in fig s11 no noticeable decrease was found when ha concentration was increased from 0 to 200 mg l suggesting that the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system displayed high resistance to the nom containing water further to assess its catalytic performance tap water raw and tail wastewater jingkaiqu municipal wastewater plant hefei city china table s4 were separately used as the water sources to prepare bpa reaction solution relatively high bpa removal efficiencies 98 fig s12 remained even in the raw wastewater containing plenty of inorganic ions and other competitive pollutants favorably indicating the promising potentials of the system accordingly these results indicate that the non radical pathway should work in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system with a high efficiency 3 5 contributions of radical pathway to bpa degradation after excluding the contribution of physical adsorption and pms direct oxidation on the bpa degradation some highly reactive species that might be responsible for bpa degradation were examined first tba for oh k oh 3 8 7 6 108 m 1 s 1 and k so4 4 0 9 1 105 m 1 s 1 and meoh etoh and ipa for both oh k 9 7 108 m 1 s 1 and so4 k 2 5 107 m 1 s 1 were applied to confirm the contribution of oh and so4 to bpa degradation as shown in fig 4 tba meoh etoh and ipa with a series of dosages 0 120 mm all failed to produce an obvious inhibition on the bpa degradation indicating that oh and so4 were not the main active species in the reaction the degradation experiment of sodium benzoate 1 a typical radical probe by the fe o doped g c3n4 pms fig s13a was also conduced after the exposure to visible light with a 300 w xe arc lamp pls sxe 300d 300duv beijing perfectlight co ltd as the light source the fe o doped g c3n4 a typical photocatalyst achieved a 19 1 degradation of sodium benzoate within 6 min through the production of oh and o2 radicals fig s13b which is in line with the previous reports thus the radical pathway was not dominant in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system it should be mentioned that the electron spin resonance esr signals of dmpo oh so4 fig s14a and onehydroxylated product of bpa product p1 table s5 were observed simultaneously thereby the transient generation of oh so4 species also accelerated the bpa decomposition as an auxiliary promoter this observation was interesting and useful to guide us to re examine the traditional catalytic degradation process besides dosing 10 mm bq a quencher for o2 fig 5 a into the reaction system didn t affect the bpa removal suggesting that o2 also had a smaller contribution to the bpa degradation these results above highlight that the radical pathway didn t play a crucial role in enhancing the catalytic activity in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system 3 6 contributions of 1o2 to bpa degradation the presence of 10 mm temp decreased the bpa removal efficiency from 100 to 80 73 after 4 min reaction fig 5a this result implies that 1o2 species contributed to the bpa degradation process which was further validated by a 2 2 6 6 tetramethyl 4 piperidinol temp spin trapping esr technique as shown in fig 5b and fig s14b compared with the temp itself pms and fe doped g c3n4 alone a typical three line temp 1o2 signal in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system was much higher and the signal intensity decreased substantially in the presence of bpa thus more 1o2 species were generated in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system to participate in the bpa degradation notably dosing temp reduced the bpa removal efficiency by 20 only suggesting that some currently unknown species with a high activity should be responsible for the residual 80 of bpa degradation 3 7 contributions of fe v o to bpa degradation acid treatment was first used to determine the role of fe iii in the composite catalyst after 0 5 h pretreatment with 1 m hcl the bpa removal efficiency in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system decreased from 100 to 93 9 fig s15 further increasing the hcl treatment time to 1 0 h the bpa removal declined to 79 6 within 6 min reaction this result suggests that fe iii served as a primary active site for pms activation considering that the carboxyl groups of oxalate can coordinate with fe iii to form the metal carboxyl complex xue et al 2009 chelating agent of oxalate was then dosed into the catalytic degradation system to reconfirm the role of fe iii a set of batch experiments with an oxalate concentration of 0 10 20 and 40 mm were conducted as displayed in fig s16a the bpa removal efficiency declined from 100 to 55 0 when increasing the oxalate concentration from nil to 40 mm excluding the negligible effect of oxalate itself fig s16b the coordinated fe iii confined in the nitrogen pots of the g c3n4 framework was proven to be one main active site for pms activation besides the o atom with a strong electron attracting effect could also facilitate the internal circulation of fe based species as reported previously the oxidants such as pms pds or h2o2 favor the generation of the high valent iron oxo species e g fe iv o and fe v o when the fe iii coordinated with n rich ligands was used as a heterogeneous catalyst ghosh et al 2008 wang et al 2017 undoubtedly it was possible that the high valent iron oxo species were also involved in the bpa degradation in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system to confirm this assumption the dmso dimethyl sulfoxide was selected as a probe and synchronously dosed into the catalytic system fig 5c as the dmso concentration was increased from nil to 160 mm the bpa degradation efficiency significantly declined from 100 to 35 8 furthermore the liquid chromagraphy mass spectrometry lc ms data in fig 5d also indicate that the pmso methyl phenyl sulfoxide was oxidized into pmso2 methyl phenyl sulfone the oxidation product of pmso by fe v o through an oxygen atom transfer step after the comparisons between the standard and oxidized pmso samples by the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system the m z 141 04 in a positive mode was observed for the standard pmso fig s17a b while another peak with a m z value of 157 03 corresponding to the pmso2 fig s18 19 was also detected after the reaction time of 6 min in the pmso fe o doped g c3n4 pms system further extending the reaction time to 30 min the characteristic peak of pmso disappeared and was almost transformed into that of pmso2 fig 6 a b the formation of pmso2 was an indicator for the determination of fe v o species furthermore the δe ad values of psmo at the fe iv o and fe v o sites were calculated to be 0 32 fig s20a and 0 73 ev fig s20b respectively suggesting that pmso could be efficiently adsorbed by the fe v o species and further achieve in situ oxidation these results demonstrate that fe iii was coordinated with n atoms in the nitrogen pots of g c3n4 framework and then the formed fe n bond was transformed into fe v o species in the catalytic reaction therefore the high valent iron species fe v o as another non radical species also contributed to the enhanced bpa degradation in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system 3 8 contributions of electron transfer to bpa degradation the foregoing electron transfer between bpa catalysts and pms was examined by electrochemical impedance spectra eis i t curves and linear sweep voltammetry lsv tests as shown in fig 7 a a smaller semicircle diameter was observed in the fe o doped g c3n4 system compared with those of g c3n4 o doped g c3n4 and fe doped g c3n4 systems indicating that the fe o co doped g c3n4 led to a higher conductivity and facilitated the inner electron transfer for pms activation chronoamperometry test was carried out to investigate the intrinsic electron transfer kinetics when bpa was initially added into the electrochemical system fig 7c no electron transfer occurred between bpa and the catalysts dosing pms in advance fig 7d the current output was drastically enhanced after the introduction of successive pms and bpa these observations indicate that the direct electron transfer from bpa molecules occurred after the possibly pre generated metastable pms catalyst surface complex to eliminate the impacts of other factors e g f doped sno2 fto nafion and operating parameters the control experiments of current outputs were also conducted a transient current response was found after dosing pms into the fto substrate nafion fto and nafion fto fe o doped g c3n4 systems under bias free conditions fig s22a however a current response again after the injection of stored bpa was detected only in the nafion fto fe o doped g c3n4 system consistent results were also obtained by applying an open circuit voltage fig s22b thus electron transfer from bpa molecule to the metastable pms catalyst complex was confirmed besides the current density in the lsv curves fig 7b increased in the presence of pms and another substantial elevation of current densitywas observed after dosing bpa these results suggest that the reactive complexes were initially formed between pms and fe o doped g c3n4 and then bpa molecules could provide electrons to accelerate pms activation and favor the degradation process 3 9 dft calculations to further reveal the reaction mechanism of pollutant degradation in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system at the molecular level dft calculations were performed with the results shown in fig 8 and table s6 7 the adsorption of pms on the g c3n4 o doped g c3n4 fe doped g c3n4 and fe o doped g c3n4 with the lowest energy configuration is illustrated in fig 8a d the average bond length of fe n bonds in the fe o doped g c3n4 2 18 å was shorter than that in the fe doped g c3n4 2 33 å suggesting a more stable geometry structure with four coordinated fe active site in the fe o doped g c3n4 composite this might be attributed to the carbon nitrogen heterocycle warping after the doping of o atoms which reduced the steric hindrance of fe n coordination pms was likely to locate at the surface of all the catalysts with the so4 group as summarized in table s6 the bond length of o o l o o of free pms was 1 47 å and kept almost unchanged after pms was adsorbed on the g c3n4 fig 8a and o doped g c3n4 fig 8b whereas l o o was remarkably stretched and broken when pms was anchored on fe site of the fe doped g c3n4 fig 8c and fe o doped g c3n4 fig 8d thereby generating the metastable pms catalyst surface complex and even producing so4 and oh the adsorption between pms and surface was enhanced by the doped fe to trigger the more electron transfer leading to an elongation of l o o to better understand the interaction and activation between the surfaces and pms the adsorption energy fig 8e and charge transfer of pms on the different surfaces were investigated the adsorption energies of pms on the g c3n4 and o doped g c3n4 were 0 98 ev and 1 05 ev respectively table s6 with almost no charge transfer with pms fig s23a and s23b corresponding to weak activation performance however the adsorption energies of pms on the fe doped g c3n4 2 29 ev and fe o doped g c3n4 2 83 ev were much higher than those on the g c3n4 and o doped g c3n4 simultaneously an obvious charge transfer at the interface of pms and fe doped g c3n4 fig s23c or fe o doped g c3n4 fig s23d was observed implying their strong activation ability these results are in good agreement with the bpa degradation efficiencies of these four catalytic systems table s2 in addition the mulliken population analysis based on the electron density difference results demonstrates that about 0 38 electron was transferred from fe atom on the surface of fe o doped g c3n4 to pms indicating that fe atom was oxidized to form the high valent iron oxo species as fe v o which was also consistent well with the experimental results moreover the adsorption of bpa as the initial step in the bpa degradation process would govern the reactivity of the catalysts on the basis of the sabatier principle the adsorption energy of bpa on the fe o doped g c3n4 surface was moderate fig 8f table s7 in other words the interaction of bpa on the surface of fe o doped g c3n4 was neither too strong nor too weak the rational surface structure and elemental doping grant the optimal adsorption energy of bpa molecules thus improving the degradation activity of the fe o doped g c3n4 system with the above analyses a dual non radical dominated mechanism is proposed for the pollutant degradation in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system fig 7e and fig s24 after the co doping fe and o atoms into g c3n4 nanosheets the electronic structure of pristine g c3n4 was re adjusted and more adsorptive or active catalytic sites were formed in the catalytic reaction a metastable fe o doped g c3n4 pms intermediate was initially formed after pms ions were adsorbed on the fe o doped g c3n4 1o2 could be boosted by the reaction between water molecules and so5 radical that was produced through the electron transfer from pms to the electron deficient c atoms in fe o doped g c3n4 subsequently the metastable pms fe o doped g c3n4 intermediate either returned to its original state by the dissociation of fe iii o bond or was converted to fe v o afterward these two non radicals 1o2 and fe v o mainly contributed to bpa degradation and bpa or o active site served as an electron donor to promote the pms decomposition besides the formation of oh so4 as the temporary contributors accelerated bpa degradation in this way a high efficient bpa degradation and mineralization were achieved even under high salinity conditions 3 10 stability and reusability of the developed catalytic systems the stability of the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system in the degradation of bpa was evaluated by six consecutive runs under identical conditions after each run the used catalyst was recycled by filtration and washing with deionized water and ethanol the 100 efficiency of bpa degradation remained within 6 min after six cycles indicating that the fe o doped g c3n4 composite was an efficient and stable heterogeneous catalyst for pms activation fig 9 a the leakage amount of fe3 in solution after one cycle was respectively 0 35 and 0 18 mg l for the fe doped g c3n4 and fe o doped g c3n4 systems fig 9e the co doped o could favor the stabilization of fe and reduce its leaching level which is consistent with dft results after six repeated experiments the total amount of leached fe in the fe o doped g c3n4 system reached 0 45 mg l which was only 2 9 wt of total fe content in the composite fig 9f furthermore almost no bpa degradation fig s29 was found by the homogeneous fe3 pms system demonstrating that the formed fe n in the fe o doped g c3n4 composite was crucial tem images of the used fe o doped g c3n4 in fig s30 show the broken nanosheets as the fresh sample as shown in fig s31 no significant characteristic peaks changes in ftir spectra after the dark adsorption and catalytic degradation were also observed except for one new peak appeared at 622 cm 1 assigned to the asymmetric angular vibration of so4 2 in pms structure indicating the adsorptive interaction of pms onto the fe o doped g c3n4 composite no obvious xps spectra variations in fig s32 were found after six cyclic reactions further confirming the outstanding reusability of the fe o doped g c3n4 the illustration of the s 2p xps spectrum in fig s32f also well verifies the formed catalyst pms complex 3 11 efficient pms utilization the pms decomposition in the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system was 19 8 only after the first cycle and nearly 80 of pms was not utilized to find out the possible reason for this observation we tentatively dosed a quantitative of the stored bpa solution 300 mg l into the fe o doped g c3n4 pms system to maintain the concentration of bpa suspension at 10 mg l fig 9b after a 6 min catalytic reaction 100 of bpa degradation was also achieved after repeating the above experiment for nine times the bpa degradation efficiency was still 60 2 and the catalytic activity disappeared at the tenth cycle the pms utilization was enhanced after being treated with bpa as an electron donor in other words an equivalent removal efficiency could be achieved with theless consumption of pms after one cycle besides a 40 ml aqueous solution containing 100 mg l bpa was used the target and the initial pms dosage 0 1 mm was sequentially dosed into the catalytic system after 6 min as shown in fig 9c 61 7 of bpa was degraded within 6 min and 100 removal efficiency was received after dosing pms of 0 1 mm for five times these results reveal that the successive additions of pms at a low dose level into the bpa solution under high pollutant concentration conditions was favorable for the maximum utilization of pms more electrons were transferred to the fe o doped g c3n4 pms complex which promoted the generation of reactive active species comparison degradation experiments with a bpa concentration of 100 mg l were conducted under the conditions of a single 1 mm and successive additions of pms 10 0 1 mm fig 9d after 36 min reaction bpa was eliminated but the total pms consumption was only 0 5 mm in the sequential additions considering the pms cost and bpa degradation efficiency a successive of pms addition is more cost effective and eco friendly in the actual wastewater treatment 4 conclusion in this work a simple calcination approach for the synthesis of fe and o co doped g c3n4 nanosheets is developed which is suitable for large scale production of catalysts differing from the conventional pms based aops two non radicals 1o2 and fe v o in the fe o doped g c3n4 system are unveiled by analysis suite of experiments and dft calculations the electronic structure of g c3n4 is regulated by doping fe and o to accelerate the electron transport and generate highly active non radicals resulting in efficient pollutant degradation under high salinity conditions upon the formation of metastable fe o doped g c3n4 pms complexes in the catalytic reaction a signification elevation of electron transfer between the complexes and bpa is achieved the applicability of the developed fe o doped g c3n4 pms system in a wide ph range of 3 11 and various organic pollutants validates its application potentials which is further enhanced in the presence of cl the successive addition of pms with a low dosage into the high concentration of bpa solution favors the efficient utilization of pms this work provides a novel approach to relieve the inhibitory effects of anions in conventional radical dominated aops by the co doped metal and non metal atoms onto carbon based materials for pms activation with the non radical pathway this approach is
