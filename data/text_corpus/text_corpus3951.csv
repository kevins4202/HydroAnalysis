19755,the effect of extracellular polymeric substances eps on the meso scale physical structure and hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms during gravity driven membrane gdm filtration was investigated biofilms were developed on the surface of ultrafiltration membranes during dead end filtration at ultra low pressure 70 mbar biofilm eps composition total protein polysaccharide and edna was manipulated by growing biofilms under contrasting nutrient conditions nutrient conditions consisted of i a nutrient enriched condition with a nutrient ratio of 100 30 10 c n p ii a phosphorus limitation c n p ratio 100 30 0 and iii a nitrogen limitation c n p ratio 100 0 10 the structure of the biofilm was characterised at meso scale using optical coherence tomography oct biofilm composition was analysed with respect to total organic carbon total cellular mass and extracellular concentrations of proteins polysaccharides and edna 2d confocal raman mapping was used to characterise the functional group composition and micro scale distribution of the biofilms eps our study reveals that the composition of the eps matrix can determine the meso scale physical structure of membrane biofilms and in turn its hydraulic resistance biofilms grown under p limiting conditions were characterised by dense and homogeneous physical structures with high concentrations of polysaccharides and edna biofilm grown under nutrient enriched or n limiting conditions were characterised by heterogeneous physical structures with lower concentrations of polysaccharides and edna for p limiting biofilms 2d confocal raman microscopy revealed a homogeneous spatial distribution of anionic functional groups in homogeneous biofilm structures with higher polysaccharide and edna concentrations this study links eps composition physical structure and hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms with practical relevance for the hydraulic performances of gdm ultrafiltration graphical abstract image 1 keywords gravity driven membrane filtration gdm ultrafiltration biofilm hydraulic resistance physical structure eps 1 introduction the microbial biofilm is akin to a semi permeable polymeric gel wilking et al 2011 the microbial cells embedded in their surrounding matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps collectively form a semi solid structure which can impede perpendicular flow during membrane ultrafiltration vrouwenvelder et al 2016 from an engineering perspective the hydraulic resistance imposed by the biofilm is problematic for membrane filtration systems causing a decline in permeate flux production gravity driven membrane gdm ultrafiltration however tolerates biofilm development on the membrane surface for the benefit of minimal maintenance stable flux and improved permeate quality peter varbanets et al 2010 2011 stable but low permeate flux values are reported in gdm filters depending of the type of feed water 5 15 l m2 h peter varbanets et al 2010 thus for successful implementation reducing the hydraulic resistance of the biofilm for effective flux recovery whilst simultaneously tolerating its presence for stable flux production will be imperative towards this goal a fundamental understanding of the influencing factors that govern the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms is required for efficient hydraulic operation of gdm filtration systems extracellular polymeric substances eps are a proposed determinant of biofilm hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 relatively little hydraulic resistance can be attributed to the embedded microbial cells or inorganic particles dreszer et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 a comparison of hydraulic resistance profiles from intact biofilms bacterial cake layers and model fouling layers revealed that fouling layers with a greater eps content had a greater hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 however it is not known how the biofilms eps and their associated physical structures can directly influence hydraulic transport through the biofilm dreszer et al 2014 valladares linares et al 2015 dreszer et al 2013 suggested eps can limit convective transport through biofilms by providing friction to the permeating water molecules valladares linares et al 2015 support this claim when compacting the biofilms physical structure and evaluating the compacted biofilms hydraulic resistance compaction is proposed to increase the density of eps which could lead to higher hydraulic resistances on the assumption a higher eps density can reduce the volume between neighbouring eps molecules limiting hydraulic flow valladares linares et al 2015 vrouwenvelder et al 2016 united such observations in a theoretical model based on the hagen poiseuille law which describes hydraulic transport through a channel or pipe the hydraulic resistance imposed by the biofilm is thought to be dependent on the biofilms internal architecture specifically the geometry between the strands of eps vrouwenvelder et al 2016 this theory assumes that volume between the eps molecules can act as conduits capable of hydraulic transport during forced water passage numerically it was demonstrated that reducing the diameter between eps molecules can restrict water passage through the channel thus increasing resistance to flow during forced water passage vrouwenvelder et al 2016 this is in fact analogous to the darcian models of tiller and kwon 1998 who describe fluid flow through a cake layer of particles therein the authors assume uniform particle size and charge unlike a layer of inert particles biofilm eps is composed of proteins polysaccharides extracellular dna edna and to a lesser extent lipids flemming and wingender 2010 the secretion of specific eps classes is self regulated based on environmental stimuli shear nutrient status flemming and wingender 2010 danhorn et al 2004 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 such biopolymers are capable of electrostatic and functional interactions in pure culture studies changes to the composition of eps can alter the biofilms physical structure ma et al 2006 mayer et al 1999 it is thus plausible that specific compositions of eps could influence the physical structure of membrane biofilms e g its internal architecture pores channels and in turn permeation through such structures during membrane filtration the production of extracellular polysaccharides by the biofilm is associated with a lower flux production chang and halverson 2003 chen and stewart 2002 herzberg et al 2009 however whether the production of specific eps molecules by membrane biofilms leads to the formation of specific physical structures with preferential flow paths remains unknown the uncertainty of whether specific eps molecules can assemble into distinct physical structures which may help or hinder hydraulic transport is compounded by the fact that analysis of physical structures usually occurs at the micro scale via confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm it is argued that clsm reduces the overall detail of the biofilms physical structure and related functions e g permeability due its measurement range in micrometres wagner et al 2010 furthermore application of clsm used in conjunction with fluorophore staining e g concanavalin a for chemical characterisation e g polysaccharides is an invasive method

function relationships such as the influence of overall thickness internal porosity and surface topology roughness on water passage through the biofilm wagner et al 2010 martin et al 2014 fortunato et al 2017 for in situ chemical characterisation 2d confocal raman microscopy is a non invasive technique used for characterisation of functional groups and their distribution within a sample raman 1930 ivleva et al 2009 sijtsema et al 1998 raman microscopy has been demonstrated to provide accurate chemical information of intact microbial aggregates e g flocs the utility of 2d confocal raman mapping in providing localised chemical analysis of eps of intact membrane biofilms is unknown ivleva et al 2009 blackwell 1977 wagner et al 2009 by relating the accumulation of specific eps composition to the meso scale physical structure of the biofilm one may better ascertain how the chemical composition of the eps can influence the physical structure and ultimately the hydraulic resistance of the biofilm the goal of this study is to understand i whether different compositions of the eps in terms of protein polysaccharide and edna concentration can influence the biofilm physical structure and ii how resulting structures influence the hydraulic resistance of a biofilm during gdm ultrafiltration we hypothesized the hydraulic resistance of the biofilm is dependent on the chemical composition of the eps whereby differences in eps molecules will lead to the formation of distinct physical structures which have different hydraulic resistances to investigate this hypothesis different biofilms were grown during gdm filtration on membrane surface limiting nutrient conditions n and p limitations were used to produce biofilms of different eps concentrations and compositions danhorn et al 2004 chen and stewart 2002 oct analysis was performed to study the effect of eps accumulation on biofilms meso scale physical structure and ultimately on the biofilms hydraulic resistance the biofilm composition was analysed with respect to total mass extracellular polysaccharide protein and edna concentrations results from colorimetric assays were confirmed by conducting 2d confocal raman microscopy characterisations of the different types of biofilms 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup membrane fouling simulators mfs were operated as gdm membrane filtration systems in dead end mode at a constant transmembrane pressure of 70 mbar fig 1 for each mfs synthetic feed water was pumped into the system with a peristaltic pump ism932a ismatec glattbrugg switzerland at a rate ensuring that permeation was solely gravity driven the system was connected to overhead tanks with overflows through which excess water could leave the system in that way a constant water head of 70

ortho phosphate po4 3 respectively in a ratio of 100 c 30 n 10 p for the positive growth conditions a ratio representational for drink water a solution of nanopure water with no added nutrients was used as the negative control p and n limitations were imposed to produce a biofilm with distinct eps composition and anticipated different physical structures danhorn et al 2004 liu et al 2006 ras et al 2011 nutrient limitation was used only as an experimental tool to grow biofilms of different physical structures and eps compositions essential trace elements were supplemented to the feed water along with edta to ensure trace elements did not precipitate hammes and egli 2005 an overview of the four different nutrient conditions are given in table 1 organic carbon concentrations are within a range typically expected for drinking water 2 2 3 bacteria cultivation and membrane mfs inoculation bacteria for mfs inoculation were cultivated from the chriesbach river dübendorf switzerland 47 24 16 3 n 8 36 31 8 e during spring time river water was collected in a sterile beaker sealed and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter to remove higher organisms this was confirmed by visual examination of the filtrate under stereomicroscope 10 ml of filtrate was added to 90 ml of sterile nutrient solution containing 50 mg c l and corresponding p and n concentrations under a laminar flow hood the nutrient filtrate suspension was placed in an orbital incubator for 30 c with a rocking speed of 220 rpm for 24 h this procedure was repeated 3 times to condition bacteria to the synthetic substrate bacterial suspension was analysed under stereomicroscope to ensure absence of higher organisms after incubation bacterial cell number was quantified by atp measurement as described by hammes et al 2010 1 2 1010 cells ml measured thereafter the 1 5 ml aliquots were taken and distributed into 2 ml eppendorf tubes containing 0 5 ml of 30 glycerol as a cryo protectant bacterial glycerol stocks were snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until use to regenerate the bacteria from frozen stock 2 ml of the bacteria glycerol stock was taken and inoculated into 100 ml of sterile nutrient containing 50 mg c l with corresponding p and n concentrations in a ratio of 100 30 10 c n p under a laminar flow hood suspension was incubated for 18 24 h at 30 c as defined in previous steps for inoculation of the mfs microbial suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm unicen mr herolab germany the supernatant was decanted allowing resuspension of the cell pellet in 30 ml 0 1 m nacl yielding a final concentration of 1 5 1010 cells ml as determined by atp assay from the resulting bacterial solution 2 5 ml was injected into each mfs the spiked mfs was let settle for 18 24 h to allow filtration of bacterial solution allowing known cell coverage over the membrane area this resulted in a surface coverage of 2 1013 cells m2 as determined from atp assay 2 2 4 hydraulic parameters permeate flux and hydraulic resistances were derived from the mass of collected permeate the mass of permeate was recorded daily the volume of permeate was determined by dividing the permeate mass by the density of water 1000 kg m3 the following equations were used for the calculations of the permeate flux j l m2 h 1 j δ v a δ t where δv is the change in permeate volume l a is

scale gradient analysis 2 image binarization automatic threshold selection 3 calculating physical properties of the biofilm mean biofilm thickness z in μm 2 2 6 biofilm harvesting biofilms were removed from the mfs for chemical analysis at each time point biofilms were scraped from the membrane surface via a cell scrapper and transferred into sterile glass beakers a volume of 30 ml 0 1 m nacl solution was used to rinse the remaining biofilm from the membrane and mfs surface the collected biomass was re suspended in the washings of the 30 ml 0 1 m nacl solution toc remaining following removal of biomass is similar to the one of a virgin membrane indicating that no left biofilm remained on the scrapped membrane thus verifying removal of available biomass from the membranes surface 2 2 7 eps extraction eps were separated from cells through physical extraction the approach consisted of sonication homogenisation phase and centrifugation separation phase steps respectively sole physical extraction was selected over existing chemical methods to limit contamination of sample fractions due to sensitivity of subsequent analytical methods different extraction tests were performed to maximize eps extraction while avoiding cell lysis detected through soluble atp measurement the harvested biofilm suspensions were placed in an ice bath and sonicated for 120 s with 10 s rest intervals using a needle sonicator sonoplus hd 3200 bandelin berlin germany this was repeated three times to ensure full extraction of the biofilms eps thereafter homogenised samples were centrifuged

data set analysed provided in supplementary information si 3 results 3 1 permeate flux and hydraulic resistance 3 1 1 permeate flux the change in the mean flux of each experimental condition was monitored for 30 days for 3 separate experimental runs to determine experimental reproducibility fig 2 a c flux stabilisation occurred only under nutrient enriched fig 2a and n limiting fig 2c conditions but not for p limiting condition fig 2b which decreased up to the experimental endpoint this was standard for all three experimental runs under n limiting conditions flux stabilisation was the higher producing an average flux production of 10 1 2 l m2 h n 12 mfs between day 19 30 compared to an average stable flux of 4 5 2 7 l m2 h n 12 mfs for the nutrient enriched condition permeate flux production for p limiting condition however declined continuously to 1 60 0 7 l m2 h n 12 mfs up to 30 days 3 1 2 biofilm hydraulic resistance the biofilms hydraulic resistance was derived from mean flux values monitored for 30 days repeated for three separate experimental runs fig 2d f hydraulic resistance for the biofilms formed under the p limiting condition fig 2e increased over time reaching 1 26 1012 2 07 1011 1 m n 12 mfs after 30 days of growth conversely the hydraulic resistance of biofilms formed under the nutrient enriched condition fig 2d increased to an average of 3 78 1011 2 75 10 n 12 mfs after 10 days of growth and remained stable at an average resistance 3 78 1011 2 75 10 1 m n 12 mfs thereafter until 30 days of system operation similarly the biofilm formed under the n limiting condition fig 2f had a lower hydraulic resistance of 2 25 1011 1 m after 30 days of growth compared to p limiting and nutrient enriched conditions respectively 3 2 biofilm physical structure 3 2 1 biofilm morphology visual observations at the meso scale revealed a time dependent accumulation of biomass on the surface of membranes fig 3 contrasting growth conditions produced biofilms with different physical structures at meso scale associated with different hydraulic resistances biofilms grown under nutrient enriched conditions had a heterogeneous morphology n 50 meanwhile the biofilm of the p limiting growth condition had a largely homogenous morphology n 50 the biofilm grown under the n limiting condition formed a thin and heterogeneous structure n 30 visual observations of the biofilms suggest hydraulic resistance is linked to the biofilms meso scale structure biofilms with homogenous morphologies had very high hydraulic resistances conversely heterogeneous biofilm morphologies were associated with significantly lower hydraulic resistances biofilms formed under the nutrient enriched condition while also being heterogeneous had a higher hydraulic resistance than the biofilm of the n limiting condition 3 2 2 quantification of biofilm morphology morphological observations at the meso scale were supported by quantification of mean biofilm thickness based on oct image analysis as described in section 2 2 5 the thickness of the nutrient enriched biofilm fig 4 a increased over time achieving an average thickness of 803 70 μm n 37 locations after 30 days of growth the biofilm of the p limiting fig 4b and n limiting fig 4c conditions were thinner achieving respective thickness of 251 18 μm n 17 locations and 214 37 μm n 30 locations after 30 days of growth the thickness of the enriched nutrient film was significantly higher than the thickness of both the p and n limiting biofilms with a p value of 3e 04 and 4e 05 respectively increase in thickness of the nutrient enriched biofilm had a limited impact on its hydraulic resistance the homogenous p limiting biofilm had a higher hydraulic resistance compared to the thicker biofilm of the nutrient enriched despite being thinner biofilms formed under the n limiting condition were thinner than the biofilm of the nutrient enriched and had a lower hydraulic resistance indicating passage length may influence the hydraulic resistance of biofilms with similar morphological distributions of biomass 3 3 biofilm accumulation 3 3 1 biomass accumulation during the first 7 days of operation the nutrient enriched condition fig 4d yielded an average toc of 463 15 mg c m2 n 4 compared to 312 8 mg c m2 n 4 and 206 1 12 mg c m2 n 5 of p fig 4e and n limiting conditions fig 4f as the biofilms matured onwards of 7 days higher concentrations of biomass in terms of toc were measured for the p limiting condition yielding a final concentration of 1006 32 mg c m2 n 4 after 30 days of growth compared to 760 40 mg c m2 n 6 and 400 80 mg c m2 n 4 for enriched and n limiting growth conditions after 30 days of growth respectively data analysis indicated that the mass of the enriched nutrient and p limited biofilms are similar null hypothesis not rejected p value of 0 7 while the mass of the n limited biofilm is significantly lower than the one of the enriched nutrient biofilms null hypothesis rejected with a p value of 0 009 3 3 2 biofilm density as the biofilms matured the biofilm formed under the p limiting condition had a higher density of 3 0 22 kg c

matured biofilms formed under nutrient enriched conditions had higher active cell mass compared to p and n limiting conditions respectively in all experimental runs biofilms formed under nutrient enriched conditions contained 7 9 10 7 5 410 7 mol of atp m2 n 3 after 30 days of biofilm growth this corresponded to 3 9 1011 2 8 10 active cells m2 assuming 2 10 18 mol of atp per unit cell biofilms formed under p and n limiting conditions contained 7 10 8 1 9 10 8 mol of atp m2 n 3 and 2 4 10 8 6 3 10 09 mol of atp m2 n 3 respectively this corresponded to 3 5 1010 9 6 109 n 3 and 1 2 1010 3 1 109 active cells m2 assuming 2 10 18 mol of atp per unit cell for biofilms formed under p and n limiting conditions respectively this indicates lower cellular activity in biofilm grown under nutrient limiting conditions 3 4 eps concentration 3 4 1 protein concentration extracellular protein concentration increased in all biofilms during 30 days of growth fig 5 biofilms formed under nutrient enriched fig 5a conditions yielded 461 8 2 mg c m2 n 5 after 30 days of growth compared to 186 6 37 mg c m2 n 5 and 198 1 67 mg c m2 n 2 for p fig 5b and n limiting fig 5c conditions respectively statistical analysis indicated that the null hypotheses similar protein concentrations in the p and n limiting biofilms compared to nutrient enriched biofilms can be rejected with p values of 0 0002 and 2e 05 respectively 3 4 2 polysaccharide concentration during early biofilm development up to 7 days biofilms formed under the nutrient enriched conditions fig 5d yielded 188 5 mg c m2 n 4 compared to 306 23 mg c m2 n 4 yielded under p fig 5e and n limiting fig 5f conditions respectively after 30 days of biofilm growth biofilms formed under p limiting conditions fig 5e yielded 1006 32 48 mg c m2 n 5 compared to 188 2 94 mg c m2 n 4 and 110 30 mg c m2 n 5 for nutrient enriched fig 5d and n limiting fig 5f conditions respectively the accumulation of polysaccharides in the p limiting biofilms was statistically higher than in the nutrient enriched biofilms null hypothesis i e similar polysaccharide concentrations in the p limiting and enriched biofilms was rejected with p value of 3e 08 the accumulation of polysaccharides in the n limiting biofilms compared to the nutrient enriched biofilms was also statistically significant null hypothesis i e similar polysaccharide concentrations in the n limiting and enriched biofilms was rejected with p value of 0 0034 3 4 3 edna concentration edna concentration increased over the course of biofilm growth fig 5 biofilms formed under p limiting fig 5h yielded 159 mg edna m2 n 2 compared to 82 mg edna m2 n 2 and 60 1 mg edna m2 n 2 yielded under nutrient enriched fig 5g and n limiting fig 5i growth conditions change in the edna concentrations of the p limited biofilm was statistically different than in the nutrient enriched biofilms null hypotheses i e similar edna concentrations in the p and n limiting biofilms compared to the enriched biofilms were rejected with p values of 4e 05 the edna content of the n limited biofilm was different from the ones of the enriched nutrient biofilms p value of 0 025 3 4 4 in situ 2d confocal raman microscopy of membrane biofilms in situ 2d confocal raman microscopy was performed to characterise the functional group profile of biofilms with different meso scale physical structures to better understand the link between polymer composition and biofilm physical structure fig 6 illustrates the raman spectra of nutrient enriched p and n limiting conditions for all conditions the spectra show 3 identical bands with different strengths of intensity depending on the biofilm growth condition at i 1000 1 cm ii 1155 1 cm and iii 1510 1 cm the assignment of raman bands is based on reference samples for polymicrobial biofilms validated with surrogate substances ivleva et al 2009 blackwell 1977 wagner et al 2009 the band at approximately 1000 1 cm i corresponds to o p2 the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the dna rna molecule ivleva et al 2009 blackwell 1977 bands at 1155 1 cm ii are typical for vibrations of glucosidic ring structures of long change polysaccharides wagner et al 2009 berg et al 2002 shoulder bands between 1400 1420 1 cm iii are typical for coo 1 cm blackwell 1977 while at 1510 1 cm strong c c stretching modes are allocated ivleva et al 2009 a c c stretch is also detectable around 855 899 1 cm and corresponds to a non compound specific covalent bond between two carbon atoms and can constitute the backbone of a long chain polysaccharide or a peptide compound blackwell 1977 berg et al 2002 the intensity of the specific raman shifts is viewed with respect to the base line back ground signal to the maximum of the peak biofilms grown under the nutrient enriched and p limiting conditions show higher organic signal intensities at i 1000 1 cm ii 1155 1 cm and iii 1510 1 cm compared to the enriched biofilms and n limiting biofilms the distribution of bands a b and c varied in space on the micro scale for each biofilm grown under different nutrient conditions under p limiting conditions raman intensity was homogeneous distributed in space compared to nutrient enriched and n limiting conditions overall the 2d raman microscope confirmed results from colorimetric assays e g the significantly higher polysaccharide content of the biofilms grown under p limitations 4 discussion 4 1 distinct biofilm physical structures have a characteristic hydraulic resistance our study links physical structure of membrane biofilms to hydraulic resistance under p limiting conditions biofilms formed dense uniform physical structures with low permeability as indicated by a high hydraulic resistance fig 3 under the nutrient enriched and n limiting conditions biofilms were characterised by low density values and in turn by low hydraulic resistances the nutrient enriched biofilm was thicker and had a higher hydraulic resistance compared to biofilms formed under the n limiting condition despite both having a similar heterogeneous morphology thus it is proposed that the passage length thickness can greatly influence hydraulic resistance in biofilms with a comparable morphology heterogeneity using hagen poiseuille s law for laminar flow through a biofilm one can evaluate the respective influence of biofilm thickness and to an extent porosity on permeation through the biofilm j vrouwenvelder et al 2016 hagen poiseuille s law relates the mean velocity through a cylindrical pore to the trans membrane pressure applied over the length of the pore tmp the length lf and the diameter of the pore dp 2 for a given dynamic viscosity μ from the hagen poiseuille equation the flux can be calculated considering the total cross sectional area of the pores ap relative to the total membrane area am 6 j tmp d p 2 32 μ l f a p a m as can be seen from eq 6 the flux is related to the inverse of the thickness of the pore but increases with the square of its diameter and total cross sectional area of the pores per membrane surface thus larger and more pores significantly increase the flux and decrease the hydraulic resistance conversely p limiting biofilms had a hydraulic resistance several orders of magnitude higher than the n limiting biofilm despite having a comparable thickness we suggest the higher hydraulic resistance of biofilms formed under p limiting conditions compared to the nutrient enriched and n limiting condition is due to a lower porosity this hypothesis is supported by comparison of biofilms density biofilms grown under p limiting conditions had a significantly higher density than those formed under nutrient enriched and n limiting conditions respectively given passage length of the nutrient enriched biofilm is greater we conclude that the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms has greater dependency on density than biofilm thickness 4 2 linking eps chemical composition to biofilm physical structure for all biofilms increasing eps mass positively correlated with increasing hydraulic resistance this observation is comparable to the findings of derlon et al 2016 therein cake layer structures with greater concentrations of eps rather than cell mass had a higher hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 however in the current study p limiting biofilms had a higher hydraulic resistance than nutrient enriched conditions despite having similar concentrations of eps after 20 days of growth figs 2a b and 4e d we suggest eps composition is linked to the biofilms physical structure and in turn its hydraulic resistance eps produced under p limiting conditions contained statistically higher concentrations of polysaccharides and edna and accumulated into dense homogeneous physical structures fig 6b homogeneous biofilm structures with high concentrations of polysaccharides and edna were characterised by a raman spectra indicative of c o c groups carboxyl groups coo and o p2 dna backbone homogeneously distributed in space fig 6a and c such functional groups are molecular fingerprints of anionic polysaccharides and dna biopolymers sutherland 2001a b we suggest the formation of a homogeneous physical structure is linked to a high content in the functional groups capable of strong intermolecular interaction and their homogeneous spatial distribution this is based on the fact that the c o c groups detected at 1155 1 cm are for example implicated in glycosidic bond formation a form of strong covalent interaction which can link polysaccharide molecules to another saccharide groups e g α 1 4 glycosidic bond 335 kj mol berg et al 2002 hibben 1936 the presence of c o c groups is also indicative of nitrogen carbon linkage between the 9 nitrogen of purine bases and the 1 carbon of the sugar group in dna berg et al 2002 carboxyl groups coo detected at 1510 1 cm can also provide additional electrostatic interactions between neighbouring negatively charged polymers via a divalent cation intermediary such as ca2 mayer et al 1999 laue et al 2006 the resulting salt bridge can link two negatively charged residues via hydrogen bond formation 10 30 kj mol to form an array of repeating polymeric blocks termed an egg box configuration lewandowski and beyenal 2013 such interactions can form uniform packing structures and homogeneous physical structures which are typical of alginate gel layers giraudier et al 2004 o neill et al 1983 similarly the negatively charged dna backbone o p2 identifiable at 1095 1 cm can also interact with the divalent inorganics again bridging and stabilising neighbouring anionic polymers to form a uniform cross linked matrix of interacting polymers böckelmann et al 2006 peterson et al 2013 in the current study higher concentrations of polysaccharide and edna did in fact coincide with a strong signal intensity for carboxylic and o p2 functional groups which were homogeneously distributed in space forming a densely packed meso scale physical structure reduced secretion of polysaccharides and edna or their degradation by catabolic enzymatic activity has also been reported to lead to the formation of dispersed heterogeneous biofilm structures albeit in simple biofilm colonies ma et al 2006 laue et al 2006 o neill et al 1983 ahimou et al 2007 boyd and chakrabarty 1995 in our study lower concentrations of polysaccharides and edna coincided with greater heterogeneity in functional group distribution and in the formation of a heterogeneous physical structures we propose the high concentrations of polysaccharides and edna favour close range electrostatic interactions leading to the formation of a homogeneous physical structures of low permeability at lower concentrations functional groups are heterogeneously distributed in space limiting potential for electrostatic interactions imperative for the formation of an otherwise dense homogeneous structure the scientific implication of the presented work links in situ functional group composition and distribution to the formation of a specific meso scale physical structure without alteration to its nascent composition or physical structure this has allowed greater insight into the form e g chemical structural and function hydraulic permeability of microbial biofilms with practical relevance for the performance of membrane filtration systems 4 3 practical considerations in the current study growth conditions in terms of nutrient limitations impacted cellular activity concentration and composition of extracellular polymeric substances as well as the biofilm structure and hydraulic resistance the influence of the feed water composition on biofilm hydraulic resistance has been reported for different types of filtration systems in the case of bio filters nutrient enrichment by low level phosphorus supplementation can also enhance the hydraulic performance decreasing head loss by 15 due to the formation of heterogeneous biofilm structures lauderdale et al 2012 in our study nutrient enriched conditions allowed the formation of a permeable biofilm with a stable hydraulic resistance this was linked to the formation of open heterogeneous biofilm structures fig 3 in membrane filtration systems operated under cross flow conditions vrouwenvelder et al 2010 observed that p limiting regimes can limit biofilm formation over a period of 4 days therein it is suggested p limiting conditions restricts cellular activity and in turn biofilm growth vrouwenvelder et al 2010 the difference between our observations increased eps and hydraulic resistance under p limitations and the observations of vrouwenvelder et al 2010 may be attributed to the different time scales 30 vs 4 d or to the different filtration modes dead end vs cross flow in our study during the first 4 days with p limitation conditions cellular growth eps production and hydraulic resistance were in fact lower compared to nutrient enriched conditions long term application of p limiting conditions led to greater accumulation of eps thereby increasing hydraulic resistance this is in agreement with previous authors who report p limitation can enhance biofilm formation in mono species biofilm models danhorn et al 2004 rüberg et al 1999 danhorn et al 2004 demonstrate p limitation can enhance biofilm formation in mono species biofilms through the phor phob regulatory system exopolysaccharide production by s meliloti is also regulated through the phob response regulator which activates production of galactoglucan eps ii under phosphate limitation by direct activation of the exp gene in a pathway akin to the bacterial stringent stress response rüberg et al 1999 boutte and crosson 2013 for polymicrobial biofilms exemplified in the current study the reasons for increased eps production under p limiting conditions are yet to be investigated supporting literature describing the impact of nutrient limitations on biofilm structure could not be found the practical implication of the presented work demonstrates that restricting microbial activity by p limitation does not stop biofilm accumulation and can lead to its exacerbation due to over production of eps this challenges the explanation of vrouwenvelder et al 2010 who suggests p limitation can limit biofilm accumulation by reducing cell proliferation and thereby restrict biofouling we demonstrate p limitation can reduce cell growth but can simultaneously increase accumulation of eps responsible for the formation of a dense biofilm structure with a high hydraulic resistance 5 conclusions growth conditions in terms of nutrient limitations determine chemical composition of the extracellular polymeric substances in membrane biofilms and in turn the biofilms physical structure and its hydraulic resistance biofilms with a high polysaccharide and edna content p limiting conditions formed dense homogeneous structures with high hydraulic resistance the biochemical composition of homogeneous biofilm structures was characterised by a high content in functional groups capable of strong covalent and hydrogen bond formation c o c groups carboxyl groups coo and o p2 dna backbone biofilms with low polysaccharide and edna content nutrient enriched and n limiting conditions formed thick heterogeneous structures imperative for low hydraulic resistance the biochemical composition of those heterogeneous physical structures was characterised by lower abundance of functional groups capable of strong covalent and hydrogen bond formation for

19755,the effect of extracellular polymeric substances eps on the meso scale physical structure and hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms during gravity driven membrane gdm filtration was investigated biofilms were developed on the surface of ultrafiltration membranes during dead end filtration at ultra low pressure 70 mbar biofilm eps composition total protein polysaccharide and edna was manipulated by growing biofilms under contrasting nutrient conditions nutrient conditions consisted of i a nutrient enriched condition with a nutrient ratio of 100 30 10 c n p ii a phosphorus limitation c n p ratio 100 30 0 and iii a nitrogen limitation c n p ratio 100 0 10 the structure of the biofilm was characterised at meso scale using optical coherence tomography oct biofilm composition was analysed with respect to total organic carbon total cellular mass and extracellular concentrations of proteins polysaccharides and edna 2d confocal raman mapping was used to characterise the functional group composition and micro scale distribution of the biofilms eps our study reveals that the composition of the eps matrix can determine the meso scale physical structure of membrane biofilms and in turn its hydraulic resistance biofilms grown under p limiting conditions were characterised by dense and homogeneous physical structures with high concentrations of polysaccharides and edna biofilm grown under nutrient enriched or n limiting conditions were characterised by heterogeneous physical structures with lower concentrations of polysaccharides and edna for p limiting biofilms 2d confocal raman microscopy revealed a homogeneous spatial distribution of anionic functional groups in homogeneous biofilm structures with higher polysaccharide and edna concentrations this study links eps composition physical structure and hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms with practical relevance for the hydraulic performances of gdm ultrafiltration graphical abstract image 1 keywords gravity driven membrane filtration gdm ultrafiltration biofilm hydraulic resistance physical structure eps 1 introduction the microbial biofilm is akin to a semi permeable polymeric gel wilking et al 2011 the microbial cells embedded in their surrounding matrix of extracellular polymeric substances eps collectively form a semi solid structure which can impede perpendicular flow during membrane ultrafiltration vrouwenvelder et al 2016 from an engineering perspective the hydraulic resistance imposed by the biofilm is problematic for membrane filtration systems causing a decline in permeate flux production gravity driven membrane gdm ultrafiltration however tolerates biofilm development on the membrane surface for the benefit of minimal maintenance stable flux and improved permeate quality peter varbanets et al 2010 2011 stable but low permeate flux values are reported in gdm filters depending of the type of feed water 5 15 l m2 h peter varbanets et al 2010 thus for successful implementation reducing the hydraulic resistance of the biofilm for effective flux recovery whilst simultaneously tolerating its presence for stable flux production will be imperative towards this goal a fundamental understanding of the influencing factors that govern the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms is required for efficient hydraulic operation of gdm filtration systems extracellular polymeric substances eps are a proposed determinant of biofilm hydraulic resistance dreszer et al 2013 relatively little hydraulic resistance can be attributed to the embedded microbial cells or inorganic particles dreszer et al 2013 derlon et al 2016 a comparison of hydraulic resistance profiles from intact biofilms bacterial cake layers and model fouling layers revealed that fouling layers with a greater eps content had a greater hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 however it is not known how the biofilms eps and their associated physical structures can directly influence hydraulic transport through the biofilm dreszer et al 2014 valladares linares et al 2015 dreszer et al 2013 suggested eps can limit convective transport through biofilms by providing friction to the permeating water molecules valladares linares et al 2015 support this claim when compacting the biofilms physical structure and evaluating the compacted biofilms hydraulic resistance compaction is proposed to increase the density of eps which could lead to higher hydraulic resistances on the assumption a higher eps density can reduce the volume between neighbouring eps molecules limiting hydraulic flow valladares linares et al 2015 vrouwenvelder et al 2016 united such observations in a theoretical model based on the hagen poiseuille law which describes hydraulic transport through a channel or pipe the hydraulic resistance imposed by the biofilm is thought to be dependent on the biofilms internal architecture specifically the geometry between the strands of eps vrouwenvelder et al 2016 this theory assumes that volume between the eps molecules can act as conduits capable of hydraulic transport during forced water passage numerically it was demonstrated that reducing the diameter between eps molecules can restrict water passage through the channel thus increasing resistance to flow during forced water passage vrouwenvelder et al 2016 this is in fact analogous to the darcian models of tiller and kwon 1998 who describe fluid flow through a cake layer of particles therein the authors assume uniform particle size and charge unlike a layer of inert particles biofilm eps is composed of proteins polysaccharides extracellular dna edna and to a lesser extent lipids flemming and wingender 2010 the secretion of specific eps classes is self regulated based on environmental stimuli shear nutrient status flemming and wingender 2010 danhorn et al 2004 vrouwenvelder et al 2010 such biopolymers are capable of electrostatic and functional interactions in pure culture studies changes to the composition of eps can alter the biofilms physical structure ma et al 2006 mayer et al 1999 it is thus plausible that specific compositions of eps could influence the physical structure of membrane biofilms e g its internal architecture pores channels and in turn permeation through such structures during membrane filtration the production of extracellular polysaccharides by the biofilm is associated with a lower flux production chang and halverson 2003 chen and stewart 2002 herzberg et al 2009 however whether the production of specific eps molecules by membrane biofilms leads to the formation of specific physical structures with preferential flow paths remains unknown the uncertainty of whether specific eps molecules can assemble into distinct physical structures which may help or hinder hydraulic transport is compounded by the fact that analysis of physical structures usually occurs at the micro scale via confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm it is argued that clsm reduces the overall detail of the biofilms physical structure and related functions e g permeability due its measurement range in

function relationships such as the influence of overall thickness internal porosity and surface topology roughness on water passage through the biofilm wagner et al 2010 martin et al 2014 fortunato et al 2017 for in situ chemical characterisation 2d confocal raman microscopy is a non invasive technique used for characterisation of functional groups and their distribution within a sample raman 1930 ivleva et al 2009 sijtsema et al 1998 raman microscopy has been demonstrated to provide accurate chemical information of intact microbial aggregates e g flocs the utility of 2d confocal raman mapping in providing localised chemical analysis of eps of intact membrane biofilms is unknown ivleva et al 2009 blackwell 1977 wagner et al 2009 by relating the accumulation of specific eps composition to the meso scale physical structure of the biofilm one may better ascertain how the chemical composition of the eps can influence the physical structure and ultimately the hydraulic resistance of the biofilm the goal of this study is to understand i whether different compositions of the eps in terms of protein polysaccharide and edna concentration can influence the biofilm physical structure and ii how resulting structures influence the hydraulic resistance of a biofilm during gdm ultrafiltration we hypothesized the hydraulic resistance of the biofilm is dependent on the chemical composition of the eps whereby differences in eps molecules will lead to the formation of distinct physical structures which have different hydraulic resistances to investigate this hypothesis different biofilms were grown during gdm filtration on membrane surface limiting nutrient conditions n and p limitations were used to produce biofilms of different eps concentrations and compositions danhorn et al 2004 chen and stewart 2002 oct analysis was performed to study the effect of eps accumulation on biofilms meso scale physical structure and ultimately on the biofilms hydraulic resistance the biofilm composition was analysed with respect to total mass extracellular polysaccharide protein and edna concentrations results from colorimetric assays were confirmed by conducting 2d confocal raman microscopy characterisations of the different types of biofilms 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental setup membrane fouling simulators mfs were operated as gdm membrane filtration systems in dead end mode at a constant transmembrane pressure of 70 mbar fig 1 for each mfs synthetic feed water was pumped into the system with a peristaltic pump ism932a ismatec glattbrugg switzerland at a rate ensuring that permeation was solely gravity driven the system was connected to overhead tanks with overflows through which excess water could leave the system in that way a constant water head of 70

consisting of a negative control nanopure water positive growth condition nutrient enriched a phosphorous limiting and nitrogen limiting conditions were run in parallel three experimental runs were performed for a duration of 30 days in order to assess the reproducibility of our observations a total of ca 20 28 flow cells was used per run duplicate measurements were performed for each time point

used as the negative control p and n limitations were imposed to produce a biofilm with distinct eps composition and anticipated different physical structures danhorn et al 2004 liu et al 2006 ras et al 2011 nutrient limitation was used only as an experimental tool to grow biofilms of different physical structures and eps compositions essential trace elements were supplemented to the feed water along with edta to ensure trace elements did not precipitate hammes and egli 2005 an overview of the four different nutrient conditions are given in table 1 organic carbon concentrations are within a range typically expected for drinking water 2 2 3 bacteria cultivation and membrane mfs inoculation bacteria for mfs inoculation were cultivated from the chriesbach river dübendorf switzerland 47 24 16 3 n 8 36 31 8 e during spring time river water was collected in a sterile beaker sealed and immediately filtered through a 0 45 μm syringe filter to remove higher organisms this was confirmed by visual examination of the filtrate under stereomicroscope 10 ml of filtrate was added to 90 ml of sterile nutrient solution containing 50 mg c l and corresponding p and n concentrations under a laminar flow hood the nutrient filtrate suspension was placed in an orbital incubator for 30 c with a rocking speed of 220 rpm for 24 h this procedure was repeated 3 times to condition bacteria to the synthetic substrate bacterial suspension was analysed under stereomicroscope to ensure absence of higher organisms after incubation bacterial cell number was quantified by atp measurement as described by hammes et al 2010 1 2 1010 cells ml measured thereafter the 1 5 ml aliquots were taken and distributed into 2 ml eppendorf tubes containing 0 5 ml of 30 glycerol as a cryo protectant bacterial glycerol stocks were snap frozen with liquid nitrogen and stored at 80 c until use to regenerate the bacteria from frozen stock 2 ml of the bacteria glycerol stock was taken and inoculated into 100 ml of sterile nutrient containing 50 mg c l with corresponding p and n concentrations in a ratio of 100 30 10 c n p under a laminar flow hood suspension was incubated for 18 24 h at 30 c as defined in previous steps for inoculation of the mfs microbial suspension was centrifuged for 15 min at 5000 rpm unicen mr herolab germany the supernatant was decanted allowing resuspension of the cell pellet in 30 ml 0 1 m nacl yielding a final concentration of 1 5 1010 cells ml as determined by atp assay from the resulting bacterial solution 2 5 ml was injected into each mfs the spiked mfs was let settle for 18 24 h to allow filtration of bacterial solution allowing known cell coverage over the membrane area this resulted in a surface coverage of 2 1013 cells m2 as determined from atp assay 2 2 4 hydraulic parameters permeate flux and hydraulic resistances were derived from the mass of collected permeate the mass of permeate was recorded daily the volume of permeate was determined by dividing the permeate mass by the density of water 1000 kg m3 the following equations were used for the calculations of the permeate flux j l m2 h 1 j δ v a δ t where δv is the change in permeate volume l a is

scale gradient analysis 2 image binarization automatic threshold selection 3 calculating physical properties of the biofilm mean biofilm thickness z in μm 2 2 6 biofilm harvesting biofilms were removed from the mfs for chemical analysis at each time point biofilms were scraped from the membrane surface via a cell scrapper and transferred into sterile glass beakers a volume of 30 ml 0 1 m nacl solution was used to rinse the remaining biofilm from the membrane and mfs surface the collected biomass was re suspended in the washings of the 30 ml 0 1 m nacl solution toc remaining following removal of biomass is similar to the one of a virgin membrane indicating that no left biofilm remained on the scrapped membrane thus verifying removal of available biomass from the membranes surface 2 2 7 eps extraction eps were separated from cells through physical extraction the approach consisted of sonication homogenisation phase and centrifugation separation phase steps respectively sole physical extraction was selected over existing chemical methods to limit contamination of sample fractions due to sensitivity of subsequent analytical methods different extraction tests were performed to maximize eps extraction while avoiding cell lysis detected through soluble atp measurement the harvested biofilm suspensions were placed in an ice bath and sonicated for 120 s with 10 s rest intervals using a needle sonicator sonoplus hd 3200 bandelin berlin germany this was repeated three times to ensure full extraction of the biofilms eps thereafter homogenised samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm at 20 c for 15 min unicen mr herolab germany to separate the eps from the cells centrifugation was repeated to ensure full separation the supernatant containing the soluble eps was decanted from the resolved cell pellet and aliquots were obtained from the extracellular fraction for measurement of total organic carbon toc toc l shimadzu japan and eps analysis polysaccharide

performed on an upright confocal raman microscope with a wavelength of 532 nm and a 50x ultra long working distance objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0 55 ntegra spectra provides two separate detection channels one for acquiring the laser confocal rayleigh signal and the second for simultaneous but independent collection of the raman map that reveals the local chemical composition

data set analysed provided in supplementary information si 3 results 3 1 permeate flux and hydraulic resistance 3 1 1 permeate flux the change in the mean flux of each experimental condition was monitored for 30 days for 3 separate experimental runs to determine experimental reproducibility fig 2 a c flux stabilisation occurred only under nutrient enriched fig 2a and n limiting fig 2c conditions but not for p limiting condition fig 2b which decreased up to the experimental endpoint this was standard for all three experimental runs under n limiting conditions flux stabilisation was the higher producing an average flux production of 10 1 2 l m2 h n 12 mfs between day 19 30 compared to an average stable flux of 4 5 2 7 l m2 h n 12 mfs for the nutrient enriched condition permeate flux production for p limiting condition however declined continuously to 1 60 0 7 l m2 h n 12 mfs up to 30 days 3 1 2 biofilm hydraulic resistance the biofilms hydraulic resistance was derived from mean flux values monitored for 30 days repeated for three separate experimental runs fig 2d f hydraulic resistance for the biofilms formed under the p limiting condition fig 2e increased over time reaching 1 26 1012 2 07 1011 1 m n 12 mfs after 30 days of growth conversely the hydraulic resistance of biofilms formed under the nutrient enriched condition fig 2d increased to an average of 3 78

under the n limiting condition fig 2f had a lower hydraulic resistance of 2 25 1011 1 m after 30 days of growth compared to p limiting and nutrient enriched conditions respectively 3 2 biofilm physical structure 3 2 1 biofilm morphology visual observations at the meso scale revealed a time dependent accumulation of biomass on the surface of membranes fig 3 contrasting growth conditions produced biofilms with different physical structures at meso scale associated with different hydraulic resistances biofilms grown under nutrient enriched conditions had a heterogeneous morphology n 50 meanwhile the biofilm of the p limiting growth condition had a largely homogenous morphology n 50 the biofilm grown under the n limiting condition formed a thin and heterogeneous structure n 30 visual observations of the biofilms suggest hydraulic resistance is linked to the biofilms meso scale structure biofilms with homogenous morphologies had very high hydraulic resistances conversely heterogeneous biofilm morphologies were associated with significantly lower hydraulic resistances biofilms formed under the nutrient enriched condition while also being heterogeneous had a higher hydraulic resistance than the biofilm of the n limiting condition 3 2 2 quantification of biofilm morphology morphological observations at the meso scale were supported by quantification of mean biofilm thickness based on oct image analysis as described in section 2 2 5 the thickness of the nutrient enriched biofilm fig 4 a increased over time achieving an average thickness of 803 70 μm n 37 locations after 30 days of growth the biofilm of the p limiting fig 4b and n limiting fig 4c conditions were thinner achieving respective thickness of 251 18 μm n 17 locations and 214 37 μm n 30 locations after 30 days of growth the thickness of the enriched nutrient film was significantly higher than the thickness of both the p and n limiting biofilms with a p value of 3e 04 and 4e 05 respectively increase in thickness of the nutrient enriched biofilm had a limited impact on its hydraulic resistance the homogenous p limiting biofilm had a higher hydraulic resistance compared to the thicker biofilm of the nutrient enriched despite being thinner biofilms formed under the n limiting condition were thinner than the biofilm of the nutrient enriched and had a lower hydraulic resistance indicating passage length may influence the hydraulic resistance of biofilms with similar morphological distributions of biomass 3 3 biofilm accumulation 3 3 1 biomass accumulation during the first 7 days of operation the nutrient enriched condition fig 4d yielded an average toc of 463 15 mg c m2 n 4 compared to 312 8 mg c m2 n 4 and 206 1 12 mg c m2 n 5 of p fig 4e and n limiting conditions fig 4f as the biofilms matured onwards of 7 days higher concentrations of biomass in terms of toc were measured for the p limiting condition yielding a final concentration of 1006 32 mg c m2 n 4 after 30 days of growth compared to 760 40 mg c m2 n 6 and 400 80 mg c m2 n 4 for enriched and n limiting growth conditions after 30 days of growth respectively data analysis indicated that the mass of the enriched nutrient and p limited biofilms are similar null hypothesis not rejected p value of 0 7 while the mass of the n limited biofilm is significantly lower than the one of the enriched nutrient biofilms null hypothesis rejected with a p value of 0 009 3 3 2 biofilm density as the biofilms matured the biofilm formed under the p limiting condition had a higher density of 3 0 22 kg c m3 n 2 compared to densities of 0 9 0 198 kg c m3 and 1 5 0 27 kg c m3 for the nutrient enriched and n limiting conditions respectively after 30 days of growth 3 3 3 biofilm activity as biofilms matured biofilms formed under nutrient enriched conditions had higher active cell mass compared to p and n limiting conditions respectively in all experimental runs biofilms formed under nutrient enriched conditions contained 7 9 10 7 5 410 7 mol of atp m2 n 3 after 30 days of biofilm growth this corresponded to 3 9 1011 2 8 10 active cells m2 assuming 2 10 18 mol of atp per unit cell biofilms formed under p and n limiting conditions contained 7 10 8 1 9 10 8 mol of atp m2 n 3 and 2 4 10 8 6 3 10 09 mol of atp m2 n 3 respectively this corresponded to 3 5 1010 9 6 109 n 3 and 1 2 1010 3 1 109 active cells m2 assuming 2 10 18 mol of atp per unit cell for biofilms formed under p and n limiting conditions respectively this indicates lower cellular activity in biofilm grown under nutrient limiting conditions 3 4 eps concentration 3 4 1 protein concentration extracellular protein concentration increased in all biofilms during 30 days of growth fig 5 biofilms formed under nutrient enriched fig 5a conditions yielded 461 8 2 mg c m2 n 5 after 30 days of growth compared to 186 6 37 mg c m2 n 5 and 198 1 67 mg c m2 n 2 for p fig 5b and n limiting fig 5c conditions respectively statistical analysis indicated that the null hypotheses similar protein concentrations in the p and n limiting biofilms compared to nutrient enriched biofilms can be rejected with p values of 0 0002 and 2e 05 respectively 3 4 2 polysaccharide concentration during early biofilm development up to 7 days biofilms formed under the nutrient enriched conditions fig 5d yielded 188 5 mg c m2 n 4 compared to 306 23 mg c m2 n 4 yielded under p fig 5e and n limiting fig 5f conditions respectively after 30 days of biofilm growth biofilms formed under p limiting conditions fig 5e yielded 1006 32 48 mg c m2 n 5 compared to 188 2 94 mg c m2 n 4 and 110 30 mg c m2 n 5 for nutrient enriched fig 5d and n limiting fig 5f conditions respectively the accumulation of polysaccharides in the p limiting biofilms was statistically higher than in the nutrient enriched biofilms null hypothesis i e similar polysaccharide concentrations in the p limiting and enriched biofilms was rejected with p value of 3e 08 the accumulation of polysaccharides in the n limiting biofilms compared to the nutrient enriched biofilms was also statistically significant null hypothesis i e similar polysaccharide concentrations in

of the p limited biofilm was statistically different than in the nutrient enriched biofilms null hypotheses i e similar edna concentrations in the p and n limiting biofilms compared to the enriched biofilms were rejected with p values of 4e 05 the edna content of the n limited biofilm was different from the ones of the enriched nutrient biofilms p value of 0 025 3 4 4 in situ 2d confocal raman microscopy of membrane biofilms in situ 2d confocal raman microscopy was performed to characterise the functional group profile of biofilms with different meso scale physical structures to better understand the link between polymer composition and biofilm physical structure fig 6 illustrates the raman spectra of nutrient enriched p and n limiting conditions for all conditions the spectra show 3 identical bands with different strengths of intensity depending on the biofilm growth condition at i 1000 1 cm ii 1155 1 cm and iii 1510 1 cm the assignment of raman bands is based on reference samples for polymicrobial biofilms validated with surrogate substances ivleva et al 2009 blackwell 1977 wagner et al 2009 the band at approximately 1000 1 cm i corresponds to o p2 the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the dna rna molecule ivleva et al 2009 blackwell 1977 bands at 1155 1 cm ii are typical for vibrations of glucosidic ring structures of long change polysaccharides wagner et al 2009 berg et al 2002 shoulder bands between 1400 1420 1 cm iii are typical for coo 1 cm blackwell 1977 while at 1510 1 cm strong c c stretching modes are allocated ivleva et al 2009 a c c stretch is also detectable around 855 899 1 cm and corresponds to a non compound specific covalent bond between two carbon atoms and can constitute the backbone of a long chain polysaccharide or a peptide compound blackwell 1977 berg et al 2002 the intensity of the specific raman shifts is viewed with respect to the base line back ground signal to the maximum of the peak biofilms grown under the nutrient enriched and p limiting conditions show higher organic signal intensities at i 1000 1 cm ii 1155 1 cm and iii 1510 1 cm compared to the enriched biofilms and n limiting biofilms the distribution of bands a b and c varied in space on the micro scale for each biofilm grown under different nutrient conditions under p limiting conditions raman intensity was homogeneous distributed in space compared to nutrient enriched and n limiting conditions overall the 2d raman microscope confirmed results from colorimetric assays e g the significantly higher polysaccharide content of the biofilms grown under p limitations 4 discussion 4 1 distinct biofilm physical structures have a characteristic hydraulic resistance our study links physical structure of membrane biofilms to hydraulic resistance under p limiting conditions biofilms formed dense uniform physical structures with low permeability as indicated by a high hydraulic resistance fig 3 under the nutrient enriched and n limiting conditions biofilms were characterised by low density values and in turn by low hydraulic resistances the nutrient enriched biofilm was thicker and had a higher hydraulic resistance compared to biofilms formed under the n limiting condition despite both having a similar heterogeneous morphology thus it is proposed that the passage length thickness can greatly influence hydraulic resistance in biofilms with a comparable morphology heterogeneity using hagen poiseuille s law for laminar flow through a biofilm one can evaluate the respective influence of biofilm thickness and to an extent porosity on permeation through the biofilm j vrouwenvelder et al 2016 hagen poiseuille s law relates the mean velocity through a cylindrical pore to the trans membrane pressure applied over the length of the pore tmp the length lf and the diameter of the pore dp 2 for a given dynamic viscosity μ from the hagen poiseuille equation the flux can be calculated considering the total cross sectional area of the pores ap relative to the total membrane area am 6 j tmp d p 2 32 μ l f a p a m as can be seen from eq 6 the flux is related to the inverse of the thickness of the pore but increases with the square of its diameter and total cross sectional area of the pores per membrane surface thus larger and more pores significantly increase the flux and decrease the hydraulic resistance conversely p limiting biofilms had a hydraulic resistance several orders of magnitude higher than the n limiting biofilm despite having a comparable thickness we suggest the higher hydraulic resistance of biofilms formed under p limiting conditions compared to the nutrient enriched and n limiting condition is due to a lower porosity this hypothesis is supported by comparison of biofilms density biofilms grown under p limiting conditions had a significantly higher density than those formed under nutrient enriched and n limiting conditions respectively given passage length of the nutrient enriched biofilm is greater we conclude that the hydraulic resistance of membrane biofilms has greater dependency on density than biofilm thickness 4 2 linking eps chemical composition to biofilm physical structure for all biofilms increasing eps mass positively correlated with increasing hydraulic resistance this observation is comparable to the findings of derlon et al 2016 therein cake layer structures with greater concentrations of eps rather than cell mass had a higher hydraulic resistance derlon et al 2016 however in the current study p limiting biofilms had a higher hydraulic resistance than nutrient enriched conditions despite having similar concentrations of eps after 20 days of growth figs 2a b and 4e d we suggest eps composition is linked to the biofilms physical structure and in turn its hydraulic resistance eps produced under p limiting conditions contained statistically higher concentrations of polysaccharides and edna and accumulated into dense homogeneous physical structures fig 6b homogeneous biofilm structures with high concentrations of polysaccharides and edna were characterised by a raman spectra indicative of c o c groups carboxyl groups coo and o p2 dna backbone homogeneously distributed in space fig 6a and c such functional groups are molecular fingerprints of anionic polysaccharides and dna biopolymers sutherland 2001a b we suggest the formation of a homogeneous physical structure is linked to a high content in the functional groups capable of strong intermolecular interaction and their homogeneous spatial distribution this is based on the fact that the c o c groups detected at 1155 1 cm are for example implicated in glycosidic bond formation a form of strong covalent interaction which can link polysaccharide molecules to another saccharide groups e g α 1 4 glycosidic bond 335 kj mol berg et al 2002 hibben 1936 the presence of c o c groups is also indicative of nitrogen carbon linkage between the 9 nitrogen of purine bases and the 1 carbon of the sugar group in dna berg et al 2002 carboxyl groups coo detected at 1510 1 cm can also provide additional electrostatic interactions between neighbouring negatively charged polymers via a divalent cation intermediary such as ca2 mayer et al 1999 laue et al 2006 the resulting salt bridge can link two negatively charged residues via hydrogen bond formation 10 30 kj mol to form an array of repeating polymeric blocks termed an egg box configuration lewandowski and beyenal 2013 such interactions can form uniform packing structures and homogeneous physical structures which are typical of alginate gel layers giraudier et al 2004 o neill et al 1983 similarly the negatively charged dna backbone o p2 identifiable at 1095 1 cm can also interact with the divalent inorganics again bridging and stabilising neighbouring anionic polymers to form a uniform cross linked matrix of interacting polymers böckelmann et al 2006 peterson et al 2013 in the current study higher concentrations of polysaccharide and edna did in fact coincide with a strong signal intensity for carboxylic and o p2 functional groups which were homogeneously distributed in space forming a densely packed meso scale physical structure reduced secretion of polysaccharides and edna or their degradation by catabolic enzymatic activity has also been reported to lead to the formation of dispersed heterogeneous biofilm structures albeit in simple biofilm colonies ma et al 2006 laue et al 2006 o neill et al 1983 ahimou et al 2007 boyd and chakrabarty 1995 in our study lower concentrations of polysaccharides and edna coincided with greater heterogeneity in functional group distribution and in the formation of a heterogeneous physical structures we propose the high concentrations of polysaccharides and edna favour close range electrostatic interactions leading to the formation of a homogeneous physical structures of low permeability at lower concentrations functional groups are heterogeneously distributed in space limiting potential for electrostatic interactions imperative for the formation of an otherwise dense homogeneous structure the scientific implication of the presented work links in situ functional group composition and distribution to the formation of a specific meso scale physical structure without alteration to its nascent composition or physical structure this has allowed greater insight into the form e g chemical structural and function hydraulic permeability of microbial biofilms with practical relevance for the performance of membrane filtration systems 4 3 practical considerations in the current study growth conditions in terms of nutrient limitations impacted cellular activity concentration and composition of extracellular polymeric substances as well as the biofilm structure and hydraulic resistance the influence of the feed water composition on biofilm hydraulic resistance has been reported for different types of filtration systems in the case of bio filters nutrient enrichment by low level phosphorus supplementation can also enhance the hydraulic performance decreasing head loss by 15 due to the formation of heterogeneous biofilm structures lauderdale et al 2012 in our study nutrient enriched conditions allowed the formation of a permeable biofilm with a stable hydraulic resistance this was linked to the formation of open heterogeneous biofilm structures fig 3 in membrane filtration systems operated under cross flow conditions vrouwenvelder et al 2010 observed that p limiting regimes can limit biofilm formation over a period of 4 days therein it is suggested p limiting conditions restricts cellular activity and in turn biofilm growth vrouwenvelder et al 2010 the difference between our observations increased eps and hydraulic resistance under p limitations and the observations of vrouwenvelder et al 2010 may be attributed to the different time scales 30 vs 4 d or to the different filtration modes dead end vs cross flow in our study during the first 4 days with p limitation conditions cellular growth eps production and hydraulic resistance were in fact lower compared to nutrient enriched conditions long term application of p limiting conditions led to greater accumulation of eps thereby increasing hydraulic resistance this is in agreement with previous authors who report p limitation can enhance biofilm formation in mono species biofilm models danhorn et al 2004 rüberg et al 1999 danhorn et al 2004 demonstrate p limitation can enhance biofilm formation in mono species biofilms through the phor phob regulatory system exopolysaccharide production by s meliloti is also regulated through the phob response regulator which activates production of galactoglucan eps ii under phosphate limitation by direct activation of the exp gene in a pathway akin to the bacterial stringent stress response rüberg et al 1999 boutte and crosson 2013 for polymicrobial biofilms exemplified in the current study the reasons for increased eps production under p limiting conditions are yet to be investigated supporting literature describing the impact of nutrient limitations on biofilm structure could not be found the practical implication of the presented work demonstrates that restricting microbial activity by p limitation does not stop biofilm accumulation and can lead to its exacerbation due to over production of eps this challenges the explanation of vrouwenvelder et al 2010 who suggests p limitation can limit biofilm accumulation by reducing cell proliferation and thereby restrict biofouling we demonstrate p limitation can reduce cell growth but can simultaneously increase accumulation of eps responsible for the formation of a dense biofilm structure with a high hydraulic resistance 5 conclusions growth conditions in terms of nutrient limitations determine chemical composition of the extracellular polymeric substances in membrane biofilms and in turn the biofilms physical structure and its hydraulic resistance biofilms with a high polysaccharide and edna content p limiting conditions formed dense homogeneous structures with high hydraulic resistance the biochemical composition of homogeneous biofilm structures was characterised by a high content in functional groups capable of strong covalent and hydrogen bond formation c o c groups carboxyl groups coo and o p2 dna backbone biofilms with low polysaccharide and edna content nutrient enriched and n limiting conditions formed thick heterogeneous structures imperative for low hydraulic resistance the biochemical composition of those heterogeneous physical structures was characterised by lower abundance of functional groups capable of strong covalent and hydrogen bond formation for practice reducing microbial activity on the surface of the membrane by nutrient limitation does not necessarily prevent biofilm accumulation when developing biofilm control measures understanding the

19756,the presence of antibiotics in water bodies has received increasing attention since they are continuously introduced and detected in the environment and may cause unpredictable environmental hazards and risks the photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx by zno in the presence of fluoride ions f zno was evaluated the effects of operating parameters on the efficiency of smx removal were investigated by using response surface methodology rsm under the optimum condition i e photocatalyst dosage 1 48 g l ph 4 7 airflow rate 2 5 l min and the concentration of fluoride ions 2 505 mm about 97 smx removal was achieved by f zno after 30 min of reaction the mechanism of reactions cod removal efficiency and reaction kinetics were also investigated under optimum operating conditions in addition about 85 cod reduction was obtained after 90 min photocatalytic reaction the pseudo first order kinetics rate constants for the photodegradation of smx were found to be 0 099 0 058 and 0 048 min 1 by f zno zno and tio2 p25 respectively the figure of merit electrical energy per order e eo was used for estimating the electrical energy efficiency which was shown to be considerably lower than the energy consumption for the reported research on removal of smx by photocatalytic degradation under uv irradiation toxicity assays were conducted by measuring the inhibition percentage pi towards e coli bacteria strain and by agar well diffusion method the results showed that after 30 min of reaction the toxicity of the treated solutions by all photocatalysts fell within the non toxic range however the reduction in toxicity by f zno was faster than those by zno and p25 despite the positive effects of surface fluorination of zno on the smx and cod removal and reaction kinetics its lower stability compared to zno and p25 in the repeated experiments gave rise to some doubts about its performance from a practical point of view keywords toxicity sulfamethoxazole surface fluorination response surface methodology photocorrosion stability 1 introduction widespread detection of emerging contaminants ecs including many synthetic antimicrobial agents in water bodies is raising public health concerns even at sub therapeutic concentration levels beltran et al 2008 ryan et al 2011 although there is an ongoing debate about the risks posed by chronic exposure to trace concentrations of antimicrobials compounds recent studies have demonstrated adverse health effects caused by mixtures of ecs in the environment even at trace levels and enhancement of antibiotic resistance beltran et al 2008 sulfonamide antibacterial compounds such as sulfamethoxazole smx are the oldest group of antibiotics and they are widely prescribed to treat infectious and respiration diseases in human and veterinary medicine długosz et al 2015 li et al 2017 sulfonamide antibiotics show high excretion rates in the feces and urine either as parent compound or metabolites yang et al 2015 it is reported that conventional biological treatment processes are ineffective and or too slow to eliminate sulfonamides in water abellán et al 2007 thus it is not surprising that research has recently focused on utilizing advanced oxidation processes aops for the degradation of antibiotics in water photocatalytic oxidation pco is a promising aops for the removal of recalcitrant and or toxic compounds from water abellán et al 2007 kim and kan 2016 liu et al 2016 however most photocatalytic processes are complicated and difficult to use in water treatment operations because of high preparation and operating costs and relatively low photocatalytic efficiency li et al 2017 photocatalysts such as zno when illuminated by photons having an energy level that exceeds their band gap produce reactive species such as e h oh and o 2 which can participate in the elimination reactions of organic contaminants a list of complete reactions which may contribute to the photocatalytic process by zno can be found elsewhere mirzaei et al 2016 unfortunately the low quantum efficiency caused by the high recombination rate of the photo induced electron hole pairs leads to high energy consumption during the operation and greatly restricts the applications of photocatalytic removal processes liu et al 2012 shayegan et al 2018 so far numerous modifying strategies have been proposed for promoting the efficiency of photocatalysts li et al 2016 however most efforts have been focused on narrowing the band gap of photocatalyst by introducing dopant s into the structure of semiconductor in order to reduce the recombination rate and harvest visible instead of uv light from the thermodynamic viewpoint narrowing the band gap of semiconductor will lead to reducing the oxidation and reduction potential li et al 2016 therefore the incomplete degradation of ecs due to low redox potential may enhance the probability of toxic by products formation during the treatment by narrow band gap photocatalysts catalá et al 2015 improving the efficiency of wide band gap photocatalysts by alternative methods such as surface modification will not only promote the removal efficiencies without band gap engineering but may also improve the disinfection process by uvc λ max 254 nm and further reduce operating cost by process intensification cruz ortiz et al 2017 the photocatalytic activities of semiconductors are strongly related to their surface characteristics charge transfer recombination rate contaminant surface interactions and the type and amount of reactive oxygen species ros ryu et al 2017 surface modification of photocatalyst can alter the surface characteristics including polarity surface charge acidity adsorption capacities etc liu et al 2012 most current methods of surface modification use long chain fluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds pfcs mirzaei et al 2013 xing et al 2012 the use of pfcs is restricted because of their acute toxicity high bioaccumulative potential in biota and high cost bai et al 2016 mirzaei et al 2017a xing et al 2012 as an alternative surface fluorination by fluoride anions has become a popular method because this technique is simple to implement highly effective inexpensive and less bioaccumulative mirzaei et al 2017a ryu et al 2017 the enhancement of photocatalytic degradation efficiency of organic contaminants such as methylene blue kim et al 2010 n nitrosodimethylamine lee et al 2005 phenol park and choi 2004 wang et al 2007 acid orange 7 park and choi 2004 acid red 1 mrowetz and selli 2005 benzoic acid mrowetz and selli 2006 and cyanuric acid oh and jenks 2004 in the presence of f ions in aqueous tio2 suspensions has been reported although the higher removal efficiency of zno compared to tio2 under certain operating conditions is demonstrated in several studies elmolla and chaudhuri 2010 kansal et al 2007 mirzaei et al 2016 the surface fluorination of zno has not been reported the higher photocatalytic activity of fluorinated photocatalysts is related to the substantial changes in their surface characteristics such as surface charge polarity acidity and adsorption capacity liu et al 2012 on the other hand it is proven that the photostability of photocatalyst is heavily dependent on its surface properties chu et al 2009 however the effects of surface fluorination on the stability and reusability of photocatalysts has been rarely reported in the literature in this study response surface methodology rsm was used to optimize four process parameters namely catalyst loading fluoride ions concentration solution ph and airflow rate for maximum smx degradation possible mechanisms of photocatalytic degradation of smx as well as cod removal and reaction kinetics are investigated under the optimum operating conditions the effect of surface fluorination on photocorrosion of zno and reusability of f zno in consecutive experiments is also investigated in addition the figure of merit electrical energy per order e eo for photocatalysis process at the optimum operating condition is calculated and compared to the reported results of smx removal by pco under uv light irradiation since oxidation treatment processes may cause the formation of toxic by products the final stage of this research was devoted to the assessment of solution toxicity before and after the treatment 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals zinc oxide ammonium fluoride potassium iodide and tert butanol tba were purchased from fisher scientific on canada

reagent grade and were used as received without any further purification deionized milli q water 18 μs cm 1 was used to prepare the different solutions in this study 2 2 analytical procedures the concentration of zinc ion in the solution was measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer pinaacle 900f perkinelmer usa the variations of smx concentration were evaluated by the method reported by liu et al 2016 by using a uv vis spectrophotometer evolution 201 thermo scientific usa ultra low range cod 0 7 40 mg l digestion vials toxtrak toxicity assay kit and h2o2 titration kit were purchased all from hach co and used according to the manufacturer s methods the degree of removal for smx and cod was determined based on eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 r 1 c t c 0 100 2 y 1 c o d t c o d 0 100 where r and y are the degree of smx and cod removal respectively c t mm is the concentration smx at time t and c 0 mm is the initial concentration of smx 2 3 photocatalytic experiments the photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted in a 700 ml tubular stainless steel photoreactor working in slurry mode the light source was provided by a uvc lamp 10 w trojan technologies on canada the intensity of uvc radiation was 3 5 mj cm 2 measured by a radiometer trojan technologies on canada in all cases air was continuously bubbled into the solution mixture through a sparger located at the bottom of reactor to supply dissolved oxygen molecules and provide sufficient agitation the temperature of solution was maintained at 21 1 c using an external cooling jacket an external reservoir 300 ml was used in order to purge air from the reactor and to conduct sampling and further mixing of solution by stirring the schematic diagram of the photoreactor is depicted in fig 1 the solution ph was adjusted at the required value by 0 1 n hcl or 0 1 n naoh before illumination the solutions were circulated for 30 min in dark to reach the adsorption desorption equilibrium between photocatalysts smx and fluoride ions at given time intervals a 10 ml sample of the solution was withdrawn from the reactor and the photocatalyst particles were removed by 0 22 μm filter minisart germany for the ensuing analyses 2 4 experimental design and optimization in order to evaluate the impacts of the four key parameters photocatalyst loading ph of solution airflow rate and concentration of fluoride ions on the percentage removal of smx by photocatalysis central composite design ccd was applied by the minitab software version 16 minitab institute usa the possible interaction of the parameters and their influence on the response can be evaluated by ccd shayegan et al 2013 the coded and real levels of the independent variables are listed in table 1 the full quadratic model was used to model removal percentage of smx by four main effects linear terms four curvature effects quadratic terms and four two factor effects interaction terms the preliminary experiments had been performed to determine the range of parameters the response surfaces were plotted and parameters were optimized to obtain the maximum removal of smx the analysis of variance anova was used to assess the interactions between the process variables and response 2 5 toxicity tests the toxicity of samples was assessed by a commercial toxicity test kit toxtrac hach usa in the form of percentage inhibition pi of samples against escherichia coli e coli bacteria according to the manufacturer s protocol this method is based on the color change of solution from blue to pink by the reduction of resazurin a redox reactive dye by bacterial respiration to resorufin gmurek et al 2015 e coli culture cultivated on nutrient broth medium was used as the test organisms the respiration inhibition of e coli strain was calculated by eq 3 gmurek et al 2015 3 i n h i b i t a t i o n 1 δ a s a m p l e δ a c o n t r o l 100 where δa initial absorbance value final absorbance value at 603 nm it is reported that fluoride bala et al 2017 and zinc ions also may show antibacterial effects podporska carroll et al 2017 for this reason the uv catalyst experiment without smx was performed at the same condition of smx removal experiment and several samples were taken and filtered to use as control in the toxicity tests in the case of f zno for bare zno the samples withdrawn during the uv catalyst experiment without smx and nh4f were used as control furthermore the agar well diffusion method was used in order to visualize the change of toxicity before and after the treatment balouiri et al 2016 for this purpose the entire surface of an agar plate was inoculated by spreading e coli on it then two holes with the diameter of 6 mm were punched into the agar and 60 μl of solution was introduced into the wells the agar plate was incubated at 37 c overnight to promote the formation of inhibition zones around the wells 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of ccd based on the experimental results presented in table 2 a polynomial function was found to adequately represent the response predicting the percentage of smx removal r at the examined levels of selected parameters eq 4 expresses the relative importance of each parameter as well as their interaction 4 r 89 82 12 53 x 1 3 89 x 2 14 41 x 3 3 37 x 4 5 69 x 1 2 0 45 x 2 2 3 59 x 3 2 1 43 x 4 2 0 33 x 1 x 2 0 65 x 1

35 21 confirmed that the model was highly significant which is supported by the close agreement between the predicted values and observed results in fig 2 and table 2 the polynomial equation fitted the experimental results within a 98 01 confidence interval which is in good agreement with the adjusted r 2 95 25 fig 2 shows the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed values where the line of the best fit with r 2 0 9814 was obtained further confirming the reliability of model the f value and p value were used to determine the significance of each term the smaller p value and higher f value for each term indicate the significance of its corresponding coefficient and the higher contribution towards the response variable shayegan et al 2013 in order to evaluate the importance of factors in eq 4 the pareto equation is used and the percentage effect of each parameter on the removal of smx was calculated according to the following equation chen et al 2012 5 p i a i 2 a i 2 100 where p i is the percentage effect of each variable and a i represents statistically significant coefficients in eq 4 the results of the pareto graphic analysis is illustrated in fig 3 as shown in the figure the most important parameters for the photodegradation of smx were airflow rate x3 followed by the amount of photocatalyst x1 moreover the degradation efficiency is affected by the interrelated parameters such as two factor interactions x 1 2 the 3d response surface and contour plots were used to illustrate the effects of independent parameters and of interactions between independent parameters on the removal of smx fig 4 3 2 effect of process parameters on removal efficiency of smx 3 2 1 effect of photocatalyst dosage the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation usually increases with the photocatalyst concentration towards a limit at high catalyst concentrations prieto rodriguez et al 2012 from fig 4c and d the positive effect of increasing the photocatalyst dosage on the percentage of smx degradation is clearly indicated the addition of photocatalyst enhanced the removal efficiencies of smx and cod this could be attributed to the higher generation of ros on active surface sites of the photocatalyst ding et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 7 the addition of optimum concentration of photocatalyst increased the cod removal from 4 8 obtained by photolysis to 85 by photocatalysis after 90 min of reaction however at concentrations higher than the optimum value 1 48 g l the increase in removal efficiency demonstrated a slower rate this was caused by the increase in turbidity and the ensuing scattering phenomena which reduced the uv light penetration into the suspension abellán et al 2009 elmolla and chaudhuri 2010 in addition the smx molecules and the catalyst particles compete for the photons emitting from the uv lamp 3 2 2 effect of solution ph the ph of solution plays an important role in the degradation and mineralization of contaminants in photocatalytic processes elmolla and chaudhuri 2010 mirzaei et al 2016 generally photocatalytic degradation efficiency improves by increasing the ph of solution mirzaei et al 2016 this is due to the availability of higher amounts of hydroxyl ions at basic condition as the main precursor of oh radical by reacting with the photo generated holes however the removal of smx was shown to be more efficient under acidic conditions and at an optimum ph of 4 8 fig 4a since surface fluorination of photocatalysts can be carried out in acidic media liu et al 2012 park and choi 2004 therefore a trade off should be found between these two competitive parameters in addition in very acidic solutions zno will dissolve as zinc ions which will reduce the photocatalyst active sites and the efficiency of removal when the solution ph was equal to 1 run 7 table 2 the photocatalyst particles were totally dissolved and the reaction proceeded as direct photolysis since the ph of solution affects the extent and efficiency of surface fluorination the ionization potential of smx as well as the photocatalyst surface properties and homogenous reactions it is difficult to evaluate the effect of ph and the exact contribution of each process 3 2 3 effect of fluoride ion concentration as seen from fig 4a and b the addition of nh4f as the surface modifier had a positive impact on the removal of smx up to the optimum concentration 2 505 mm it has been shown that the surface charge separation and transfer production of active radical species and the resulting surface photocatalytic reaction mechanisms and kinetics can be altered by surface fluorination of photocatalysts liu et al 2012 in addition surface fluorination leads to the production of unbound hydroxyl radicals instead of attached surface radicals photo generated short living oh radicals which are attached to the surface of photocatalyst can be easily transformed to inactive oh functional groups on the surface of photocatalysts liu et al 2010 considering that the redox potential of free hydroxyl radicals 2 3 v vs nhe is larger than that of bound hydroxyl radicals about 1 5 1 7 v vs nhe xu et al 2007 it is expected that surface fluorination enhance the efficiency of removal and mineralization moreover the presence of fluoride ions as the most electronegative element on the surface of photocatalyst causes a stronger electron storage capacity compared to the pristine zno thus inhibits charge recombination and enhances free oh radicals generation liu et al 2012 however the presence of fluoride ions higher than the optimum concentration 2 505 mm led to the reduction in smx removal this was probably due to the reduction of o 2 species as a result of hindering electron separation and transfer on the surface of zno the effect of o 2 radicals on the photodegradation efficiency is discussed in the following section 3 2 4 effect of airflow rate aeration improves the mixing of solution in the photoreactor and reduces mass transfer limitations while providing oxygen as the electron acceptor to separate the photo generated electron holes and produce o 2 species which can promote the degradation of organic contaminants ding et al 2013 moreover a linear dependence between dissolved oxygen concentration and hydroxyl radical oh generation has been reported abellán et al 2007 wang and hong 2000 without an electron acceptor such as oxygen molecules the photo generated electron hole pairs will recombine rapidly wang and hong 2000 in addition the importance of o 2 species in the mineralization of organic contaminants has been shown ryu et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 3 the airflow rate x3 was the most significant parameter and had the highest impact on the removal of smx wang et al 2007 demonstrated that beside the conventional electron scavenging effect dissolved o2 played a critical role in the degradation of produced intermediates as shown in fig 4 the removal efficiency of smx was reduced until a critical point and then it was enhanced and there was a minimal point about 1 5 l min of airflow rate this is because the increase of airflow rate may decrease the removal efficiency due to the scattering of light by smooth surface of bubbles and shielding effects which hinder the removal of smx via photolysis and photocatalysis therefore a trade off should be made between providing dissolved oxygen and scattering effect in order to achieve high smx removal airflow rates higher than 2 5 l min was not examined in this study due to the limitation of photoreactor 3 3 determination of optimal conditions for photocatalytic degradation of smx the main objectives of process optimization were to determine the optimum values of operating and process parameters for the photocatalytic removal of smx and to further evaluate the mechanism of photocatalytic reactions under optimum conditions for this purpose the desired objective in term of the removal efficiency of smx was defined as maximize to achieve the highest removal percentage after 30 min of reaction the obtained optimum values are listed in table 4 to validate that the model was satisfactory for predicting the maximum photodegradation of smx an additional experiment was conducted at the optimum condition as presented in table 4 the obtained smx removal percentage 95 76 was close to the predicted value 96 23 which indicates that rsm is a useful mathematical tool for modeling and optimization of smx photocatalytic removal process therefore the optimum values estimated by the rsm were selected for use in the ensuing experiments 3 4 mechanism of smx removal reaction as shown in fig 5 the adsorption of smx on the surface of photocatalysts was very low therefore the photosensitization mechanism is unlikely to occur since it would require efficient adsorption of contaminants on the surface of photocatalysts and electron transfer from excited smx molecule to the conduction band of photocatalysts liu et al 2010 the low adsorption of smx on the surface of other photocatalysts such as tio2 has also been reported before nasuhoglu et al 2011 surface fluorination slightly enhanced the adsorption capacity of zno the presence of ki as the scavenger of the hole and hydroxyl radical totally hindered the adsorption of smx on photocatalyst this occurred because the concentration of ki was 20 times higher than smx hence the iodide ions in the solution could compete with the smx molecules for adsorption on the surface of photocatalyst in addition a considerable removal of smx was observed by direct photolysis in the absence of photocatalyst this happened because smx can absorb uv light up to 310 nm maximum absorption at 263 nm abellán et al 2007 which is close to the wavelength of the examined uvc lamp 254 nm the high removal of smx by photolysis under uvc irradiation has been reported before kim and kan 2016 nasuhoglu et al 2011 after a short reaction time of photolysis the color of solution changed to brownish which indicated the formation of intermediate compounds under these conditions only 4 8 cod removal was obtained after 90 min of reaction this means that in contrast to smx that was shown to be prone to photolysis photo induced intermediates were not susceptible to photolysis under optimum conditions 95 76 smx removal was achieved after 30 min reaction which is higher than the efficiencies obtained with bare zno 82 and with tio2 p25 with 79 this is due to the higher amount of photo generated oh radicals and adsorption capacity of f zno compared to bare zno and p25 to evaluate the role of oh radicals in the removal of smx the photocatalytic reaction was carried out in the presence of 20 mm tba a well known oh radical scavenger as illustrated in fig 5 the addition of tba as the hydroxyl radical scavenger resulted in significant decrease in the degradation rate of smx removal by zno this further confirmed the role of oh radicals in the degradation of smx długosz et al 2015 also emphasized the role of hydroxyl radicals formation in the photocatalytic degradation of smx the reduction of smx removal efficiency in the presence of tba was more evident for f zno in comparison with bare zno this is due to the higher contributions of hydroxyl radicals in the f zno process the addition of ki which acts as both h and oh scavenger considerably hindered the removal of smx which was even lower than the removal obtained by photolysis however this reduction was more evident in the case of f zno system due to the generation of additional oh radicals as well as a higher contribution of holes in this system due to the electronegativity of fluoride ions on the surface of zno the production of o 2 is hindered therefore the addition of ki in the f zno process not only scavenged both radicals and holes but also due to the presence of photocatalyst particles and the ensuing scattering effect it reduced the efficiency of smx removal below the efficiency observed by direct photolysis in summary the surface fluorination is an effective method to increase hydroxyl radical production but it decreases o 2 generation considering the fact that oh radicals are more powerful than o 2 radicals 2 69 v vs nhe and 0 33 v vs nhe respectively li et al 2016 the efficiency of smx removal was increased by surface fluorination however the reduction of smx efficiency at high concentrations of nh4f beyond the optimum value revealed that the generation of o 2 radicals is somewhat essential it is reported that some produced intermediates will undergo reduction reactions by o 2 species which will be used in the reaction as a main reductant species ryu et al 2017 the photo generated h2o2 concentration during the photodegradation experiments was monitored by titration method hydrogen peroxide can directly participate in the oxidation of contaminants or it will produce extra hydroxyl radicals fig 6 illustrates the concentration profile of h2o2 produced during smx photodegradation by bare zno and by f zno at the optimum condition while the photocatalytic removal of smx and cod by f zno were higher than that observed with bare zno h2o2 concentration during the photodegradation by f zno was lower possibly due to the hindering interfacial electron transfer to dissolved oxygen which is required for h2o2 generation the maximum concentration of h2o2 produced during the photocatalytic process by f zno was about three times lower than that obtained with bare zno chemical oxygen demand cod can be considered as an indicator of the extent of mineralization kim and kan 2016 nasuhoglu et al 2011 the persistence of smx and intermediates in the solution was evaluated by conducting experiments for 90 min using photolytic and photocatalytic processes under optimum operating conditions according to fig 7 the mineralization of smx required a considerably longer reaction time than its degradation approximately 85 of the initial cod was removed by f zno however only 4 8 cod removal was achieved for photolysis even after 90 min of irradiation it is concluded that although smx can be partially degraded by photolysis the degradation of intermediates that were generated by the photolytic reaction is more difficult the cod removal efficiencies were improved when f zno was used at the optimum condition at three considered time intervals compared to bare zno and tio2 degussa p25 3 5 kinetics of reaction the kinetics of photocatalytic reaction can be commonly explained by pseudo first order kinetic equation długosz et al 2015 6 ln c t c 0 k t where c 0 and c t are the initial concentration and concentration at time t respectively k is the reaction rate constant and considering the difference between the total solution volume v t and volume of photoreactor v p in this study all kinetics calculations considered illumination time eq 7 prieto rodriguez et al 2012 7 t i t e v p v t where t i and t e are the time of illumination and time of experiment respectively in order to study the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of smx removal experiments were conducted under optimum operating conditions and initial smx concentration of 1 mm as shown in fig 8 the kinetics of smx removal photocatalytic degradation was also compared to the results obtained with bare zno and tio2 degussa p25 the photocatalytic removal rate of smx was relatively high during the first 30 of reaction but the reaction rate decreased as the reactions proceeded this could be related to the formation of intermediates and ionic species such as s o 4 2 during the reaction which can compete with smx either for adsorption on the photocatalyst absorption of available uv light and or reaction by ros abellán et al 2007 2009 ding et al 2013 the highest rate constant 0 099 min 1 for the degradation of smx was achieved by f zno followed by bare zno 0 058 min 1 and tio2 degussa p25 0 048 min 1 respectively 3 6 photostability of photocatalyst the long term stability of photocatalysts is one of the most important parameters that governs their utilization in water treatment processes kovacic et al 2017 in order to evaluate the stability of photocatalysts recycled experiments for photocatalytic degradation of smx were carried out under optimum operating conditions as illustrated in fig 9 a at the first cycle the removal efficiency of smx by f zno was higher than that of zno and p25 however a sharp drop in smx removal efficiency was shown after the first cycle after four cycles the efficiency of f zno for the removal of smx was lower than bare zno and p25 the smx removal was reduced from 82 to 60 after four cycles by bare zno while by using f zno the efficiency drop was more obvious and declined from 95 to 55 it should be noted that p25 displayed a relatively lower photocatalytic activity compared to bare zno and f zno at the first cycle however the results showed that its performance in long term stability is better than zno based photocatalysts the substantial decrease of photocatalytic activity of zno based photocatalysts resulted from the photocorrosion phenomenon as reported before mirzaei et al 2016 zou et al 2017 it is known that the photocorrosion of photocatalyst and photocatalytic reactions are two competitive processes zhao et al 2017 photocorrosion consists of the release of zn2 and the collapse and deactivation of the zno structure under uv irradiation due to the self oxidation of photocatalytic eq 8 vu et al 2013 8 z n o 2 h z n 2 0 5 o 2 in this study the concentration of zinc ions zn2 in filtrates of the experiments at different time intervals was measured in order to evaluate the effects of surface fluorination on the photocorrosion fig 9b shows that the amount of zn2 released into the solution by photocorrosion is proportional to the concentration of fluoride ion in the solution based on the reaction 8 the photo induced h could be the main reason for the photocorrosion of zno ma et al 2017 the reason behind the enhancement of zn2 ion leaching by surface fluorination is the higher availability of photo induced h by holding of electrons on the surface the higher availability of holes and their contribution to the reaction leads to the self corrosion of zno release of zn2 and reductions in the photocatalytic efficiency in consecutive runs it should be emphasized that despite the higher efficiency of f zno for the removal of smx and cod and the higher rate of degradation the results indicated a negative effect of surface fluorination on the photostability of zno photocatalyst 3 7 energy consumption the high energy consumption of aop is the main obstacle to the utilization of this process in water and wastewater treatment plants the process economic is often the dominant factor in selecting an advanced oxidation process saien et al 2014 photocatalytic degradation of aqueous organic contaminants is an electric energy intensive process and the electric energy represents the major fraction of the operating costs the electrical energy per order e eo which is approved by the photochemistry commission of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac cater et al 2000 as a figures of merit for aops is used in this study as a criteria to evaluate and compare the removal efficiency based on energy consumption according to eq 9 lam et al 2013 9 e e o p t 1000 v 60 log c i c f where p is the power to drive the uv lamp s kw t is the irradiation time min v is the volume of the treated solution l c i and c f are the initial and final concentrations of contaminants respectively e eo is defined as the kilowatt hours of electrical energy needed to decrease the concentration of a contaminant by one order of magnitude 90 in one cubic meter of solution cater et al 2000 as presented in table 5 the electrical energy required in the process developed in this study is lower than that reported in most previous studies of photocatalytic degradation of smx table 5 lists an extremely diverse range of energy consumption for smx removal by pco under uv irradiation the main reasons for the low energy consumption in this study could be summarized as follow i enhancing the removal efficiency and removal rate by slowing down the recombination rate and increasing the hydrophobicity of photocatalyst which led to the promotion of hydroxyl radical generation and oxidation of smx ii utilizing low energy consuming uvc lamp which had a substantial overlap with maximum absorption wavelength of smx and led to the photolysis of smx in addition to the photocatalytic oxidation iii using a cylindrical narrow photoreactor which led to utilizing all emitted radiation and increasing the quantum yield based on eq 9 the energy consumption of process depends on the rate of reaction in addition different parameters such as the mixing efficiency and mass transfer limitations type and concentration of photocatalyst ph and temperature of solution geometry of reactor etc can considerably affect the reaction rate and consequently the energy consumption friedmann et al 2010 therefore in order to reduce the energy consumption of process and promote the feasibility of pco the above mentioned parameters should all be taken into consideration 3 8 toxicity assessment during the degradation of pharmaceuticals many intermediate compounds are formed that may be more toxic than the parent compounds therefore total mineralization or at least their transformation into non toxic compounds should be considered in addition to the removal of parent pharmaceutical contaminant mirzaei et al 2017b nasuhoglu et al 2011 ryu et al 2017 fig 10 shows the percentage inhibition pi of solution by zno f zno and tio2 p25 at two reaction intervals the results showed a high inhibition percentage of smx solution towards e coli before the photocatalytic degradation the results obtained after 15 min of reaction indicated that the oxidation of smx led to the generation of intermediates which showed some degree of toxicity pi 10 although lower than the initial samples after 30 min of reaction the toxicity of solutions treated by all photocatalysts fell within the non toxic range which demonstrated the effectiveness of photocatalytic degradation in the reduction of toxicity it should be noted that the reduction in toxicity towards e coli by f zno was obtained at a shorter time compared to zno and tio2 p25 f zno was the most appropriate process to reduce the toxicity or even eliminate it this is due to the generation of more oh radicals by f zno and ring cleavage of smx and intermediates by hydroxyl radical oxidation mechanism the magnified images of cultured plates with the zone of inhibition for the e coli strain is presented in fig 11 an untreated sample of smx was added to the well at the right side of the picture while the treated solution by f zno after 30 min reaction was added to the well at the left side of the picture the zone of inhibition around the untreated sample and the growth of bacterial colonies around the treated sample further confirmed the non toxic characteristics of the treated solution 4 conclusions the effects of surface fluorination of zno on the smx removal efficiency kinetics energy consumption and stability of photocatalyst as well as cod and toxicity removal were evaluated the conclusions drawn from this research are as follows rsm was successfully utilized to optimize the operating parameters and under the optimum operating conditions photocatalyst 0 1 48 g l ph 4 7 airflow rate 2 5 l min and f 0 2 505 mm the removal of smx and cod and the corresponding reaction rates were higher than those obtained with bare zno and tio2 p25 photocatalyst comparison of the energy consumption in this study with previously reported studies which had considered photocatalytic degradation of smx under uv irradiation showed considerably lower electrical energy per order e eo the percentage of inhibition pi values of the solutions revealed that photocatalytic degradation was an effective method to reduce the solution toxicity however the observed reduction was more significant for f zno the consecutive reuse of photocatalysts revealed that f zno was more effective to remove smx in the first cycle however gradual activity loss of photocatalyst was in the following order f zno zno p25 the smx removal after 30 min was reduced from 95 to 55 after four consecutive runs by using f zno this reduction in the activity of f zno was due to the higher photocorrosion and release of zn2 ion from the structure of photocatalyst as a result of the higher availability of photo induced holes therefore besides the photocatalytic activity the long term stability of zno based photocatalyst should be assessed in water and wastewater treatment processes 
19756,the presence of antibiotics in water bodies has received increasing attention since they are continuously introduced and detected in the environment and may cause unpredictable environmental hazards and risks the photocatalytic degradation of sulfamethoxazole smx by zno in the presence of fluoride ions f zno was evaluated the effects of operating parameters on the efficiency of smx removal were investigated by using response surface methodology rsm under the optimum condition i e photocatalyst dosage 1 48 g l ph 4 7 airflow rate 2 5 l min and the concentration of fluoride ions 2 505 mm about 97 smx removal was achieved by f zno after 30 min of reaction the mechanism of reactions cod removal efficiency and reaction kinetics were also investigated under optimum operating conditions in addition about 85 cod reduction was obtained after 90 min photocatalytic reaction the pseudo first order kinetics rate constants for the photodegradation of smx were found to be 0 099 0 058 and 0 048 min 1 by f zno zno and tio2 p25 respectively the figure of merit electrical energy per order e eo was used for estimating the electrical energy efficiency which was shown to be considerably lower than the energy consumption for the reported research on removal of smx by photocatalytic degradation under uv irradiation toxicity assays were conducted by measuring the inhibition percentage pi towards e coli bacteria strain and by agar well diffusion method the results showed that after 30 min of reaction the toxicity of the treated solutions by all photocatalysts fell within the non toxic range however the reduction in toxicity by f zno was faster than those by zno and p25 despite the positive effects of surface fluorination of zno on the smx and cod removal and reaction kinetics its lower stability compared to zno and p25 in the repeated experiments gave rise to some doubts about its performance from a practical point of view keywords toxicity sulfamethoxazole surface fluorination response surface methodology photocorrosion stability 1 introduction widespread detection of emerging contaminants ecs including many synthetic antimicrobial agents in water bodies is raising public health concerns even at sub therapeutic concentration levels beltran et al 2008 ryan et al 2011 although there is an ongoing debate about the risks posed by chronic exposure to trace concentrations of antimicrobials compounds recent studies have demonstrated adverse health effects caused by mixtures of ecs in the environment even at trace levels and enhancement of antibiotic resistance beltran et al 2008 sulfonamide antibacterial compounds such as sulfamethoxazole smx are the oldest group of antibiotics and they are widely prescribed to treat infectious and respiration diseases in human and veterinary medicine długosz et al 2015 li et al 2017 sulfonamide antibiotics show high excretion rates in the feces and urine either as parent compound or metabolites yang et al 2015 it is reported that conventional biological treatment processes are ineffective and or too slow to eliminate sulfonamides in water abellán et al 2007 thus it is not surprising that research has recently focused on utilizing advanced oxidation processes aops for the degradation of antibiotics in water photocatalytic oxidation pco is a promising aops for the removal of recalcitrant and or toxic compounds from water abellán et al 2007 kim and kan 2016 liu et al 2016 however most photocatalytic processes are complicated and difficult to use in water treatment operations because of high preparation and operating costs and relatively low photocatalytic efficiency li et al 2017 photocatalysts such as zno when illuminated by photons having an energy level that exceeds their band gap produce reactive species such as e h oh and o 2 which can participate in the elimination reactions of organic contaminants a list of complete reactions which may contribute to the photocatalytic process by zno can be found elsewhere mirzaei et al 2016 unfortunately the low quantum efficiency caused by the high recombination rate of the photo induced electron hole pairs leads to high energy consumption during the operation and greatly restricts the applications of photocatalytic removal processes liu et al 2012 shayegan et al 2018 so far numerous modifying strategies have been proposed for promoting the efficiency of photocatalysts li et al 2016 however most efforts have been focused on narrowing the band gap of photocatalyst by introducing dopant s into the structure of semiconductor in order to reduce the recombination rate and harvest visible instead of uv light from the thermodynamic viewpoint narrowing the band gap of semiconductor will lead to reducing the oxidation and reduction potential li et al 2016 therefore the incomplete degradation of ecs due to low redox potential may enhance the probability of toxic by products formation during the treatment by narrow band gap photocatalysts catalá et al 2015 improving the efficiency of wide band gap photocatalysts by alternative methods such as surface modification will not only promote the removal efficiencies without band gap engineering but may also improve the disinfection process by uvc λ max 254 nm and further reduce operating cost by process intensification cruz ortiz et al 2017 the photocatalytic activities of semiconductors are strongly related to their surface characteristics charge transfer recombination rate contaminant surface interactions and the type and amount of reactive oxygen species ros ryu et al 2017 surface modification of photocatalyst can alter the surface characteristics including polarity surface charge acidity adsorption capacities etc liu et al 2012 most current methods of surface modification use long chain fluorinated and polyfluorinated compounds pfcs mirzaei et al 2013 xing et al 2012 the use of pfcs is restricted because of their acute toxicity high bioaccumulative potential in biota and high cost bai et al 2016 mirzaei et al 2017a xing et al 2012 as an alternative surface fluorination by fluoride anions has become a popular method because this technique is simple to implement highly effective inexpensive and less bioaccumulative mirzaei et al 2017a ryu et al 2017 the enhancement of photocatalytic degradation efficiency of organic contaminants such as methylene blue kim et al 2010 n nitrosodimethylamine lee et al 2005 phenol park and choi 2004 wang et al 2007 acid orange 7 park and choi 2004 acid red 1 mrowetz and selli 2005 benzoic acid mrowetz and selli 2006 and cyanuric acid oh and jenks 2004 in the presence of f ions in aqueous tio2 suspensions has been reported although the higher removal efficiency of zno compared to tio2 under certain operating conditions is demonstrated in several studies elmolla and chaudhuri 2010 kansal et al 2007 mirzaei et al 2016 the surface fluorination of zno has not been reported the higher photocatalytic activity of fluorinated photocatalysts is related to the substantial changes in their surface characteristics such as surface charge polarity acidity and adsorption capacity liu et al 2012 on the other hand it is proven that the photostability of photocatalyst is heavily dependent on its surface properties chu et al 2009 however the effects of surface fluorination on the stability and reusability of photocatalysts has been rarely reported in the literature in this study response surface methodology rsm was used to optimize four process parameters namely catalyst loading fluoride ions concentration solution ph and airflow rate for maximum smx degradation possible mechanisms of photocatalytic degradation of smx as well as cod removal and reaction kinetics are investigated under the optimum operating conditions the effect of surface fluorination on photocorrosion of zno and reusability of f zno in consecutive experiments is also investigated in addition the figure of merit electrical energy per order e eo for photocatalysis process at the optimum operating condition is calculated and compared to the reported results of smx removal by pco under uv light irradiation since oxidation treatment processes may cause the formation of toxic by products the final stage of this research was devoted to the assessment of solution toxicity before and after the treatment 2 experimental section 2 1 chemicals zinc oxide ammonium fluoride potassium iodide and tert butanol tba were purchased from fisher scientific on canada commercial tio2 degussa p25 was used to compare its photocatalytic efficiency with bare and fluorinated zno f zno sulfamethoxazole smx was purchased from mp biomedicals on canada all chemicals were reagent grade and were used as received without any further purification deionized milli q water 18 μs cm 1 was used to prepare the different solutions in this study 2 2 analytical procedures the concentration of zinc ion in the solution was measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer pinaacle 900f perkinelmer usa the variations of smx concentration were evaluated by the method reported by liu et al 2016 by using a uv vis spectrophotometer evolution 201 thermo scientific usa ultra low range cod 0 7 40 mg l digestion vials toxtrak toxicity assay kit and h2o2 titration kit were purchased all from hach co and used according to the manufacturer s methods the degree of removal for smx and cod was determined based on eq 1 and eq 2 respectively 1 r 1 c t c 0 100 2 y 1 c o d t c o d 0 100 where r and y are the degree of smx and cod removal respectively c t mm is the concentration smx at time t and c 0 mm is the initial concentration of smx 2 3 photocatalytic experiments the photocatalytic degradation experiments were conducted in a 700 ml tubular stainless steel photoreactor working in slurry mode the light source was provided by a uvc lamp 10 w trojan technologies on canada the intensity of uvc radiation was 3 5 mj cm 2 measured by a radiometer trojan technologies on canada in all cases air was continuously bubbled into the solution mixture through a sparger located at the bottom of reactor to supply dissolved oxygen molecules and provide sufficient agitation the temperature of solution was maintained at 21 1 c using an external cooling jacket an external reservoir 300 ml was used in order to purge air from the reactor and to conduct sampling and further mixing of solution by stirring the schematic diagram of the photoreactor is depicted in fig 1 the solution ph was adjusted at the required value by 0 1 n hcl or 0 1 n naoh before illumination the solutions were circulated for 30 min in dark to reach the adsorption desorption equilibrium between photocatalysts smx and fluoride ions at given time intervals a 10 ml sample of the solution was withdrawn from the reactor and the photocatalyst particles were removed by 0 22 μm filter minisart germany for the ensuing analyses 2 4 experimental design and optimization in order to evaluate the impacts of the four key parameters photocatalyst loading ph of solution airflow rate and concentration of fluoride ions on the percentage removal of smx by photocatalysis central composite design ccd was applied by the minitab software version 16 minitab institute usa the possible interaction of the parameters and their influence on the response can be evaluated by ccd shayegan et al 2013 the coded and real levels of the independent variables are listed in table 1 the full quadratic model was used to model removal percentage of smx by four main effects linear terms four curvature effects quadratic terms and four two factor effects interaction terms the preliminary experiments had been performed to determine the range of parameters the response surfaces were plotted and parameters were optimized to obtain the maximum removal of smx the analysis of variance anova was used to assess the interactions between the process variables and response 2 5 toxicity tests the toxicity of samples was assessed by a commercial toxicity test kit toxtrac hach usa in the form of percentage inhibition pi of samples against escherichia coli e coli bacteria according to the manufacturer s protocol this method is based on the color change of solution from blue to pink by the reduction of resazurin a redox reactive dye by bacterial respiration to resorufin gmurek et al 2015 e coli culture cultivated on nutrient broth medium was used as the test organisms the respiration inhibition of e coli strain was calculated by eq 3 gmurek et al 2015 3 i n h i b i t a t i o n 1 δ a s a m p l e δ a c o n t r o l 100 where δa initial absorbance value final absorbance value at 603 nm it is reported that fluoride bala et al 2017 and zinc ions also may show antibacterial effects podporska carroll et al 2017 for this reason the uv catalyst experiment without smx was performed at the same condition of smx removal experiment and several samples were taken and filtered to use as control in the toxicity tests in the case of f zno for bare zno the samples withdrawn during the uv catalyst experiment without smx and nh4f were used as control furthermore the agar well diffusion method was used in order to visualize the change of toxicity before and after the treatment balouiri et al 2016 for this purpose the entire surface of an agar plate was inoculated by spreading e coli on it then two holes with the diameter of 6 mm were punched into the agar and 60 μl of solution was introduced into the wells the agar plate was incubated at 37 c overnight to promote the formation of inhibition zones around the wells 3 results and discussion 3 1 analysis of ccd based on the experimental results presented in table 2 a polynomial function was found to adequately represent the response predicting the percentage of smx removal r at the examined levels of selected parameters

35 21 confirmed that the model was highly significant which is supported by the close agreement between the predicted values and observed results in fig 2 and table 2 the polynomial equation fitted the experimental results within a 98 01 confidence interval which is in good agreement with the adjusted r 2 95 25 fig 2 shows the goodness of fit between the predicted and observed values where the line of the best fit with r 2 0 9814 was obtained further confirming the reliability of model the f value and p value were used to determine the significance of each term the smaller p value and higher f value for each term indicate the significance of its corresponding coefficient and the higher contribution towards the response variable shayegan et al 2013 in order to evaluate the importance of factors in eq 4 the pareto equation is used and the percentage effect of each parameter on the removal of smx was calculated according to the following equation chen et al 2012 5 p i a i 2 a i 2 100 where p i is the percentage effect of each variable and a i represents statistically significant coefficients in eq 4 the results of the pareto graphic analysis is illustrated in fig 3 as shown in the figure the most important parameters for the photodegradation of smx were airflow rate x3 followed by the amount of photocatalyst x1 moreover the degradation efficiency is affected by the interrelated parameters such as two factor interactions x 1 2 the 3d response surface and contour plots were used to illustrate the effects of independent parameters and of interactions between independent parameters on the removal of smx fig 4 3 2 effect of process parameters on removal efficiency of smx 3 2 1 effect of photocatalyst dosage the heterogeneous photocatalytic degradation usually increases with the photocatalyst concentration towards a limit at high catalyst concentrations prieto rodriguez et al 2012 from fig 4c and d the positive effect of increasing the photocatalyst dosage on the percentage of smx degradation is clearly indicated the addition of photocatalyst enhanced the removal efficiencies of smx and cod this could be attributed to the higher generation of ros on active surface sites of the photocatalyst ding et al 2013 as illustrated in fig 7 the addition of optimum concentration of photocatalyst increased the cod removal from 4 8 obtained by photolysis to 85 by photocatalysis after 90 min of reaction however at concentrations higher than the optimum value 1 48 g l the increase in removal efficiency demonstrated a slower rate this was caused by the increase in turbidity and the ensuing scattering phenomena which reduced the uv light penetration into the suspension abellán et al 2009 elmolla and chaudhuri 2010 in addition the smx molecules and the catalyst particles compete for the photons emitting from the uv lamp 3 2 2 effect of solution ph the ph of solution plays an important role in the degradation and mineralization of contaminants in photocatalytic processes elmolla and chaudhuri 2010 mirzaei et al 2016 generally photocatalytic degradation efficiency improves by increasing the ph of solution mirzaei et al 2016 this is due to the availability of higher amounts of hydroxyl ions at basic condition as the main precursor of oh radical by reacting with the photo generated holes however the removal of smx was shown to be more efficient under acidic conditions and at an optimum ph of 4 8 fig 4a since surface fluorination of photocatalysts can be carried out in acidic media liu et al 2012 park and choi 2004 therefore a trade off should be found between these two competitive parameters in addition in very acidic solutions zno will dissolve as zinc ions which will reduce the photocatalyst active sites and the efficiency of removal when the solution ph was equal to 1 run 7 table 2 the photocatalyst particles were totally dissolved and the reaction proceeded as direct photolysis since the ph of solution affects the extent and efficiency of surface fluorination the ionization potential of smx as well as the photocatalyst surface properties and homogenous reactions it is difficult to evaluate the effect of ph and the exact contribution of each process 3 2 3 effect of fluoride ion concentration as seen from fig 4a and b the addition of nh4f as the surface modifier had a positive impact on the removal of smx up to the optimum concentration 2 505 mm it has been shown that the surface charge separation and transfer production of active radical species and the resulting surface photocatalytic reaction mechanisms and kinetics can be altered by surface fluorination of photocatalysts liu et al 2012 in addition surface fluorination leads to the production of unbound hydroxyl radicals instead of attached surface radicals photo generated short living oh radicals which are attached to the surface of photocatalyst can be easily transformed to inactive oh functional groups on the surface of photocatalysts liu et al 2010 considering that the redox potential of free hydroxyl radicals 2 3 v vs nhe is larger than that of bound hydroxyl radicals about 1 5 1 7 v vs nhe xu et al 2007 it is expected that surface fluorination enhance the efficiency of removal and mineralization moreover the presence of fluoride ions as the most electronegative element on the surface of photocatalyst causes a stronger electron storage capacity compared to the pristine zno thus inhibits charge recombination and enhances free oh radicals generation liu et al 2012 however the presence of fluoride ions higher than the optimum concentration 2 505 mm led to the reduction in smx removal this was probably due to the reduction of o 2 species as a result of hindering electron separation and transfer on the surface of zno the effect of o 2 radicals on the photodegradation efficiency is discussed in the following section 3 2 4 effect of airflow rate aeration improves the mixing of solution in the photoreactor and reduces mass transfer limitations while providing oxygen as the electron acceptor to separate the photo generated electron holes and produce o 2 species which can promote the degradation of organic contaminants ding et al 2013 moreover a linear dependence between dissolved oxygen concentration and hydroxyl radical oh generation has been reported abellán et al 2007 wang and hong 2000 without an electron acceptor such as oxygen molecules the photo generated electron hole pairs will recombine rapidly wang and hong 2000 in addition the importance of o 2 species in the mineralization of organic contaminants has been shown ryu et al 2017 as illustrated in fig 3 the airflow rate x3 was the most significant parameter and had the highest impact on the removal of smx wang et al 2007 demonstrated that beside the conventional electron scavenging effect dissolved o2 played a critical role in the degradation of produced intermediates as shown in fig 4 the removal efficiency of smx was reduced until a critical point and then it was enhanced and there was a minimal point about 1 5 l min of airflow rate this is because the increase of airflow rate may decrease the removal efficiency due to the scattering of light by smooth surface of bubbles and shielding effects which hinder the removal of smx via photolysis and photocatalysis therefore a trade off should be made between providing dissolved oxygen and scattering effect in order to achieve high smx removal airflow rates higher than 2 5 l min was not examined in this study due to the limitation of photoreactor 3 3 determination of optimal conditions for photocatalytic degradation of smx the main objectives of process optimization were to determine the optimum values of operating and process parameters for the photocatalytic removal of smx and to further evaluate the mechanism of photocatalytic reactions under optimum conditions for this purpose the desired objective in term of the removal efficiency of smx was defined as maximize to achieve the highest removal percentage after 30 min of reaction the obtained optimum values are listed in table 4 to validate that the model was satisfactory for predicting the maximum photodegradation of smx an additional experiment was conducted at the optimum condition as presented in table 4 the obtained smx removal percentage 95 76 was close to the predicted value 96 23 which indicates that rsm is a useful mathematical tool for modeling and optimization of smx photocatalytic removal process therefore the optimum values estimated by the rsm were selected for use in the ensuing experiments 3 4 mechanism of smx removal reaction as shown in fig 5 the adsorption of smx on the surface of photocatalysts was very low therefore the photosensitization mechanism is unlikely to occur since it would require efficient adsorption of contaminants on the surface of photocatalysts and electron transfer from excited smx molecule to the conduction band of photocatalysts liu et al 2010 the low adsorption of smx on the surface of other photocatalysts such as tio2 has also been reported before nasuhoglu et al 2011 surface fluorination slightly enhanced the adsorption capacity of zno the presence of ki as the scavenger of the hole and hydroxyl radical totally hindered the adsorption of smx on photocatalyst this occurred because the concentration of ki was 20 times higher than smx hence the iodide ions in the solution could compete with the smx molecules for adsorption on the surface of photocatalyst in addition a considerable removal of smx was observed by direct photolysis in the absence of photocatalyst this happened because smx can absorb uv light up to 310 nm maximum absorption at 263 nm abellán et al 2007 which is close to the wavelength of the examined uvc lamp 254 nm the high removal of smx by photolysis under uvc irradiation has been reported before kim and kan 2016 nasuhoglu et al 2011 after a short reaction time of photolysis the color of solution changed to brownish which indicated the formation of intermediate compounds under these conditions only 4 8 cod removal was obtained after 90 min of reaction this means that in contrast to smx that was shown to be prone to photolysis photo induced intermediates were not susceptible to photolysis under optimum conditions 95 76 smx removal was achieved after 30 min reaction which is higher than the efficiencies obtained with bare zno 82 and with tio2 p25 with 79 this is due to the higher amount of photo generated oh radicals and adsorption capacity of f zno compared to bare zno and p25 to evaluate the role of oh radicals in the removal of smx the photocatalytic reaction was carried out in the presence of 20 mm tba a well known oh radical scavenger as illustrated in fig 5 the addition of tba as the hydroxyl radical scavenger resulted in significant decrease in the degradation rate of smx removal by zno this further confirmed the role of oh radicals in the degradation of smx długosz et al 2015 also emphasized the role of hydroxyl radicals formation in the photocatalytic degradation of smx the reduction of smx removal efficiency in the presence of tba was more evident for f zno in comparison with bare zno this is due to the higher contributions of hydroxyl radicals in the f zno process the addition of ki which acts as both h and oh scavenger considerably hindered the removal of smx which was even lower than the removal obtained by photolysis however this reduction was more evident in the case of f zno system due to the generation of additional oh radicals as well as a higher contribution of holes in this system due to the electronegativity of fluoride ions on the surface of zno the production of o 2 is hindered therefore the addition of ki in the f zno process not only scavenged both radicals and holes but also due to the presence of photocatalyst particles and the ensuing scattering effect it reduced the efficiency of smx removal below the efficiency observed by direct photolysis in summary the surface fluorination is an effective method to increase hydroxyl radical production but it decreases o 2 generation considering the fact that oh radicals are more powerful than o 2 radicals 2 69 v vs nhe and 0 33 v vs nhe respectively li et al 2016 the efficiency of smx removal was increased by surface fluorination however the reduction of smx efficiency at high concentrations of nh4f beyond the optimum value revealed that the generation of o 2 radicals is somewhat essential it is reported that some produced intermediates will undergo reduction reactions by o 2 species which will be used in the reaction as a main reductant species ryu et al 2017 the photo generated h2o2 concentration during the photodegradation experiments was monitored by titration method hydrogen peroxide can directly participate in the oxidation of contaminants or it will produce extra hydroxyl radicals fig 6 illustrates the concentration profile of h2o2 produced during smx photodegradation by bare zno and by f zno at the optimum condition while the photocatalytic removal of smx and cod by f zno were higher than that observed with bare zno h2o2 concentration during the photodegradation by f zno was lower possibly due to the hindering interfacial electron transfer to dissolved oxygen which is required for h2o2 generation the maximum concentration of h2o2 produced during the photocatalytic process by f zno was about three times lower than that obtained with bare zno chemical oxygen demand cod can be considered as an indicator of the extent of mineralization kim and kan 2016 nasuhoglu et al 2011 the persistence of smx and intermediates in the solution was evaluated by conducting experiments for 90 min using photolytic and photocatalytic processes under optimum operating conditions according to fig 7 the mineralization of smx required a considerably longer reaction time than its degradation approximately 85 of the initial cod was removed by f zno however only 4 8 cod removal was achieved for photolysis even after 90 min of irradiation it is concluded that although smx can be partially degraded by photolysis the degradation of intermediates that were generated by the photolytic reaction is more difficult the cod removal efficiencies were improved when f zno was used at the optimum condition at three considered time intervals compared to bare zno and tio2 degussa p25 3 5 kinetics of reaction the kinetics of photocatalytic reaction can be commonly explained by pseudo first order kinetic equation długosz et al 2015 6 ln c t c 0 k t where c 0 and c t are the initial concentration and concentration at time t respectively k is the reaction rate constant and considering the difference between the total solution volume v t and volume of photoreactor v p in this study all kinetics calculations considered illumination time eq 7 prieto rodriguez et al 2012 7 t i t e v p v t where t i and t e are the time of illumination and time of experiment respectively in order to study the kinetics of photocatalytic degradation of smx removal experiments were conducted under optimum operating conditions and initial smx concentration of 1 mm as shown in fig 8 the kinetics of smx removal photocatalytic degradation was also compared to the results obtained with bare zno and tio2 degussa p25 the photocatalytic removal rate of smx was relatively high during the first 30 of reaction but the reaction rate decreased as the reactions proceeded this could be related to the formation of intermediates and ionic species such as s o 4 2 during the reaction which can compete with smx either for adsorption on the photocatalyst absorption of available uv light and or reaction by ros abellán et al 2007 2009 ding et al 2013 the highest rate constant 0 099 min 1 for the degradation of smx was achieved by f zno followed by bare zno 0 058 min 1 and tio2 degussa p25 0 048 min 1 respectively 3 6 photostability of photocatalyst the long term stability of photocatalysts is one of the most important parameters that governs their utilization in water treatment processes kovacic et al 2017 in order to evaluate the stability of photocatalysts recycled experiments for photocatalytic degradation of smx were carried out under optimum operating conditions as illustrated in fig 9 a at the first cycle the removal efficiency of smx by f zno was higher than that of zno and p25 however a sharp drop in smx removal efficiency was shown after the first cycle after four cycles the efficiency of f zno for the removal of smx was lower than bare zno and p25 the smx removal was reduced from 82 to 60 after four cycles by bare zno while by using f zno the efficiency drop was more obvious and declined from 95 to 55 it should be noted that p25 displayed a relatively lower photocatalytic activity compared to bare zno and f zno at the first cycle however the results showed that its performance in long term stability is better than zno based photocatalysts the substantial decrease of photocatalytic activity of zno based photocatalysts resulted from the photocorrosion phenomenon as reported before mirzaei et al 2016 zou et al 2017 it is known that the photocorrosion of photocatalyst and photocatalytic reactions are two competitive processes zhao et al 2017 photocorrosion consists of the release of zn2 and the collapse and deactivation of the zno structure under uv irradiation due to the self oxidation of photocatalytic eq 8 vu et al 2013 8 z n o 2 h z n 2 0 5 o 2 in this study the concentration of zinc ions zn2 in filtrates of the experiments at different time intervals was measured in order to evaluate the effects of surface fluorination on the photocorrosion fig 9b shows that the amount of zn2 released into the solution by photocorrosion is proportional to the concentration of fluoride ion in the solution based on the reaction 8 the photo induced h could be the main reason for the photocorrosion of zno ma et al 2017 the reason behind the enhancement of zn2 ion leaching by surface fluorination is the higher availability of photo induced h by holding of electrons on the surface the higher availability of holes and their contribution to the reaction leads to the self corrosion of zno release of zn2 and reductions in the photocatalytic efficiency in consecutive runs it should be emphasized that despite the higher efficiency of f zno for the removal of smx and cod and the higher rate of degradation the results indicated a negative effect of surface fluorination on the photostability of zno photocatalyst 3 7 energy consumption the high energy consumption of aop is the main obstacle to the utilization of this process in water and wastewater treatment plants the process economic is often the dominant factor in selecting an advanced oxidation process saien et al 2014 photocatalytic degradation of aqueous organic contaminants is an electric energy intensive process and the electric energy represents the major fraction of the operating costs the electrical energy per order e eo which is approved by the photochemistry commission of the international union of pure and applied chemistry iupac cater et al 2000 as a figures of merit for aops is used in this study as a criteria to evaluate and compare the removal efficiency based on energy consumption according to eq 9 lam et al 2013 9 e e o p t 1000 v 60 log c i c f where p is the power to drive the uv lamp s kw t is the irradiation time min v is the volume of the treated solution l c i and c f are the initial and final concentrations of contaminants respectively e eo is defined as the kilowatt hours of electrical energy needed to decrease the concentration of a contaminant by one order of magnitude 90 in one cubic meter of solution cater et al 2000 as presented in table 5 the electrical energy required in the process developed in this study is lower than that reported in most previous studies of photocatalytic degradation of smx table 5 lists an extremely diverse range of energy consumption for smx removal by pco under uv irradiation the main reasons for the low energy consumption in this study could be summarized as follow i enhancing the removal efficiency and removal rate by slowing down the recombination rate and increasing the hydrophobicity of photocatalyst which led to the promotion of hydroxyl radical generation and oxidation of smx ii utilizing low energy consuming uvc lamp which had a substantial overlap with maximum absorption wavelength of smx and led to the photolysis of smx in addition to the photocatalytic oxidation iii using a cylindrical narrow photoreactor which led to utilizing all emitted radiation and increasing the quantum yield based on eq 9 the energy consumption of process depends on the rate of reaction in addition different parameters such as the mixing efficiency and mass transfer limitations type and concentration of photocatalyst ph and temperature of solution geometry of reactor etc can considerably affect the reaction rate and consequently the energy consumption friedmann et al 2010 therefore in order to reduce the energy consumption of process and promote the feasibility of pco the above mentioned parameters should all be taken into consideration 3 8 toxicity assessment during the degradation of pharmaceuticals many intermediate compounds are formed that may be more toxic than the parent compounds therefore total mineralization or at least their transformation into non toxic compounds should be considered in addition to the removal of parent pharmaceutical contaminant mirzaei et al 2017b nasuhoglu et al 2011 ryu et al 2017 fig 10 shows the percentage inhibition pi of solution by zno f zno and tio2 p25 at two reaction intervals the results showed a high inhibition percentage of smx solution towards e coli before the photocatalytic degradation the results obtained after 15 min of reaction indicated that the oxidation of smx led to the generation of intermediates which showed some degree of toxicity pi 10 although lower than the initial samples after 30 min of reaction the toxicity of solutions treated by all photocatalysts fell within the non toxic range which demonstrated the effectiveness of photocatalytic degradation in the reduction of toxicity it should be noted that the reduction in toxicity towards e coli by f zno was obtained at a shorter time compared to zno and tio2 p25 f zno was the most appropriate process to reduce the toxicity or even eliminate it this is due to the generation of more oh radicals by f zno and ring cleavage of smx and intermediates by hydroxyl radical oxidation mechanism the magnified images of cultured plates with the zone of inhibition for the e coli strain is presented in fig 11 an untreated sample of smx was added to the well at the right side of the picture while the treated solution by f zno after 30 min reaction was added to the well at the left side of the picture the zone of inhibition around the untreated sample and the growth of bacterial colonies around the treated sample further confirmed the non toxic characteristics of the treated solution 4 conclusions the effects of surface fluorination of zno on the smx removal efficiency kinetics energy consumption and stability of photocatalyst as well as cod and toxicity removal were evaluated the conclusions drawn from this research are as follows rsm was successfully utilized to optimize the operating parameters and under the optimum operating conditions photocatalyst 0 1 48 g l ph 4 7 airflow rate 2 5 l min and f 0 2 505 mm the removal of smx and cod and the corresponding reaction rates were higher than those obtained with bare zno and tio2 p25 photocatalyst comparison of the energy consumption in this study with previously reported studies which had considered photocatalytic degradation of smx under uv irradiation showed considerably lower electrical energy per order e eo the percentage of inhibition pi values of the solutions revealed that photocatalytic degradation was an effective method to reduce the solution toxicity however the observed reduction was more significant for f zno the consecutive reuse of photocatalysts revealed that f zno was more effective to remove smx in the first cycle however gradual activity loss of photocatalyst was in the following order f zno zno p25 the smx removal after 30 min was reduced from 95 to 55 after four consecutive runs by using f zno this reduction in the activity of f zno was due to the higher photocorrosion and release of zn2 ion from the structure of photocatalyst as a result of the higher availability of photo induced holes therefore besides the photocatalytic activity the long term stability of zno based photocatalyst should be assessed in water and wastewater treatment processes 
19757,to reduce intra plant nutrient cycling and recover phosphorus p fertilizers from nutrient rich sidestreams wastewater utilities increasingly elect to employ struvite precipitation processes without a clear understanding of the inherent tradeoffs associated with specific design and operating decisions specifically the impact of reactor conditions on struvite crystallization rate and distribution between formation of fines particles and secondary growth onto large diameter seed crystals represent critical knowledge gaps limiting the predictive capabilities of existing process

si and primarily attributed to formation of fines the concentration of struvite seed granules had a significant impact on the rate of p removal struvite seed granules increased the rate of precipitation by reducing induction time of primary nucleation of struvite fines secondary crystal growth represented the majority of struvite solids formed at high seed loading and low si but presented the tradeoff of low total removal and low rate of removal to convey the significance of these findings on process modeling we show how a prominent kinetic model with a first order dependency

removal precipitation reactors must be designed and operated to not only convert soluble p to struvite but also collect all of the solids that form unlike calcium phosphate minerals which forms in

struvite recovery processes operate with high seed crystal loadings to enhance secondary growth onto seed surfaces but distribution of growth between struvite seed crystals and new colloidal struvite fines remains poorly understood with an increase in extractive nutrient recovery installations latimer et al 2016 utilities are making substantial investments in sidestream p recovery processes

reactors and operating ph which increases precipitation driving force i e supersaturation on solids recovery and product quality remain unclear desmidt et al 2015 ye et al 2017 if struvite fines represent a significant fraction of solids formed during treatment measuring process efficiency in terms of soluble phosphate removal could be misleading since fine particles can washout and re dissolve in downstream processes baur et al 2008 crutchik et al 2017 grooms et al 2015 excess production and loss of struvite fines from precipitation reactors can also affect the validity of modeling assumptions and economic predictions for struvite crystal recovery and reuse as evidenced by the multitude of models for struvite crystallization that exist in the literature the research community has yet to reach consensus on a kinetic process model that accurately and efficiently predicts both soluble phosphate removal and the distribution of crystallite growth between seeds and fines struvite crystallization rate has been defined using several approaches power law correlation with relative supersaturation kofina and koutsoukos 2005 rahaman et al 2014 dependence on crystals mass ratio specific surface area of crystals and relative supersaturation mehta and batstone 2013 while some have neglected or lumped the nucleation and aggregation kinetics into crystal growth rate expressions mehta and batstone 2013 rahaman et al 2014 others have individually characterized the kinetics of nucleation crystal growth and aggregation using a dynamic particle population mass balance galbraith et al 2014 lizarralde et al 2015 coupling soluble p removal to particle size and surface area dynamics while intuitive introduces the need for a particle counting device with a broad detection limit and several fitting parameters that cannot be externally calibrated both of which limit the applicability of these approaches at full scale recently a computationally lean modeling approach with a first order dependence on struvite concentration and relative supersaturation kazadi mbamba et al 2015b was recently integrated with a plant wide model to project the significant benefits of sidestream struvite total nutrient removal capacity and plant effluent p concentration kazadi mbamba et al 2016 to evaluate if this approach has merit for full scale struvite recovery systems the model must be validated with struvite seed loadings and particle diameters that reflect full scale operation the objective of this work was to investigate the influence of solution supersaturation and seed crystal loading on struvite solids distribution i e fines versus secondary crystal growth and precipitation kinetics batch experiments were conducted using synthetic wastewater containing struvite forming ions at concentrations typical of anaerobic digester supernatant and sludge centrate at multiple levels of seed loading and initial struvite supersaturation si experimental results were used to explore and understand potential tradeoffs between removal and recovery in struvite precipitation processes experimental data were also used to better understand the efficacy and validity of current modeling techniques and identify a path forward for model development and process design 2 materials and methods experiments were designed to create an initial driving force for precipitation supersaturation eq 3 and measure the amount of struvite that forms onto existing seed crystals struvite granules collected from a full scale crystallization reactor or through the production of fine particles as the system approaches equilibrium as described below section 2 4 chemical base was excluded from all experiments to reduce the impacts of localized supersaturation on fines production due to incomplete mixing all experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 23 c in 1 l beakers and a mixing speed of 300 rpm was used to be consistent with other nucleation studies mehta and batstone 2013 ohlinger et al 1999 experimental data were used to quantify reaction kinetics of struvite formation section 2 5 and evaluate the validity of a prominent precipitation process model under high seed loading section 2 6 for all experiments initial chemical concentrations of the synthetic solutions were 2 2 mm of po4 3 2 6 mm of mg2 and 50 mm of nh4 given that ammonium was in excess for all experimental conditions a mg to p ratio of 1 2 1 was chosen to maximize the purity of struvite precipitation muster et al 2013 the p concentration used was typical of centrate or filtrate for post anaerobic digestion and in range of the p concentrations entering full scale struvite recovery processes battistoni et al 1998 desmidt et al 2015 solution composition excluded impurities that would impact precipitate phase and crystal size e g calcium and carbonate ions dissolved organic matter and inert particulates in order to quantify the impact of supersaturation and seed loading on struvite mass distribution and modeling accuracy 2 1 solution preparation experimental solutions were prepared by mixing aliquots of ammonium chloride and magnesium chloride with a sodium phosphate solution composed of specific quantities of mono di and tribasic sodium phosphate to obtain a specific initial thermodynamic driving force for precipitation initial chemical concentrations of the synthetic solutions were approximately maintained at 2 2 mm of total phosphate 2 64 mm of total magnesium and 50 mm of total ammonia while supersaturation was adjusted with ph the ammonium concentration in solution was significantly higher than phosphate and magnesium to reflect mg nh4 po4 ratios observed in wastewater and to promote formation of struvite over newberyite and amorphous magnesium phosphate abbona et al 1982 1984 abbona and boistelle 1979 crutchik and garrido 2011 all stocks solutions were prepared by dissolving acs grade inorganic salts nh4cl mgcl2 6h2o

2100q turbidimeter hach co usa solution turbidity measurements have been shown to correlate with the formation of struvite particles ranging from 5 to 120 μm triger et al 2012 2 3 induction time study experiments were conducted to characterize the induction time of homogeneous nucleation no seed granules in solutions at different levels of supersaturation with and without the addition of sodium hydroxide naoh although naoh is commonly used for ph adjustment in nucleation studies it was hypothesized that its addition would expedite nucleation by generating localized zones of high ph as the concentrated base is mixed into solution to test this hypothesis ten solutions were prepared with identical concentrations of total phosphate total magnesium and total ammonium five levels of supersaturation from 1 8 to 2 6 were achieved in duplicate by adjusting ph either i through naoh 1 n addition or ii by selecting different combinations of dibasic and tribasic sodium phosphate induction time has been shown to be primarily dependent on supersaturation bhuiyan et al 2008 mehta and batstone 2013 ohlinger et al 1999 using the expression 1 log t ind a log s 2 b where tind sec is the measured induction time s is supersaturation and a and b are empirical constants induction time was defined as the time taken for the ph to decrease by 0 05 below its initial value in a batch reactor as previously described mehta and batstone 2013 solution ph can be used as an indicator for precipitation since struvite formation at near neutral ph involves hpo4 2 and produces an equivalent of acid per mole of struvite formed 2 nh4 mg2 hpo4 2 nh4mgpo4 s h preliminary unseeded precipitation experiments indicated the induction time of nucleation was sensitive to the addition of naoh at lower values of supersaturation fig s1 since induction time is inversely related to supersaturation increased rate of fines production associated with naoh fig 1 may be attributed to the formation of localized zones of higher supersaturation when base was added to adjust initial ph to avoid the bias of enhanced fines production in subsequent experiments the kinetics of phosphate removal were further studied by allowing solutions to reach equilibrium without any addition of naoh neither for initial ph adjustment or ph control 2 4 kinetic experiments batch experiments were conducted to understand the impacts of seed loading and supersaturation on kinetics of phosphate removal and struvite production as fines experiments were conducted in duplicate at initial superstations si of 1 7 2 1 and 2 4 across all seed loadings of 0 g l 1 5 g l 1 15 g l 1 and 25 g l 1 struvite seeds used in this study were 0 9 mm 90 sgn in diameter and were provided by ostara vancouver canada these saturation values are intentionally low to promote secondary growth onto existing seeds to avoid spatial and temporal gradients in supersaturation from chemical addition that could promote nucleation described in 2 3 experimental solutions were allowed to reach equilibrium without maintaining a fixed level of supersaturation kinetic experiments were run for 3 h during which time all solutions reached equilibrium and were sampled at different time points for phosphate and turbidity readings at the end of the experiments struvite granules were dried in an oven at 40 c for 48 h to prevent any loss of water of crystallization from the struvite crystals ohlinger et al 1999 to determine the amount of struvite solids that precipitated onto the seeds the granules were weighed before and after each experiment the mass of fines generated in each experiment were defined as the molar difference between soluble p removal and seed growth 2 5 calculations experimental data collected in batch precipitation experiments were used to estimate struvite supersaturation as a function of time and second order kinetic rate constants for struvite precipitation h 1 the struvite precipitation potential or supersaturation s for any solution was defined by 3 s m g 2 n h 4 p o 4 3 k s p 1 3 where represents the activity of an ion and ksp is the thermodynamic solubility product the value of ksp used in this work was 5 49 10 14 pksp 13 26 mehta and batstone 2013 ohlinger et al 1998 the values of equilibrium constants and heat enthalpies for dissociation of the different species considered were taken from literature bhuiyan et al 2007 rahaman et al 2006 the van t hoff equation was used to correct the values of equilibrium constants for temperature variations and davies equation was used to find the activity coefficient of different species in the solution since struvite was the only supersaturated mineral under all experimental conditions table s1 the decrease in molar concentrations of mg2 and nh4 was assumed to be equal to the corresponding decrease in po4 3 molar concentrations matlab r2015a mathworks usa was used to calculate the value of supersaturation and solve for the concentration of each ionic species at time points for the duration of the experiment the interactions of the different ionic species and compounds considered in this study were rahaman et al 2014 mg2 nh4 po4 3 mgnh4po4 6h2o s h3po4 aq h2po4 hpo4 2 mgh2po4 mghpo4 aq mgpo4 mgoh nh3 aq h and oh the values of the kinetic rate constant for p removal were derived using regression analysis between relative supersaturation and time fig s3 a pseudo 2nd order relationship with respect to relative supersaturation was used as the aqueous concentration of ammonium nh4 was in excess relative to phosphate po4 3 and magnesium mg2 experimental data prior to reaching a steady state were used to determine the kinetic parameters as the solution reached equilibrium nelson et al 2003 the r squared values of the fits for the pseudo 2nd order kinetics plots were greater than 0 90 except for one which was 0 87 2 6 modeling analysis crystal growth modeling is critical to process development and system optimization as it allows us to traverse the design and operational landscape recently a mineral precipitation approach for struvite using eqn 4 was used while modeling a multi species system with multiple mineral precipitation processes kazadi mbamba et al 2015b 2015a based on this kinetic modeling approach plant wide models for tracking p transformations and evaluating struvite precipitation in wastewater treatment systems are being built kazadi mbamba et al 2016 solon et al 2017 we leveraged our experimental data to evaluate the validity of a prominent kinetic model eq 4 kazadi mbamba et al 2015b 2015a to understand the efficacy of this approach in predicting soluble p removal and struvite formation at high seed loadings the evaluated rate expression is as follow 4 r c r y s t k c r y s t x c r y s t σ n where rcryst is the mineral precipitation rate moles l 1 h 1 kcryst is the kinetic rate constant h 1 xcryst is the concentration of precipitate at any time moles l 1 σ is relative supersaturation σ s 1 and n is the order of the reaction this modeling approach for mineral precipitation rate has not been assessed in the presence of larger size struvite particles which are typically present in large full scale struvite reactors supersaturation values from the experimental data were used to predict the mineral precipitation rate of struvite and were then compared with the actual observed mineral precipitation rate of struvite to calculate the residuals the difference between the observed rate and predicted rate the value of n was taken to be 3 and the value of kcryst for struvite was assumed to be 3 2 h 1 as found for synthetic wastewater kazadi mbamba et al 2015b the value of xcryst was assumed to be constant throughout the length of all batch experiments since the concentrations of struvite that precipitated in the experiments were negligible as compared to the concentrations of the struvite seed crystals 4 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 p removal and struvite solids distribution the extent of soluble p removal in batch experiments was dependent on initial supersaturation si while the distribution of struvite production was dependent on both si and seed loading total solution phosphate removal ranged from 0 22 0 04 mm at the lowest initial supersaturation si 1 7 to 0 84 0 03 mm at the highest si 2 4 starting from an initial phosphate concentration of 2 2 mm as po4 3 in all batch experiments fig 2 left as described in section 2 4 experimental solutions were allowed to approach equilibrium without maintaining a fixed level of supersaturation average final across all experiments s 1 2 0 02 as a result total p removal was comparatively lower 10 38 than values observed for full scale processes 80 90 desmidt et al 2015 in which chemicals are added naoh and mgcl2 to maintain a constant level of supersaturation fines represented the majority of struvite solids formed in all but two experimental conditions si 1 7 at 15 g l 1 and 25 g l 1 fig 2 while the percentage of struvite solids attributed to secondary growth of seed crystals increased with seed loading for each value of si observed increases in p removal was primarily attributed to the production of new particles fig 2 right high seed loading can be used to exert control over secondary crystal growth fig 2a right but supersaturation must be kept low to minimize fines production 3 2 effects of seed loading and initial supersaturation on kinetics and fines production the percentage of total phosphate removal associated with struvite fines was dependent on both seed loading and initial supersaturation fig 3 a higher seed loadings and lower values of initial supersaturation maximized secondary crystal growth on struvite seeds while minimizing the production of suspended struvite fines in the solution higher recoveries of the struvite formed via secondary crystal growth on the seed crystals were observed at the cost of lower soluble phosphate removal fig 2 left due to slower removal kinetics fig 3b for example the highest recovery of the struvite formed via secondary crystal growth on the seed crystals was 69 31 1 75 at a seed loading of 25 g l 1 and initial supersaturation si of 1 7 fig 2 right but the total phosphate removed at this condition was only 0 2 mm fig 2 left the kinetic rate of phosphate removal via struvite precipitation also exhibited dependence on both seed loading and initial supersaturation fig 3b the kinetic rate constant appeared to plateau as seed loading was increased at higher values of initial supersaturation si 2 4 figs s5 and s2 at these conditions kinetics of p removal was governed by fines production instead of secondary crystal growth fig 2c the greatest shift in the kinetic precipitation rate was observed at higher intitial supersaturation si 2 1 during the transition from no seeds to a seed loading of 5 g l 1 and can be attributed to an observed decrease in the total induction time fig 4 a the change in seed loading concentration from 0 g l 1 to 5 g l 1 at si of 1 7 eliminated the precipitation lag phase that was observed in the absence of seed crystals fig 4b these results indicate that the designation of metastability for primary nucleation is not applicable in the presence of seed crystals fig 4b total induction time also showed a waning dependence on both seed loading and initial supersaturation fig 4a these findings elucidate a potential important design and operation trade off systems designed to optimize struvite recovery at higher seed loadings and lower initial supersaturations may require longer residence times than those that promote rapid removal through heterogeneous nucleation of fines 3 3 engineering design implications assuming our results translate to full scale reactors recovery of fines will broadly dictate the struvite collection efficiency of a process ostara pearl upflow fluidized bed reactors which represent the majority of operational full scale struvite recovery systems work at conditions of high seed loading and lower values of supersaturation characterized by target ph values as low as 6 9 and 7 2 baur et al 2008 britton et al 2009 thus maximizing the collection efficiency but if struvite fines are produced the potential for process disruption could increase because of the associated risks with fines washout from the high recycle rate of fluidized bed reactors since the kinetics of p removal and production of fines were most sensitive to saturation at high seed loadings fig 3a and b addition of magnesium and base to maintain saturation likely creates spatial and temporal variations in precipitation rate and mechanism struvite precipitation in the nuresys process occurs at a higher ph range of 8 8 5 and supersaturation assuming similar concentrations desmidt et al 2015 ye et al 2017 indicating that both fines production and removal kinetics may be higher in this system despite this difference nuresys systems achieve similar removal 80 90 and produce struvite particles in the range of 1 3 mm desmidt et al 2015 moerman 2011 which is similar to values reported for ostara pearl fbrs 1 4 5 mm desmidt et al 2015 grooms et al 2015 since the nuresys system promotes formation and capture with a hydrocyclone the risk of washout could be lower than fluidized bed systems most importantly recovery of fines has not been reported for each of these systems and should be a primary metric during pilot scale technology evaluations 3 4 precipitation kinetics and modeling the values of second order kinetic rate constants observed in this study 1 6 11 5 h 1 which varied with seed loading and initial supersaturation were in range and similar to those observed others in both synthetic and real wastewaters for struvite precipitation the values of kinetic rate constant svary by more than an order of magnitude in the literature table 1 the reason for the large reported range of kinetic rate constants 2 2 125 h 1 can likely be attributed to variations in wastewater aqueous and solid phase compositions the presence of ionic ligands calcium carbonate organic ligands etc can reduce precipitation rate by forming complexes with magnesium and phosphates and lowering the apparent supersaturation moerman 2011 2011 musvoto et al 2000 the formation of non struvite minerals amorphous calcium phosphate acp calcite magnesium carbonate dicalcium phosphate dihydrate etc can further also influence struvite production kinetics le corre et al 2005 muster et al 2013 since the rate of struvite precipitation in anaerobic digestion effluent appears to exhibit an inverse relationship to organic solids concentration it is possible that sorption of organic contaminants increases the activation energy of secondary crystal growth and heterogeneous nucleation table 1 a recent study showed that micro molar concentrations of alginate a model polysaccharide can inhibit crystal growth by forming electrostatic bonds with struvite surface functional groups wei et al 2017 this could also stabilize fines increasing the risk of washout in high rate systems future work should focus on the impact of specific impurities on precipitation kinetics and stability of fines modeling the struvite production with first order dependence on seed loading eq 4 will severely over predict the rate of precipitation at higher seed loadings if seed diameter and loadings are large residuals between predicted and observed mineral precipitation rate fig 5 fig s8 were significant for all seeded conditions and increased with seed loading when the mass seed crystals were included in the growth equation simulated rates of mineral precipitation predict complete removal of the total phosphate 2 2 mm in all batch experiments within 7 8 min at 5 g l 1 si 1 7 to 0 15 min at 25 g l 1 si 2 4 this is in contradiction to our experimental results in fig 2 fig s2 which show only a partial removal of total phosphate across all seed loadings and initial supersaturations after 180 min the discrepancy between predicted p removal and experimental data also stems from our observation that the kinetic rate constant for struvite precipitation is not fixed and exhibits dependence on both seed loading and initial supersaturation mineral seed loadings used in the batch experiments in this study were comparatively higher than the experiments used to calibrate and validate eq 4 0 085 g l 1 0 1 g l 1 kazadi mbamba et al 2015b mehta and batstone 2013 also batch experiments in this study were conducted with a seed size of 0 9 mm sourced from working ostara pearl reactors while others have worked with moderately lower seed sizes such as 53 297 μm shih et al 2017 250 μm rahaman et al 2008 and 30 50 μm kazadi mbamba et al 2015b mehta and batstone 2013 which does not reflect the reality of full scale p recovery processes in which struvite crystals as large as 4 5 mm in size represent the majority of total mass in the reactor it is possible that distinguishing between the mass of crystals and fines within a crystallization reactor may improve the predictive capabilities of mass dependent models to accurately predict both phosphate removal rate and precipitate recovery struvite crystallization models must distinguish between the relative abundance of high settling velocity seed crystals and fine crystallites that are difficult to capture since fines production may be responsible for the majority of p removal lumping nucleation or fines kinetics into a crystal growth rate expressions based on seed crystal diameter rahaman et al 2014 will only accurately predict p removal and growth if i secondary growth dictates kinetics or ii fines dictate kinetics but agglomeration onto seeds is so rapid that fines are not observed in the system efforts have been made to describe precipitation in physio chemical models using monod style mineral rate expressions for different individual pathways of precipitation lizarralde et al 2015 incorporating switching functions into the expressions of nucleation crystal growth agglomeration and breakage may give more dynamic control over the simultaneous reactions taking place in a system depending upon which pathway is dominant however model development must also consider the constraints of characterizing individual precipitation pathways in the field in the laboratory dynamic light scattering particle counting and atomic force microscopy can be used to understand precipitation pathways quantify nucleation kinetics and characterize particle size distributions but these techniques will not be widely available to calibrate a model in the field a more realistic approach may be to first study kinetics and particle dynamics at lab scale and use settling column tests and total solids concentration to estimate particle size distributions and the balance between secondary crystal growth and fines formation at full scale 4 conclusions these results show how variations in seed loading and initial supersaturation conditions can have a significant impact on the rate of phosphate removal the role of primary versus secondary struvite crystal growth and the validity of mass dependent kinetic precipitation models the key findings are as follow formation of struvite fines was observed in majority of the experiments and found to govern the rate of struvite precipitation p removal kinetics and fines formation exhibited dependence on both seed loading and initial supersaturation the presence of seed granules indirectly increased the rate of struvite precipitation by reducing nucleation induction time a key challenge for the design operation and modeling of struvite recovery processes will be to understand the dynamics of fine particles in the presence of larger seed crystals and soluble ligands the pathway towards a consensus struvite precipitation process model must incorporate some form particle size distribution while also considering the constraints of model calibration and validation at the plant scale by understanding the dynamic interactions between secondary growth processes and fines formation and tuning operational parameters of seed crystal loading and initial supersaturation kinetic models for struvite precipitation can be better used to optimize reactor design based upon the balance needed between struvite removal and recovery understanding the impacts of ionic ligands organic contaminants and co precipitation products in sidestream wastewater on the precipitation kinetics and fines stability will also be critical in the meantime accounting for the production and capture of fines must be incorporated into the capital and

19757,to reduce intra plant nutrient cycling and recover phosphorus p fertilizers from nutrient rich sidestreams wastewater utilities increasingly elect to employ struvite precipitation processes without a clear understanding of the inherent tradeoffs associated with specific design and operating decisions specifically the impact of reactor conditions on struvite crystallization rate and distribution between formation of fines particles and secondary growth onto large diameter seed crystals represent critical knowledge gaps limiting the predictive capabilities of existing process models in this work the relative impacts of initial supersaturation si and seed loading on p removal kinetics and struvite solids distribution were investigated in experiments conducted at different levels of initial supersaturation 1 7 2 4 and seed loading 0 25 g l 1 struvite fines represented the majority of phosphate solids formed in 10 of 12 conditions while total p removal was dependent on si and primarily attributed to formation of fines the concentration of struvite seed granules had a significant impact on the rate of p removal struvite seed granules increased the rate of precipitation by reducing induction time of primary nucleation of struvite fines secondary crystal growth represented the majority of struvite solids formed at high seed loading and low si but presented the tradeoff of low total removal and low rate of removal to convey the significance of these findings on process modeling we show how a prominent kinetic model with a first order dependency on solid struvite concentration over predicts p removal rate when total mass is dominated by large diameter seeds 0 9 mm this works reveals the critical role of struvite fines in p removal and highlights the need to account for their production and kinetic importance in struvite process design and operation graphical abstract image 1 keywords struvite precipitation nucleation phosphorus

dissolve in downstream processes baur et al 2008 crutchik et al 2017 grooms et al 2015 excess production and loss of struvite fines from precipitation reactors can also affect the validity of modeling assumptions and economic predictions for struvite crystal recovery and reuse as evidenced by the multitude of models for struvite crystallization that exist in the literature the research community has yet to reach consensus on a kinetic process model that accurately and efficiently predicts both soluble phosphate removal and the distribution of crystallite growth between seeds and fines struvite crystallization rate has been defined using several approaches power law correlation with relative supersaturation kofina and koutsoukos 2005 rahaman et al 2014 dependence on crystals mass ratio specific surface area of crystals and relative supersaturation mehta and batstone 2013 while some have neglected or lumped the nucleation and aggregation kinetics into crystal growth rate

galbraith et al 2014 lizarralde et al 2015 coupling soluble p removal to particle size and surface area dynamics while intuitive introduces the need for a particle counting device with a broad detection limit and several fitting parameters that cannot be externally calibrated both of which limit the applicability of these approaches at full scale recently a computationally lean modeling approach with a first order dependence on struvite concentration and relative supersaturation kazadi mbamba et al 2015b was recently integrated with a plant wide model to project the significant benefits of sidestream struvite total nutrient removal capacity and plant effluent p concentration kazadi mbamba et al 2016 to evaluate if this approach has merit for full scale struvite recovery systems the model must be validated with struvite seed loadings and particle diameters that reflect full scale operation the objective of this work was to investigate the influence of solution supersaturation and seed crystal loading on struvite solids distribution i e fines versus secondary crystal growth and precipitation kinetics batch experiments were conducted using synthetic wastewater containing struvite forming ions at concentrations typical of anaerobic digester supernatant and sludge centrate at multiple levels of seed loading and initial struvite supersaturation si experimental results were used to explore and understand potential tradeoffs between removal and recovery in struvite precipitation processes experimental data were also used to better understand the efficacy and validity of current modeling techniques and identify a path forward for model development and process design 2 materials and methods experiments were designed to create an initial driving force for precipitation supersaturation eq 3 and measure the amount of struvite that forms onto existing seed crystals struvite granules collected from a full scale crystallization reactor or through the production of fine particles as the system approaches equilibrium as described below section 2 4 chemical base was excluded from all experiments to reduce the impacts of localized supersaturation on fines production due to incomplete mixing all experiments were conducted at room temperature 21 23 c in 1 l beakers and a mixing speed of 300 rpm was used to be consistent with other nucleation studies mehta and batstone 2013 ohlinger et al 1999 experimental data were used to quantify reaction kinetics of struvite formation section 2 5 and evaluate the validity of a prominent precipitation process model under high seed loading section 2 6 for all experiments initial chemical concentrations of the synthetic solutions were 2 2 mm of po4 3 2 6 mm of mg2 and 50 mm of nh4 given that ammonium was in excess for all experimental conditions a mg to p ratio of 1 2 1 was chosen to maximize the purity of struvite precipitation muster et al 2013 the p concentration used was typical of centrate or filtrate for post anaerobic digestion and in range of the p concentrations entering full scale struvite recovery processes battistoni et al 1998 desmidt et al 2015 solution composition excluded impurities that would impact precipitate phase and crystal size e g calcium and carbonate ions dissolved organic matter and inert particulates in order to quantify the impact of supersaturation and seed loading on struvite mass distribution and modeling accuracy 2 1 solution preparation experimental solutions were prepared by mixing aliquots of ammonium chloride and magnesium chloride with a sodium phosphate solution composed of specific quantities of mono di and tribasic sodium phosphate to obtain a specific initial thermodynamic driving force for precipitation initial chemical concentrations of the synthetic solutions were approximately maintained at 2 2 mm of total phosphate 2 64 mm of total magnesium and 50 mm of total ammonia while supersaturation was adjusted with ph the ammonium concentration in solution was significantly higher than phosphate and magnesium to reflect mg nh4 po4 ratios observed in wastewater and to promote formation of struvite over newberyite

2100q turbidimeter hach co usa solution turbidity measurements have been shown to correlate with the formation of struvite particles ranging from 5 to 120 μm triger et al 2012 2 3 induction time study experiments were conducted to characterize the induction time of homogeneous nucleation no seed granules in solutions at different levels of supersaturation with and without the addition of sodium hydroxide naoh although naoh is commonly used for ph adjustment in nucleation studies it was hypothesized that its addition would expedite nucleation by generating localized zones of high ph as the concentrated base is mixed into solution to test this hypothesis ten solutions were prepared with identical concentrations of total phosphate total magnesium and total ammonium five levels of supersaturation from 1 8 to 2 6 were achieved in duplicate by adjusting ph either i through naoh 1 n addition or ii by selecting different combinations of dibasic and tribasic sodium phosphate induction time has been shown to be primarily dependent on supersaturation bhuiyan et al 2008 mehta and batstone 2013 ohlinger et al 1999 using the expression 1 log t ind a log s 2 b where tind sec is the measured induction time s is supersaturation and a and b are empirical constants induction time was defined as the time taken for the ph to decrease by 0 05 below its initial value in a batch reactor as previously described mehta and batstone 2013 solution ph can be used as an indicator for precipitation since struvite formation at near neutral ph involves hpo4 2 and produces an equivalent of acid per mole of struvite formed 2 nh4 mg2 hpo4 2 nh4mgpo4 s h preliminary unseeded precipitation experiments indicated the induction time of nucleation was sensitive to the addition of naoh at lower values of supersaturation fig s1 since induction time is inversely related to supersaturation increased rate of fines production associated with naoh fig 1 may be attributed to the formation of localized zones of higher supersaturation when base was added to adjust initial ph to avoid the bias of enhanced fines production in subsequent experiments the kinetics of phosphate removal were further studied by allowing solutions to reach equilibrium without any addition of naoh neither for initial ph adjustment or ph control 2 4 kinetic experiments batch experiments were conducted to understand the impacts of seed loading and supersaturation on kinetics of phosphate removal and struvite production as fines experiments were conducted in duplicate at initial superstations si of 1 7 2 1 and 2 4 across all seed loadings of 0 g l 1 5 g l 1 15 g l 1 and 25 g l 1 struvite seeds used in this study were 0 9 mm 90 sgn in diameter and were provided by ostara vancouver canada these saturation values are intentionally low to promote secondary growth onto existing seeds to avoid spatial and temporal gradients in supersaturation from chemical addition that could promote nucleation described in 2 3 experimental solutions were allowed to reach equilibrium without maintaining a fixed level of supersaturation kinetic experiments were run for 3 h during which time all solutions reached equilibrium and were sampled at different time points for phosphate and turbidity readings at the end of the experiments struvite granules were dried in an oven at 40 c for 48 h to prevent any loss of water of crystallization from the struvite crystals ohlinger et al 1999 to determine the amount of struvite solids that precipitated onto the seeds the granules were weighed before and after each experiment the mass of fines generated in each experiment were defined as the molar difference between soluble p removal and seed growth 2 5 calculations experimental data collected in batch precipitation experiments were used to estimate struvite supersaturation as a function of time and second order kinetic rate constants for struvite precipitation h 1 the struvite precipitation potential or supersaturation s for any solution was defined by 3 s m g 2 n h 4 p o 4 3 k s p 1 3 where represents the activity of an ion and ksp is the thermodynamic solubility product the value of ksp used in this work was 5 49 10 14 pksp 13 26 mehta and batstone 2013 ohlinger et al 1998 the values of equilibrium constants and heat enthalpies for dissociation of the different species considered were taken from literature bhuiyan et al 2007 rahaman et al 2006 the van t hoff equation was used to correct the values of equilibrium constants for temperature variations and davies equation was used to find the activity coefficient of different species in the solution since struvite was the only supersaturated mineral under all experimental conditions table s1 the decrease in molar concentrations of mg2 and nh4 was assumed to be equal to the corresponding decrease in po4 3 molar concentrations matlab r2015a mathworks usa was used to calculate the value of supersaturation and solve for the concentration of each ionic species at time points for the duration of the experiment the interactions of the different ionic species and compounds considered in this study were rahaman et al 2014 mg2

relative supersaturation and time fig s3 a pseudo 2nd order relationship with respect to relative supersaturation was used as the aqueous concentration of ammonium nh4 was in excess relative to phosphate po4 3 and magnesium mg2 experimental data prior to reaching a steady state were used to determine the kinetic parameters as the solution reached equilibrium nelson et al 2003 the r squared values of the fits for the pseudo 2nd order kinetics plots were greater than 0 90 except for one which was 0 87 2 6 modeling analysis crystal growth modeling is critical to process development and system optimization as it allows us to traverse the design and operational landscape recently a mineral precipitation approach for struvite using eqn 4 was used while modeling a multi species system with multiple mineral precipitation processes kazadi mbamba et al 2015b 2015a based on this kinetic modeling approach plant wide models for tracking p transformations and evaluating struvite precipitation in wastewater treatment systems are being built kazadi mbamba et al 2016 solon et al 2017 we leveraged our experimental data to evaluate the validity of a prominent kinetic model eq 4 kazadi mbamba et al 2015b 2015a to understand the efficacy of this approach in predicting soluble p removal and struvite formation at high seed loadings the evaluated rate expression is as follow 4 r c r y s t k c r y s t x c r y s t σ n where rcryst is the mineral precipitation rate moles l 1 h 1 kcryst is the kinetic rate constant h 1 xcryst is the concentration of precipitate at any time moles l 1 σ is relative supersaturation σ s 1 and n is the order of the reaction this modeling approach for mineral precipitation rate has not been assessed in the presence of larger size struvite particles which are typically present in large full scale struvite reactors supersaturation values from the experimental data were used to predict the mineral precipitation rate of struvite and were then compared with the actual observed mineral precipitation rate of struvite to calculate the residuals the difference between the observed rate and predicted rate the value of n was taken to be 3 and the value of kcryst for struvite was assumed to be 3 2 h 1 as found for synthetic wastewater kazadi mbamba et al 2015b the value of xcryst was assumed to be constant throughout the length of all batch experiments since the concentrations of struvite that precipitated in the experiments were negligible as compared to the concentrations of the struvite seed crystals 4 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 p removal and struvite solids distribution the extent of soluble p removal in batch experiments was dependent on initial supersaturation si while the distribution of struvite production was dependent on both si and seed loading total solution phosphate removal ranged from 0 22 0 04 mm at the lowest initial supersaturation si 1 7 to 0 84 0 03 mm at the highest si 2 4 starting from an initial phosphate concentration of 2 2 mm as po4 3 in all batch experiments fig 2 left as described in section 2 4 experimental solutions were allowed to approach equilibrium without maintaining a fixed level of supersaturation average final across all experiments s 1 2 0 02 as a result total p removal was comparatively lower 10 38 than values observed for full scale processes 80 90 desmidt et al 2015 in which chemicals are added naoh and mgcl2 to maintain a constant level of supersaturation fines represented the majority of struvite solids formed in all but two experimental conditions si 1 7 at 15 g l 1 and 25 g l 1 fig 2 while the percentage of struvite solids attributed to secondary growth of seed crystals increased with seed loading for each value of si observed increases in p removal was primarily attributed to the production of new particles fig 2 right high seed loading can be used to exert control over secondary crystal growth fig 2a right but supersaturation must be kept low to minimize fines production 3 2 effects of seed loading and initial supersaturation on kinetics and fines production the percentage of total phosphate removal associated with struvite fines was dependent on both seed loading and initial supersaturation fig 3 a higher seed loadings and lower values of initial supersaturation maximized secondary crystal growth on struvite seeds while minimizing the production of suspended struvite fines in the solution higher recoveries of the struvite formed via secondary crystal growth on the seed crystals were observed at the cost of lower soluble phosphate removal fig 2 left due to slower removal kinetics fig 3b for example the highest recovery of the struvite formed via secondary crystal growth on the seed crystals was 69 31 1 75 at a seed loading of 25 g l 1 and initial supersaturation si of 1 7 fig 2 right but the total phosphate removed at this condition was only 0 2 mm fig 2 left the kinetic rate of phosphate removal via struvite precipitation also exhibited dependence on both seed loading and initial supersaturation fig 3b the kinetic rate constant appeared to plateau as seed loading was increased at higher values of initial supersaturation si 2 4 figs s5 and s2 at these conditions kinetics of p removal was governed by fines production instead of secondary crystal growth fig 2c the greatest shift in the kinetic precipitation rate was observed at higher intitial supersaturation si 2 1 during the transition from no seeds to a seed loading of 5 g l 1 and can be attributed to an observed decrease in the total induction time fig 4 a the change in seed loading concentration from 0 g l 1 to 5 g l 1 at si of 1 7 eliminated the precipitation lag phase that was observed in the absence of seed crystals fig 4b these results indicate that the designation of metastability for primary nucleation is not applicable in the presence of seed crystals fig 4b total induction time also showed a waning dependence on both seed loading and initial supersaturation fig 4a these findings elucidate a potential important design and operation trade off systems designed to optimize struvite recovery at higher seed loadings and lower initial supersaturations may require longer residence times than those that promote rapid removal through heterogeneous nucleation of fines 3 3 engineering design implications assuming our results translate to full scale reactors recovery of fines will broadly dictate the struvite collection efficiency of a process ostara pearl upflow fluidized bed reactors which represent the majority of operational full scale struvite recovery systems work at conditions of high seed loading and lower values of supersaturation characterized by target ph values as low as 6 9 and 7 2 baur et al 2008 britton et al 2009 thus maximizing the collection efficiency but if struvite fines are produced the potential for process disruption could increase because of the associated risks with fines washout from the high recycle rate of fluidized bed reactors since the kinetics of p removal and production of fines were most sensitive to saturation at high seed loadings fig 3a and b addition of magnesium and base to maintain saturation likely creates spatial and temporal variations in precipitation rate and mechanism struvite precipitation in the nuresys process occurs at a higher ph range of 8 8 5 and supersaturation assuming similar concentrations desmidt et al 2015 ye et al 2017 indicating that both fines production and removal kinetics may be higher in this system despite this difference nuresys systems achieve similar removal 80 90 and produce struvite particles in the range of 1 3 mm desmidt et al 2015 moerman 2011 which is similar to values reported for ostara pearl fbrs 1 4 5 mm desmidt et al 2015 grooms et al 2015 since the nuresys system promotes formation and capture with a hydrocyclone the risk of washout could be lower than fluidized bed systems most importantly recovery of fines has not been reported for each of these systems and should be a primary metric during pilot scale technology evaluations 3 4 precipitation kinetics and modeling the values of second order kinetic rate constants observed in this study 1 6 11 5 h 1 which varied with seed loading and initial supersaturation were in range and similar to those observed others in both synthetic and real wastewaters for struvite precipitation the values of kinetic rate constant svary by more than an order of magnitude in the literature table 1 the reason for the large reported range of kinetic rate constants 2 2 125 h 1 can likely be attributed to variations in wastewater aqueous and solid phase compositions the presence of ionic ligands calcium carbonate organic ligands etc can reduce precipitation rate by forming complexes with magnesium and phosphates and lowering the apparent supersaturation moerman 2011 2011 musvoto et al 2000 the formation of non struvite minerals amorphous calcium phosphate acp calcite magnesium carbonate dicalcium phosphate dihydrate etc can further also influence struvite production kinetics le corre et al 2005 muster et al 2013 since the rate of struvite precipitation in anaerobic digestion effluent appears to exhibit an inverse relationship to organic solids concentration it is possible that sorption of organic contaminants increases the activation energy of secondary crystal growth and heterogeneous nucleation table 1 a recent study showed that micro molar concentrations of alginate a model polysaccharide can inhibit crystal growth by forming electrostatic bonds with struvite surface functional groups wei et al 2017 this could also stabilize fines increasing the risk of washout in high rate systems future work should focus on the impact of specific impurities on precipitation kinetics and stability of fines modeling the struvite production with first order dependence on seed loading eq 4 will severely over predict the rate of precipitation at higher seed loadings if seed diameter and loadings are large residuals between predicted and observed mineral precipitation rate fig 5 fig s8 were significant for all seeded conditions and increased with seed loading when the mass seed crystals were included in the growth equation simulated rates of mineral precipitation predict complete removal of the total phosphate 2 2 mm in all batch experiments within 7 8 min at 5 g l 1 si 1 7 to 0 15 min at 25 g l 1 si 2 4 this is in contradiction to our experimental results in fig 2 fig s2 which show only a partial removal of total phosphate across all seed loadings and initial supersaturations after 180 min the discrepancy between predicted p removal and experimental data also stems from our observation that the kinetic rate constant for struvite precipitation is not fixed and exhibits dependence on both seed loading and initial supersaturation mineral seed loadings used in the batch experiments in this study were comparatively higher than the experiments used to calibrate and validate eq 4 0 085 g l 1 0 1 g l 1 kazadi mbamba et al 2015b mehta and batstone 2013 also batch experiments in this study were conducted with a seed size of 0 9 mm sourced from working ostara pearl reactors while others have worked with moderately lower seed sizes such as 53 297 μm shih et al 2017 250 μm rahaman et al 2008 and 30 50 μm kazadi mbamba et al 2015b mehta and batstone 2013 which does not reflect the reality of full scale p recovery processes in which struvite crystals as large as 4 5 mm in size represent the majority of total mass in the reactor it is possible that distinguishing between the mass of crystals and fines within a crystallization reactor may improve the predictive capabilities of mass dependent models to accurately predict both phosphate removal rate and precipitate recovery struvite crystallization models must distinguish between the relative abundance of high settling velocity seed crystals and fine crystallites that are difficult to capture since fines production may be responsible for the majority of p removal lumping nucleation or fines kinetics into a crystal growth rate expressions based on seed crystal diameter rahaman et al 2014 will only accurately predict p removal and growth if i secondary growth dictates kinetics or ii fines dictate kinetics but agglomeration onto seeds is so rapid that fines are not observed in the system efforts have been made to describe precipitation in physio chemical models using monod style mineral rate expressions for different individual pathways of precipitation lizarralde et al 2015 incorporating switching functions into the expressions of nucleation crystal growth agglomeration and breakage may give more dynamic control over the simultaneous reactions taking place in a system depending upon which pathway is dominant however model development must also consider the constraints of characterizing individual precipitation pathways in the field in the laboratory dynamic light scattering particle counting and atomic force microscopy can be used to understand precipitation pathways quantify nucleation kinetics and characterize particle size distributions but these techniques will not be widely available to calibrate a model in the field a more realistic approach may be to first study kinetics and particle dynamics at lab scale and use settling column tests and total solids concentration to estimate particle size distributions and the balance between secondary crystal growth and fines formation at full scale 4 conclusions these results show how variations in seed loading and initial supersaturation conditions can have a significant impact on the rate of phosphate removal the role of primary versus secondary struvite crystal growth and the validity of mass dependent kinetic precipitation models the key findings are as follow formation of struvite fines was observed in majority of the experiments and found to govern the rate of struvite precipitation p removal kinetics and fines formation exhibited dependence on both seed loading and initial supersaturation the presence of seed granules indirectly increased the rate of struvite precipitation by reducing nucleation induction time a key challenge for the design operation and modeling of struvite recovery processes will be to understand the dynamics of fine particles in the presence of larger seed crystals and soluble ligands the pathway towards a consensus struvite precipitation process model must incorporate some form particle size distribution while also considering the constraints of model calibration and validation at the plant scale by understanding the dynamic interactions between secondary growth processes and fines formation and tuning operational parameters of seed crystal loading and initial supersaturation kinetic models for struvite precipitation can be better used to optimize reactor design based upon the balance needed between struvite removal and recovery understanding the impacts of ionic ligands organic contaminants and co precipitation products in sidestream wastewater on the precipitation kinetics and fines stability will also be critical in the meantime accounting for the production and capture of fines must be incorporated into the capital and

19758,thermal and hydrothermal treatments are promising techniques for sewage sludge management that can potentially facilitate safe waste disposal energy recovery and nutrient recovery recycling content and speciation of heavy metals in the treatment products affect the potential environmental risks upon sludge disposal and or application of the treatment products therefore it is important to study the speciation transformation of heavy metals and the effects of treatment conditions by combining synchrotron x ray spectroscopy microscopy analysis and sequential chemical extraction this

carbonization htc a representative hydrothermal treatment technique spectroscopy analysis revealed enhanced sulfidation of zn and cu by anaerobic digestion and htc treatments as compared to desulfidation by pyrolysis overall changes in the chemical speciation and matrix properties led to reduced mobility of zn and cu in the treatment products these results provide insights into the reaction mechanisms during pyrolysis and htc treatments of sludges and can help evaluate the environmental health risks associated with the metals in the treatment products graphical abstract image 1

the high water content large volume and the presence of organic and inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals pesticides herbicides pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and pathogens rogers 1996 westerhoff et al 2015 on the other hand sludges also contain large amounts of energy i e carbon c and nutrients i e nitrogen n and phosphorus p and have great potential for resource recovery koppelaar and weikard 2013 withers et al 2015 however current waste management strategies have intrinsic problems that result in limited resource utilization of sludges in the united states 35 of the sewage sludges are recycled in agriculture 30 are disposed in landfill 15 are thermally disposed and the rest are disposed by other means christodoulou and stamatelatou 2016 high landfill disposal costs associated with transport and land availability make this option less favorable strict regulations inhibit direct land application of sludges due to concerns with soil contamination and related environmental and human health risks christodoulou and stamatelatou 2016 with the global interests in societal and environmental sustainability there are urgent needs for the integration of new technologies and strategies into current sludge management systems spinosa 2004 wang et al 2015 in recent years thermal and hydrothermal treatments of sewage sludges have emerged as sustainable treatment techniques because they have the potential to simultaneously target environmental protection energy recovery and nutrient recovery recycling barber 2016 wang and li 2015 these treatments can degrade pathogens decompose organic contaminants and reduce waste volume thus serving as excellent sanitation and waste management options escala et al 2012 vom eyser et al 2015a vom eyser et al 2015b two representative thermal and hydrothermal treatment techniques are pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization htc respectively the treatment products chars including pyrochar from pyrolysis and hydrochar from hydrothermal treatments are potential stand alone fuel sources bridle and pritchard 2004 kim et al 2014b zhao et al 2014 chars can also be applied as soil amendments for contaminant remediation for improving soil quality or as fertilizers atkinson et al 2010 hossain et al 2010 malghani et al 2013 overall applications of thermal and hydrothermal techniques have strong potential in mitigating the environmental burdens of sludge management and enhancing societal sustainability properties and functionality of the treatment products are largely governed by the composition and speciation of elements embedded the concentration and speciation of heavy metals are relevant to environmental risks associated with the disposal and applications of sludge derived products since heavy metal speciation largely determines their mobility and availability lake et al 1984 reeder et al 2006 many previous studies have examined the behavior of heavy metals during thermal and hydrothermal treatments of sludges primarily focusing on heavy metal phase distribution in solid liquid and gas phases or mobility transformation using empirically defined sequential chemical extraction methods huang yuan 2016 jin et al 2016 leng et al 2014 li et al 2012 shao et al 2015 shi et al 2013 wu et al 2016 yuan et al 2011 2015 zhang et al 2016 however chemical extraction is an indirect method and the obtained fractions do not necessarily correlate with the chemical species targeted by a specific extraction step metal reaction with the extracting solutions can also potentially cause alterations or transformations of metal speciation much still remains unknown on the detailed speciation of heavy metals and the effects of treatment conditions during thermal and hydrothermal treatments of sludges heavy metals in sludges can exist in diverse physical and chemical forms for example cu and zn were found to exist as sulfides phosphates organic complexes and iron mineral associated species with sizes ranging from nano to micrometers donner et al 2011 2012 kim et al 2014a lombi et al 2012 ma et al 2014a synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy xas is a non destructive technique that can provide detailed metal speciation information in complex heterogeneous environmental samples by combining xas and sequential extraction one can potentially obtain in depth information on metal speciation and mobility that cannot be achieved by sequential chemical extraction alone although recent studies have characterized cu and zn speciation transformation during traditional treatments such as aging chemical amendments and anaerobic digestions using these techniques donner et al 2011 2012 legros et al 2017 little is known about the transformation of these species during thermal and hydrothermal treatments in this study activated and anaerobically digested sewage sludges from a municipal wastewater treatment plant were treated with pyrolysis and htc at different temperatures as previously discussed pyrolysis and htc are representative thermal and hydrothermal techniques respectively and their applications to sludge treatment have been extensively studied escala et al 2013 manara and zabaniotou 2012 wang et al 2014 the speciation and mobility of cu and zn two abundant heavy metals in sewage sludges were characterized using sequential extraction bulk x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and coupled micro x ray fluorescence μ xrf imaging and absorption spectroscopy μ xas particularly the use of microanalysis enabled the characterization of particulate forms of these metals and cross validation of bulk analysis results from this work can improve our understanding of the thermochemical behaviors of these elements in sludges and also provide fundamental information for evaluating heavy metal mobility and environmental risks when the treatment products are applied 2 experimental approaches 2 1 sample collection sewage sludges were collected from f wayne hill water resources center gwinnett county atlanta ga usa which collects and treats municipal sewage from the county this treatment plant has primary physical secondary activated sludge and tertiary membrane filtration and ozonation treatment units 10 ppm of al is added to the clarifiers to facilitate sludge aggregation and settling and 25 ppm of fecl3 is added in the tertiary process for phosphate removal excess activated sludge and sludge from primary treatment unit are combined into anaerobic digester for biogas production and most of the biosolids are disposed in landfill activated sludge is the excess sludge from the secondary clarifier and anaerobically digested sludge hereafter referred to as anaerobic sludge was collected from the outlet of anaerobic digester the activated sludge was further enriched by centrifugation and stored at 20 c while the anaerobically digested sludge was stored at 20 c without pretreatments for pyrolysis a portion of the samples was freeze dried before treatments for htc frozen samples were thawed at room temperature prior to treatments 2 2 pyrolysis and htc treatment of sludges pyrolysis of the sewage sludges was performed in a quartz tube furnace thermo scientific ma usa under n2 flow 1 ml s at 250 and 450 c with a heating and cooling rate of 200 c h and a duration at the target temperature of 4 h these two temperatures represent the low and middle temperature range of thermal treatments at which mass remains mostly in solid phase table 1 although low temperature pyrolysis treatment is also known as torrefaction for simplicity treatments at both temperatures are hereafter referred to as pyrolysis for each treatment condition freeze dried sludges 1 0 g was added to a crucible and inserted into the glass tube the products are referred to as pyrochars htc treatments of both sludges were performed in the presence of deionized water di with a solid liquid ratio of 1 9 w w and ph around 6 6 to achieve this 4 g of the sludges equivalent to 1 g dried mass and 6 g di water were mixed in a 20 ml teflon lined stainless steel hydrothermal reactor parr instrument il usa the reactor was sealed and heated in an oven at 175 or 225 c for 16 h then allowed to cool down to 50 c overnight in an oven solid hydrochars produced from htc were collected by centrifugation and dried at 50 c for at least 24 h until no further weight loss all treatments were processed in duplicate 2 3 bulk x ray absorption spectroscopy xas cu and zn k edge xas analysis of raw and treated sludge samples and reference

conducted on the normalized sample spectra to determine the number of components needed for obtaining reasonable fits using the corresponding reference compound spectra library target transformation tt was conducted to determine appropriate candidate compounds linear combination fitting lcf was conducted on both xanes 20 to 100 ev and exafs 2 5 11 5 å 1 regions combinations of tt determined candidate compounds were used and the goodness of fit was determined by r factor fits with smallest r factors were used 2 6 sequential extraction both raw sludges and their chars were subjected to sequential extraction using the three step community bureau of reference bcr procedure mossop and davidson 2003 briefly 250 mg of dried solids were added to 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes and sequentially extracted with the following steps 1 soluble exchangeable fraction 20 ml acetic acid 0 11 m for 16 h 2 reducible fraction 20 ml hydroxylamine hydrochloride 0 1 m ph 2 0 for 16 h and 3 oxidizable fraction 4 ml h2o2 30 air dried then 20 ml ammonium acetate 1 m ph 2 0 a portion of the extracted liquids were mixed with certain amount of scandium solution equivalent to 50 ppb in the

solution and further diluted for concentration analysis metal contents in the untreated solids extracted liquids and solid residues were determined by icp ms on an agilent 7500a instrument all extractions were conducted in triplicates 3 results and discussions 3 1 chemical characteristics of the sludges and derived chars sludge type treatment conditions sample labels and elemental concentrations are presented in table 1 total sulfur content and recovery in the solid phases are presented in fig 1 other compositional information can be found in our previous studies huang tang 2015 2016 in general anaerobic sludge has higher cu and zn concentrations due to the mixing of activated sludge with primary sludge and the volatilization of organic matters during biogas production since heavy metals mostly remained in the solid phase after pyrolysis and htc treatments their concentrations in the solids have correspondingly increased similar trends were also previously observed for p huang and tang 2015 in general products from higher treatment temperatures have higher metal concentrations as a result of increasing volatilization of organic matter 3 2 cu and zn speciation in raw sludges cu and zn k edge xanes and exafs spectra for the raw sludges and their chars are presented in fig 2 lcf was conducted on both xanes and exafs data of each sample and the main difference between these samples is the relative abundance of different sulfide species which is likely caused by spectral similarities between these species tables 2 and si table s2 for cu the main difference is in the relative abundance of different pure cu sulfides cysteine complex cu2s and cus and cu fe sulfides cubanite and chalcopyrite for zn the main difference is between wurtzite and sphalerite with lcf of xanes determines more sphalerite and lcf of exafs determines more wurtzite wurtzite and sphalerite are two polymorphs of zns their xanes spectra differ in the white line intensity and post edge features with sphalerite having higher white line intensity and sharper post edge features than those of wurtzite regardless of these differences the trends caused by different treatment techniques and conditions are consistent for both xanes and exafs results therefore discussions in the main text were based on the exafs data to avoid redundancy cu exists predominantly as sulfide phases in both sludges with a small amount as organic complex es fitted as cu humic complex fig 2a and b table 2 the sulfide phases identified include organic sulfides fitted as cu i cysteine complex inorganic cu2s and cu fe sulfide fitted as cubanite with pure sulfides constituting 50 60 and cubanite 30 in both sludges the abundance of cu ii organic complex fitted as cu ii humic complex in both samples was similarly low 15 because of the spectra similarity of different cu sulfides e g cu i cysteine complex cu2s cus and cubanite fig s1 possible overlap between them could occur in lcf thus they were grouped into sulfide species and their relative abundances were not further interpreted for zn speciation distinct characteristics were observed comparing the two raw sludges spectrum of activated sludge showed higher edge absorption extended until 9688 ev and less post edge features than those of anaerobic sludge fig 2c the post edge features 9679 and 9692 ev resembled those of zn sulfides fig s2 similar to cu a significant fraction of zn was present as sulfide phases 42 in activated sludge and 77 in anaerobic sludge table 2 in addition to sulfides zn phosphate phases fitted as hopeite and zn associated with fe oxides fitted as zn doped ferrihydrite were also present in the raw sludges both species accounted for 30 in activated sludge and 15 in anaerobic sludge elemental composition and speciation in sewage sludges are controlled by a number of factors such as sewage source wastewater treatment technology and sludge processing stage donner et al 2013 2011 2012 garcía delgado et al 2007 metals in municipal sewage can originate from diverse sources and enter into wastewater treatment plants wwtps in diverse forms different chemical species in dissolved or particulate states garcía delgado et al 2007 mitrano et al 2014 sterritt and lester 1984 during wastewater treatment and sludge production processes metals can experience extensive transformations including microbial uptake and utilization complexation by extracellular substances or minerals dissolution and or precipitation brown and lester 1982 chipasa 2003 stasinakis et al 2003 stephenson and lester 1987 sterritt and lester 1984 since both cu and zn are chalcophile elements i e elements with high tendency to combine with sulfur other than oxygen goldschmidt 1937 it is not surprising to find their dominant association with s possibly complexed intra or extracellularly by organic sulfides or precipitated as inorganic sulfides the relative abundance of different cu zn sulfide phases can be affected by other competing reactions such as precipitation with phosphate that is found in high concentration in sludges as shown in a previous study zno nanoparticles nps can be readily transformed into different zn phosphate solid phases with the relative abundance of different phases dependent on phosphate concentration and ph rathnayake et al 2014 comparison between activated sludge and anaerobic sludge revealed the effects of anaerobic digestion higher abundance of metal sulfide species in anaerobic sludge than activated sludge is consistent with the overall higher total s content in anaerobic sludge fig 1 sulfidation of chalcophile metals during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludges has been previously reported for ag zno and cuo nps kim et al 2015 lombi et al 2012 2013 ma et al 2014b since most of the cu already existed as sulfide phases in activated sludge little alteration occurred for cu after anaerobic digestion for zn more than half of it was in phosphate phases or associated with fe which can be released via reductive dissolution of fe phases and dissolution of zn phosphates and precipitate with sulfide species released from hydrolysis of organic sulfides or from sulfate reduction dunnette et al 1985 isa et al 1986 lawrence and mccarty 1965 legros et al 2017 enhanced sulfidation of cu and zn was also found in a recent study on anaerobic digestion of different biowastes legros et al 2017 in addition to bulk xas analysis μ xrf imaging was conducted to reveal elemental distribution and correlations μ xanes spectra were collected at cu and zn hot spots in the xrf images to identify their speciation within discrete particles fig 3 and fig s4 the metals were distributed throughout both activated sludge fig 3 panel a1 and anaerobic sludge fig s4 panel a1 with many scattered particles in micrometer size range and with more fe containing particles than cu and zn containing particles lcf analyses of cu and zn μ xanes spectra suggests that these particulates are heterogeneous and contain different cu zn species that are consistent with bulk xas lcf components consistent with the heterogeneous nature of these samples data for activated sludge in table s3 and anaerobic sludge in table s4 sequential extraction results showed that in both activated and anaerobic sludges cu existed mostly in the oxidizable fraction 50 followed by the residual fraction 20 30 and reducible fraction 15 fig 4 this is consistent with xas lcf results showing that cu sulfides and cu humic complexes are the main cu species inorganic cu sulfides are insoluble in water and weak acid while their oxidation will result in the dissolution of cu compared to cu zn partitioned mostly in the soluble exchangeable and reducible fractions 35 each less in the oxidizable fraction and the residual fraction was negligible a previous study also showed a large fraction of zn in the soluble exchangeable fraction 20 50 and reducible fraction 30 50 in a range of sewage sludges donner et al 2011 lcf analyses of xas data showed that zn was present mainly as zn sulfides zn doped ferrihydrite and zn phosphate as hopeite using the geochemical modeling software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 zn phosphate was calculated to be soluble in the acetic extraction solution while wurtzite was barely soluble under the same condition therefore zn in the soluble exchangeable fraction is likely associated with zn phosphate mineral zn in the reducible fraction is mostly likely contributed by zn doped ferrihydrite because zn can be released following the reductive dissolution of fe iii containing minerals the oxidizable fraction is possibly contributed by zn sulfides it is worth noting that sequential extraction fractions do not necessarily correlate quantitatively to the relative abundance estimated by xas fitting for example zn sulfides are abundant 40 based on lcf analyses of exafs spectra while the oxidizable fraction determined by sequential extraction is only 10 this could be caused by 1 potential presence of reference compounds with overlapping spectra features as those used in the lcf of exafs data 2 challenges in including all possible species in the lcf reference library particularly for highly complex and heterogeneous samples such as sewage sludge 3 matrix effects that affect the extraction solution chemistry and dissolution kinetics and 4 speciation alteration during extraction 3 3 effects of pyrolysis on cu and zn speciation pyrolysis treatment significantly modified cu and zn speciation as shown in the cu and zn xanes and exafs analyses fig 2 with lcf results in table 2 two main features in the cu xanes spectra distinguish the raw activated sludge and its pyrochars decrease of the peak intensity at 8986 ev and increase of the peak intensity at 8998 ev after pyrolysis the magnitude of changes also increased with increasing temperature fig 2a lcf fittings of the pyrochars of activated sludge were less satisfactory as can be seen and also evidenced by the large r factors possibly due to the missing of components with distorted structures as shown in the relatively weak oscillations in k space in fig 2 or the physical association of cu phases with the pyrochars adsorbed species nonetheless lcf fitting of the pyrochars particularly at 450 c suggested a decrease of cu sulfide species and an increase of cu organic complexes fitted as cu humic complex table 2 consistent changes in the zn xanes spectra features were observed after pyrolysis of both sludges the post edge shoulder at 9672 ev increased while the peak intensity at 9679 and 9692 ev decreased after treatment fig 2c regarding zn speciation the primary change is the decrease of zn sulfide and the increase of zn doped ferrihydrite after pyrolysis table 2 after pyrolysis the abundance of zn sulfide in both sludges significantly decreased from 42 to 10 and 77 to 40 for pyrochars of activated and anaerobically digested sludges respectively zn doped ferrihydrite increased to 56 s250 and 43 s450 compared to 30 in the raw activated sludge spectromicroscopy analysis of s250 biochar showed no dramatic changes in the particle morphology and distribution after pyrolysis fig 3 panels b1 b3 while the speciation of zn and cu in corresponding hot spots was transformed and consistent with the bulk speciation evolution table s3 over the tested temperature range 250 450 c no effects between these two temperatures were observed for the bulk zn speciation table 2 the decrease of cu and zn sulfides is generally consistent with the volatilization of s during pyrolysis fig 1 as shown in a recent study 20 60 of the total s was volatized into gas and tar during the pyrolysis of sewage sludge at 100 900 c during which h2s was formed from methanethiol aliphatic s aromatic s and thiophene zhang et al 2017 the thermal stability of sulfides is likely phase dependent and affected by the matrix properties and treatment conditions further research is needed to evaluate the thermochemical behaviors of different sulfide species under thermal treatment conditions pyrolysis treatment also significantly altered the mobility of cu and zn in terms of their partitioning in sequential extracts fig 4 after pyrolysis cu in all three extractable fractions significantly decreased and migrated into the residual fraction 80 and the change was more significant at higher temperature fig 4a similar to cu the partition of zn in the soluble exchangeable fraction was also reduced from 35 to 10 and the residual fraction slightly increased the oxidizable fraction increased significantly from 10 in raw sludges to 35 60 in the pyrochars as compared to the decrease of this fraction for cu the immobilization of cu and zn into the residue fraction after pyrolysis is consistent with previous findings although with different heating temperatures or durations chen et al 2015 liu et al 2016 these changes do not seem to proportionally correlate with the changes in speciation 1 although being reduced sulfides still account for a significant portion of total cu but little cu partitioned in the oxidizable fraction 2 sequential fractionation showed an enhancement of the zn oxidizable fraction while xas fitting showed a reduction in zn sulfides and an increase in zn doped ferrihydrite following pyrolysis of activated sludge again these were likely caused by the intrinsic limitations of xas lcf and sequential extraction methods as previously discussed in section 3 2 despite these discrepancies the sequential extraction results demonstrated the overall stabilization of heavy metals especially cu by pyrolysis 3 4 effects of htc on cu and zn speciation xanes and exfas spectra for the hydrochars and their lca results are presented in fig 2 and table 2 despite the difference in initial composition and complex reactions under hydrothermal conditions cu xas spectra of hydrochars from different feedstocks and treatment temperatures are very similar and significantly different from those of pyrochars fig 2a and b the features that distinguish the raw sludges and the hydrochars occur at 8979 and 8986 ev with spectra of all hydrochars showing increasing intensity at these two positions these two features are characteristic of the presence of cu fe sulfide minerals fig s1 lca results showed the dominance of cubanite and chalcopyrite in the hydrochars with a combined abundance of more than 80 compared to less than 35 in the raw sludges both cubanite and chalcopyrite are important cu minerals that typically form under hydrothermal conditions and intergrowth of these two minerals is commonly found pruseth et al 1999 schwartz 1927 considering the presence of abundant fe and s in the samples and the nature of hydrothermal conditions the formation of these minerals during htc treatment is reasonable the results suggest that cu fe sulfide minerals instead of pure cu sulfides are stable cu phases under the tested hydrothermal conditions regarding the effects of htc on zn the changes following htc are less significant than those for cu fig 2c the most significant changes are observed for htc of anaerobic sludge at 225 c with the abundance of zn sulfides wurtzite increasing from 79 in the raw sludge to 94 in the char zn doped ferrihydrite and hopeite may be stable under the hydrothermal conditions and little zn was dissolved and transformed into sulfides spectromicroscopy results of the hydrochars from 225 c showed no substantial changes in the morphology and distribution of zn and cu particulates fig 3 panels c1 c3 for shtc225 fig s4 panels c1 c3 for ahtc225 lca of the μ xanes data showed that the trends of cu and zn speciation evolution weresimilar to bulk xas analysis on the samples following htc treatment more metal sulfides formed after htc tables s3 and s4 although total s content also decreased during htc similar to the effects of pyrolysis fig 1 the predominance of cu and zn sulfide species after htc treatment suggests that these inorganic sulfides are relatively stable under hydrothermal conditions under hydrothermal condition sulfide species can be released from organic structures and precipitate with chalcophile elements such as cu and zn schulte 2010 formation of metal sulfides under hydrothermal conditions is common in geological settings where metal sulfide ores form hemley et al 1992 results from this study suggest that s controls the speciation of chalcophile metals during hydrothermal treatments of sewage sludge in terms of metal mobility as assessed by sequential extraction following htc treatments the soluble exchangeable and reducible cu fractions became negligible 3 and 6 respectively and the residual fraction significantly increased similar to the effect of pyrolysis fig 4 although the absolute metal content in the oxidizable fraction remained mostly unchanged the relative abundance actually decreased following htc from 54 in the feedstocks to 29 42 in hydrochars fig 4a the effect was similar for both activated and anaerobic sludges xas fitting showed that cu exits predominantly as cu fe sulfide species which can partition into both the oxidizable and residual fractions the transformation of pure cu sulfides to cu fe sulfides is possibly responsible for such stabilization during extraction since cu sulfides in the raw sludges may contain a portion of less stable organic cu sulfides regarding zn the soluble exchangeable and reducible fractions decreased and the oxidizable fraction increased after htc treatment fig 4b the residual fraction also increased and was more significant for hydrochars of activated sludge than those of anaerobic sludge considering the limited speciation transformation revealed by zn xas physical changes of the matrix might play a more important role in summary htc also stabilized heavy metals in the treatment products although not as effective as pyrolysis under the selected conditions 4 conclusions this study comparatively characterized the speciation and mobility of cu and zn in chars from pyrolysis and htc treatments of both activated sludge and anaerobically digested sludge using sequential extraction bulk xas and coupled μ xrf imaging and μ xas this approach helped gain a systematic and in depth understanding of heavy metal transformation during pyrolysis and htc treatments of sewage sludges which can not be achieved by sequential extraction alone based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 combined chemical spectroscopic and microscopic analysis provided detailed speciation information in complex samples and enabled cross validation 2 cu exists predominantly as sulfides and zn as sulfide phosphate and ferrihydrite associated species in activated sludge both cu and zn became more sulfidized after anaerobic digestion 3 both cu and zn were desulfidized after pyrolysis treatment at 250 and 450 c zn became more associated with fe minerals while cu became more associated with organic matters though uncertainty existed due to relatively poor data fitting 4 despite s volatilization after htc similar to the effect of pyrolysis cu remained extensively sulfidized after htc at 175 and 225 c but as existed as cu fe sulfides chalcophile and cubanite instead of pure cu sulfides and zn was less altered with similar portions remained as hopeite and fe mineral associated species 5 micro xas analysis showed that individual particles of cu and zn experienced similar transformation as revealed by bulk xas analysis 6 mobility of the metals was reduced after both pyrolysis and htc treatments which can be attributed to the changes in metal speciation and matrix

19758,thermal and hydrothermal treatments are promising techniques for sewage sludge management that can potentially facilitate safe waste disposal energy recovery and nutrient recovery recycling content and speciation of heavy metals in the treatment products affect the potential environmental risks upon sludge disposal and or application of the treatment products therefore it is important to study the speciation transformation of heavy metals and the effects of treatment conditions by combining synchrotron x ray spectroscopy microscopy analysis and sequential chemical extraction this study systematically characterized the speciation of zn and cu in municipal sewage sludges and their chars derived from pyrolysis a representative thermal treatment technique and hydrothermal carbonization htc a representative hydrothermal treatment technique spectroscopy analysis revealed enhanced sulfidation of zn and cu by anaerobic digestion and htc treatments as compared to desulfidation by pyrolysis overall changes in the chemical speciation and matrix properties led to reduced mobility of zn and cu in the treatment products these results provide insights into the reaction mechanisms during pyrolysis and htc treatments of sludges and can help evaluate the environmental health risks associated with the metals in the treatment products graphical abstract image 1 keywords sewage sludge pyrolysis hydrothermal carbonization heavy metals speciation 1 introduction management of sewage sludge is a challenging task for the wastewater treatment industry because of the high water content large volume and the presence of organic and inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals pesticides herbicides pharmaceuticals and personal care products ppcps and pathogens rogers 1996 westerhoff et al 2015 on the other hand sludges also contain large amounts of energy i e carbon c and nutrients i e nitrogen n and phosphorus p and have great potential for resource recovery koppelaar and weikard 2013 withers et al 2015 however current waste management strategies have intrinsic problems that result in limited resource utilization of sludges in the united states 35 of the sewage sludges are recycled in agriculture 30 are disposed in landfill 15 are thermally disposed and the rest are disposed by other means christodoulou and stamatelatou 2016 high landfill disposal costs associated with transport and land availability make this option less favorable strict regulations inhibit direct land application of sludges due to concerns with soil contamination and related environmental and human health risks christodoulou and stamatelatou 2016 with the global interests in societal and environmental sustainability there are urgent needs for the integration of new technologies and strategies into current sludge management systems spinosa 2004 wang et al 2015 in recent years thermal and hydrothermal treatments of sewage sludges have emerged as sustainable treatment techniques because they have the potential to simultaneously target environmental protection energy recovery and nutrient recovery recycling barber 2016 wang and li 2015 these treatments can degrade pathogens decompose organic contaminants and reduce waste volume thus serving as excellent sanitation and waste management options escala et al 2012 vom eyser et al 2015a vom eyser et al 2015b two representative thermal and hydrothermal treatment techniques are pyrolysis and hydrothermal carbonization htc respectively the treatment products chars including pyrochar from pyrolysis and hydrochar from hydrothermal treatments are potential stand alone fuel sources bridle and pritchard 2004 kim et al 2014b zhao et al 2014 chars can also be applied as soil amendments for contaminant remediation for improving soil quality or as fertilizers atkinson et al 2010 hossain et al 2010 malghani et al 2013 overall applications of thermal and hydrothermal techniques have strong potential in mitigating the environmental burdens of sludge management and enhancing societal sustainability properties and functionality of the treatment products are largely governed by the composition and speciation of elements embedded the concentration and speciation of heavy metals are relevant to environmental risks associated with the disposal and applications of sludge derived products since heavy metal speciation largely determines their mobility and availability lake et al 1984 reeder et al 2006 many previous studies have examined the behavior of heavy metals during thermal and hydrothermal treatments of sludges primarily focusing on heavy metal phase distribution in solid liquid and gas phases or mobility transformation using empirically defined sequential chemical extraction methods huang yuan 2016 jin et al 2016 leng et al 2014 li et al 2012 shao et al 2015 shi et al 2013 wu et al 2016 yuan et al 2011 2015 zhang et al 2016 however chemical extraction is an indirect method and the obtained fractions do not necessarily correlate with the chemical species targeted by a specific extraction step metal reaction with the extracting solutions can also potentially cause alterations or transformations of metal speciation much still remains unknown on the detailed speciation of heavy metals and the effects of treatment conditions during thermal and hydrothermal treatments of sludges heavy metals in sludges can exist in diverse physical and chemical forms for example cu and zn were found to exist as sulfides phosphates organic complexes and iron mineral associated species with sizes ranging from nano to micrometers donner et al 2011 2012 kim et al 2014a lombi et al 2012 ma et al 2014a synchrotron based x ray absorption spectroscopy xas is a non destructive technique that can provide detailed metal speciation information in complex heterogeneous environmental samples by combining xas and sequential extraction one can potentially obtain in depth information on metal speciation and mobility that cannot be achieved by sequential chemical extraction alone although recent studies have characterized cu and zn speciation transformation during traditional treatments such as aging chemical amendments and anaerobic digestions using these techniques donner et al 2011 2012 legros et al 2017 little is known about the transformation of these species during thermal and hydrothermal treatments in this study activated and anaerobically digested sewage sludges from a municipal wastewater treatment plant were treated with pyrolysis and htc at different temperatures as previously discussed pyrolysis and htc are representative thermal and hydrothermal techniques respectively and their applications to sludge treatment have been extensively studied escala et al 2013 manara and zabaniotou 2012 wang et al 2014 the speciation and mobility of cu and zn two abundant heavy metals in sewage sludges were characterized using sequential extraction bulk x ray absorption spectroscopy xas and coupled micro x ray fluorescence μ xrf imaging and absorption spectroscopy μ xas particularly the use of microanalysis enabled the characterization of particulate forms of these metals and cross validation of bulk analysis results from this work can improve our understanding of the thermochemical behaviors of these elements in sludges and also provide fundamental information for evaluating heavy metal mobility and environmental risks when the treatment products are applied 2 experimental approaches 2 1 sample collection sewage sludges were collected from f wayne hill water resources center gwinnett county atlanta ga usa which collects and treats municipal sewage from the county this treatment plant has primary physical secondary activated sludge and tertiary membrane filtration and ozonation treatment units 10 ppm of al is added to the clarifiers to facilitate sludge aggregation and settling and 25 ppm of fecl3 is added in the tertiary process for phosphate removal excess activated sludge and sludge from primary treatment unit are combined into anaerobic digester for biogas production and most of the biosolids are disposed in landfill activated sludge is the excess sludge from the secondary clarifier and anaerobically digested sludge hereafter referred to as anaerobic sludge was collected from the outlet of anaerobic digester the activated sludge was further enriched by centrifugation and stored at 20 c while the anaerobically digested sludge was stored at 20 c without pretreatments for pyrolysis a portion of the samples was freeze dried before treatments for htc frozen samples were thawed at room temperature prior to treatments 2 2 pyrolysis and htc treatment of sludges pyrolysis of the sewage sludges was performed in a quartz tube furnace thermo scientific ma usa under n2 flow 1 ml s at 250 and 450 c with a heating and cooling rate of 200 c h and a duration at the target temperature of 4 h these two temperatures represent the low and middle temperature range of thermal treatments at which mass remains mostly in solid phase table 1 although low temperature pyrolysis treatment is also known as torrefaction for simplicity treatments at both temperatures are hereafter referred to as pyrolysis for each treatment condition freeze dried sludges 1 0 g was added to a crucible and inserted into the glass tube the products are referred to as pyrochars htc treatments of both sludges were performed in the presence of deionized water di with a solid liquid ratio of 1 9 w w and ph around 6 6 to achieve this 4 g of the sludges equivalent to 1 g dried mass and 6 g di water were mixed in a 20 ml teflon lined stainless steel hydrothermal reactor parr instrument il usa the reactor was sealed and heated in an oven at 175 or 225 c for 16 h then allowed to cool down to 50 c overnight in an oven solid hydrochars produced from htc were collected by centrifugation and dried at 50 c for at least 24 h until no further weight loss all treatments were processed in duplicate 2 3 bulk x ray absorption spectroscopy xas cu and zn k edge xas analysis of raw and treated sludge samples and reference

and analysis used the softwares sixpack and ifeffit ravel and newville 2005 webb 2005 multiple scans 2 6 were energy calibrated and averaged for further analysis principal component analysis pca was conducted on the normalized sample spectra to determine the number of components needed for obtaining reasonable fits using the corresponding reference compound spectra library target transformation tt was conducted to determine appropriate candidate compounds linear combination fitting lcf was conducted on both xanes 20 to 100 ev and exafs 2 5 11 5 å 1 regions combinations of tt determined candidate compounds were used and the goodness of fit was determined by r factor fits with smallest r factors were used 2 6 sequential extraction both raw sludges and their chars were subjected to sequential extraction using the three step community bureau of reference bcr procedure mossop and davidson 2003 briefly 250 mg of dried solids were added to 50 ml polypropylene centrifuge tubes and sequentially extracted with the following steps 1 soluble exchangeable fraction 20 ml acetic acid 0 11 m for 16 h 2 reducible fraction 20 ml hydroxylamine hydrochloride 0 1 m ph 2 0 for 16 h and 3 oxidizable fraction 4 ml h2o2 30 air dried then 20 ml ammonium acetate 1 m ph 2 0 a portion of the extracted liquids were mixed with certain amount of scandium solution equivalent to 50 ppb in the final dilution served as internal standard and digested by a mixture of concentrated h2o2 and hno3 v v 1 1 on a hot plate at 100 c then diluted for final analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms the untreated solids and extracted solid residues were ashed in an oven at 550 c followed by digestion with aqua regia a portion of the digested solution was mixed with sc standard solution and further diluted for concentration analysis metal contents in the untreated solids extracted liquids and solid residues were determined by icp ms on an agilent 7500a instrument all extractions were conducted in triplicates 3 results and discussions 3 1 chemical characteristics of the sludges and derived chars sludge type treatment conditions sample labels and elemental concentrations are presented in table 1 total sulfur content and recovery in the solid phases are presented in fig 1 other compositional information can be found in our previous studies huang tang 2015 2016 in general anaerobic sludge has higher cu and zn concentrations due to the mixing of activated sludge with primary sludge and the volatilization of organic matters during biogas production since heavy metals mostly remained in the solid phase after pyrolysis and htc treatments their concentrations in the solids have correspondingly increased similar trends were also previously observed for p huang and tang 2015 in general products from higher treatment temperatures have higher metal concentrations as a result of increasing volatilization of organic matter 3 2 cu and zn speciation in raw sludges cu and zn k edge xanes and exafs spectra for the raw sludges and their chars are presented in fig 2 lcf was conducted on both xanes and exafs data of each sample and the main difference between these samples is the relative abundance of different sulfide species which is likely caused by spectral similarities between these species tables 2 and si table s2 for cu the main difference is in the relative abundance of different pure cu sulfides cysteine complex cu2s and cus and cu fe sulfides cubanite and chalcopyrite for zn the main difference is between wurtzite and sphalerite with lcf of xanes determines more sphalerite and lcf of exafs determines more wurtzite wurtzite and sphalerite are two polymorphs of zns their xanes spectra differ in the white line intensity and post edge features with sphalerite having higher white line intensity and sharper post edge features than those of wurtzite regardless of these differences the trends caused by different treatment techniques and conditions are consistent for both xanes and exafs results therefore discussions in the main text were based on the exafs data to avoid redundancy cu exists predominantly as sulfide phases in both sludges with a small amount as organic complex es fitted as cu humic complex fig 2a and b table 2 the sulfide phases identified include organic sulfides fitted as cu i cysteine complex inorganic cu2s and cu fe sulfide fitted as cubanite with pure sulfides constituting 50 60 and cubanite 30 in both sludges the abundance of cu ii organic complex fitted as cu ii humic complex in both samples was similarly low 15 because of the spectra similarity of different cu sulfides e g cu i cysteine complex cu2s cus and cubanite fig s1 possible overlap between them could occur in lcf thus they were grouped into sulfide species and their relative abundances were not further interpreted for zn speciation distinct characteristics were observed comparing the two raw sludges spectrum of activated sludge showed higher edge absorption extended until 9688 ev and less post edge features than those of anaerobic sludge fig 2c the post edge features 9679 and 9692 ev resembled those of zn sulfides fig s2 similar to cu a significant fraction of zn was present as sulfide phases 42 in activated sludge and 77 in anaerobic sludge table 2 in addition to sulfides zn phosphate phases fitted as hopeite and zn associated with fe oxides fitted as zn doped ferrihydrite were also present in the raw sludges both species accounted for 30 in activated sludge and 15 in anaerobic sludge elemental composition and speciation in sewage sludges are controlled by a number of factors such as sewage source wastewater treatment technology and sludge processing stage donner et al 2013 2011 2012 garcía delgado et al 2007 metals in municipal sewage can originate from diverse sources and enter into wastewater treatment plants wwtps in diverse forms different chemical species in dissolved or particulate states garcía delgado et al 2007 mitrano et al 2014 sterritt and lester 1984 during wastewater treatment and sludge production processes metals can experience extensive transformations including microbial uptake and utilization complexation by extracellular substances or minerals dissolution and or precipitation brown and lester 1982 chipasa 2003 stasinakis et al 2003 stephenson and lester 1987 sterritt and lester 1984 since both cu and zn are chalcophile elements i e elements with high tendency to combine with sulfur other than oxygen goldschmidt 1937 it is not surprising to find their dominant association with s possibly complexed intra or extracellularly by organic sulfides or precipitated as inorganic sulfides the relative abundance of different cu zn sulfide phases can be affected by other competing reactions such as precipitation with phosphate that is found in high concentration in sludges as shown in a previous study zno nanoparticles nps can be readily transformed into different zn phosphate solid phases with the relative abundance of different phases dependent on phosphate concentration and ph rathnayake et al 2014 comparison between activated sludge and anaerobic sludge revealed the effects of anaerobic digestion higher abundance of metal sulfide species in anaerobic sludge than activated sludge is consistent with the overall higher total s content in anaerobic sludge fig 1 sulfidation of chalcophile metals during anaerobic digestion of sewage sludges has been previously reported for ag zno and cuo nps kim et al 2015 lombi et al 2012 2013 ma et al 2014b since most of the cu already existed as sulfide phases in activated sludge little alteration occurred for cu after anaerobic digestion for zn more than half of it was in phosphate phases or associated with fe which can be released via reductive dissolution of fe phases and dissolution of zn phosphates and precipitate with sulfide species released from hydrolysis of organic sulfides or from sulfate reduction dunnette et al 1985 isa et al 1986 lawrence and mccarty 1965 legros et al 2017 enhanced sulfidation of cu and zn was also found in a recent study on anaerobic digestion of different biowastes legros et al 2017 in addition to bulk xas analysis μ xrf imaging was conducted to reveal elemental distribution and correlations μ xanes spectra were collected at cu and zn hot spots in the xrf images to identify their speciation within discrete particles fig 3 and fig s4 the metals were distributed throughout both activated sludge fig 3 panel a1 and anaerobic sludge fig s4 panel a1 with many scattered particles in micrometer size range and with more fe containing particles than cu and zn containing particles lcf analyses of cu and zn μ xanes spectra suggests that these particulates are heterogeneous and contain different cu zn species that are consistent with bulk xas lcf components consistent with the heterogeneous nature of these samples data for activated sludge in table s3 and anaerobic sludge in table s4 sequential extraction results showed that in both activated and anaerobic sludges cu existed mostly in the oxidizable fraction 50 followed by the residual fraction 20 30 and reducible fraction 15 fig 4 this is consistent with xas lcf results showing that cu sulfides and cu humic complexes are the main cu species inorganic cu sulfides are insoluble in water and weak acid while their oxidation will result in the dissolution of cu compared to cu zn partitioned mostly in the soluble exchangeable and reducible fractions 35 each less in the oxidizable fraction and the residual fraction was negligible a previous study also showed a large fraction of zn in the soluble exchangeable fraction 20 50 and reducible fraction 30 50 in a range of sewage sludges donner et al 2011 lcf analyses of xas data showed that zn was present mainly as zn sulfides zn doped ferrihydrite and zn phosphate as hopeite using the geochemical modeling software phreeqc parkhurst and appelo 1999 zn phosphate was calculated to be soluble in the acetic extraction solution while wurtzite was barely soluble under the same condition therefore zn in the soluble exchangeable fraction is likely associated with zn phosphate mineral zn in the reducible fraction is mostly likely contributed by zn doped ferrihydrite because zn can be released following the reductive dissolution of fe iii containing minerals the oxidizable fraction is possibly contributed by zn sulfides it is worth noting that sequential extraction fractions do not necessarily correlate quantitatively to the relative abundance estimated by xas fitting for example zn sulfides are abundant 40 based on lcf analyses of exafs spectra while the oxidizable fraction determined by sequential extraction is only 10 this could be caused by 1 potential presence of reference compounds with overlapping spectra features as those used in the lcf of exafs data 2 challenges in including all possible species in the lcf reference library particularly for highly complex and heterogeneous samples such as sewage sludge 3 matrix effects that affect the extraction solution chemistry and dissolution kinetics and 4 speciation alteration during extraction 3 3 effects of pyrolysis on cu and zn speciation pyrolysis treatment significantly modified cu and zn speciation as shown in the cu and zn xanes and exafs analyses fig 2 with lcf results in table 2 two main features in the cu xanes spectra distinguish the raw activated sludge and its pyrochars decrease of the peak intensity at 8986 ev and increase of the peak intensity at 8998 ev after pyrolysis the magnitude of changes also increased with increasing temperature fig 2a lcf fittings of the pyrochars of activated sludge were less satisfactory as can be seen and also evidenced by the large r factors possibly due to the missing of components with distorted structures as shown in the relatively weak oscillations in k space in fig 2 or the physical association of cu phases with the pyrochars adsorbed species nonetheless lcf fitting of the pyrochars particularly at 450 c suggested a decrease of cu sulfide species and an increase of cu organic complexes fitted as cu humic complex table 2 consistent changes in the zn xanes spectra features were observed after pyrolysis of both sludges the post edge shoulder at 9672 ev increased while the peak intensity at 9679 and 9692 ev decreased after treatment fig 2c regarding zn speciation the primary change is the decrease of zn sulfide and the increase of zn doped ferrihydrite after pyrolysis table 2 after pyrolysis the abundance of zn sulfide in both sludges significantly decreased from 42 to 10 and 77 to 40 for pyrochars of activated and anaerobically digested sludges respectively zn doped ferrihydrite increased to 56 s250 and 43 s450 compared to 30 in the raw activated sludge spectromicroscopy analysis of s250 biochar showed no dramatic changes in the particle morphology and distribution after pyrolysis fig 3 panels b1 b3 while the speciation of zn and cu in corresponding hot spots was transformed and consistent with the bulk speciation evolution table s3 over the tested temperature range 250 450 c no effects between these two temperatures were observed for the bulk zn speciation table 2 the decrease of cu and zn sulfides is generally consistent with the volatilization of s during pyrolysis fig 1 as shown in a recent study 20 60 of the total s was volatized into gas and tar during the pyrolysis of sewage sludge at 100 900 c during which h2s was formed from methanethiol aliphatic s aromatic s and thiophene zhang et al 2017 the thermal stability of sulfides is likely phase dependent and affected by the matrix properties and treatment conditions further research is needed to evaluate the thermochemical behaviors of different sulfide species under thermal treatment conditions pyrolysis treatment also significantly altered the mobility of cu and zn in terms of their partitioning in sequential extracts fig 4 after pyrolysis cu in all three extractable fractions significantly decreased and migrated into the residual fraction 80 and the change was more significant at higher temperature fig 4a similar to cu the partition of zn in the soluble exchangeable fraction was also reduced from 35 to 10 and the residual fraction slightly increased the oxidizable fraction increased significantly from 10 in raw sludges to 35 60 in the pyrochars as compared to the decrease of this fraction for cu the immobilization of cu and zn into the residue fraction after pyrolysis is consistent with previous findings although with different heating temperatures or durations chen et al 2015 liu et al 2016 these changes do not seem to proportionally correlate with the changes in speciation 1 although being reduced sulfides still account for a significant portion of total cu but little cu partitioned in the oxidizable fraction 2 sequential fractionation showed an enhancement of the zn oxidizable fraction while xas fitting showed a reduction in zn sulfides and an increase in zn doped ferrihydrite following pyrolysis of activated sludge again these were likely caused by the intrinsic limitations of xas lcf and sequential extraction methods as previously discussed in section 3 2 despite these discrepancies the sequential extraction results demonstrated the overall stabilization of heavy metals especially cu by pyrolysis 3 4 effects of htc on cu and zn speciation xanes and exfas spectra for the hydrochars and their lca results are presented in fig 2 and table 2 despite the difference in initial composition and complex reactions under hydrothermal conditions cu xas spectra of hydrochars from different feedstocks and treatment temperatures are very similar and significantly different from those of pyrochars fig 2a and b the features that distinguish the raw sludges and the hydrochars occur at 8979 and 8986 ev with spectra of all hydrochars showing increasing intensity at these two positions these two features are characteristic of the presence of cu fe sulfide minerals fig s1 lca results showed the dominance of cubanite and chalcopyrite in the hydrochars with a combined abundance of more than 80 compared to less than 35 in the raw sludges both cubanite and chalcopyrite are important cu minerals that typically form under hydrothermal conditions and intergrowth of these two minerals is commonly found pruseth et al 1999 schwartz 1927 considering the presence of abundant fe and s in the samples and the nature of hydrothermal conditions the formation of these minerals during htc treatment is reasonable the results suggest that cu fe sulfide minerals instead of pure cu sulfides are stable cu phases under the tested hydrothermal conditions regarding the effects of htc on zn the changes following htc are less significant than those for cu fig 2c the most significant changes are observed for htc of anaerobic sludge at 225 c with the abundance of zn sulfides wurtzite increasing from 79 in the raw sludge to 94 in the char zn doped ferrihydrite and hopeite may be stable under the hydrothermal conditions and little zn was dissolved and transformed into sulfides spectromicroscopy results of the hydrochars from 225 c showed no substantial changes in the morphology and distribution of zn and cu particulates fig 3 panels c1 c3 for shtc225 fig s4 panels c1 c3 for ahtc225 lca of the μ xanes data showed that the trends of cu and zn speciation evolution weresimilar to bulk xas analysis on the samples following htc treatment more metal sulfides formed after htc tables s3 and s4 although total s content also decreased during htc similar to the effects of pyrolysis fig 1 the predominance of cu and zn sulfide species after htc treatment suggests that these inorganic sulfides are relatively stable under hydrothermal conditions under hydrothermal condition sulfide species can be released from organic structures and precipitate with chalcophile elements such as cu and zn schulte 2010 formation of metal sulfides under hydrothermal conditions is common in geological settings where metal sulfide ores form hemley et al 1992 results from this study suggest that s controls the speciation of chalcophile metals during hydrothermal treatments of sewage sludge in terms of metal mobility as assessed by sequential extraction following htc treatments the soluble exchangeable and reducible cu fractions became negligible 3 and 6 respectively and the residual fraction significantly increased similar to the effect of pyrolysis fig 4 although the absolute metal content in the oxidizable fraction remained mostly unchanged the relative abundance actually decreased following htc from 54 in the feedstocks to 29 42 in hydrochars fig 4a the effect was similar for both activated and anaerobic sludges xas fitting showed that cu exits predominantly as cu fe sulfide species which can partition into both the oxidizable and residual fractions the transformation of pure cu sulfides to cu fe sulfides is possibly responsible for such stabilization during extraction since cu sulfides in the raw sludges may contain a portion of less stable organic cu sulfides regarding zn the soluble exchangeable and reducible fractions decreased and the oxidizable fraction increased after htc treatment fig 4b the residual fraction also increased and was more significant for hydrochars of activated sludge than those of anaerobic sludge considering the limited speciation transformation revealed by zn xas physical changes of the matrix might play a more important role in summary htc also stabilized heavy metals in the treatment products although not as effective as pyrolysis under the selected conditions 4 conclusions this study comparatively characterized the speciation and mobility of cu and zn in chars from pyrolysis and htc treatments of both activated sludge and anaerobically digested sludge using sequential extraction bulk xas and coupled μ xrf imaging and μ xas this approach helped gain a systematic and in depth understanding of heavy metal transformation during pyrolysis and htc treatments of sewage sludges which can not be achieved by sequential extraction alone based on the results the following conclusions can be drawn 1 combined chemical spectroscopic and microscopic analysis provided detailed speciation information in complex samples and enabled cross validation 2 cu exists predominantly as sulfides and zn as sulfide phosphate and ferrihydrite associated species in activated sludge both cu and zn became more sulfidized after anaerobic digestion 3 both cu and zn were desulfidized after pyrolysis treatment at 250 and 450 c zn became more associated with fe minerals while cu became more associated with organic matters though uncertainty existed due to relatively poor data fitting 4 despite s volatilization after htc similar to the effect of pyrolysis cu remained extensively sulfidized after htc at 175 and 225 c but as existed as cu fe sulfides chalcophile and cubanite instead of pure cu sulfides and zn was less altered with similar portions remained as hopeite and fe mineral associated species 5 micro xas analysis showed that individual particles of cu and zn experienced similar transformation as revealed by bulk xas analysis 6 mobility of the metals was reduced after both pyrolysis and htc treatments which can be attributed to the changes in metal speciation and matrix

19759,overall apparent reaction rates for the removal of monochloramine mca in granular activated carbon gac beds were determined using a fixed bed reactor system and under conditions typical for swimming pool water treatment reaction rates dropped and quasi stationary conditions were reached quickly diffusional mass transport in the pores was shown to be limiting the overall reaction rate this was reflected consistently in the thiele modulus in the effect of temperature pore size distribution and of grain size on the reaction rates pores 2 5 times the diameter of the monochloramine molecule were shown to be barely accessible for the monochloramine conversion reaction gacs with a significant proportion of large mesopores were found to have the highest overall reactivity for monochloramine removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords swimming pool water monochloramine surface catalytic reaction granular activated carbon diffusion control 1 introduction hypochlorous acid hocl is widely used as disinfectant in swimming pools due to its effectiveness in disinfection a major drawback is its reactivity towards inorganic and organic matter present in pool water which results in the formation of halogenated disinfection by products dbps zwiener et al 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 the dominating nitrogenous precursors for dbp formation that are introduced into the pool by bathers are urea and ammonia consolazio et al 1963 ammonia reacts with hocl to progressively form inorganic chloramines mono di and trichloramine blatchley and cheng 2010 qiang and adams 2004 urea however reacts in pool water through progressive chlorine addition forming chlorinated urea which finally breaks down to form the very volatile trichloramine blatchley and cheng 2010 chloramines are known to be irritating to skin and eyes and are suspected to cause respiratory problems eichelsdörfer et al 1975 this also includes an increased risk to children of asthma during adolescence bernard et al 2003 2008 consequently the sum of all inorganic chloramines is strictly regulated to a concentration of 0 2 mg l 1 as cl2 in swimming pools in germany din 19643 2 2012 and the us ansi apsp 1 2009 among the variety of inorganic chloramines monochloramine mca is the most dominant species in pool water a study of 11 swimming pools in the us found concentrations of monochloramine of up to 1 88 mg l 1 as cl2 weaver et al 2009 moreover mca is particularly of interest because it has been found to be a precursor for the formation of carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine ndma schreiber and mitch 2006 which was also found in chlorinated pools walse and mitch 2008 as bathers are introducing urea and ammonia into swimming pools the removal of the chloramines formed by the reaction of ammonia can decrease the total concentration of chloramines in the pool activated carbons are widely known as effective adsorbents worch 2012 schreiber et al 2005 however previous studies have shown that they are reducing agents for mca as well in that the reduction of mca primarily proceeds via a surface chemical reaction and the capacity of granular activated carbon gac filters for mca removal was found to be higher than expected when only adsorption was considered jaguaribe et al 2005 bauer and snoeyink 1973 over the course of the reaction the reactivity of gacs decreased before stationary conditions were reached scaramelli and digiano 1977 as a result activated carbon filters operated under swimming pool water conditions have a finite life time and need to be regenerated or replaced after a certain time in operation however the exact mechanism of the initial decrease of reactivity has not been fully understood until now previous studies proposed a two step process where mca is initially reduced at neutral ph to nh4 at free active carbon sites c equation 1 as enough surface oxides were formed the authors assume that mca is oxidised to n2 in a second slower reaction with surface oxides equation 2 bauer and snoeyink 1973 1 nh2cl h2o c nh4 cl c o 2 2 nh2cl c o h2o n2 2 h3o 2 cl c however a more recent study indicates that the ratio of transformation products nh4 and n2 formed did not change over the course of the reaction fairey et al 2007 which contradicts the hypothesis of bauer and snoeyink 1973 furthermore earlier studies reasoned that the overall reactivity is dominated by pore diffusion rather than by the surface chemical reactions komorita and snoeyink 1985 fairey et al 2006 mass transport in the pore system of gacs is known to be influenced by various parameters such as the grain size water temperature ertl et al 1997 the presence of surface oxides mangun et al 1999 and the pore size distribution of gacs maia et al 2008 to describe theoretically the mca removal process in gac filters the semi empirical mca catalysis model mcat model was established by kim 1977 to predict steady state mca removal in gac filters kim 1977 the mcat model was complemented recently to take into account the effect of source water type and ph fairey et al 2006 2006 however the model estimates the gac reactivity after stationary conditions are reached komorita and snoeyink 1985 using only basic gac properties such as the porosity and tortuosity of the gacs this makes the model inapplicable in elucidating mass transfer effects in detail which is important when considering the potentials for optimisation of the process thus considering the current state of knowledge the process of decreasing reactivity of gacs with increasing reaction time as well as the impact of pore diffusional limitations on the removal performance of a fixed gac bed is still not fully understood conclusively the aim of this study was to determine the impact of diffusional mass transport on the overall mca removal performance of gac for a wide range of operation conditions such as grain size pore size distribution and water temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 fixed bed reactor system for determination of the reaction rate constants reaction rate constants for monochloramine removal in gac beds were determined using the fixed bed reactor fbr system shown in fig 1 it included a glass column of 34 mm inner diameter and a total length of 200 mm in which the gac bed is placed on a glass frit a glass frit close to the inlet ensures equal distribution of the flow to the gac bed the gac bed was continuously fed with an mca solution at a constant flow rate qbed from a rapidly stirred 250 rpm double walled glass tank of 10 l volume equipped with a stainless steel lid and with feedback temperature control b braun germany the conductivity of the mca solution was adjusted to 400 μs cm 1 by dosing 1 mol l 1 nacl solution before the experiment was started the volumetric flow rate through the bed was maintained by a turbine pump p1 bg1 30 gather industries germany and was measured using a magnetic inductive flow meter altoflux ifm 5080 k with ifc 080 transformer krohne germany the gac bed was prepared by initially filling the glass column disconnected from the system with deionised water subsequently gac that had been wetted and the pores filled with deionised water by applying a vacuum was transferred to the column the bed was then consolidated by carefully tamping the column to guarantee a reproducible packing after connecting the column to the fbr system the chloramine solution was circulated through all instruments and tubes while bypassing the column the experiment was started then by changing the fluid flow from bypass to the gac bed the effluents from the gac bed or the bypass were fed back to the tank the mca concentration in the tank was measured by an amperometric chlorine sensor dulcotest cte 1 dmt prominent germany mounted in a closed loop and flowed through by a peristaltic pump p2 5004s watson marlow uk at a flow rate of 25 l h 1 the ph in the tank was measured continuously and maintained constant at ph 7 which was in the ph range for swimming pool water din 19643 2 2012 by dosage with 0 3 mol l 1 phosphoric acid or 0 1 mol l 1 naoh using feedback controlled peristaltic pumps p4 p5 the level in the tank was kept constant by a peristaltic pump p3 triggered by a level electrode since mca was consumed in the gac bed the mca concentration in the tank and thus the mca inflow concentration to the gac bed cbed in were kept constant by feeding a cooled 4 6 c mca stock solution to the tank using a feedback controlled peristaltic micro pump p6 bvk ismatec germany that stock solution was placed on a balance ca 572 kern germany and the mass of the stock solution was recorded continuously thus at any time t the mass flow of stock solution to the tank was known a scada system topmessage delphin technologies germany was used for data recording and feedback control of all relevant process parameters of the fbr system 2 2 preparation of the monochloramine stock solution monochloramine stock solutions as used in the fbr experiments were prepared by drop wise addition of 750 ml of a ocl solution ph 10 0 032 mol l 1 prepared from a sodium hypochlorite solution 12 active chlorine to 250 ml of a rapidly stirred nh4cl or nh4 2so4 solution ph 10 0 098 mol l 1 nh4cl or 0 049 mol l 1 nh4 2so4 at a final molar chlorine to ammonia ratio of 1 00 1 03 aoki 1989 all chemicals were p a reagent grade 2 3 analytical quantification of monochloramine and hocl the total chlorine sensor of the fbr system was calibrated daily using the spectrophotometric dpd method din en iso 2000 using a unicam uv2 200 uv vis spectrophotometer with a 5 cm quartz cuvette the concentration of the ocl solution used to prepare the mca stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient at 294 nm εocl 294nm of 348 mol 1 cm 1 hand and margerum 1983 the mca stock solution was determined at least twice a day according to the spectrophotometric method of schreiber and mitch accounting for the overlapping absorbance peaks of mca and dichloramine nhcl2 at 245 nm and 295 nm εnh2cl 245 nm 445 mol 1 cm 1 εnhcl2 245 nm 208 mol 1 cm 1 εnh2cl 295 nm 14 mol 1 cm 1 εnhcl2 295 nm 267 mol 1 cm 1 schreiber and mitch 2005 measurements at 360 nm confirmed the absence of trichloramine ncl3 in the mca stock solution εncl3 360 nm 126 mol 1 cm 1 schurter et al 1995 the yield for transformation of nh4 n to mca n was found to be in a range from 95 to 100 2 4 granular activated carbons four commercially available granular activated carbons gacs were used in this study namely hydraffin 30 n from donau carbon gmbh 30 n silcarbon k 835 from silcarbon aktivkohle gmbh k835 centaur from chemviron carbon gmbh centaur and a spherically shaped activated carbon type 100058 from blücher gmbh 100058 the raw materials of the carbons were anthracite coal 30n coconut shells k835 bituminous coal centaur and non porous polymer based spheres 100058 the gacs as provided by the manufacturers are denoted as unfractionated fresh gacs in the following grain size fractions of the 30n k835 and centaur with mean grain diameters of 0 30 mm 0 25 0 355 mm 0 57 mm 0 50 0 63 mm and 1 90 mm 1 80 2 00 mm were prepared by sieving the unfractionated fresh gacs using a sieve tower as 200 retsch germany and if necessary by grinding the unfractionated fresh gacs using a ball mill pm100 retsch germany prior to sieving the 100058 gac was used solely at the original monomodal grain size dp provided by the manufacturer 0 55 mm before use the fresh gacs were treated by i soaking in ultrapure water for 24 h ii evacuating the soaked gac using a vacuum chamber until rising air bubbles could no longer be seen and iii washing and decantation of the gac using ultrapure water until the supernatant was particle free 2 5 physical characterisation of the gac evaluation of the bed volume specific outer surface area ao and the representative hydraulic grain size dhy of the unfractionated gacs is described in section a of the supplementary material sm the internal surface area abet the pore volume of micropores 2 nm and mesopores 2 50 nm the pore size distribution psd and the tortuosity of the fresh unfractionated gacs were determined from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms belsorp max microtracbel the pore volume of macropores 50 nm was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry pascal 140 440 thermo fisher scientific to further elucidate the morphology of the 100058 gac images were taken from a cross section of a single gac grain with a high resolution scanning electron microscope fei nova nanosem 5 kv further details on the experimental procedures of physical gac characterisation are given in section b of the sm 2 6 data analysis and calculation of bed volume based apparent first order rate constants mca is consumed in the gac bed according to equations 1 and 2 above it is expected to follow first order kinetics with respect to mca if reaction 1 was slower than reaction 2 and thus rate limiting if reaction 2 was rate limiting then second order kinetics is expected finally mass transport inside the pores may be rate limiting diffusion control in that case a first order reaction will remain first order and a second order reaction will turn into an apparent 1 5 order reaction to take that into account apparent rate constants for a pseudo first order reaction were determined and the validity of that approach was verified in separate experiments see section 2 10 for a fixed bed reaction at stationary conditions the apparent bed volume based reaction rate constant kapp is obtained according to 3 k a p p 1 e b c t l n c b e d i n c b e d o u t where cbed in and cbed out are the gac bed s mca in and outflow concentrations and ebct is the empty bed contact time given by vbed qbed where vbed and qbed are the bed volume and the volumetric flow rate respectively to ensure that all gac in the filter bed was subjected to the almost same concentration of mca it was designed such that the change of the concentration from the inflow to the outflow of the bed was negligible generally typical outflow concentrations of monochloramine over the course of an experiment were about 5 below the inflow concentration see fig 2 consequently the measurement of the outflow concentration would have resulted in a lack of precision to overcome that restriction the outflow concentration was obtained from the decreasing mass of the mca stock solution the volumetric dosing rate qstock for any time t during an experiment is given by equation 4 4 q s t o c k t d m s t o c k d t ρ s t o c k t here ρstock t is the temperature dependent density of the stock solution and mstock is the recorded mass of the stock solution on the balance the time dependent mass loss dmstock dt was determined in time intervals of 0 5 1 h a mass balance for mca around the tank of the fbr system yields 5 q b e d c b e d o u t t q b e d c b e d i n q s t o c k t c s t o c k q s t o c k t c b e d i n r s y s t v s y s d c b e d i n d t here rsys accounts for a hypothetical loss of mca in the system excluding the gac bed e g through reaction at the glass or tube walls and cstock is the concentration of the mca stock solution preliminary experiments without gac showed that mca removal in the fbr system without gac was negligible thus 6 r s y s 0 since cbed in was kept constant the capacity term in equation 5 gives 7 v s y s d c b e d i n d t 0 introducing equations 6 and 7 into equation 5 and rearranging yields 8 c b e d o u t t q s t o c k t q b e d c b e d i n c s t o c k c b e d i n introducing equation 8 into equation 3 gives the bed volume based rate constant kapp at any time t 2 7 catalyst surface area based rate constants as the reduction of mca by gac is a solid surface reaction catalyst surface area based apparent rate constants kapp a are calculated from the bed volume based rate constants according to 9 k a p p a k a p p a 0 where a0 is the bed volume specific outer surface area of the gac in the fbr 2 8 conversion dependence of the overall reaction rate previous studies showed that the reactivity of gacs for mca conversion decreased gradually over time scaramelli and digiano 1977 however using the fbr system described above the time needed to acquire the data for determination of the rate constant at a given time t was short compared to the time needed for a notable decrease of gac reactivity thus for each time t the assumption of quasi steady state was justified to describe the process of decreasing reactivity of the heterogeneous mca gac reaction conversion time curves were determined in fbr experiments for all gacs until the reactivity was constant over time the general shape of the conversion time curves can indicate which one of the two widely recognised reaction models the progressive conversion model pcm or the shrinking core model scm levenspiel 1999 is appropriate fbr experiments were conducted to determine kapp either at the beginning of the mca gac reaction or after a certain time of operation when stationary conditions were reached the reactivity at the beginning of the reaction was determined after 0 1 mmol g 1 of mca per mass of gac had been converted in the gac bed for these experiments the fresh gacs were used as provided by the manufacturer to determine the reactivity under stationary conditions the fixed bed experiments were divided into two consecutive steps i subjecting the gacs to monochloramine at cbed in 4 5 mg l 1 as cl2 t 30 c and qbed 40 l h 1 equalling a superficial filter velocity of vbed 44 1 m h 1 until no change in kapp was observed and stationary conditions were reached and ii determination of kapp under various stationary operation conditions e g different cbed in t or vbed gacs operating under stationary conditions were denoted as altered gacs a detailed description of the fbr experiments is provided in the following sections table 1 summarises all experiments conducted 2 9 temperature dependence of rate constants the temperature dependence of kapp is described using the arrhenius equation 10 k a p p t k 0 e e a r 0 t here k0 and ea are the frequency factor and the activation energy respectively r0 is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature ea is derived from the slope of the linear least squares best fit of the correlation between ln kapp and t 1 arrhenius plots levenspiel 1999 to describe the temperature dependence of mca conversion in the gac filter the activation energies ea see equation 10 of the reaction for both the fresh and the altered unfractionated gacs 30n k835 and centaur were determined in order to calculate ea kapp was experimentally determined in fbr experiments in a range of temperatures of 12 45 c other process parameters except the temperature were kept constant see table 1 2 10 verification of first order kinetics to experimentally verify the first order kinetic approach used in this study the reactivity of the altered unfractionated k835 gac was determined for various mca inflow concentrations the reproducibility of the measurement of kapp was determined from a set of four repeated experiments 2 11 impact of external mass transport on the overall reactivity to assess the impact of pore diffusional mass transport on the overall reactivity of the gac the influence of extra particle mass transport film diffusion on the overall reaction rate must be excluded ertl et al 1997 to check for the absence of film diffusion resistance kapp a was determined for different superficial flows vbed for filter beds of the fresh and altered unfractionated k835 gac to guarantee comparable conditions in all experiments the flow rate vbed was adjusted to the actual catalyst volume vbed such that the ebct in the filter column was 2 88 s the mass transfer coefficient of mca through the laminar filmlayer kf was calculated according to equation 11 worch 2012 11 k f s h d b u l k m c a d h y here sh is the sherwood number which was calculated according to the empirical approaches of williamson et al 1963 and gnielinski 1978 and dbulk mca is the bulk diffusion coefficient of mca in water which was calculated using the wilke chang correlation with 2 03 10 5 cm2 s 1 at 30 c wilke and chang 1955 if the rate of mass transfer through the laminar film layer is much larger than the surface based reaction rate constant thus kf kapp a external mass transfer limitation can be excluded 2 12 impact of internal mass transport on the overall reactivity 2 12 1 impact of grain size to check for the importance of grain size on the overall reactivity kapp was determined for different grain size fractions of the altered 30n gac to further elucidate the impact of grain size the thiele modulus φ was calculated according to equation 12 levenspiel 1999 the thiele modulus is a dimensionless constant representing the ratio of the overall reaction rate to the diffusion rate of the reactant in the pore system 12 φ l k a p p η d e m c a here l is the diffusion path length within the adsorbent which is dp 6 assuming a spherical shape of the gac grains levenspiel 1999 de mca is the effective diffusion coefficient of mca in the pore system and η is the effectiveness factor de mca was determined based on the pore size distribution of the individual gacs using the random intersecting pore model harriott 2003 and assuming surface diffusion of mca in the pore system of the gacs to be negligible fairey et al 2007 13 d e mca 1 t j d mca d bulk mca 1 d mca d p j 4 v p j j d mca v p j here τ is the tortuosity factor of the gacs dp j and vp j are the diameter and the incremental pore volume of a pore in the size fraction j as derived from the pore size distribution of the 30n gac and dmca is the minimal pore diameter of the gac that is still accessible for a mca molecule the effectiveness factor η is defined as the ratio of the reaction rate to the theoretical reaction rate without diffusional limitations ertl et al 1997 for a first order reaction taking place at a spherical grain η could be determined as follows levenspiel 1999 14 η 1 φ 1 t a n h 3 φ 1 3 φ numerical solutions of equations 12 and 14 give the corresponding values for φ and η 2 12 2 impact of pore size distribution in this set of experiments kapp was determined for the altered 30n k835 centaur and 100058 gacs to exclude the influence of gac grain size on kapp and to allow comparison between the gacs filter beds of equal grain size fractions were used 0 50 mm 100058 and 0 57 mm 30n k835 centaur to study the effect of the pore size distribution it will be discussed and proven in detail in sections 3 6 and 3 7 below that the prerequisites for the comparison between carbons of different surface chemical properties are fulfilled 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical characterisation of the gacs the physical characteristics of the gacs tested in this study are summarised in table 2 more details and further discussion of the results are given in section b of the sm there n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the fresh unfractionated gacs and the corresponding pore size distributions psd are shown in figure b1 and the grain size distribution of the fresh unfractionated gacs are shown in figure b2 3 2 verification of the first order reaction kinetics fig 2 exemplarily shows time plots of cbed in and cbed out of one of the four repeated verification experiments as well as kapp as calculated according to equation 3 fig 2 a shows the rapid decrease of the reaction rate constant until stationary conditions were reached after 90 h this is much shorter than the time reported in a previous study 1250 3000 h fairey et al 2007 although comparable mca inflow concentrations were used in both studies this discrepancy can be attributed to the significant differences in ebct of the respective gac beds 30 s in fairey et al 2007 and 2 8 s in this work and thus the difference in the time needed to oxidise the gac in the bed fig 2 b shows the determination of kapp at three different inflow concentrations that were adjusted after stationary conditions had been reached fig 3 shows the linear least squares regression analysis between kapp and cbed in the slope of the linear regression was almost zero 0 4 0 21 10 3 l mg 1 s 1 which shows that the reaction rate constant was independent of the inflow concentration this confirms the validity of the first order approach used in equation 3 this was also true for mca concentrations that are as low as typically found in swimming pool water e g 0 1 8 mg l 1 as cl2 weaver et al 2009 the repeatability standard deviation of kapp for the altered gac k835 determined by four identical repeated validation experiments was 0 006 s 1 4 which indicates a high reproducibility of the experimental method used additionally to check for heterogeneity of the reaction the maitlis test was conducted crabtree 2012 in that the loss of mca in the tank of the fbr system was measured once during the course of an experiment while bypassing the gac filter column results confirmed that no mca was degraded and thus no reactive agents leached from the gac 3 3 exclusion of extra particle mass transfer limitations fig 4 shows the dependence of the apparent surface related reaction rate constant kapp a in m s 1 determined experimentally and of the theoretical mass transfer coefficient of mca in the laminar film layer kf in m s 1 on the filter velocity vbed for the fresh and altered unfractionated gac k835 it showed that kapp a was independent of the superficial flow rate vbed for both the fresh and altered gac p 001 as mentioned above two empirical approaches for the calculation of the sherwood number were used it appeared that kapp a was 4 times lower than kf when the sherwood number was approximated according to williamson et al 1963 and 10 times lower when the approximation according to gnielinski 1978 was used similar results were obtained for the fresh 30n gac results not shown this proves that external mass transport is not limiting the overall reactivity worch 2008 for mca removal in gac filters over a wide range of superficial filter velocities for both fresh and altered gacs in previous work it was assumed that the negligible impact of film diffusion on the removal of dichloramine at gacs would also apply to the removal of mca fairey et al 2007 kim and snoeyink 1980 our results prove that this assumption is justified fig 4 impact of filter velocity on the experimentally determined apparent surface related reaction rate constant kapp a for mca conversion and the theoretical mass transfer coefficient kf of the unfractionated k835 gac error bars represent the 95 confidence interval mass transfer coefficients kf were calculated using a mean grain diameter dhy k835 of 1 39 mm the dashed vertical line represents the recommended filter velocity for gac filters in swimming pool water treatment in germany 30 m h 1 din 19643 2 2012 3 4 progress of the reaction until stationary conditions were reached fig 5 a shows the conversion time curves of mca in the gac filter for the 0 57 mm grain size fractions of the 30n k835 centaur and 100058 gac the respective reaction rates are given in fig 5 b and c it is apparent that the conversion time plot of mca removal for the conventional gacs 30n k835 centaur which comprise a homogeneously distributed and strongly microporous pore size distribution is hyperbolic while that of the 100058 gac is sigmoid s shaped the conversion time behaviour is reflected in the behaviour of the reaction rate over time kapp of the gacs 30n k835 and centaur drop continuously instead kapp of the 100058 first shows an increase and then decreases continuously after a maximum has been reached after about 15 h the sigmoid conversion time behaviour is often associated with a shift in the reaction controlling mechanism from chemical reaction rate control to diffusional control and can be described by the shrinking core model scm levenspiel 1999 the scm describes a reaction that starts first at the outer surface of the gac grains and the reaction front then moves towards the centre of the grains with ongoing reaction time levenspiel 1999 the difference in conversion time behaviour between the microporous gacs and the 100058 gac is explained in more detail in section c of the sm fig 5 mca removed a and bed volume based reaction rate constant kapp for mca removal b c over the filter run time all gacs had the same grain size of 0 55 mm 0 57 mm for the 100058 gac dashed horizontal lines in b represent the gac reactivity when stationary conditions were reached 3 5 impact of grain size fig 6 a presents the time course of the bed volume based first order reaction rate constant kapp for mca removal by different grain size fractions of the 30n gac until stationary conditions were reached the bed volume based reaction rate constants at stationary conditions are displayed in 6 b they decrease linearly with increasing grain diameter these results are in agreement with previous studies which however were obtained before stationary conditions were reached komorita and snoeyink 1985 fig 6 c shows the catalyst surface area related rate constants for different grain size fractions of the 30n carbon if the reaction only took place at the outer surface of the gac grains then kapp a would be independent of the grain diameter the decrease indicates that diffusional resistances in the pore systems are limiting the overall reaction rate to assess further the influence of pore diffusion on the overall reactivity the thiele modulus φ and the effectiveness factor ƞ were calculated using the stationary effective bed volume based reaction rate constants the minimal pore diameter of the gac that is accessible for the mca molecule dmca was needed in equation 13 as will be discussed further in section 3 6 dmca was assumed to be approximately twice the molecular diameter of the mca molecule the individual tortuosity factors τ of the carbons needed to determine dmca were calculated using the cstm model and are given in section b of the sm fig 7 shows φ as function of ƞ the thiele modulus of the grain size fractions 1 9 mm 1 18 mm unfractionated gac and 0 57 mm were 4 which confirmed that pore diffusion strongly controls the overall reaction the thiele modulus of the smallest grain size fraction 0 30 mm was 3 which is related to the transient region with moderate pore diffusional influence levenspiel 1999 in a previous study scaramelli and digiano 1977 a thiele modulus of 0 51 was found for a gac with a grain size of 0 5 mm the thiele modulus of the 0 57 mm fraction of the 30n gac observed in this study was higher by a factor of 15 this indicates that the importance of pore diffusion on the overall reactivity found in this study was higher compared to the previous results this discrepancy is due to the fact that de mca of the 30n gac 9 43 10 7 cm2 s 1 used to calculate ф in the present study was lower by a factor of 4 compared to that used previously where an estimated de mca of 5 484 10 6 cm2 s 1 was used scaramelli and digiano 1977 however they had no data available regarding the pore size distribution and based their estimation on the gacs porosity and roughly estimated tortuosity 3 6 impact of pore size distribution the magnitudes of φ and η fig 7 demonstrate a very strong limitation of the overall reaction rate by diffusion consequently it is concluded that kapp is not or only to a minor extent affected by the intrinsic chemical reaction which most likely differs among the different types of carbons tested given the strong pore diffusional control of the overall reaction conclusively values of kapp for the given set of equally sized gacs fig 5 are primarily affected by the effective diffusion coefficient of mca in the pore system de mca which in turn is a function of the pore size distribution equation 13 thus the gac that exhibits the highest de mca should exhibit the highest kapp and vice versa using the effective molecular diameter of mca of 0 5 nm calculated using the rasmol visualisation tool sayle and milnerwhite 1995 as dmca in equation 13 to calculate de mca for the different gacs gives the following order of de mca 2 28 10 6 cm2 s 1 30n 1 42 10 6 cm2 s 1 k835 1 26 10 6 cm2s 1 centaur obviously this order does not comply with the order of kapp shown in fig 8 0 036 s 1 centaur 0 025 s 1 k835 0 017 s 1 30n 0 016 s 1 100058 by calculating de mca as a function of dmca it appeared that the orders of de mca and kapp correspond when dmca is equal or larger than 1 3 nm this leads to the conclusion that pores 1 3 nm in width which is about 2 5 times the molecular diameter of a mca molecule might be barely accessible for mca this can be explained by constrictions at the pore mouth caused by water molecules that adsorb onto oxygen containing functional groups present at the gac surface by hydrogen bonding mccallum et al 1999 these findings are in agreement with those found in previous studies where it was assumed that certain pores might be barely accessible for mca molecules due to diffusional limitations fairey et al 2006 the significantly higher de mca found for the centaur gac for dmca 1 3 nm compared to the 30n and k835 gac results mainly from the large number of mesopores 7 nm which the other gacs did not contain it must be noted here that calculation of de mca for the 100058 gac according to equation 13 is not eligible due to the structured pore size distribution of the gac grains harriott 2003 3 7 impact of water temperature fig 8 presents arrhenius plots for mca removal in gac beds of the 30n k835 and centaur gac determined at temperatures between 12 and 45 c the activation energies ea of the fresh and altered gacs derived from the arrhenius plots ranged between 20 4 and 29 8 kj mol 1 for typical swimming pool water temperatures 20 35 c an increase of activation energy from 20 to 30 kj mol 1 results in an increase in the reaction rates of 40 fresh gacs and 80 altered gacs for the fresh unfractionated gacs investigated 30n and k835 activation energies were between 20 4 and 21 4 kj mol 1 for the altered unfractionated gacs investigated 30n k835 and centaur they were slightly higher namely between 26 0 and 29 3 kj mol 1 however the differences were not significant p 001 the activation energies determined are those for the combined pore diffusion surface reaction process it is interesting to note that temperature sensitivity was higher when the gacs had been altered i e for lower overall reaction rates for most chemical reactions the activation energy is in the range of 50 250 kj mol 1 for diffusional mass transport in water the diffusion coefficient is approximately linearly proportional to t from that an activation energy for diffusion in water of approximately 5 kj mol 1 can be calculated for the temperature dependence of the combined processes of diffusion and chemical surface reaction in pores it will consequently be lower for diffusion controlled processes i e when the chemical surface reaction is faster and will be higher for chemical surface reaction controlled processes thus as the alteration of the gacs brings about a decrease in a chemical reaction rate the higher activation energies found for the altered gacs although not significant due to the small number of data points available support the conclusions on diffusion control drawn above as diffusion limits less for slower chemical reactions additionally the conclusions on diffusion control are supported by the fact that activation energies found for mca removal in gac filters in this study were significantly lower than those reported for the removal of dichloramine 35 6 kj mol 1 at ph 10 kim et al 1978 and free chlorine 43 9 kj mol 1 at ph 7 6 suidan et al 1977 the lower activation energies are in agreement with the higher reactivity of gacs for the removal of dichloramine and free chlorine as compared with mca as shown previously in this study the impact of pore diffusion increases with increasing grain size of the gacs used consequently this increase in diffusional resistance should affect the temperature dependence of the overall reaction as well levenspiel 1999 however the difference in the experimentally determined ea for the unfractionated 30 n carbon 1 18 mm grain diameter and the 0 5 mm size fraction of the 30n gac was not significant p 001 this discrepancy can be explained by the limited resolution of the method used to determine kapp which in turn is used to calculate ea 4 summary and conclusions using a fixed bed reactor system the thorough investigation of apparent reaction rates of the removal of monochloramine at gac surfaces showed a rapid decrease with ongoing exposure of the gac to monochloramine quasi stationary conditions were reached after less than 100 h when the gac had been exposed to mca concentrations of 4 5 mg l 1 when quasi stationary conditions had been reached film diffusion definitely is not rate limiting however diffusion of monochloramine in the pores for the gacs investigated limits the overall reaction rate it was shown that the overall apparent reaction including diffusion and chemical reaction is first order as diffusion limitation of a second order chemical reaction will result in an apparent 1 5 order overall reaction and diffusion limitation of a first order reaction will result in an apparent first order overall reaction rate it is concluded that the reaction according to equation 2 is much faster than the reaction according to equation 1 or not taking place at all the dependence of the apparent overall reaction rate on temperature yielded activation energies ea according to the arrhenius relation in the range of 20 27 kj mol 1 this additionally supports the conclusion that diffusion is ratee limiting as chemical reactions usually show activation energies of 50 kj mol 1 or higher while temperature dependence of diffusion is equivalent to activation energies of about 10 kj mol 1 also the thiele modulus 3 0 42 1 derived from experiments with different grain sizes indicates that the overall reaction rate is strongly controlled by diffusional mass transport in the pore system of the gacs considered conclusively the pore size distribution of the gacs was found to have a significant impact on the overall reaction rate constant of mca removal in gac filters analysis of the impact of the pore size distribution indicates that pores 1 3 nm which is about 2 5 times the molecular diameter of mca are not accessible for the mca gac reaction instead the number of large mesopores is suggested to be of importance for a high overall reactivity of a gac bed for mca removal the use of smaller grain size fractions resulted in an increase of the overall reactivity of the gac bed which is attributed to a lower diffusion path length in the single gac grains if for example swimming pool water with a mca concentration of 0 2 mg l 1 is treated in a gac bed of 1 m height of the 30n gac and of the largest grain size investigated 1 9 mm the effluent concentration will be 0 038 mg l 1 for the smallest grain size 0 3 mm this effluent concentration can be achieved with a gac bed of 0 56 m however it must be considered that the use of smaller gac grain sizes for enhanced mca removal in full scale applications would bring about a considerably high pressure loss in fixed bed gac filters for the example described above using the empirical relationship described by ergun 1952 and 1 m bed of 1 9 mm grains the pressure loss will be 1 6 mbar however for a 0 56 m bed of the 0 3 mm grains the pressure loss will 24 mbar i e higher by a factor of 15 from the shape of the conversion time curves of the reaction it was concluded that the decrease of the reactivity of the gacs observed in the initial phase of the mca gac reaction is due to an increasing pore diffusional resistance that developed with increasing reaction time the increasing diffusional control is explained by the fact that the reaction front starts at the outer surface of the grains and

19759,overall apparent reaction rates for the removal of monochloramine mca in granular activated carbon gac beds were determined using a fixed bed reactor system and under conditions typical for swimming pool water treatment reaction rates dropped and quasi stationary conditions were reached quickly diffusional mass transport in the pores was shown to be limiting the overall reaction rate this was reflected consistently in the thiele modulus in the effect of temperature pore size distribution and of grain size on the reaction rates pores 2 5 times the diameter of the monochloramine molecule were shown to be barely accessible for the monochloramine conversion reaction gacs with a significant proportion of large mesopores were found to have the highest overall reactivity for monochloramine removal graphical abstract image 1 keywords swimming pool water monochloramine surface catalytic reaction granular activated carbon diffusion control 1 introduction hypochlorous acid hocl is widely used as disinfectant in swimming pools due to its effectiveness in disinfection a major drawback is its reactivity towards inorganic and organic matter present in pool water which results in the formation of halogenated disinfection by products dbps zwiener et al 2007 deborde and von gunten 2008 the dominating nitrogenous precursors for dbp formation that are introduced into the pool by bathers are urea and ammonia consolazio et al 1963 ammonia reacts with hocl to progressively form inorganic chloramines mono di and trichloramine blatchley and cheng 2010 qiang and adams 2004 urea however reacts in pool water through progressive chlorine addition forming chlorinated urea which finally breaks down to form the very volatile trichloramine blatchley and cheng 2010 chloramines are known to be irritating to skin and eyes and are suspected to cause respiratory problems eichelsdörfer et al 1975 this also includes an increased risk to children of asthma during adolescence bernard et al 2003 2008 consequently the sum of all inorganic chloramines is strictly regulated to a concentration of 0 2 mg l 1 as cl2 in swimming pools in germany din 19643 2 2012 and the us ansi apsp 1 2009 among the variety of inorganic chloramines monochloramine mca is the most dominant species in pool water a study of 11 swimming pools in the us found concentrations of monochloramine of up to 1 88 mg l 1 as cl2 weaver et al 2009 moreover mca is particularly of interest because it has been found to be a precursor for the formation of carcinogenic n nitrosodimethylamine ndma schreiber and mitch 2006 which was also found in chlorinated pools walse and mitch 2008 as bathers are introducing urea and ammonia into swimming pools the removal of the chloramines formed by the reaction of ammonia can decrease the total concentration of chloramines in the pool activated carbons are widely known as effective adsorbents worch 2012 schreiber et al 2005 however previous studies have shown that they are reducing agents for mca as well in that the reduction of mca primarily proceeds via a surface chemical reaction and the capacity of granular activated carbon gac filters for mca removal was found to be higher than expected when only adsorption was considered jaguaribe et al 2005 bauer and snoeyink 1973 over the course of the reaction the reactivity of gacs decreased before stationary conditions were reached scaramelli and digiano 1977 as a result activated carbon filters operated under swimming pool water conditions have a finite life time and need to be regenerated or replaced after a certain time in operation however the exact mechanism of the initial decrease of reactivity has not been fully understood until now previous studies proposed a two step process where mca is initially reduced at neutral ph to nh4 at free active carbon sites c equation 1 as enough surface oxides were formed the authors assume that mca is oxidised to n2 in a second slower reaction with surface oxides equation 2 bauer and snoeyink 1973 1 nh2cl h2o c nh4 cl c o 2 2 nh2cl c o h2o n2 2 h3o 2 cl c however a more recent study indicates that the ratio of transformation products nh4 and n2 formed did not change over the course of the reaction fairey et al 2007 which contradicts the hypothesis of bauer and snoeyink 1973 furthermore earlier studies reasoned that the overall reactivity is dominated by pore diffusion rather than by the surface chemical reactions komorita and snoeyink 1985 fairey et al 2006 mass transport in the pore system of gacs is known to be influenced by various parameters such as the grain size water temperature ertl et al 1997 the presence of surface oxides mangun et al 1999 and the pore size distribution of gacs maia et al 2008 to describe theoretically the mca removal process in gac filters the semi empirical mca catalysis model mcat model was established by kim 1977 to predict steady state mca removal in gac filters kim 1977 the mcat model was complemented recently to take into account the effect of source water type and ph fairey et al 2006 2006 however the model estimates the gac reactivity after stationary conditions are reached komorita and snoeyink 1985 using only basic gac properties such as the porosity and tortuosity of the gacs this makes the model inapplicable in elucidating mass transfer effects in detail which is important when considering the potentials for optimisation of the process thus considering the current state of knowledge the process of decreasing reactivity of gacs with increasing reaction time as well as the impact of pore diffusional limitations on the removal performance of a fixed gac bed is still not fully understood conclusively the aim of this study was to determine the impact of diffusional mass transport on the overall mca removal performance of gac for a wide range of operation conditions such as grain size pore size distribution and water temperature 2 materials and methods 2 1 fixed bed reactor system for determination of the reaction rate constants reaction rate constants for monochloramine removal in gac beds were determined using the fixed bed reactor fbr system shown in fig 1 it included a glass column of 34 mm inner diameter and a total length of 200 mm in which the gac bed is placed on a glass frit a glass frit close to the inlet ensures equal distribution of the flow to the gac bed the gac bed was continuously fed with an mca solution at a constant flow rate qbed from a rapidly stirred 250 rpm double walled glass tank of 10 l volume equipped with a stainless steel lid and with feedback temperature control b braun germany the conductivity of the mca solution was adjusted to 400 μs cm 1 by dosing 1 mol l 1 nacl solution before the experiment was started the volumetric flow rate through the bed was maintained by a turbine pump p1 bg1 30 gather industries germany and was measured using a magnetic inductive flow meter altoflux ifm 5080 k with ifc 080 transformer krohne germany the gac bed was prepared by initially filling the glass column disconnected from the system with deionised water subsequently gac that had been wetted and the pores filled with deionised water by applying a vacuum was transferred to the column the bed was then consolidated by carefully tamping the column to guarantee a reproducible packing after connecting the column to the fbr system the chloramine solution was circulated through all instruments and tubes while bypassing the column the experiment was started then by changing the fluid flow from bypass to the gac bed the effluents from the gac bed or the bypass were fed back to the tank the mca concentration in the tank was measured by an amperometric chlorine sensor dulcotest cte 1 dmt prominent germany mounted in a closed loop and flowed through by a peristaltic pump p2 5004s watson marlow uk at a flow rate of 25 l h 1 the ph in the tank was measured continuously and maintained constant at ph 7 which was in the ph range for swimming pool water din 19643 2 2012 by dosage with 0 3 mol l 1 phosphoric acid or 0 1 mol l 1 naoh using feedback controlled peristaltic pumps p4 p5 the level in the tank was kept constant by a peristaltic pump p3 triggered by a level electrode since mca was consumed in the gac bed the mca concentration in the tank and thus the mca inflow concentration to the gac bed cbed in were kept constant by feeding a cooled 4 6 c mca stock solution to the tank using a feedback controlled peristaltic micro pump p6 bvk ismatec germany that stock solution was placed on a balance ca 572 kern germany and the mass of the stock solution was recorded continuously thus at any time t the mass flow of stock solution to the tank was known a scada system topmessage delphin technologies germany was used for data recording and feedback control of all relevant process parameters of the fbr system 2 2 preparation of the monochloramine stock solution monochloramine stock solutions as used in the fbr experiments were prepared by drop wise addition of 750 ml of a ocl solution ph 10 0 032 mol l 1 prepared from a sodium hypochlorite solution 12 active chlorine to 250 ml of a rapidly stirred nh4cl or nh4 2so4 solution ph 10 0 098 mol l 1 nh4cl or 0 049 mol l 1 nh4 2so4 at a final molar chlorine to ammonia ratio of 1 00 1 03 aoki 1989 all chemicals were p a reagent grade 2 3 analytical quantification of monochloramine and hocl the total chlorine sensor of the fbr system was calibrated daily using the spectrophotometric dpd method din en iso 2000 using a unicam uv2 200 uv vis spectrophotometer with a 5 cm quartz cuvette the concentration of the ocl solution used to prepare the mca stock solution was determined spectrophotometrically using a molar absorption coefficient at 294 nm εocl 294nm of 348 mol 1 cm 1 hand and margerum 1983 the mca stock solution was determined at least twice a day according to the spectrophotometric method of schreiber and mitch accounting for the overlapping absorbance peaks of mca and dichloramine nhcl2 at 245 nm and 295 nm εnh2cl 245 nm 445 mol 1 cm 1 εnhcl2 245 nm 208 mol 1

1 cm 1 schurter et al 1995 the yield for transformation of nh4 n to mca n was found to be in a range from 95 to 100 2 4 granular activated carbons four commercially available granular activated carbons gacs were used in this study namely hydraffin 30 n from donau carbon gmbh 30 n silcarbon k 835 from silcarbon aktivkohle gmbh k835 centaur from chemviron carbon gmbh centaur and a spherically shaped activated carbon type 100058 from blücher gmbh 100058 the raw materials of the carbons were anthracite coal 30n coconut shells k835 bituminous coal centaur and non porous polymer based spheres 100058 the gacs as provided by the manufacturers are denoted as unfractionated fresh gacs in the following grain size fractions of the 30n k835 and centaur with mean grain diameters of 0 30 mm 0 25 0 355 mm 0 57 mm 0 50 0 63 mm and 1 90 mm 1 80 2 00 mm were prepared by sieving the unfractionated fresh gacs using a sieve tower as 200 retsch germany and if necessary by grinding the unfractionated fresh gacs using a ball mill pm100 retsch germany prior to sieving the 100058 gac was used solely at the original monomodal grain size dp provided by the manufacturer 0 55 mm before use the fresh gacs were treated by i soaking in ultrapure water for 24 h ii evacuating the soaked gac using a vacuum chamber until rising air bubbles could no longer be seen and iii washing and decantation of the gac using ultrapure water until the supernatant was particle free 2 5 physical characterisation of the gac evaluation of the bed volume specific outer surface area ao and the representative hydraulic grain size dhy of the unfractionated gacs is described in section a of the supplementary material sm the internal surface area abet the pore volume of micropores 2 nm and mesopores 2 50 nm the pore size distribution psd and the tortuosity of the fresh unfractionated gacs were determined from nitrogen adsorption desorption isotherms belsorp max microtracbel the pore volume of macropores 50 nm was determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry pascal 140 440 thermo fisher scientific to further elucidate the morphology of the 100058 gac images were taken from a cross section of a single gac grain with a high resolution scanning electron microscope fei nova nanosem 5 kv further details on the experimental procedures of physical gac characterisation are given in section b of the sm 2 6 data analysis and calculation of bed volume based apparent first order rate constants mca is consumed in the gac bed according to equations 1 and 2 above it is expected to follow first order kinetics with respect to mca if reaction 1 was slower than reaction 2 and thus rate limiting if reaction 2 was rate limiting then second order kinetics is expected finally mass transport inside the pores may be rate limiting diffusion control in that case a first order reaction will remain first order and a second order reaction will turn into an apparent 1 5 order reaction to take that into account apparent rate constants for a pseudo first order reaction were determined and the validity of that approach was verified in separate experiments see section 2 10 for a fixed bed reaction at stationary conditions the apparent bed volume based reaction rate constant kapp is obtained according to 3 k a p p 1 e b c t l n c b e d i n c b e d o u t where cbed in and cbed out are the gac bed s mca in and outflow concentrations and ebct is the empty bed contact time given by vbed qbed where vbed and qbed are the bed volume and the volumetric flow rate respectively to ensure that all gac in the filter bed was subjected to the almost same concentration of mca it was designed such that the change of the concentration from the inflow to the outflow of the bed was negligible generally typical outflow concentrations of monochloramine over the course of an experiment were about 5 below the inflow concentration see fig 2 consequently the measurement of the outflow concentration would have resulted in a lack of precision to overcome that restriction the outflow concentration was obtained from the decreasing mass of the mca stock solution the volumetric dosing rate qstock for any time t during an experiment is given by equation 4 4 q s t o c k t d m s t o c k d t ρ s t o c k t here ρstock t is the temperature dependent density of the stock solution and mstock is the recorded mass of the stock solution on the balance the time dependent mass loss dmstock dt was determined in time intervals of 0 5 1 h a mass balance for mca around the tank of the fbr system yields 5 q b e d c b e d o u t t q b e d c b e d i n q s t o c k t c s t o c k q s t o c k t c b e d i n r s y s t v s y s d c b e d i n d t here rsys accounts for a hypothetical loss of mca in the system excluding the gac bed e g through reaction at the glass or tube walls and cstock is the concentration of the mca stock solution preliminary experiments without gac showed that mca removal in the fbr system without gac was negligible thus 6 r s y s 0 since cbed in was kept constant the capacity term in equation 5 gives 7 v s y s d c b e d i n d t 0 introducing equations 6 and 7 into equation 5 and rearranging yields 8 c b e d o u t t q s t o c k t q b e d c b e d i n c s t o c k c b e d i n introducing equation 8 into equation 3 gives the bed volume based rate constant kapp at any time t 2 7 catalyst surface area based rate constants as the reduction of mca by gac is a solid surface reaction catalyst surface area based apparent rate constants kapp a are calculated from the bed volume based rate constants according to 9 k a p p a k a p p a 0 where a0 is the bed volume specific outer surface area of the gac in the fbr 2 8 conversion dependence of the overall reaction rate previous studies showed that the reactivity of gacs for mca conversion decreased gradually over time scaramelli and digiano 1977 however using the fbr system described above the time needed to acquire the data for determination of the rate constant at a given time t was short compared to the time needed for a notable decrease of gac reactivity thus for each time t the assumption of quasi steady state was justified to describe the process of decreasing reactivity of the heterogeneous mca gac reaction conversion time curves were determined in fbr experiments for all gacs until the reactivity was constant over time the general shape of the conversion time curves can indicate which one of the two widely recognised reaction models the progressive conversion model pcm or the shrinking core model scm levenspiel 1999 is appropriate fbr experiments were conducted to determine kapp either at the beginning of the mca gac reaction or after a certain time of operation when stationary conditions were reached the reactivity at the beginning of the reaction was determined after 0 1 mmol g 1 of mca per mass of gac had been converted in the gac bed for these experiments the fresh gacs were used as provided by the manufacturer to determine the reactivity under stationary conditions the fixed bed experiments were divided into two consecutive steps i subjecting the gacs to monochloramine at cbed in 4 5 mg l 1 as cl2 t 30 c and qbed 40 l h 1 equalling a superficial filter velocity of vbed 44 1 m h 1 until no change in kapp was observed and stationary conditions were reached and ii determination of kapp under various stationary operation conditions e g different cbed in t or vbed gacs operating under stationary conditions were denoted as altered gacs a detailed description of the fbr experiments is provided in the following sections table 1 summarises all experiments conducted 2 9 temperature dependence of rate constants the temperature dependence of kapp is described using the arrhenius equation 10 k a p p t k 0 e e a r 0 t here k0 and ea are the frequency factor and the activation energy respectively r0 is the universal gas constant and t is the temperature ea is derived from the slope of the linear least squares best fit of the correlation between ln kapp and t 1 arrhenius plots levenspiel 1999 to describe the temperature dependence of mca conversion in the gac filter the activation energies ea see equation 10 of the reaction for both the fresh and the altered unfractionated gacs 30n k835 and centaur were determined in order to calculate ea kapp was experimentally determined in fbr experiments in a range of temperatures of 12 45 c other process parameters except the temperature were kept constant see table 1 2 10 verification of first order kinetics to experimentally verify the first order kinetic approach used in this study the reactivity of the altered unfractionated k835 gac was determined for various mca inflow concentrations the reproducibility of the measurement of kapp was determined from a set of four repeated experiments 2 11 impact of external mass transport on the overall reactivity to assess the impact of pore diffusional mass transport on the overall reactivity of the gac the influence of extra particle mass transport film diffusion on the overall reaction rate must be excluded ertl et al 1997 to check for the absence of film diffusion resistance kapp a was determined for different superficial flows vbed for filter beds of the fresh and altered unfractionated k835 gac to guarantee comparable conditions in all experiments the flow rate vbed was adjusted to the actual catalyst volume vbed such that the ebct in the filter column was 2 88 s the mass transfer coefficient of mca through the laminar filmlayer kf was calculated according to equation 11 worch 2012 11 k f s h d b u l k m c a d h y here sh is the sherwood number which was calculated according to the empirical approaches of williamson et al 1963 and gnielinski 1978 and dbulk mca is the bulk diffusion coefficient of mca in water which was calculated using the wilke chang correlation with 2 03 10 5 cm2 s 1 at 30 c wilke and chang 1955 if the rate of mass transfer through the laminar film layer is much larger than the surface based reaction rate constant thus kf kapp a external mass transfer limitation can be excluded 2 12 impact of internal mass transport on the overall reactivity 2 12 1 impact of grain size to check for the importance of grain size on the overall reactivity kapp was determined for different grain size fractions of the altered 30n gac to further elucidate the impact of grain size the thiele modulus φ was calculated according to equation 12 levenspiel 1999 the thiele modulus is a dimensionless constant representing the ratio of the overall reaction rate to the diffusion rate of the reactant in the pore system 12 φ l k a p p η d e m c a here l is the diffusion path length within the adsorbent which is dp 6 assuming a spherical shape of the gac grains levenspiel 1999 de mca is the effective diffusion coefficient of mca in the pore system and η is the effectiveness factor de mca was determined based on the pore size distribution of the individual gacs using the random intersecting pore model harriott 2003 and assuming surface diffusion of mca in the pore system of the gacs to be negligible

in this set of experiments kapp was determined for the altered 30n k835 centaur and 100058 gacs to exclude the influence of gac grain size on kapp and to allow comparison between the gacs filter beds of equal grain size fractions were used 0 50 mm 100058 and 0 57 mm 30n k835 centaur to study the effect of the pore size distribution it will be discussed and proven in detail in sections 3 6 and 3 7 below that the prerequisites for the comparison between carbons of different surface chemical properties are fulfilled 3 results and discussion 3 1 physical characterisation of the gacs the physical characteristics of the gacs tested in this study are summarised in table 2 more details and further discussion of the results are given in section b of the sm there n2 adsorption desorption isotherms of the fresh unfractionated gacs and the corresponding pore size distributions psd are shown in figure b1 and the grain size distribution of the fresh unfractionated gacs are shown in figure b2 3 2 verification of the first order reaction kinetics fig 2 exemplarily shows time plots of cbed in and cbed out of one of the four repeated verification experiments as well as kapp as calculated according to equation 3 fig 2 a shows the rapid decrease of the reaction rate constant until stationary conditions were reached after 90 h this is much shorter than the time reported in a previous study 1250 3000 h fairey et al 2007 although comparable mca inflow concentrations were used in both studies this discrepancy can be attributed to the significant differences in ebct of the respective gac beds 30 s in fairey et al 2007 and 2 8 s in this work and thus the difference in the time needed to oxidise the gac in the bed fig 2 b shows the determination of kapp at three different inflow concentrations that were adjusted after stationary conditions had been reached fig 3 shows the linear least squares regression analysis between kapp and cbed in the slope of the linear regression was almost zero 0 4 0 21 10 3 l mg 1 s 1 which shows that the reaction rate constant was independent of the inflow concentration this confirms the validity of the first order approach used in equation 3 this was also true for mca concentrations that are as low as typically found in swimming pool water e g 0 1 8 mg l 1 as cl2 weaver et al 2009 the repeatability standard deviation of kapp for the altered gac k835 determined by four identical repeated validation experiments was 0 006 s 1 4 which indicates a high reproducibility of the experimental method used additionally to check for heterogeneity of the reaction the maitlis test was conducted crabtree 2012 in that the loss of mca in the tank of the fbr system was measured once during the course of an experiment while bypassing the gac filter column results confirmed that no mca was degraded and thus no reactive agents leached from the gac 3 3 exclusion of extra particle mass transfer limitations fig 4 shows the dependence of the apparent surface related reaction rate constant kapp a in m s 1 determined experimentally and of the theoretical mass transfer coefficient of mca in the laminar film layer kf in m s 1 on the filter velocity vbed for the fresh and altered unfractionated gac k835 it showed that kapp a was independent of the superficial flow rate vbed for both the fresh and altered gac p 001 as mentioned above two empirical approaches for the calculation of the sherwood number were used it appeared that kapp a was 4 times lower than kf when the sherwood number was approximated according to williamson et al 1963 and 10 times lower when the approximation according to gnielinski 1978 was used similar results were obtained for the fresh 30n gac results not shown this proves that external mass transport is not limiting the overall reactivity worch 2008 for mca removal in gac filters over a wide range of superficial filter velocities for both fresh and altered gacs in previous work it was assumed that the negligible impact of film diffusion on the removal of dichloramine at gacs would also apply to the removal of mca fairey et al 2007 kim and snoeyink 1980 our results prove that this assumption is justified fig 4 impact of filter velocity on the experimentally determined apparent surface related reaction rate constant kapp a for mca conversion and the theoretical mass transfer coefficient kf of the unfractionated k835 gac error bars represent the 95 confidence interval mass transfer coefficients kf were calculated using a mean grain diameter dhy k835 of 1 39 mm the dashed vertical line represents the recommended filter velocity for gac filters in swimming pool water treatment in germany 30 m h 1 din 19643 2 2012 3 4 progress of the reaction until stationary conditions were reached fig 5 a shows the conversion time curves of mca in the gac filter for the 0 57 mm grain size fractions of the 30n k835 centaur and 100058 gac the respective reaction rates are given in fig 5 b and c it is apparent that the conversion time plot of mca removal for the conventional gacs 30n k835 centaur which comprise a homogeneously distributed and strongly microporous pore size distribution is hyperbolic while that of the 100058 gac is sigmoid s shaped the conversion time behaviour is reflected in the behaviour of the reaction rate over time kapp of the gacs 30n k835 and centaur drop continuously instead kapp of the 100058 first shows an increase and then decreases continuously after a maximum has been reached after about 15 h the sigmoid conversion time behaviour is often associated with a shift in the reaction controlling mechanism from chemical reaction rate control to diffusional control and can be described by the shrinking core model scm levenspiel 1999 the scm describes a reaction that starts first at the outer surface of the gac grains and the reaction front then moves towards the centre of the grains with ongoing reaction time levenspiel 1999 the difference in conversion time behaviour between the microporous gacs and the 100058 gac is explained in more detail in section c of the sm fig 5 mca removed a and bed volume based reaction rate constant kapp for mca removal b c over the filter run time all gacs had the same grain size of 0 55 mm 0 57 mm for the 100058 gac dashed horizontal lines in b represent the gac reactivity when stationary conditions were reached 3 5 impact of grain size fig 6 a presents the time course of the bed volume based first order reaction rate constant kapp for mca removal by different grain size fractions of the 30n gac until stationary conditions were reached the bed volume based reaction rate constants at stationary conditions are displayed in 6 b they decrease linearly with increasing grain diameter these results are in agreement with previous studies which however were obtained before stationary conditions were reached komorita and snoeyink 1985 fig 6 c shows the catalyst surface area related rate constants for different grain size fractions of the 30n carbon if the reaction only took place at the outer surface of the gac grains then kapp a would be independent of the grain diameter the decrease indicates that diffusional resistances in the pore systems are limiting the overall reaction rate to assess further the influence of pore diffusion on the overall reactivity the thiele modulus φ and the effectiveness factor ƞ were calculated using the stationary effective bed volume based reaction rate constants the minimal pore diameter of the gac that is accessible for the mca molecule dmca was needed in equation 13 as will be discussed further in section 3 6 dmca was assumed to be approximately twice the molecular diameter of the mca molecule the individual tortuosity factors τ of the carbons needed to determine dmca were calculated using the cstm model and are given in section b of the sm fig 7 shows φ as function of ƞ the thiele modulus of the grain size fractions 1 9 mm 1 18 mm unfractionated gac and 0 57 mm were 4 which confirmed that pore diffusion strongly controls the overall reaction the thiele modulus of the smallest grain size fraction 0 30 mm was 3 which is related to the transient region with moderate pore diffusional influence levenspiel 1999 in a previous study scaramelli and digiano 1977 a thiele modulus of 0 51 was found for a gac with a grain size of 0 5 mm the thiele modulus of the 0 57 mm fraction of the 30n gac observed in this study was higher by a factor of 15 this indicates that the importance of pore diffusion on the overall reactivity found in this study was higher compared to the previous results this discrepancy is due to the fact that de mca of the 30n gac 9 43 10 7 cm2 s 1 used to calculate ф in the present study was lower by a factor of 4 compared to that used previously where an estimated de mca of 5 484 10 6 cm2 s 1 was used scaramelli and digiano 1977 however they had no data available regarding the pore size distribution and based their estimation on the gacs porosity and roughly estimated tortuosity 3 6 impact of pore size distribution the magnitudes of φ and η fig 7 demonstrate a very strong limitation of the overall reaction rate by diffusion consequently it is concluded that kapp is not or only to a minor extent affected by the intrinsic chemical reaction which most likely differs among the different types of carbons tested given the strong pore diffusional control of the overall reaction conclusively values of kapp for the given set of equally sized gacs fig 5 are primarily affected by the effective diffusion coefficient of mca in the pore system de mca which in turn is a function of the pore size distribution equation 13 thus the gac that exhibits the highest de mca should exhibit the highest kapp and vice versa using the effective molecular diameter of mca of 0 5 nm calculated using the rasmol visualisation tool sayle and milnerwhite 1995 as dmca in equation 13 to calculate de mca for the different gacs gives the following order of de mca 2 28 10 6 cm2 s 1 30n 1 42 10 6 cm2 s 1 k835 1 26 10 6 cm2s 1 centaur obviously this order does not comply with the order of kapp shown in fig 8 0 036 s 1 centaur 0 025 s 1 k835 0 017 s 1 30n 0 016 s 1 100058 by calculating de mca as a function of dmca it appeared that the orders of de mca and kapp correspond when dmca is equal or larger than 1 3 nm this leads to the conclusion that pores 1 3 nm in width which is about 2 5 times the molecular diameter of a mca molecule might be barely accessible for mca this can be explained by constrictions at the pore mouth caused by water molecules that adsorb onto oxygen containing functional groups present at the gac surface by hydrogen bonding mccallum et al 1999 these findings are in agreement with those found in previous studies where it was assumed that certain pores might be barely accessible for mca molecules due to diffusional limitations fairey et al 2006 the significantly higher de mca found for the centaur gac for dmca 1 3 nm compared to the 30n and k835 gac results mainly from the large number of mesopores 7 nm which the other gacs did not contain it must be noted here that calculation of de mca for the 100058 gac according to equation 13 is not eligible due to the structured pore size distribution of the gac grains harriott 2003 3 7 impact of water temperature fig 8 presents arrhenius plots for mca removal in gac beds of the 30n k835 and centaur gac determined at temperatures between 12 and 45 c the activation energies ea of the fresh and altered gacs derived from the arrhenius plots ranged between 20 4 and 29 8 kj mol 1 for typical swimming pool water temperatures 20 35 c an increase of activation energy from 20 to 30 kj mol 1 results in an increase in the reaction rates of 40 fresh gacs and 80 altered gacs for the fresh unfractionated gacs investigated 30n and k835 activation energies were between 20 4 and 21 4 kj mol 1 for the altered unfractionated gacs investigated 30n k835 and centaur they were slightly higher namely between 26 0 and 29 3 kj mol 1 however the differences were not significant p 001 the activation energies determined are those for the combined pore diffusion surface reaction process it is interesting to note that temperature sensitivity was higher when the gacs had been altered i e for lower overall reaction rates for most chemical reactions the activation energy is in the range of 50 250 kj mol 1 for diffusional mass transport in water the diffusion coefficient is approximately linearly proportional to t from that an activation energy for diffusion in water of approximately 5 kj mol 1 can be calculated for the temperature dependence of the combined processes of diffusion and chemical surface reaction in pores it will consequently be lower for diffusion controlled processes i e when the chemical surface reaction is faster and will be higher for chemical surface reaction controlled processes thus as the alteration of the gacs brings about a decrease in a chemical reaction rate the higher activation energies found for the altered gacs although not significant due to the small number of data points available support the conclusions on diffusion control drawn above as diffusion limits less for slower chemical reactions additionally the conclusions on diffusion control are supported by the fact that activation energies found for mca removal in gac filters in this study were significantly lower than those reported for the removal of dichloramine 35 6 kj mol 1 at ph 10 kim et al 1978 and free chlorine 43 9 kj mol 1 at ph 7 6 suidan et al 1977 the lower activation energies are in agreement with the higher reactivity of gacs for the removal of dichloramine and free chlorine as compared with mca as shown previously in this study the impact of pore diffusion increases with increasing grain size of the gacs used consequently this increase in diffusional resistance should affect the temperature dependence of the overall reaction as well levenspiel 1999 however the difference in the experimentally determined ea for the unfractionated 30 n carbon 1 18 mm grain diameter and the 0 5 mm size fraction of the 30n gac was not significant p 001 this discrepancy can be explained by the limited resolution of the method used to determine kapp which in turn is used to calculate ea 4 summary and conclusions using a fixed bed reactor system the thorough investigation of apparent reaction rates of the removal of monochloramine at gac surfaces showed a rapid decrease with ongoing exposure of the gac to monochloramine quasi stationary conditions were reached after less than 100 h when the gac had been exposed to mca concentrations of 4 5 mg l 1 when quasi stationary conditions had been reached film diffusion definitely is not rate limiting however diffusion of monochloramine in the pores for the gacs investigated limits the overall reaction rate it was shown that the overall apparent reaction including diffusion and chemical reaction is first order as diffusion limitation of a second order chemical reaction will result in an apparent 1 5 order overall reaction and diffusion limitation of a first order reaction will result in an apparent first order overall reaction rate it is concluded that the reaction according to equation 2 is much faster than the reaction according to equation 1 or not taking place at all the dependence of the apparent overall reaction rate on temperature yielded activation energies ea according to the arrhenius relation in the range of 20 27 kj mol 1 this additionally supports the conclusion that diffusion is ratee limiting as chemical reactions usually show activation energies of 50 kj mol 1 or higher while temperature dependence of diffusion is equivalent to activation energies of about 10 kj mol 1 also the thiele modulus 3 0 42 1 derived from experiments with different grain sizes indicates that the overall reaction rate is strongly controlled by diffusional mass transport in the pore system of the gacs considered conclusively the pore size distribution of the gacs was found to have a significant impact on the overall reaction rate constant of mca removal in gac filters analysis of the impact of the pore size distribution indicates that pores 1 3 nm which is about 2 5 times the molecular diameter of mca are not accessible for the mca gac reaction instead the number of large mesopores is suggested to be of importance for a high overall reactivity of a gac bed for mca removal the use of smaller grain size fractions resulted in an increase of the overall reactivity of the gac bed which is attributed to a lower diffusion path length in the single gac grains if for example swimming pool water with a mca concentration of 0 2 mg l 1 is treated in a gac bed of 1 m height of the 30n gac and of the largest grain size investigated 1 9 mm the effluent concentration will be 0 038 mg l 1 for the smallest grain size 0 3 mm this effluent concentration can be achieved with a gac bed of 0 56 m however it must be considered that the use of smaller gac grain sizes for enhanced mca removal in full scale applications would bring about a considerably high pressure loss in fixed bed gac filters for the example described above using the empirical relationship described by ergun 1952 and 1 m bed of 1 9 mm grains the pressure loss will be 1 6 mbar however for a 0 56 m bed of the 0 3 mm grains the pressure loss will 24 mbar i e higher by a factor of 15 from the shape of the conversion time curves of the reaction it was concluded that the decrease of the reactivity of the gacs observed in the initial phase of the mca gac reaction is due to an increasing pore diffusional resistance that developed with increasing reaction time the increasing diffusional control is explained by the fact that the reaction front starts at the outer surface of the grains and
