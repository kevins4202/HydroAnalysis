researchers and marine industry as reported in the european maritime safety agency allianz global corporate and speciality 2012 the collisions and groundings take 71 of accidents in european waters during the period 2011 2016 teixeira and guedes soares 2018 reported that general cargo ships account for 43 of all marine casualties reported followed by passenger ships 24 one of the most significant reasons is that the size of cargo ship grows large which causes the ship s manoeuvrability to decrease especially in shallow water and confined waters as described by vantorre et al 2017 manoeuvrability in shallow water is critically important as ships have to access harbours in shallow and confined waters where the traffic is more complex this put forward higher requirement about ship s manoeuvrability tello ruiz et al 2015 lataire et al 2012 maimun et al 2011 vantorre et al 2017 yoshimura 1986 zhou et al 2016 the study on ship manoeuvrability in shallow water benefits ship pilots and designers who are more interested in the response characteristics to commanded changes of the direction of ship motions the development of numerical computation makes it possible to simulate the ship response travelling in a confined waterway du et al 2017 and shallow water kaidi et al 2018 using the ship manoeuvring mathematical models the models can also be incorporated in vessel simulators varela and guedes soares 2015a 2015b which can be used to train ship pilots and hardware in the loop test for ship controller sørensen 2011 a mathematical model is widely used to describe the dynamics of ships in deep water as well as shallow water maimun et al 2011 many mathematical models have been proposed to meet different applications considering the trade off between the complexity and fidelity such as abkowitz 1980 mmg model yoshimura 2005 nomoto model nomoto et al 1956 vectorial model fossen 2011 a generic nonlinear manoeuvring model sutulo and guedes soares 2015 a more comprehensive review of ship manoeuvring models can be found in sutulo and guedes soares 2011 vantorre et al 2017 discussed ship manoeuvrability in shallow water and confined waterway a mathematical manoeuvring model with finite water depth was proposed by norrbin 1971 wing theory was used to calculate the derivatives of ship manoeuvring in shallow water inoue and murayama 1969 vantorre 2001 evaluated a semi empirical formula for manoeuvring in shallow water eloot et al 2015 reported on efforts of validation of shallow water manoeuvring simulation through free running tests it is noteworthy that the benchmark data for manoeuvring in shallow water of dtc ship model is now available at mashcon for the validation and verification van zwijnsvoorde et al 2019 the most convenient way of modelling the shallow water effect is to approximate the hydrodynamic forces and moments by means of manoeuvring coefficients accounting for water depth dependence factors system identification is one of the mature techniques for estimating the coefficients with the measured data ljung 1999 as described by sutulo and guedes soares 2006 captive model tests are a reliable and effective method to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments from which hydrodynamic coefficients in manoeuvring model can be identified ross et al 2015 estimated the hydrodynamic coefficients of a nonlinear manoeuvring model based on planar motion mechanism pmm tests using the nonlinear least square method the obtained manoeuvring model was then validated in full scale hassani et al 2015 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 developed an optimal offline system identification method combined the least square with genetic algorithm for the parameters estimation of a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model a similar approach can also be found in xu et al 2018b where a loss function considering both the bias and variance of the errors between the reference outputs and the mathematical model outputs was proposed for the estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients based on free running manoeuvring tests an online least square support vector machine was applied to modelling the nonlinear ship steering motion in real time in xu et al 2019b perera et al 2015 2016 applied the extended kalman filter to estimate the dynamic parameters of a modified nomoto model for vessel steering however a number of problems have arisen in the course of parameter estimation such as overfitting and parameter uncertainty or so called parameter drift hwang 1980 luo et al 2016 luo and zou 2009 in order to get a high fidelity manoeuvring model the structure of the proposed model is usually very complex and redundant this kind of models will result in overfitting sutulo and guedes soares 2011 and the obtained parameters are dominated by the noise and drift from the true values xu et al 2018a several methods have been proposed to diminish the parameter drift for ship manoeuvring models such as model simplification parallel processing and additional excitation hwang 1980 luo and li 2017 it needs to be pointed out that the main purpose of these methods is to reconstruct the samples and lighten the multicollinearity of the variabilities in the input matrix xu et al 2018a 2019a analysed the parameter uncertainty by using singular value decomposition and a robust parameter estimation was achieved computational fluid dynamics cfd is a very useful tool for the study on manoeuvring in confined waterway it was recommended in the report by the manoeuvring committee of the 24th international towing tank conference ittc 2005 cfd has also been used to study the ship manoeuvring in shallow water jin et al 2016 wang et al 2009 bank effect xu et al 2017 ship ship interaction zhou et al 2016 numerical pmm test islam and guedes soares 2018 just to name a few but the verification and validation of this method still have some way to go to avoid the burden of parameter estimation the implicit model has been used for modelling of dynamical systems it is also well known as the black box model in which no physical knowledge of the dynamic system is required and inputs and outputs must be measured it can be treated as a response function which represents the input output mapping characteristic of the dynamic system artificial neural networks anns is one of the most widely used technology for the black box model anns have been applied to the research on ship manoeuvring simulations luo et al 2014 moreira and guedes soares 2003a 2012 applied recursive neural networks for ship manoeuvring motion simulations and the results compared well with manoeuvring trials moreira and guedes soares 2003b hess et al 2006 carried out ship manoeuvring simulation in wind and waves using recursive neural networks recently a kernel based machine learning method support vector machine svm has been used for system identification suykens et al 2002 vapnik 1998 1995 it has a better generalization performance compared with anns because the optimization problem of solving svms is defined by considering the trade off between the empirical errors and the complexity of the model svm has been used to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients for marine vessels luo and zou 2009 firstly applied the least square support vector machine ls svm to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of an abkowitz model further work on this topic can be found in luo et al 2016 in which particle swarm optimization was employed to choose the regularization factor xu and guedes soares 2016a used the ls svm to identify a nonlinear steering model for ship autopilot design further studies can be found in xu et al 2017 xu and guedes soares 2016b zhu et al 2017 employed the ls svm combined with artificial bee colony algorithm to estimate a dynamic model of a large container ship manoeuvring simulations of catamaran using implicit models were carried out based on svm by luo et al 2014 the main contribution of this paper is to propose an optimal truncated least square support vector machine ls svm and then use it to substitute the manoeuvring models in shallow water of the dtc ship model a series of pmm tests such as pure drift pure sway pure yaw and mixed yaw and drift were carried out by flanders hydraulics research fhr in their towing tank using the dtc ship model moctar et al 2012 the nonlinear regression models in 3 dof surge sway and yaw are constructed by using the proposed method optimal truncated ls svm it is different from the method of wei et al 2006 or zheng et al 2014 where singular value decomposition svd was employed for signal pre processing and the filtered data was then used for training the classical ls svm here the optimal truncated ls svm is implemented by calculating the singular value decomposition svd of the kernel matrix and neglecting the small singular values as well as the corresponded matrix due to their negligible contribution to the solutions the dimensionality reduction of the kernel matrix is achieved which reduce the computation cost the optimal truncated number of singular values is estimated using l curve which plays the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data the radial basis function kernel is chosen and the quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea is employed to search the optimal values of the regularization factor and kernel width with the optimal parameters the truncated ls svm is used to train the nonlinear regression models for ship manoeuvring the performance of the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring models is further tested against the validation set which is completely left untouched during the training process the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes a nonlinear manoeuvring model for marine surface vessel in shallow water in section 3 planar motion mechanism pmm test in shallow water was carried out using dtc ship model the optimal truncated nonlinear kernel based least square support vector machine is proposed and the quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm was introduced in section 4 in section 5 manoeuvring modelling in shallow water was carried out using the proposed method the generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring models was further tested against the validation set the final section is the conclusion 2 mathematical manoeuvring model of the marine surface vessel the manoeuvring motions of a marine surface vessel are usually described in 3 degrees of freedom dofs surge sway and yaw as illustrated in fig 1 because the manoeuvring motions typically occur with a much lower frequency than the wave encounter frequencies faltinsen 2006 it is reasonable to assume that the frequency dependent added mass and potential damping are approximated by constant values and neglect the fluid memory effects which are typically considered for the seakeeping motions fossen 2011 assume a ship moving in a horizontal plane as presented in fig 2 two different coordinate systems north east down ned and body fixed frame are defined the ned is a local horizontal coordinate plane the body frame is a moving coordinate frame that is fixed to the craft the manoeuvring mathematical model is usually defined in the body fixed frame the dynamic equation 1 are organized in such a way that acceleration derivative force coefficients are presented on the left hand side as added masses μ 11 μ 22 μ 26 and μ 66 quasi steady x q y q n q forces and moments and propeller thrust x p are placed on the right hand side 1 m μ 11 u m v r m x g r 2 x q x p m μ 22 v m x g μ 26 r m u r y q m x g μ 26 v i z z μ 66 r m x g u r n q where m is the mass of the ship and i z z is the moment of inertia x g is the longitudinal position of the centre of gravity u v r are the state variables surge sway velocities and yaw rate respectively the upper dot signs on the top of those variables refer to their related accelerations the most common method of describing the hydrodynamic forces is to apply regression models sutulo and guedes soares 2011 the first consequent formulations of a global manoeuvring model using multivariate algebraic polynomials were proposed by abkowitz 1980 also well known as abkowitz manoeuvring model the hydrodynamic forces and moments are approximated using 3 order truncated taylor expansion techniques this model has a good generalization performance as well as its modified versions hwang 1980 xu et al 2018a but the disadvantage is that the model is complex and redundancy many hydrodynamic coefficients have no physical meaning in order to simplify the structure of the model a quasi polynomial model was used and it is slightly more computational economical and with a good generalization performance a typical nondimensionalized manoeuvring model in quasi polynomial is given 2 x q v r x 0 x v v v v x v r v r x r r r r y q v r y 0 y v v y r r y v v v v v y v r v r n q v r n 0 n v v n r r n r v r v n v r v r n r r r r as discussed in mucha 2017 ship motions in shallow water involve hydrodynamic interactions with vertical flow restrictions affecting the dynamic floating position of ships underway and hydrodynamic properties relating to inertia lift and cross flow forces mucha 2017 the intrinsic way of modelling the shallow water effect is to approximate the hydrodynamic forces and moments by means of manoeuvring coefficients accounting for water depth dependence factors considering the effect of shallow water a novel model structure with explicit h terms involved in the functions is proposed 3 m μ 11 u m v r m x g r 2 f 1 u v r u v r h t m μ 22 v m x g μ 26 r m u r f 2 u v r u v r h t m x g μ 26 v i z z μ 66 r m x g u r f 3 u v r u v r h t where f i u v r u v r h t i 1 3 is an unknown nonlinear multivariate function in which the water depth is one variable they are used to approximate the surge sway forces and yaw moment with the nonlinear multivariate functions the manoeuvring model can be used to simulate ship manoeuvring in varying water depth 3 planar motion mechanism pmm tests in shallow water the planar motion mechanism pmm tests using a ship model is introduced in this section the tests were performed by flanders hydraulics research fhr in the framework of the shopera project delefortrie and vantorre 2007 papanikolaou et al 2016 in total 102 pmm tests pure drift pure sway and pure yaw have been performed with different water depths velocities amplitudes and sample period see table 1 a scaled ship model of a modern container carrier was used during the test and it is well known as the dtc ship model eloot et al 2016 moctar et al 2012 the main particulars are given in table 2 captive model tests are nowadays commonly used for modelling the ship motions delefortrie et al 2016a b vantorre and eloot 1998 it can provide rich information for system identification method and get a reasonable estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients however it is costly to perform such tests here a brief summary of different pmm tests is presented such as pure drift pure sway pure yaw and mixed sway and yaw which were performed at flanders hydraulics research fhr as presented in fig 3 the towing tank at fhr has a total length 87 5 m a width of 7 m and a maximum water depth of 0 5 m eloot et al 2016 more detail information can be found in van kerkhove et al 2009 and delefortrie et al 2016 the ship and tank fixed coordinate system is presented in fig 4 the ship mode was towed forward at a constant speed with a fixed drift angle β in pure drift as presented in fig 5 a so the surge and sway velocity are a non zero constant while the yaw rate is zero u u cos β v u sin β r 0 pure sway tests can be used to isolate the sway dynamics from the yaw motion the hydrodynamic coefficients related to the yaw motion can be neglected due to the zero yaw rate during the test the ship will move forward with a constant velocity and with a sinusoidal oscillation in sway where u u c v v max cos ω t and ψ 0 as presented in fig 5 b during the pure yaw test the ship moves forward with a constant velocity and with a sinusoidal oscillation in sway motion where u u c v 0 and ψ ψ max cos ω t as presented in fig 5 c in order to study the coupled dynamic of yaw and sway motion a combined test pure yaw and drift was carried out using a ship model with a sinusoidal oscillation in sway motion as well as a sinusoidal oscillation of yaw motion around a constant drift angle the pathline is presented in fig 5 d this test can provide the dynamic information of surge sway and yaw motion so it can be used to estimate the coupled coefficients which corresponded to the surge sway and yaw motion during the test the ground speed and drift angle are kept as constant and the yaw rate is set as a sinusoidal oscillation u u c β β c and ψ ψ max cos ω t 4 optimal truncated nonlinear kernel based least square support vector machine in this section an optimal truncated nonlinear kernel based least square support vector machine ls svm is proposed for the approximation of the regression model of ship manoeuvring the optimal truncated ls svm is a robust method for regression it trains the model by employing the singular values decomposition of the kernel matrix and filter out the smaller singular values meanwhile it can reduce the computation cost due to the dimensionality reduction of the kernel matrix 4 1 optimal truncated ls svm given the training set s s i s i x i y i x i ℜ n y i ℜ i 1 n where x i is the input and y i is the output as presented by suykens et al 2002 the general approximation function of svm is given 4 y x w t ϕ x b where x is the input y x are the target values b is the bias term w is a weight matrix ϕ x is mapping function that map the training data x i to a higher dimensional feature space suykens et al 2002 for function estimation the following optimization problem can be formulated in the primal weight space 5 min w b e i j w e 1 2 w t w 1 2 c i 1 n e i 2 s t y i w t ϕ x i b e i i 1 n where e i i 1 n is the error and c is the regularization factor it balances the well known structural risk which is the trade off between the model accuracy and the model complexity suykens et al 2002 constructing the lagrange function and gives as 6 l w b e i α i 1 2 w t w 1 2 c i 1 n e i 2 i 1 n α i w t ϕ x i b e i y i where α i are the lagrange multipliers according to the karush kuhn tucker conditions kkt suykens et al 2002 the conditions for the optimality are given 7 l w 0 w i 1 n α i ϕ x i l b 0 i 1 n α i 0 l e i 0 α i c e i i 1 n l α i 0 w t ϕ x i b e i y i 0 i 1 n after the elimination of the variable w and e i one gets the following solution 8 0 1 1 k x k x i c 1 i b α 0 y where i is an n n identity matrix α α 1 α n t y y 1 y n t the kernel function is applied here as follows 9 k x k x i φ x k t φ x i i 1 n the resulted ls svm model for the regression is given 10 y x i 1 n α i k x x i b as can be observed the kernel function plays an important role in the function estimation it represents an inner product between its operands it is positive definite and satisfies the mercer condition suykens and vandewalle 1999 vapnik 1995 what is more interesting is that k x x i is usually inexpensive to calculate even though φ x itself may be very expensive to calculate considering the performance of the nonlinear approximation a nonlinear kernel the radial basis function kernel rbf is chosen in this paper the rbf kernel is given 11 k x x i exp x x i 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the free parameter x x i 2 can be recognized as the squared euclidean distance between the two feature vectors rbf kernel measures the similarity between vectors it is close to 1 when the vectors are close and near 0 when the vectors are far apart the principle of kernel based svm can be illustrated in fig 6 as presented in eq 9 the dimension of the kernel matrix k x k x i is n n it is proportional to the length of the training set so if there are large amounts of data in the training set the classical ls svm fails to inverse the matrix due to the heavy computation as suggested by suykens et al 2002 the maximum length of the training set is 2000 but a limited training set will result in a local optimum so it is necessary to improve the robustness of the classical ls svm when the training set is large the obtained parameter matrix is usually dominated by the noise and drift from the true values the corresponded numerical model fits well with the training data and fails to reproduce the training set this is also well known as overfitting in the following phase an optimal truncated ls svm is proposed to solve the problem firstly using the singular value decomposition the kernel matrix can be rewritten as 12 a i 1 n u i σ i v i t u σ v t then the parameter matrix can be rewritten as 13 θ u σ v t 1 y v σ 1 u t y i 1 n v i u i t σ i y where the matrix u and v are orthonormal u t u i and v t v i ʃ is the diagonal matrix of the singular values of the matrix x assume that there is an additive perturbation δ y it will propagate to a perturbation in the solution 14 δ θ v σ 1 u t δ y i 1 n v i u i t σ i δ y as presented in eq 14 when the singular value σ i is very small or close to the numerical precision of the computation then the perturbation in the y is magnified and potentially dominates the solutions θ i the corresponding columns of u and v contribute negligibly to the matrix a their contribution to the solution can be easily dominated by the noise and round off error in y so the obtained parameters are dominated by the noise as discussed in the preceding section the number of the singular σ i equals the length of the training data the obtained parameters are inevitably dominated by the smaller singular values and are easily affected by the noise in the data and drift from the true values with a large probability in order to diminish such uncertainty and obtain a robust estimation it is necessary to neglect the effect caused by the smaller singular values truncated singular value decomposition can be used to obtain a relatively accurate representation of the matrix a by retaining the first r singular values of a and the corresponding columns of u and v the tsvd can be presented as 15 a r u r σ r v r t where the matrix σ r is obtained by retaining the first r singular values of σ similarly matrices u r and v r are found using the corresponding singular vectors the resulted a r represents the reduced data set where the data related to the omitted singular values are filtered meanwhile as it can be observed the dimensionality of the kernel matrix is reduced by using truncated singular values decomposition the optimal value of r can be estimated using the l curve hansen and o leary 1993 it is a log log plot of the norm of a regularized solution versus the norm of the corresponding residual norm it is a graphical tool for displaying the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data as the r varies golub et al 1999 hansen and johnston 2001 from the l curve plot it is convenient to get the optimal parameters as discussed above there are two parameters regularization factor c and σ need to be predefined in the following phase a global optimization method the quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea is employed to search the optimal values 4 2 quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm a quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea was proposed by replacing the binary coding method in the classical genetic algorithm ga xu et al 2018c with the quantum bit it was inspired by quantum computing where the information is stored in a two state called qubit mermin 2007 qubit is a probability representation of the information state it may be in the 1 state in the 0 state or in any superposition of the two han and kim 2002 the state of a qubit can be represented as 16 ψ α 0 β 1 where α and β are the probability amplitudes of the two states the qubit ψ can be in the 0 state with the α 2 probability and in the 1 state with β 2 probability the α and β satisfy 17 α 2 β 2 1 the polar plot of the qubit is presented in fig 7 for the genetic algorithm the chromosome is represented using a string of binary code typically 0 or 1 they are the coordinate axis in the figure 0 or 1 obvious the chromosomes presented by the qubits have a good population diversity 4 2 1 qubit observation in order to obtain a population composed of classical chromosomes or bit strings the qubit observation needs to be carried out with the qubit observation the qubit will collapse to the 0 state or 1 state with a different probability then the classical population can be obtained after the observation qubit observation is simulated modelling the wave function collapse as follows lahoz beltra et al 2016 18 p α α i 2 x i 0 p α α i 2 x i 1 where p α is a random number between 0 and 1 the aim of the qubit observation is to get a population composed with the classical chromosomes and the fitness evaluation can be carried out using a digital computer 4 2 2 qubit rotation gate qubit rotation gate is used to update the chromosome in the qea rotation operation will force the state of qubit approximate to the state of the optimum chromosome in the populations as presented in fig 8 this rotation gate equals the selection operation in the classical genetic algorithm the qubit rotation gate is given 19 α i t 1 β i t 1 cos δ θ sin δ θ sin δ θ cos δ θ α i t β i t where α i t β i t t and α i t 1 β i t 1 t are the amplitudes of the i qubit before and after the rotation operation respectively the rotation angle is obtained according to table 3 as presented in table 3 and x i is the ith position of the chromosome b i is the ith position of the best chromosome the aims of this table are to define the rotation angle of the rotation gate which makes the probability amplitudes of the qubit evolving toward the qubit of the best individual 4 2 3 qubit mutation gate qubit mutation gate is used to maintain population diversity by changing the direction of individual evolution it will increase the population diversity and avoid converging on a local optimum the gate performs an inter qubit mutation of the ith qubit swapping the amplitudes 20 α i t 1 β i t 1 0 1 1 0 α i t β i t the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is used to measure the goodness of the fitness the r 2 is the ratio of the variability in the data that is not explained by the model to the total variability in the data if r 2 is equal to zero it means that the model fails to explain the measurement variability otherwise if r 2 is equal to 1 it means that all the variability of the measured data can be fully explained by the model so the objective of the qea is to find the optimal parameters of the truncated ls svm with a maximum r 2 value the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is defined as 21 r 2 1 y i y ˆ x θ 2 y i y 2 as discussed in the preceding section the regularization factor c and the kernel width σ are the parameters that need to be optimized the range of c is set as 103 106 while the range of σ is 0 1 the larger the regularization factor is the more accurate the regression model will be however if c is too large the generalization performance of the resulted model will be poor for the kernel width σ a small value of σ will improve the accuracy of regression in this paper it was found that the range was appropriate considering both regression and prediction it should be noted that the training set will be modified if the resulted regression model fails to reproduce the validation set as well as the qea program will restart to search the new optimal values see fig 9 5 manoeuvring modelling in shallow water in this section the manoeuvring simulation in shallow water is discussed using the pmm tests firstly a small portion of pmm test data will be used for the training set and the rest will be kept as the validation set which is completely untouched during the training process the validation set is used to test the generalization performance of the obtained regression model of eq 3 the manoeuvring simulation based on the obtained regression models will be carried out as presented in fig 10 during the training process the input matrix contains the accelerations velocities of the surge sway and yaw motion and the water depth the output matrix is the forces and moment which are the right hand side of eq 3 after the training the obtained regression model can replace the manoeuvring model and carry out the manoeuvring simulations 5 1 training process using optimal truncated ls svm and qea the training process was carried out using the proposed method the optimal truncated ls svm and qea was employed to search the optimal values of the regularization factor c and kernel width σ firstly the initial conditions for qea need to be defined before the optimization the most common technique to initialize the population is to set the value of the amplitudes of all qubits in the chromosomes to a value representing the quantum superposition of all states with equal probability lahoz beltra et al 2016 this is achieved from the product of the hadamard matrix by the vector 0 it is given as 22 α i 0 β i 0 h 0 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 the maximum generations are set as 200 and the numbers of the chromosome are 40 the length of the chromosome in qubit is 20 the mutation probability is set as 0 2 a large scale of populations is not necessary due to the good population diversity and the limited parameters to be optimized the results are given in table 4 before training the proposed nonlinear implicit models the training set needs to be built the training set plays an important role in the training process the basic requirement of the training set is that it should contain rich information to fully activate the ship dynamics here a small portion of the collected data was used for training purpose x t r a n i n g x 1 n e n d n is the constant for the model of surge motion n is 5 the length of the training set is 5100 it includes the pure drift harmonic sway harmonic yaw and mixed yaw and drift for the model of sway and yaw motion n is 30 the length of the training set is 800 and it contains the pure drift harmonic sway harmonic yaw and mixed yaw and drift for the validation all the measured data was used the test set includes the training set and the new data which is completely left untouched during the training process fig 11 presented the results of the trained surge fig 11 a sway fig 11 b and yaw motion fig 11 c the resulted ls svm numerical model has a good agreement with the data in the training set from table 4 the numbers of the singular values which are reserved for approximate the kernel matrix are 2529 274 and 165 they are a small part of all the singular values obviously the dimensional reduction of the kernel matrix is achieved successfully it reduces the computation cost meanwhile the obtained regression models still have a good generalization performance which is validated in the following phase 5 2 validation of the regression models once the regression models are obtained the next most important step is to validate that if the obtained models are good enough to represent the dynamics of manoeuvring the generalization performance of the obtained models is usually needed to check using the validation data which are new data and are not used for training the model the generalization performance is used to indicate how accurately a model is able to predict outcome values for previously unseen data in this paper the validation set includes the whole pmm test data both the training set and the new data which was left completely untouched during the training process figs 12 14 presents the surge sway forces and yaw moment measured in the pmm test with different water depth which is reproduced based on the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring model using the optimal truncated ls svm according to the figure the nonlinear manoeuvring model can reproduce the forces and moments during the pmm test with good accuracy meanwhile the shallow water effect is also included in the regression model in figs 12 14 the above figures represented the pmm test when water depth is 0 3254 m the regression models of the surge sway and yaw can reproduce the forces and moments which agree very well with the test data the same accuracy of the prediction is achieved when the water depth equals to 0 1952m the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is used to measure the fitness given in table 5 from table 5 the regression model obtained using optimal truncated ls svm can be used for the manoeuvring simulation in the shallow water the obtained model has a good generalization performance and can reproduce the pmm model test in different water depth successfully as dicussed above the obtained models can predict the surge sway forces and yaw moments during the pmm tests in the following part the obtained models will be used to precdit the motions of a free runing model test which was not used in the traning process a free running model test was carried out in the towing tank an autopilot was used to control the ship to go straight since the ship model is no longer attahced to the carriage the hull forces and moments can not directly mesured the results of a free running model test is presented in fig 15 the ship travels straigtly and the motions of the ship model were measured such as the speed of surge sway rudder angle heading angle etc a complete manovering model with the obtained nonlinear

n are the forces and moment of surge sway and yaw respectively and the subscripts p and r stand for the propeller and rudder respectively the forces and moments of propeller and rudder were measured during the test fig 16 presents the surge speed sway speed and yaw rate measured in the free running test in shallow water and the corresponding predictions using the manouvering models in eq 23 in order to eliminate the accumulated error in integration the one step prediction was adopted to predict the surge sway speed and yaw rate according to the figure the nonlinear manoeuvring model can reproduce the surge speed sway speed and yaw rate correctly they agree well with the experimental data the r 2 values of the predictions are given in table 6 it shows that the obtained model has a good generalization performance and can reproduce the free running model test in shallow water 6 conclusions an optimal truncated ls svm with a quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea was proposed for manoeuvring modelling of a container in shallow water considering the effect of water depth nonlinear implicit manoeuvring models in 3 dof surge sway and yaw were proposed and trained with pmm model test data such as pure drift pure sway pure yaw the tests were carried out in fhr s towing tank delefortrie et al 2016a b using the dtc ship model in shallow water during the eu project shopera papanikolaou et al 2016 one well known disadvantage is the classical ls svm has a poor generalization performance when dealing with a large scale problem suykens et al 2002 the proposed method optimal truncated ls svm can overcome this disadvantage by employing the singular values decomposition of the kernel matrix and filter out the smaller singular values meanwhile it also lightens the computation cost due to the dimensionality reduction of the kernel matrix the optimal truncated number which plays the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data was estimated using the l curve in order to assure a good generalization performance of the obtained manoeuvring models nonlinear radial basis function was chosen as the kernel function of truncated ls svm and quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea was employed to search the optimal values of the regularization factor and kernel width the generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring models was further tested against the validation set which contains the new data that completely left untouched during the training the r 2 goodness of fit criterion demonstrated that the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring models have a good generalization performance and can be used to model the dynamics of the ship manoeuvring with different shallow water depths the obtained models were used to predict the motions measured in a free running model test in shallow water the proposed method has only examined the manoeuvrability of a container in two shallow water depths however we believe that the proposed method will achieve a good performance due to its robustness and computational efficiency when dealing with the large scale problem the proposed method should be validated with rich manoeuvring tests of different ship type and water depth and can be used for vessel simulators or hardware in the loop test declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts

researchers and marine industry as reported in the european maritime safety agency allianz global corporate and speciality 2012 the collisions and groundings take 71 of accidents in european waters during the period 2011 2016 teixeira and guedes soares 2018 reported that general cargo ships account for 43 of all marine casualties reported followed by passenger ships 24 one of the most significant reasons is that the size of cargo ship grows large which causes the ship s manoeuvrability to decrease especially in shallow water and confined waters as described by vantorre et al 2017 manoeuvrability in shallow water is critically important as ships have to access harbours in shallow and confined waters where the traffic is more complex this put forward higher requirement about ship s manoeuvrability tello ruiz et al 2015 lataire et al 2012 maimun et al 2011 vantorre et al 2017 yoshimura 1986 zhou et al 2016 the study on ship manoeuvrability in shallow water benefits ship pilots and designers who are more interested in the response characteristics to commanded changes of the direction of ship motions the development of numerical computation makes it possible to simulate the ship response travelling in a confined waterway du et al 2017 and shallow water kaidi et al 2018 using the ship manoeuvring mathematical models the models can also be incorporated in vessel simulators varela and guedes soares 2015a 2015b which can be used to train ship pilots and hardware in the loop test for ship controller sørensen 2011 a mathematical model is widely used to describe the dynamics of ships in deep water as well as shallow water maimun et al 2011 many mathematical models have been proposed to meet different applications considering the trade off between the complexity and fidelity such as abkowitz 1980 mmg model yoshimura 2005 nomoto model nomoto et al 1956 vectorial model fossen 2011 a generic nonlinear manoeuvring model sutulo and guedes soares 2015 a more comprehensive review of ship manoeuvring models can be found in sutulo and guedes soares 2011 vantorre et al 2017 discussed ship manoeuvrability in shallow water and confined waterway a mathematical manoeuvring model with finite water depth was proposed by norrbin 1971 wing theory was used to calculate the derivatives of ship manoeuvring in shallow water inoue and murayama 1969 vantorre 2001 evaluated a semi empirical formula for manoeuvring in shallow water eloot et al 2015 reported on efforts of validation of shallow water manoeuvring simulation through free running tests it is noteworthy that the benchmark data for manoeuvring in shallow water of dtc ship model is now available at mashcon for the validation and verification van zwijnsvoorde et al 2019 the most convenient way of modelling the shallow water effect is to approximate the hydrodynamic forces and moments by means of manoeuvring coefficients accounting for water depth dependence factors system identification is one of the mature techniques for estimating the coefficients with the measured data ljung 1999 as described by sutulo and guedes soares 2006 captive model tests are a reliable and effective method to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments from which hydrodynamic coefficients in manoeuvring model can be identified ross et al 2015 estimated the hydrodynamic coefficients of a nonlinear manoeuvring model based on planar motion mechanism pmm tests using the nonlinear least square method the obtained manoeuvring model was then validated in full scale hassani et al 2015 sutulo and guedes soares 2014 developed an optimal offline system identification method combined the least square with genetic algorithm for the parameters estimation of a nonlinear manoeuvring mathematical model a similar approach can also be found in xu et al 2018b where a loss function considering both the bias and variance of the errors between the reference outputs and the mathematical model outputs was proposed for the estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients based on free running manoeuvring tests an online least square support vector machine was applied to modelling the nonlinear ship steering motion in real time in xu et al 2019b perera et al 2015 2016 applied the extended kalman filter to estimate the dynamic parameters of a modified nomoto model for vessel steering however a number of problems have arisen in the course of parameter estimation such as overfitting and parameter uncertainty or so called parameter drift hwang 1980 luo et al 2016 luo and zou 2009 in order to get a high fidelity manoeuvring model the structure of the proposed model is usually very complex and redundant this kind of models will result in overfitting sutulo and guedes soares 2011 and the obtained parameters are dominated by the noise and drift from the true values xu et al 2018a several methods have been proposed to diminish the parameter drift for ship manoeuvring models such as model simplification parallel processing and additional excitation hwang 1980 luo and li 2017 it needs to be pointed out that the main purpose of these methods is to reconstruct the samples and lighten the multicollinearity of the variabilities in the input matrix xu et al 2018a 2019a analysed the parameter uncertainty by using singular value decomposition and a robust parameter estimation was achieved computational fluid dynamics cfd is a very useful tool for the study on manoeuvring in confined waterway it was recommended in the report by the manoeuvring committee of the 24th international towing tank conference ittc 2005 cfd has also been used to study the ship manoeuvring in shallow water jin et al 2016 wang et al 2009 bank effect xu et al 2017 ship ship interaction zhou et al 2016 numerical pmm test islam and guedes soares 2018 just to name a few but the verification and validation of this method still have some way to go to avoid the burden of parameter estimation the implicit model has been used for modelling of dynamical systems it is also well known as the black box model in which no physical knowledge of the dynamic system is required and inputs and outputs must be measured it can be treated as a response function which represents the input output mapping characteristic of the dynamic system artificial neural networks anns is one of the most widely used technology for the black box model anns have been applied to the research on ship manoeuvring simulations luo et al 2014 moreira and guedes soares 2003a 2012 applied recursive neural networks for ship manoeuvring motion simulations and the results compared well with manoeuvring trials moreira and guedes soares 2003b hess et al 2006 carried out ship manoeuvring simulation in wind and waves using recursive neural networks recently a kernel based machine learning method support vector machine svm has been used for system identification suykens et al 2002 vapnik 1998 1995 it has a better generalization performance compared with anns because the optimization problem of solving svms is defined by considering the trade off between the empirical errors and the complexity of the model svm has been used to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients for marine vessels luo and zou 2009 firstly applied the least square support vector machine ls svm to estimate the hydrodynamic coefficients of an abkowitz model further work on this topic can be found in luo et al 2016 in which particle swarm optimization was employed to choose the regularization factor xu and guedes soares 2016a used the ls svm to identify a nonlinear steering model for ship autopilot design further studies can be found in xu et al 2017 xu and guedes soares 2016b zhu et al 2017 employed the ls svm combined with artificial bee colony algorithm to estimate a dynamic model of a large container ship manoeuvring simulations of catamaran using implicit models were carried out based on svm by luo et al 2014 the main contribution of this paper is to propose an optimal truncated least square support vector machine ls svm and then use it to substitute the manoeuvring models in shallow water of the dtc ship model a series of pmm tests such as pure drift pure sway pure yaw and mixed yaw and drift were carried out by flanders hydraulics research fhr in their towing tank using the dtc ship model moctar et al 2012 the nonlinear regression models in 3 dof surge sway and yaw are constructed by using the proposed method optimal truncated ls svm it is different from the method of wei et al 2006 or zheng et al 2014 where singular value decomposition svd was employed for signal pre processing and the filtered data was then used for training the classical ls svm here the optimal truncated ls svm is implemented by calculating the singular value decomposition svd of the kernel matrix and neglecting the small singular values as well as the corresponded matrix due to their negligible contribution to the solutions the dimensionality reduction of the kernel matrix is achieved which reduce the computation cost the optimal truncated number of singular values is estimated using l curve which plays the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data the radial basis function kernel is chosen and the quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea is employed to search the optimal values of the regularization factor and kernel width with the optimal parameters the truncated ls svm is used to train the nonlinear regression models for ship manoeuvring the performance of the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring models is further tested against the validation set which is completely left untouched during the training process the paper is organized as follows section 2 describes a nonlinear manoeuvring model for marine surface vessel in shallow water in section 3 planar motion mechanism pmm test in shallow water was carried out using dtc ship model the optimal truncated nonlinear kernel based least square support vector machine is proposed and the quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm was introduced in section 4 in section 5 manoeuvring modelling in shallow water was carried out using the proposed method the generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring models was further tested against the validation set the final section is the conclusion 2 mathematical manoeuvring model of the marine surface vessel the manoeuvring motions of a marine surface vessel are usually described in 3 degrees of freedom dofs surge sway and yaw as illustrated in fig 1 because the manoeuvring motions typically occur with a much lower frequency than the wave encounter frequencies faltinsen 2006 it is reasonable to assume that the frequency dependent added mass and potential damping are approximated by constant values and neglect the fluid memory effects which are typically considered for the seakeeping motions fossen 2011 assume a ship moving in a horizontal plane as presented in fig 2 two different coordinate systems north east down ned and body fixed frame are defined the ned is a local horizontal coordinate plane the body frame is a moving coordinate frame that is fixed to the craft the manoeuvring mathematical model is usually defined in the body fixed frame the dynamic equation 1 are organized in such a way that acceleration derivative force coefficients are presented on the left hand side as added masses μ 11 μ 22 μ 26 and μ 66 quasi steady x q y q n q forces and moments and propeller thrust x p are placed on the right hand side 1 m μ 11 u m v r m x g r 2 x q x p m μ 22 v m x g μ 26 r m u r y q m x g μ 26 v i z z μ 66 r m x g u r n q where m is the mass of the ship and i z z is the moment of inertia x g is the longitudinal position of the centre of gravity u v r are the state variables surge sway velocities and yaw rate respectively the upper dot signs on the top of those variables refer to their related accelerations the most common method of describing the hydrodynamic forces is to apply regression models sutulo and guedes soares 2011 the first consequent formulations of a global manoeuvring model using multivariate algebraic polynomials were proposed by abkowitz 1980 also well known as abkowitz manoeuvring model the hydrodynamic forces and moments are approximated using 3 order truncated taylor expansion techniques this model has a good generalization performance as well as its modified versions hwang 1980 xu et al 2018a but the disadvantage is that the model is complex and redundancy many hydrodynamic coefficients have no physical meaning in order to simplify the structure of the model a quasi polynomial model was used and it is slightly more computational economical and with a good generalization performance a typical nondimensionalized manoeuvring model in quasi polynomial is given 2 x q v r x 0 x v v v v x v r v r x r r r r y q v r y 0 y v v y r r y v v v v v y v r v r n q v r n 0 n v v n r r n r v r v n v r v r n r r r r as discussed in mucha 2017 ship motions in shallow water involve hydrodynamic interactions with vertical flow restrictions affecting the dynamic floating position of ships underway and hydrodynamic properties relating to inertia lift and cross flow forces mucha 2017 the intrinsic way of modelling the shallow water effect is to approximate the hydrodynamic forces and moments by means of manoeuvring coefficients accounting for water depth dependence factors considering the effect of shallow water a novel model structure with explicit h terms involved in the functions is proposed 3 m μ 11 u m v r m x g r 2 f 1 u v r u v r h t m μ 22 v m x g μ 26 r m u r f 2 u v r u v r h t m x g μ 26 v i z z μ 66 r m x g u r f 3 u v r u v r h t where f i u v r u v r h t i 1 3 is an unknown nonlinear multivariate function in which the water depth is one variable they are used to approximate the surge sway forces and yaw moment with the nonlinear multivariate functions the manoeuvring model can be used to simulate ship manoeuvring in varying water depth 3 planar motion mechanism pmm tests in shallow water the planar motion mechanism pmm tests using a ship model is introduced in this section the tests were performed by flanders hydraulics research fhr in the framework of the shopera project delefortrie and vantorre 2007 papanikolaou et al 2016 in total 102 pmm tests pure drift pure sway and pure yaw have been performed with different water depths velocities amplitudes and sample period see table 1 a scaled ship model of a modern container carrier was used during the test and it is well known as the dtc ship model eloot et al 2016 moctar et al 2012 the main particulars are given in table 2 captive model tests are nowadays commonly used for modelling the ship motions delefortrie et al 2016a b vantorre and eloot 1998 it can provide rich information for system identification method and get a reasonable estimation of the hydrodynamic coefficients however it is costly to perform such tests here a brief summary of different pmm tests is presented such as pure drift pure sway pure yaw and mixed sway and yaw which were performed at flanders hydraulics research fhr as presented in fig 3 the towing tank at fhr has a total length 87 5 m a width of 7 m and a maximum water depth of 0 5 m eloot et al 2016 more detail information can be found in van kerkhove et al 2009 and delefortrie et al 2016 the ship and tank fixed coordinate system is presented in fig 4 the ship mode was towed forward at a constant speed with a fixed drift angle β in pure drift as presented in fig 5 a so the surge and sway velocity are a non zero constant while the yaw rate is zero u u cos β v u sin β r 0 pure sway tests can be used to isolate the sway dynamics from the yaw motion the hydrodynamic coefficients related to the yaw motion can be neglected due to the zero yaw rate during the test the ship will move forward with a constant velocity and with a sinusoidal oscillation in sway where u u c v v max cos ω t and ψ 0 as presented in fig 5 b during the pure yaw test the ship moves forward with a constant velocity and with a sinusoidal oscillation in sway motion where u u c v 0 and ψ ψ max cos ω t as presented in fig 5 c in order to study the coupled dynamic of yaw and sway motion a combined test pure yaw and drift was carried out using a ship model with a sinusoidal oscillation in sway motion as well as a sinusoidal oscillation of yaw motion around a constant drift angle the pathline is presented in fig 5 d this test can provide the dynamic information of surge sway and yaw motion so it can be used to estimate the coupled coefficients which corresponded to the surge sway and yaw motion during the test the ground speed and drift angle are kept as constant and the yaw rate is set as a sinusoidal oscillation u u c β β c and ψ ψ max cos ω t 4 optimal truncated nonlinear kernel based least square support vector machine in this section an optimal truncated nonlinear kernel based least square support vector machine ls svm is proposed for the approximation of the regression model of ship manoeuvring the optimal truncated ls svm is a robust method for regression it trains the model by employing the singular values decomposition of the kernel matrix and filter out the smaller singular values meanwhile it can reduce the computation cost due to the dimensionality reduction of the kernel matrix 4 1 optimal truncated ls svm given the training set s s i s i x i y i x i ℜ n y i ℜ i 1 n where x i is the input and y i is the output as presented by suykens et al 2002 the general approximation function of svm is given 4 y x w t ϕ x b where x is the input y x are the target values b is the bias term w is a weight matrix ϕ x is mapping function that map the training data x i to a higher dimensional feature space suykens et al 2002 for function estimation the following optimization problem can be formulated in the primal weight space 5 min w b e i j w e 1 2 w t w 1 2 c i 1 n e i 2 s t y i w t ϕ x i b e i i 1 n where e i i 1 n is the error and c is the regularization factor it balances the well known structural risk which is the trade off between the model accuracy and the model complexity suykens et al 2002 constructing the lagrange function and gives as 6 l w b e i α i 1 2 w t w 1 2 c i 1 n e i 2 i 1 n α i w t ϕ x i b e i y i where α i are the lagrange multipliers according to the karush kuhn tucker conditions kkt suykens et al 2002 the conditions for the optimality are given 7 l w 0 w i 1 n α i ϕ x i l b 0 i 1 n α i 0 l e i 0 α i c e i i 1 n l α i 0 w t ϕ x i b e i y i 0 i 1 n after the elimination of the variable w and e i one gets the following solution 8 0 1 1 k x k x i c 1 i b α 0 y where i is an n n identity matrix α α 1 α n t y y 1 y n t the kernel function is applied here as follows 9 k x k x i φ x k t φ x i i 1 n the resulted ls svm model for the regression is given 10 y x i 1 n α i k x x i b as can be observed the kernel function plays an important role in the function estimation it represents an inner product between its operands it is positive definite and satisfies the mercer condition suykens and vandewalle 1999 vapnik 1995 what is more interesting is that k x x i is usually inexpensive to calculate even though φ x itself may be very expensive to calculate considering the performance of the nonlinear approximation a nonlinear kernel the radial basis function kernel rbf is chosen in this paper the rbf kernel is given 11 k x x i exp x x i 2 2 σ 2 where σ is the free parameter x x i 2 can be recognized as the squared euclidean distance between the two feature vectors rbf kernel measures the similarity between vectors it is close to 1 when the vectors are close and near 0 when the vectors are far apart the principle of kernel based svm can be illustrated in fig 6 as presented in eq 9 the dimension of the kernel matrix k x k x i is n n it is proportional to the length of the training set so if there are large amounts of data in the training set the classical ls svm fails to inverse the matrix due to the heavy computation as suggested by suykens et al 2002 the maximum length of the training set is 2000 but a limited training set will result in a local optimum so it is necessary to improve the robustness of the classical ls svm when the training set is large the obtained parameter matrix is usually dominated by the noise and drift from the true values the corresponded numerical model fits well with the training data and fails to reproduce the training set this is also well known as overfitting in the following phase an optimal truncated ls svm is proposed to solve the problem firstly using the singular value decomposition the kernel matrix can be rewritten as 12 a i 1 n u i σ i v i t u σ v t then the parameter matrix can be rewritten as 13 θ u σ v t 1 y v σ 1 u t y i 1 n v i u i t σ i y where the matrix u and v are orthonormal u t u i and v t v i ʃ is the diagonal matrix of the singular values of the matrix x assume that there is an additive perturbation δ y it will propagate to a perturbation in the solution 14 δ θ v σ 1 u t δ y i 1 n v i u i t σ i δ y as presented in eq 14 when the singular value σ i is very small or close to the numerical precision of the computation then the perturbation in the y is magnified and potentially dominates the solutions θ i the corresponding columns of u and v contribute negligibly to the matrix a their contribution to the solution can be easily dominated by the noise and round off error in y so the obtained parameters are dominated by the noise as discussed in the preceding section the number of the singular σ i equals the length of the training data the obtained parameters are inevitably dominated by the smaller singular values and are easily affected by the noise in the data and drift from the true values with a large probability in order to diminish such uncertainty and obtain a robust estimation it is necessary to neglect the effect caused by the smaller singular values truncated singular value decomposition can be used to obtain a relatively accurate representation of the matrix a by retaining the first r singular values of a and the corresponding columns of u and v the tsvd can be presented as 15 a r u r σ r v r t where the matrix σ r is obtained by retaining the first r singular values of σ similarly matrices u r and v r are found using the corresponding singular vectors the resulted a r represents the reduced data set where the data related to the omitted singular values are filtered meanwhile as it can be observed the dimensionality of the kernel matrix is reduced by using truncated singular values decomposition the optimal value of r can be estimated using the l curve hansen and o leary 1993 it is a log log plot of the norm of a regularized solution versus the norm of the corresponding residual norm it is a graphical tool for displaying the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data as the r varies golub et al 1999 hansen and johnston 2001 from the l curve plot it is convenient to get the optimal parameters as discussed above there are two parameters regularization factor c and σ need to be predefined in the following phase a global optimization method the quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea is employed to search the optimal values 4 2 quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm a quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea was proposed by replacing the binary coding method in the classical genetic algorithm ga xu et al 2018c with the quantum bit it was inspired by quantum computing where the information is stored in a two state called qubit mermin 2007 qubit is a probability representation of the information state it may be in the 1 state in the 0 state or in any superposition of the two han and kim 2002 the state of a qubit can be represented as 16 ψ α 0 β 1 where α and β are the probability amplitudes of the two states the qubit ψ can be in the 0 state with the α 2 probability and in the 1 state with β 2 probability the α and β satisfy 17 α 2 β 2 1 the polar plot of the qubit is presented in fig 7 for the genetic algorithm the chromosome is represented using a string of binary code typically 0 or 1 they are the coordinate axis in the figure 0 or 1 obvious the chromosomes presented by the qubits have a good population diversity 4 2 1 qubit observation in order to obtain a population composed of classical chromosomes or bit strings the qubit observation needs to be carried out with the qubit observation the qubit will collapse to the 0 state or 1 state with a different probability then the classical population can be obtained after the observation qubit observation is simulated modelling the wave function collapse as follows lahoz beltra et al 2016 18 p α α i 2 x i 0 p α α i 2 x i 1 where p α is a random number between 0 and 1 the aim of the qubit observation is to get a population composed with the classical chromosomes and the fitness evaluation can be carried out using a digital computer 4 2 2 qubit rotation gate qubit rotation gate is used to update the chromosome in the qea rotation operation will force the state of qubit approximate to the state of the optimum chromosome in the populations as presented in fig 8 this rotation gate equals the selection operation in the classical genetic algorithm the qubit rotation gate is given 19 α i t 1 β i t 1 cos δ θ sin δ θ sin δ θ cos δ θ α i t β i t where α i t β i t t and α i t 1 β i t 1 t are the amplitudes of the i qubit before and after the rotation operation respectively the rotation angle is obtained according to table 3 as presented in table 3 and x i is the ith position of the chromosome b i is the ith position of the best chromosome the aims of this table are to define the rotation angle of the rotation gate which makes the probability amplitudes of the qubit evolving toward the qubit of the best individual 4 2 3 qubit mutation gate qubit mutation gate is used to maintain population diversity by changing the direction of individual evolution it will increase the population diversity and avoid converging on a local optimum the gate performs an inter qubit mutation of the ith qubit swapping the amplitudes 20 α i t 1 β i t 1 0 1 1 0 α i t β i t the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is used to measure the goodness of the fitness the r 2 is the ratio of the variability in the data that is not explained by the model to the total variability in the data if r 2 is equal to zero it means that the model fails to explain the measurement variability otherwise if r 2 is equal to 1 it means that all the variability of the measured data can be fully explained by the model so the objective of the qea is to find the optimal parameters of the truncated ls svm with a maximum r 2 value the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is defined as 21 r 2 1 y i y ˆ x θ 2 y i y 2 as discussed in the preceding section the regularization factor c and the kernel width σ are the parameters that need to be optimized the range of c is set as 103 106 while the range of σ is 0 1 the larger the regularization factor is the more accurate the regression model will be however if c is too large the generalization performance of the resulted model will be poor for the kernel width σ a small value of σ will improve the accuracy of regression in this paper it was found that the range was appropriate considering both regression and prediction it should be noted that the training set will be modified if the resulted regression model fails to reproduce the validation set as well as the qea program will restart to search the new optimal values see fig 9 5 manoeuvring modelling in shallow water in this section the manoeuvring simulation in shallow water is discussed using the pmm tests firstly a small portion of pmm test data will be used for the training set and the rest will be kept as the validation set which is completely untouched during the training process the validation set is used to test the generalization performance of the obtained regression model of eq 3 the manoeuvring simulation based on the obtained regression models will be carried out as presented in fig 10 during the training process the input matrix contains the accelerations velocities of the surge sway and yaw motion and the water depth the output matrix is the forces and moment which are the right hand side of eq 3 after the training the obtained regression model can replace the manoeuvring model and carry out the manoeuvring simulations 5 1 training process using optimal truncated ls svm and qea the training process was carried out using the proposed method the optimal truncated ls svm and qea was employed to search the optimal values of the regularization factor c and kernel width σ firstly the initial conditions for qea need to be defined before the optimization the most common technique to initialize the population is to set the value of the amplitudes of all qubits in the chromosomes to a value representing the quantum superposition of all states with equal probability lahoz beltra et al 2016 this is achieved from the product of the hadamard matrix by the vector 0 it is given as 22 α i 0 β i 0 h 0 1 2 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 2 1 1 the maximum generations are set as 200 and the numbers of the chromosome are 40 the length of the chromosome in qubit is 20 the mutation probability is set as 0 2 a large scale of populations is not necessary due to the good population diversity and the limited parameters to be optimized the results are given in table 4 before training the proposed nonlinear implicit models the training set needs to be built the training set plays an important role in the training process the basic requirement of the training set is that it should contain rich information to fully activate the ship dynamics here a small portion of the collected data was used for training purpose x t r a n i n g x 1 n e n d n is the constant for the model of surge motion n is 5 the length of the training set is 5100 it includes the pure drift harmonic sway harmonic yaw and mixed yaw and drift for the model of sway and yaw motion n is 30 the length of the training set is 800 and it contains the pure drift harmonic sway harmonic yaw and mixed yaw and drift for the validation all the measured data was used the test set includes the training set and the new data which is completely left untouched during the training process fig 11 presented the results of the trained surge fig 11 a sway fig 11 b and yaw motion fig 11 c the resulted ls svm numerical model has a good agreement with the data in the training set from table 4 the numbers of the singular values which are reserved for approximate the kernel matrix are 2529 274 and 165 they are a small part of all the singular values obviously the dimensional reduction of the kernel matrix is achieved successfully it reduces the computation cost meanwhile the obtained regression models still have a good generalization performance which is validated in the following phase 5 2 validation of the regression models once the regression models are obtained the next most important step is to validate that if the obtained models are good enough to represent the dynamics of manoeuvring the generalization performance of the obtained models is usually needed to check using the validation data which are new data and are not used for training the model the generalization performance is used to indicate how accurately a model is able to predict outcome values for previously unseen data in this paper the validation set includes the whole pmm test data both the training set and the new data which was left completely untouched during the training process figs 12 14 presents the surge sway forces and yaw moment measured in the pmm test with different water depth which is reproduced based on the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring model using the optimal truncated ls svm according to the figure the nonlinear manoeuvring model can reproduce the forces and moments during the pmm test with good accuracy meanwhile the shallow water effect is also included in the regression model in figs 12 14 the above figures represented the pmm test when water depth is 0 3254 m the regression models of the surge sway and yaw can reproduce the forces and moments which agree very well with the test data the same accuracy of the prediction is achieved when the water depth equals to 0 1952m the r 2 goodness of fit criterion is used to measure the fitness given in table 5 from table 5 the regression model obtained using optimal truncated ls svm can be used for the manoeuvring simulation in the shallow water the obtained model has a good generalization performance and can reproduce the pmm model test in different water depth successfully as dicussed above the obtained models can predict the surge sway forces and yaw moments during the pmm tests in the following part the obtained models will be used to precdit the motions of a free runing model test which was not used in the traning process a free running model test was carried out in the towing tank an autopilot was used to control the ship to go straight since the ship model is no longer attahced to the carriage the hull forces and moments can not directly mesured the results of a free running model test is presented in fig 15 the ship travels straigtly and the motions of the ship model were measured such as the speed of surge sway rudder angle heading angle etc a complete manovering model with the obtained nonlinear functions is given as 23 m μ 11 u m v r m x g r 2 f 1 u v r u v r h t x p x r m μ 22 v m x g μ 26 r m u r f 2 u v r u v r h t y r m x g μ 26 v i z z μ 66 r m x g u r f 3 u v r u v r h t n r where x y n are the forces and moment of surge sway and yaw respectively and the subscripts p and r stand for the propeller and rudder respectively the forces and moments of propeller and rudder were measured during the test fig 16 presents the surge speed sway speed and yaw rate measured in the free running test in shallow water and the corresponding predictions using the manouvering models in eq 23 in order to eliminate the accumulated error in integration the one step prediction was adopted to predict the surge sway speed and yaw rate according to the figure the nonlinear manoeuvring model can reproduce the surge speed sway speed and yaw rate correctly they agree well with the experimental data the r 2 values of the predictions are given in table 6 it shows that the obtained model has a good generalization performance and can reproduce the free running model test in shallow water 6 conclusions an optimal truncated ls svm with a quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea was proposed for manoeuvring modelling of a container in shallow water considering the effect of water depth nonlinear implicit manoeuvring models in 3 dof surge sway and yaw were proposed and trained with pmm model test data such as pure drift pure sway pure yaw the tests were carried out in fhr s towing tank delefortrie et al 2016a b using the dtc ship model in shallow water during the eu project shopera papanikolaou et al 2016 one well known disadvantage is the classical ls svm has a poor generalization performance when dealing with a large scale problem suykens et al 2002 the proposed method optimal truncated ls svm can overcome this disadvantage by employing the singular values decomposition of the kernel matrix and filter out the smaller singular values meanwhile it also lightens the computation cost due to the dimensionality reduction of the kernel matrix the optimal truncated number which plays the trade off between the size of a regularized solution and its fit to the given data was estimated using the l curve in order to assure a good generalization performance of the obtained manoeuvring models nonlinear radial basis function was chosen as the kernel function of truncated ls svm and quantum inspired evolutionary algorithm qea was employed to search the optimal values of the regularization factor and kernel width the generalization performance of the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring models was further tested against the validation set which contains the new data that completely left untouched during the training the r 2 goodness of fit criterion demonstrated that the obtained nonlinear manoeuvring models have a good generalization performance and can be used to model the dynamics of the ship manoeuvring with different shallow water depths the obtained models were used to predict the motions measured in a free running model test in shallow water the proposed method has only examined the manoeuvrability of a container in two shallow water depths however we believe that the proposed method will achieve a good performance due to its robustness and computational efficiency when dealing with the large scale problem the proposed method should be validated with rich manoeuvring tests of different ship type and water depth and can be used for vessel simulators or hardware in the loop test declaration of competing interest there are no conflicts

22251,mooring chains in many offshore floating facilities have failed due to overloading under extreme environmental events the ductile failure in chains due to overloading has not been addressed in past studies therefore the present study aims to analyze the ductile failure in chain links using micromechanics and phenomenology based numerical models the material damage model parameters are established using material stress strain plots obtained from tensile tests on coupons extracted from a r3 grade steel chain link the validation of material degradation models is achieved by comparing results from numerical studies and monotonic loading tests on mooring chain links of 76 mm nominal diameter the material models successfully capture the failure mode and strength of the chain links

introduction offshore floating structures employed for drilling or production and storage generally use mooring systems as station keeping equipment the mooring chains being an essential part of those mooring systems provide restoring force to the floating platforms and restrict the vessel motion within desired excursion limits so that risers umbilical and subsea equipment are protected from damage the mooring chains function in extremely harsh environments and undergo extreme loading conditions during their service life tension tension fatigue out of plane bending opb fatigue excessive wear in contact regions overloading due to storms etc d souza and majhi 2013 ma et al 2013 have been the major causes of failure in mooring chains the minor and major chain failures from year the 2001 2011 point out that the mooring chain failure probabilities are much higher than the intended design failure probabilities ma et al 2013 maslin 2013 smedly and petruska 2014 table 1 compares the failure probabilities observed for both the single line and multiple line failures with the target failure probabilities specified in the dnv s offshore standard on position mooring dnv os e301 2001 the strict quality requirements at the time of installation better understanding of degradation mechanisms reliable periodic inspections and regular condition assessment can help reduce failures and ensure safe working condition through early detection and replacement of degraded links brown et al 2005 2010 allan et al 2013 gordon et al 2014 although the periodic and after storm inspections are mandatory to ascertain the health of mooring systems for safety and early detection of faults angulo et al 2017 the identification of degraded chain link and condition or residual strength assessment is still an issue the overall study is divided into two parts 1 identification of degraded link through inspection and 2 condition assessment of identified link the present paper mainly summarizes the second part which aims at residual strength assessment of chain link by utilizing suitable material damage models the current study utilizes the fact that there are many material failure models available and a great amount of work has been done in the development of these models consequently the strength estimation of the chain link is possible by employing suitable material damage models in numerical simulations however identifying their reliability and applicability in mooring chain strength estimation is vital and needs further investigation therefore the present study explores suitable material damage models either micromechanical or phenomenological for modeling the ductile failure in chain links micromechanics based process of ductile failure in porous metals is divided into 3 stages of void a nucleation b growth and c coalescence the micromechanics based model adopted in the study is based on the pioneer works of mcclintock 1968 and rice and tracey 1969 which modeled the growth of an isolated cavity in a continuum gurson tvergaard and needleman gtn later extended the isolated cavity model by modeling the interaction between cavities in porous metals in a series of articles gurson 1975 1977 tvergaard 1981 1982 1989 tvergaard and needleman 1984 gtn model has been successfully used by previous researchers in various application such as modeling of failure in the circular hollow sections qian et al 2005 modeling of marine structural steel choung 2009a modeling of punch tests choung 2009b and plate impact simulation choung et al 2010 the alternative to the micromechanics based model is phenomenological model or macroscale model at macro levels the three stages of material deterioration void nucleation growth and coalescence are termed as softening softening is further defined as the progressive degradation of material stiffness and is accompanied by complete loss of load carrying capacity continuum damage mechanics cdm is a phenomenological yet rational approach to model the process of material degradation or softening cdm utilizes a single internal damage variable to define failure the idea first proposed by kachanov 1958 and further developed and justified by utilizing thermodynamics of irreversible processes by lemaitre 1985 cdm has been used in various applications in the marine industry such as simulation of marine structural steel behavior choung 2009a ship collisions martinez et al 2017 and structural damages in shell structures kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 the other phenomenological model employed is the shear failure sf model which models damage in terms of accumulated plastic strain the failure in the sf model occurs when equivalent plastic strain value exceeds a predefined value sf model is the simplest model among the three models gtn cdm and sf and employs only a single variable equivalent plastic strain at failure the content of the present study is broadly categorized into experimental and numerical studies the experimental study includes tensile tests on coupon specimens to ascertain the material properties and monotonic loading tests on the 5 link chains benchmarking simulations are conducted on coupon finite element fe model to establish material parameters for gtn cdm and sf models later material damage models are validated using non linear fe analysis and experimental study on chain links 2 experimental work the present section describes material tests on coupon specimens and monotonic loading tests on chain specimens the section also discusses the details of specimen geometry test setup boundary conditions loading details instrumentation and data acquisition 2 1 material tests a series of tensile tests are conducted on coupon specimens fabricated as per astm international 2009 to obtain material properties of r3 grade steel chain links the tensile coupon specimens two each are extracted from different locations a straight leg specimen sl 1 and sl 2 b welded straight leg specimen wsl 1 and wsl 2 and c bend region specimen br 1 and br 2 of the chain link fig 1 a and 1 b shows the locations of specimen extraction and dimensions of the coupon specimens fig 2 a and 2 b displays the test setup for tensile tests and measured stress strain data for sl 1 sl 2 wsl 1 wsl 2 br 1 and br 2 the complete set of yield strength ultimate strength and elongation data for all the specimens along with standard material properties of r3 grade steel are provided in table 2 the yield and ultimate strengths are observed to be approximately similar for all the coupon specimens the elongations for sl 1 sl 2 br 1 and br 2 are in the range of 15 9 18 5 which is close to the code specified elongation for r3 grade steels refer to table 2 specimen wsl 1 showed the lowest ductility due to the failure of flash butt weld in the reduced cross section region of the coupon offshore standard dnv os e302 2013 provides minimum mechanical properties for different steel grades and places relatively lower elongation requirements for higher yield strength steels since yield strength of chain material in the current study is even higher than r3s grade steel the study utilizes lower elongation as shown in the case of wsl 2 2 2 mooring chain failure tests the full scale static strength tests are conducted on 76 mm nominal diameter stud chains of r3 grade steel with minimum breaking load mbl of 4884 kn bs iso 1704 2008 table 3 summarizes the measurements of mooring chain specimens used in strength tests the dimensions of the chain links are as per the standard recommendations in bs iso 1704 2008 fig 3 a and 3 b shows the image and schematic diagram of the test setup with instrumentation and nomenclature details the load is applied using a hydraulic actuator of 10 000 kn capacity with a stroke length of 250 mm the loading actuator is connected to top link link 1 or l1 of chain with the help of a tension stud a green pin shackle and a pear link in order in between the bottom link link 5 or l5 is connected to the base deck with the help of a 110 mm diameter profiled pin the loading is applied by providing displacement to the top link l1 whereas any displacement at the bottom link l5 is restrained the specified minimum breaking load mbl of chain links used in the experimental study is much lower than the strength of the attachments as summarized in table 4 the test setup utilizes laser and mechanical transducers to measure the chain link displacements at mid height of each link as shown in the inset in fig 3 b the two laser transducers of range 600 mm and 400 mm are placed at mid height of l1 and l2 respectively additionally the three lvdts of 300 mm 100 mm and 50 mm measure displacements at the mid height of l3 l4 and l5 respectively the inter link displacements ild or displacement between links dbl δ is calculated by measuring the difference in displacements at mid height of subsequent chain links the 50 mm lvdt placed at mid height of bottom link l5 showed slight movement at higher loads 4000 4500 kn due displacement at the base deck therefore the displacement recorded at l5 is subtracted from displacement observed l1 to get elongation within the chain specimen the two chain specimens tested are named ct1 and ct2 chain test 1 and chain test 2 both the tests employ displacement controlled loading with the rate varying gradually from 0 05 mm min in the elastic stage to 1 mm min after the onset of yielding fig 4 a shows the global load p vs global displacement δ measured at the mid height of top link l1 the global displacement at l1 is corrected for base deck displacements by subtracting the displacement at the bottom link fig 4 b shows the normalized load vs normalized interlink displacements for ct1 and ct2 table 5 shows the normalizing load yield load for a single leg of chain link and normalizing displacement nominal diameter the top and bottom limits capture the scatter in the stiffness and displacements at each inter link contact as illustrated in fig 4 b and 4 c for both the tests ct1 and ct2 the inter link displacement ild between l2 and l3 is maximum and is around 35 mm ct1dbl2 3 and 40 mm ct2dbl2 3 respectively the ultimate strength tests on ct1 and ct2 show similar load vs global displacement and load vs inter link displacement behavior with approximate yield load of 3500 kn in both the tests the deformation in the chain links was not very obvious till around 4000 4100 kn which increases rapidly after around 4300 kn the inter link contact region between l2 and l3 shows maximum deformation and ultimate failure is observed in l3 in both the tests fig 5 a and 5 b show the un deformed and deformed just before failure state of l3 in ct2 and fig 5 c shows the superimposed image of both the un deformed and deformed l3 from fig 5 c it is evident that most of the inelastic activity occurs in contact regions and deformation at both the interlink contact regions may not be the same 3 calibration of the material model modeling of ductile failure in chains requires suitable material definition the present section explores and calibrates different material damage models which can be employed in conjunction with elastic plastic material definitions to model ductile failure in chain links the elastic plastic material definitions model material behavior in the elastic a b and plastic b c regions up to the onset of softening or damage initiation at c as illustrated in fig 6 a the material softening c d and ultimate failure at d is modeled using material degradation and failure models however these material damage models require calibration or establishing material parameters for a specific material the calibration of these material models utilizes stress strain results from the material tests and finite element fe simulations on the coupon model fig 6 b shows the 1 4th coupon model for the fe studies boundary conditions include symmetry boundary conditions along the two planes and fixed boundary condition at one end of the coupon model the model employs c3d8 eight node brick element with reduced integration 3 1 elastic plastic material definition the overall material behavior is divided into three regions refer to fig 6 a elastic a b plastic b c and material degradation c d followed by failure at d in the elastic regions the material strains vary linearly with stresses following hooke s law the material parameters used to model the material behavior in the elastic region are e 200 g p a and ν 0 3 in the plastic region the plastic strains cannot be uniquely determined by stresses alone and are dependent upon the whole loading history therefore to completely describe the material behavior in the plastic region an appropriate yield function a hardening rule and a flow rule are required the present study employs von mises yield surface criteria classical metal plasticity theory in abaqus with isotropic hardening and associated plastic flow for modeling the plastic region abaqus 2014 the governing equations provided in abaqus 2014 are 1 σ m p 1 3 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ e f f 3 2 s s 3 j 2 3 j 2 1 6 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 4 f j 2 j 2 k 2 5 d ε i j p l g σ i j d φ where p is hydrostatic pressure σ m is the mean stress σ e f f is the von mises or effective stress and j 2 is the second invariant of the deviatory stress tensor k is the yield strength in pure shear setting f j 2 0 the equation 4 leads to j 2 k 2 which can be interpreted as the von mises yield surface the equation 5 represents associated flow when g f where f is the yield function d ε i j p l are the plastic strain increments g is the plastic potential function and d φ is a positive constant 3 2 material degradation and failure modeling fe analysis based on continuum mechanics cannot model the failure in chain links which involves material separation thus invalidating the primary assumption of continuum mechanics hence the ultimate strength of chain links cannot be determined through continuum mechanics therefore section explores 1 micromechanics and 2 phenomenological material models which work in conjunction with elastic plastic material definitions to model the material degradation or softening c d and ultimate failure at d refer to fig 6 a abaqus explicit package also allows for the removal of elements from the mesh simulating the material failure as shown in fig 6 c for the coupon model the three established material damage models explored and calibrated in the section are porous metal plasticity pmp model micromechanics based ductile damage dd model phenomenology based shear failure sf model phenomenology based 3 2 1 porous metal plasticity model the porous metal plasticity pmp model is based on the micro mechanical model of failure due to void nucleation growth and coalescence established by gurson 1975 1977 the gurson model simulates the plastic yield behavior of a material containing voids under the action of loading the material strain hardens void nucleates and grow and subsequent coalescence of these voids leads to deformation localization or necking and final failure the pmp model utilizes a potential function φ defining the plastic yield behavior for a porous ductile material and the yield condition as below 6 φ σ e f f σ y 2 2 q 1 f cosh q 2 3 p 2 σ y 1 q 3 f 2 0 where σ e f f refers to effective or von mises stress p is hydrostatic pressure σ y is material yield stress and f is current void volume fraction when f 0 no voids the equation reduces to von mises criteria σ e f f σ y the three q i i 1 2 and 3 were introduced by tvergaard 1981 to the original gurson model the material parameters were added to consider the interactions between voids and improve the gurson model s accuracy for typical metals the ranges of the parameters reported in the abaqus documentation are q 1 1 1 5 q 2 1 and q 3 q 1 2 1 2 25 the original gurson model is recovered when q 1 q 2 q 3 1 instead of f in the original gurson model q 1 f is used to represents void volume fraction therefore q 1 can be interpreted as an amplification factor for void volume fraction anderson 1994 previous research works have generally utilized the material parameters as q 1 1 5 q 2 1 and q 3 q 1 2 2 25 for the ductile metals qian et al 2005 hardin and beckermann 2007 the void volume change occurs from two sources the growth of existing voids and nucleation of new voids tvergaard 1981 the equation describing the growth rate of voids is 7 f f g r o w t h f n u c l e a t i o n 8 f n u l c e a t i o n a ε m p l the growth rate due to growing existing voids is determined from the conservation of mass and is dependent on current void fraction f and total plastic strain rate ε k k p l trace of the strain rate tensor the growth rate term due to nucleation is calculated by multiplying the equivalent plastic strain rate ε m p l by a scaling coefficient the scaling coefficient a in the porous metal plasticity model is 9 a f n s n 2 π exp 1 2 ε m p l ε n s n 2 it is assumed that the nucleation function a f n follows a normal distribution depending on the plastic strain range about a mean value ε n standard deviation s n and volume fraction of nucleated voids f n using void nucleation requires fitting the three parameters the current study adopts the values recommended in the abaqus documentation as initial values for parametric study ε n 0 1 0 3 s n 0 05 0 1 and f n 0 04 the present study varies material parameters q 1 1 1 5 q 2 1 1 15 and q 3 q 1 2 1 2 25 abaqus 2014 while keeping void nucleation parameter fixed fig 7 a and b shows the effect of model parameters q i i 1 2 and 3 on the gurson s yield function the results show that the parameters only affect the softening part of the stress strain plot the increase in q 1 and q 2 accelerates the effect of void volume fraction and hydrostatic pressure respectively which in turn accelerates the softening the final material parameters are selected on the basis of comparison of simulation results with experimental result of wsl 2 the final shortlisted model parameters q i i 1 2 and 3 are q 1 1 5 q 2 1 and q 3 q 1 2 2 25 which are similar to those used by qian et al 2005 and hardin and beckermann 2007 a coalescence model and failure criteria model was added to the porous metal plasticity theory by tvergaard and needleman 1984 where the void fraction f in equation 6 is replaced by an effective void volume fraction due to coalescence f 10 φ σ e f f σ y 2 2 q 1 f cosh q 2 3 p 2 σ y 1 q 3 f 2 0 where f f models the rapid loss of stress carrying capacity and is accompanied failure due to void coalescence this function is defined in terms of the void volume fraction 11 f f f c f f f f f c f f f c f f c i f f f c i f f c f f i f f f f in abaqus the value of f f is set using the material parameters by the equation 12 f f q 1 q 1 2 q 3 q 3 0 67 for q 1 1 5 and q 3 q 1 2 where f c is the critical value of the void volume fraction and f f is the final value of void volume fraction which governs the void coalescence and final material failure the parameters f c and f f models the material failure when f c f f f due to mechanisms such as micro fracture and void coalescence and when f f f total failure at the material point occurs 3 2 1 1 parametric study effect of ε n f n s n f c and f f the section explores the effect of void nucleation parameters ε n f n and s n along with the failure parameters f c and f f for typical metals ε n 0 1 0 3 f n 0 04 and s n 0 05 0 1 values are suggested in abaqus 2014 for the present study ε n varies from 0 0 0 5 f n varies from 0 0 0 1 and s n varies from 0 05 0 2 the results from the parametric analysis of ε n are provided in fig 8 a a very small value of ε n such as ε n 0 means immediate void nucleation and a large value of ε n 0 4 corresponds to the large ductility of the material the final value shortlisted is ε n 0 4 as the material showed decent ductility in the experiments fig 8 b shows the variation in stress strain plots due to the variation of f n a very small f n delays the nucleation of voids whereas a large value of f n accelerates the nucleation of voids the standard deviation s n has a very low sensitivity and has only secondary effect on the model behavior the final shortlisted values of f n and s n on the basis of comparison of numerical simulation with wsl 2 experimental results are 0 04 and 0 1 respectively the two more parameters which need to be defined to model failure are f c and f f fig 8 c shows the effect due to the variation in f c 0 0 0 07 for f c 0 nucleation can be seen just after yielding occurs a very high value of f c delays failure in the material the parameter f f governs the failure path therefore for a smaller value reduction in stiffness is sudden and for a slightly larger value the coalescence of void is slow the final shortlisted values of all the parameters are summarized in table 6 the simulation also uses an initial relative density r o defined as the ratio of the volume of solid material to the total volume of the material of the porous material typically the ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume of the material is assumed around 0 2 for steels r o 0 998 however defining the initial relative density is not necessary if the value is not specified abaqus assign it a value of 1 0 the simulations carried out using the two relative density values did not show any significant difference in the behavior fig 8 d shows the final comparison of numerical simulation will all the parameters as provided in table 6 with experimental results obtained from the wsl 2 coupon test 3 2 2 ductile damage model the ductile damage dd model incorporated in abaqus is similar to the continuum damage mechanics model proposed by lemaitre 1985 which treats damage as an internal variable describing the state of the continuum the internal damage variable phenomenologically models the void nucleation growth and coalescence in materials the damage variable controls damage initiation evolution and rupture criteria and is defined in terms of corrected area of cracks and cavities per unit surface lemaitre 1985 also proposed a relationship between fracture strain and stress triaxiality as below 13 p r ε r 2 3 1 ν 3 1 2 ν σ m σ e f f 2 1 where p r is the strain at rupture or fracture strain ε r is the uniaxial strain at fracture σ m is the mean or hydrostatic stress and σ e f f is the von mises equivalent stress η stress triaxiality is defined as the ratio of σ m and σ e f f lemaitre 1985 also suggested that the dependence of p r and p d on stress triaxiality is the same hence 14 p r ε r p d ε d f σ m σ e f f where p d is the damage strain and ε d is the uniaxial damage strain the damage model in abaqus is divided into two stages of damage initiation detection and damage evolution to identify the onset of damage a variable ω d is used which is defined as 15 ω d ⅆ ε p l ε d p l η ε p l 1 no damage 1 damage initiation where ε d p l is the equivalent plastic strain at damage initiation which is assumed to be a function of both the stress triaxiality and plastic strain rate ε d p l is denoted as p d in the lemaitre 1985 damage model the present study assumes p d to be only dependent upon stress triaxiality and ignores the effect of strain rates from equation 13 and 14 and poisson ratio ν 0 3 the relationship between damage strain to uniaxial damage strain reduces to 16 p d ε d 0 867 1 2 σ m σ e f f 2 1 the relationship between the damage strain and stress triaxiality for different uniaxial damage strain values is shown in fig 9 a damage initiation the first stage of the ductile damage model is identified using damage strain and stress triaxiality which is estimated by uniaxial damage strain value tensile coupon tests indicate that the ductile damage begins and load reaches an ultimate value at the onset of necking the stress localization at the onset of necking is insignificant and uniaxial state of stress is still valid therefore it is assumed that equivalent plastic strain at damage initiation is close to the plastic strain values at the onset of necking the second stage of damage evolution is characterized by progressive degradation of the material stiffness followed by failure fig 9 b shows the characteristic stress strain behavior of the material undergoing damage depicted by the softening of yield stress and degradation of elasticity σ y 0 and ε d p l are the yield stress and equivalent plastic strain at the onset of damage and ε f p l is the equivalent plastic strain at failure at which the overall damage variable reaches value d 1 the equivalent plastic strain at failure ε f p l depends on the characteristic length of the element and using it as a material parameter to specify the damage evolution will render the results mesh sensitive therefore the damage evolution law in abaqus is specified in terms of equivalent plastic displacement u p l or fracture energy dissipation g f the model employs a fracture energy proposal to reduce the mesh dependency by creating a stress displacement response after the onset of damage the energy required to open a unit area of crack g f as a material parameter is given as 17 g f ε 0 p l ε f p l l σ y d ε p l 0 u f p l σ y d u p l where l is defined as characteristic length the implementation of this stress displacement concept requires characteristic length l associated with the integration points equivalent plastic displacement u p l is also associated with an integration point and measured only after the damage initiation before damage initiation u p l 0 and after damage initiation u p l l ε p l consequently the softening response is characterized by the stress displacement response leading to minimized mesh dependency lemaitre 1985 observed that the damage evolution is linear to the equivalent plastic strain therefore when equivalent plastic displacement at failure u f p l and critical damage value d c is achieved the material stiffness reaches maximum degradation and failure occurs the relationship between the damage rate and equivalent plastic strain is given as 18 d d c u p l u f p l therefore in the ductile damage model the material damage behavior can be completely defined by utilizing three parameters ε d p l u f p l and d c the equivalent plastic strain at damage initiation ε d p l and critical damage d c can be evaluated through uniaxial experiments lemaitre and dufailly 1987 however effective plastic displacement at failure u f p l need to be evaluated through parametric studies the present study employs critical damage d c 0 2 established through parametric studies which is equivalent to the value utilized for steel specimens in previous research works lemaitre 1985 lemaitre and dufailly 1987 3 2 2 1 parametric study effect of ε d p l u f p l and d c the sensitivity analysis and identification of suitable parametric values are carried out by varying the three parameters ε d p l u f p l and d c alternatively the ε d p l and u f p l are varied in the simulations while d c is assumed to be 1 0 initially the effect of these parameters is explored using a 1 4th coupon fe model refer to fig 6 b at first only stain at damage initiation ε d p l is varied from 0 07 to 0 1 and plastic displacement at failure u f p l and critical damage d c are fixed at 1 0 each as shown in fig 10 a the ε d p l is varied keeping in mind the strain values at the maximum stresses observed in the experiments as summarized in table 2 the higher value of damage initiation strains delays the softening of the material or the strain at which ultimate stress is achieved hence the final value shortlisted for strain at damage initiation is equal to the strain at which maximum stress occurred in wsl 2 coupon strength test fig 10 b shows the variation in stress strain response due to variation in effective plastic displacement u f p l which controls the damage evolution or softening path the effect of u f p l is observed only after the initiation of softening for a larger value of u f p l the damage evolution is slow as compared to the relatively smaller u f p l value fig 10 c shows the effect of critical damage d c where ε d p l and u f p l are 0 087 and 1 0 respectively critical damage d c is varied from 0 1 to 0 4 and it is evident from fig 10 c that d c only governs the point at which failure occurs and does not affect the damage initiation or softening paths moreover the three parameters ε d p l u f p l and d c influence the damage initiation damage evolution and failure respectively and act independently without affecting the other the ε d p l and d c are independent of mesh size but the plastic displacement at failure is dependent on the mesh size and need to be established for a given element table 7 summarizes different plastic displacement at failure u f p l for the varying mesh sizes and characteristic element length l fig 10 d compares the numerical analysis results with the wsl 2 for different mesh sizes 3 2 3 shear failure model puttick 1959 observed that the mechanism of failure under shear in ductile materials is nucleation and growth of cavities within a localized shear band abaqus provides a shear failure sf model based on the shear band localizations the model is used in conjunction with the von mises plasticity and offers the element removal capability in abaqus explicit solver the damage parameter d is based on equivalent plastic strain at failure 19 d ε 0 p l δ ε p l ε f p l where ε 0 p l is the initial value of the equivalent plastic strain δ ε p l is an increment of the equivalent plastic strain and ε f p l is the equivalent plastic strain at failure accumulated over all increments in the analysis the failure is assumed to occur when the damage parameter d 1 3 2 3 1 parametric study effect of ε f p l the strain at failure ε f p l depends on the plastic strain rate ε p l and stress triaxiality η however the present study directly assumes the value of the equivalent plastic strain at fracture the ε f p l is treated as a parameter in the study and simulation results are compared with tensile coupon test results for the two extreme cases of elongations sl 1 and wsl 2 fig 11 a and 11 b shows the stress strain plot for varying equivalent plastic strain at failure along with the tests results from coupon sl 1 and wsl 2 respectively the comparison of simulation results with experimental observations estimates two extreme values of equivalent plastic strain at fracture ε f p l 0 6 and ε f p l 0 8 4 non linear fe analysis of mooring chains the section validates the material damage models and their parameters established by comparing numerical simulations on chain fe models with chain strength tests ct1 and ct2 non linear fe analysis of chain link model employs an assembly of two quarter links as shown in fig 12 the bottom link is fixed only in the y direction which allows it to translate in all other directions the model utilizes symmetry boundary condition in the xy plane and the load is applied by providing vertical displacement to the top link the material failure is assigned to the bottom link and top link has only elastic plastic material definition the model employs c3d8 eight node brick element with reduced integration in both the top and bottom links the refined mesh is provided to the bottom link with further refinement in the bend and crown regions to simulate ductile failure on the other hand the top link has a slightly coarser mesh to reduce computational time abaqus explicit analysis with element removal from the mesh is used to simulate ductile failure in the chain links the proof load and effect of friction study employs the same fe model however it does not consider any material degradation 4 1 proof loading proof loading is the application of direct load to a length of the chain after fabrication and heat treatment the mooring chains are mandatorily proof loaded after the manufacturing process or before supply the proof loadings specified in dnv os e302 2013 and api spec 2f 1997 are in the range 70 79 and 66 76 respectively of the minimum breaking load mbl of the chain links proof load application causes permanent elongation and residual stresses in the chain links shoup et al 1992a b and tipton and shoup 1992 the mooring chains used in the strength tests are proof loaded chains therefore it is vital to include the effect of proof loading in the numerical study as well the model is loaded to a proof load of 3416 kn and unloaded before the application of final loading as specified in dnv os e302 fig 13 a plots normalized load vs normalized displacement curve showing three stages of 1 proof load 2 unloading and 3 final loading 4 2 contact definition and effect of friction coefficient the two 1 4th links in the fe model are in contact with each other refer to fig 12 the load transfer mechanism between two links is modeled using the surface to surface contact with properties defined using the normal and tangential contact behavior in the study normal behavior is defined as hard contact which ensures unlimited contact pressure between the two contacting surfaces the tangential behavior is modeled using the penalty function method and friction coefficient μ the friction coefficient μ between two chain links normally varies in the range of 0 1 0 5 depending upon the material type surface finish and the medium in which the chain is deployed the friction coefficient is higher in air as compared to in seawater which acts as a lubricant between the two contacting surfaces the present study explored the effect of friction friction coefficient μ 0 0 0 5 on the load displacement behavior of the chain links as plotted in fig 13 b for μ 0 0 slip at the contact region is observed at a very early stage whereas for μ 0 2 the slipping is delayed leading to higher ultimate load prediction load displacement response does not shows any noticeable difference in for slightly higher values of friction coefficient μ 0 4 and μ 0 5 the load vs displacement behavior in the chain strength tests did not show any slip therefore for numerical simulations a slightly larger value of friction coefficient μ 0 4 is used in further study fig 13 c compares load vs inter link displacement ild for simulation with μ 0 4 with the ild of failed links and average link displacement the numerical simulation shows a slightly higher ultimate load however both the numerical simulation and strength tests show similar trend without any slip in the interlink contact region 4 3 chain failure simulation and comparison the section compares numerical simulations with the strength tests ct1 and ct2 in terms of failure mode maximum load and inter link displacement ild the failure modes for a porous metal plasticity pmp b ductile damage dd and c shear failure sf model are shown in fig 14 the maximum load and ductility for material degradation models and strength tests are summarized in table 8 the normalized ultimate load in numerical simulations and strength tests is approximately the same for all the material models however in terms of inter link displacement only dd and sf for ε d p l 0 6 model agree with the strength tests fig 15 a plots the normalized load vs normalized interlink displacement for numerical simulations with pmp dd and sf models and experimental average link displacement pmp gtn model simulation showed maximum inter link displacement ild and delayed failure refer to fig 15 a as compared to the other material damage models and strength tests moreover the failure pattern is more synonymous with the necking and tensile failure in the bend region as shown in fig 14 a the model over predicted ild due to its inability to capture damage under shear dominated loadings in shear loading the voids present in ductile material collapse into micro cracks which subsequently rotate and elongate in shear tvergaard 2009 whereas the pmp model cannot simulate the collapse of voids to micro cracks and rotation of cracks without including the void volume growth in shear to the total void volume fraction achouri et al 2013 although study suggests that pmp model may not be suitable for the present mode of failure it can be effectively used for the strength estimation of the chain links with reduced cross sections in the bend or straight sections which may cause the failure due to coalescence of voids the ductile damage dd model results are in good agreement with the strength tests in terms of failure mode ultimate load and maximum inter link displacement fig 14 b shows the failure pattern for dd model simulation which closely resembles the failure mode observed in the experimental tests ct1 and ct2 refer to 15 b slightly lower ild and higher maximum load before the final failure may have occurred due to differences in material properties in the bend regions as has already been observed in the coupon tests nonetheless the model is able to predict the nature of failure in the chain link within acceptable limits of errors the shear failure sf model with equivalent plastic strain at fracture ε f p l 0 6 is in good agreement with the strength tests in terms of failure mode maximum load and maximum ild refer figs 14 b and figure 15 c however the sf model is not suitable because it is difficult to obtain equivalent plastic strain at failure on which ild is highly dependent refer to table 8 however the model can be used to provide a lower and upper bound of maximum ilds for comparison with strength tests 5 summary and conclusions the present study explored the micromechanics and phenomenology based material models for strength estimation of the chain links the study utilized tensile coupon tests for the material damage parameter estimation and chain strength tests for the validation of material damage models non linear fe simulations with material damage effectively captured the failure modes failure load and inter link displacements as observed in the chain strength tests the results presented above support the following findings and conclusions 1 the material behavior varied slightly with location and the probable cause could be work hardening improper heat treatment or pre loading of chains the slight difference in material properties did not significantly affect the global behavior the chain strength tests ct 1 and ct 2 showed approximately similar ultimate strength deformations and were in good agreement with the numerical simulation results which employed material properties from wsl 2 the study also highlighted the importance of considering proof load in numerical simulations which caused permanent elongation and residual stresses in the chain links and delayed the large deformations in the post loading stage moreover the plastic deformations under large loads were mainly concentrated in the inter link contact regions 2 the pmp model could not capture damage under shear dominated loadings which led to the over prediction of failure load and inter link displacement however it can be used to model failure in the links with a reduced cross section in the straight section or bend region 3 although the shear failure model accurately predicted the failure mode failure load and inter link displacements it was highly dependent on equivalent plastic strain at fracture values which makes it less suitable to use however the shear failure models could still be used to provide upper and lower bounds values of ultimate strength and inter link displacement by treating equivalent plastic strain at fracture as a parameter 4 the ductile damage model predicted the failure mode accurately and provided conservative estimates for ultimate strength and inter link displacements the simple methodology of ductile damage parameter estimation and accurate failure mode modeling even for coarse mesh sizes makes it most suitable among the three models explored for modeling the ductile failure of chain links moreover the model can be easily used for different coupon test results by directly adjusting the ε d p l as the strain at which ultimate strength is achieved effective plastic displacement at failure u f p l which governs the softening path will have to be adjusted slightly using parametric analysis the critical damage d c may not need adjustments as it is usually around 0 2 for steel specimens 5 the present study successfully explored three failure models to model the ductile failure in the mooring chain links however a few areas need further investigation first a more comprehensive gtn model which also includes damage under shear will improve the simulation results second the ductile damage model will provide better simulation results if the variation of fracture strain vs stress triaxiality and critical damage vs plastic strain data is determined experimentally

22251,mooring chains in many offshore floating facilities have failed due to overloading under extreme environmental events the ductile failure in chains due to overloading has not been addressed in

introduction offshore floating structures employed for drilling or production and storage generally use mooring systems as station keeping equipment the mooring chains being an essential part of those mooring systems provide restoring force to the floating platforms and restrict the vessel motion within desired excursion limits so that risers umbilical and subsea equipment are protected from damage the mooring chains function in extremely harsh environments and undergo extreme loading conditions during their service life tension tension fatigue out of plane bending opb fatigue excessive wear in contact regions overloading due to storms etc d souza and majhi 2013 ma et al 2013 have been the major causes of failure in mooring chains the minor and major chain failures from year the 2001 2011 point out that the mooring chain failure probabilities are much higher than the intended design failure probabilities ma et al 2013 maslin 2013 smedly and petruska 2014 table 1 compares the failure probabilities observed for both the single line and multiple line failures with the target failure probabilities specified in the dnv s offshore standard on position mooring dnv os e301 2001 the strict quality requirements at the time of installation better understanding of degradation mechanisms reliable periodic inspections and regular condition assessment can help reduce failures and ensure safe working condition through early detection and replacement of degraded links brown et al 2005 2010 allan et al 2013 gordon et al 2014 although the periodic and after storm inspections are mandatory to ascertain the health of mooring systems for safety and early detection of faults angulo et al 2017 the identification of degraded chain link and condition or residual strength assessment is still an issue the overall study is divided into two parts 1 identification of degraded link through inspection and 2 condition assessment of identified link the present paper mainly summarizes the second part which aims at residual strength assessment of chain link by utilizing suitable material damage models the current study utilizes the fact that there are many material failure models available and a great amount of work has been done in the development of these models consequently the strength estimation of the chain link is possible by employing suitable material damage models in numerical simulations however identifying their reliability and applicability in mooring chain strength estimation is vital and needs further investigation therefore the present study explores suitable material damage models either micromechanical or phenomenological for modeling the ductile failure in chain links micromechanics based process of ductile failure in porous metals is divided into 3 stages of void a nucleation b growth and c coalescence the micromechanics based model adopted in the study is based on the pioneer works of mcclintock 1968 and rice and tracey 1969 which modeled the growth of an isolated cavity in a continuum gurson tvergaard and needleman gtn later extended the isolated cavity model by modeling the interaction between cavities in porous metals in a series of articles gurson 1975 1977 tvergaard 1981 1982 1989 tvergaard and needleman 1984 gtn model has been successfully used by previous researchers in various application such as modeling of failure in the circular hollow sections qian et al 2005 modeling of marine structural steel choung 2009a modeling of punch tests choung 2009b and plate impact simulation choung et al 2010 the alternative to the micromechanics based model is phenomenological model or macroscale model at macro levels the three stages of material deterioration void nucleation growth and coalescence are termed as softening softening is further defined as the progressive degradation of material stiffness and is accompanied by complete loss of load carrying capacity continuum damage mechanics cdm is a phenomenological yet rational approach to model the process of material degradation or softening cdm utilizes a single internal damage variable to define failure the idea first proposed by kachanov 1958 and further developed and justified by utilizing thermodynamics of irreversible processes by lemaitre 1985 cdm has been used in various applications in the marine industry such as simulation of marine structural steel behavior choung 2009a ship collisions martinez et al 2017 and structural damages in shell structures kõrgesaar and romanoff 2014 the other phenomenological model employed is the shear failure sf model which models damage in terms of accumulated plastic strain the failure in the sf model occurs when equivalent plastic strain value exceeds a predefined value sf model is the simplest model among the three models gtn cdm and sf and employs only a single variable equivalent plastic strain at failure the content of the present study is broadly categorized into experimental and numerical studies the experimental study includes tensile tests on coupon specimens to ascertain the material properties and monotonic loading tests on the 5 link chains benchmarking simulations are conducted on coupon finite element fe model to establish material parameters for gtn cdm and sf models later material damage models are validated using non linear fe analysis and experimental study on chain links 2 experimental work the present section describes material tests on coupon specimens and monotonic loading tests on chain specimens the section also discusses the details of specimen geometry test setup boundary conditions loading details instrumentation and data acquisition 2 1 material tests a series of tensile tests are conducted on coupon specimens fabricated as per astm international 2009 to obtain material properties of r3 grade steel chain links the tensile coupon specimens two each are extracted from different locations a straight leg specimen sl 1 and sl 2 b welded straight leg specimen wsl 1 and wsl 2 and c bend region specimen br 1 and br 2 of the chain link fig 1 a and 1 b shows the locations of specimen extraction and dimensions of the coupon specimens fig 2 a and 2 b displays the test setup for tensile tests and measured stress strain data for sl 1 sl 2 wsl 1 wsl 2 br 1 and br 2 the complete set of yield strength ultimate strength and elongation data for all the specimens along with standard material properties of r3 grade steel are provided in table 2 the yield and ultimate strengths are observed to be approximately similar for all the coupon specimens the elongations for sl 1 sl 2 br 1 and br 2 are in the range of 15 9 18 5 which is close to the code specified elongation for r3 grade steels refer to table 2 specimen wsl 1 showed the lowest ductility due to the failure of flash butt weld in the reduced cross section region of the coupon offshore standard dnv os e302 2013 provides minimum mechanical properties for different steel grades and places relatively lower elongation requirements for higher yield strength steels since yield strength of chain material in the current study is even higher than r3s grade steel the study utilizes lower elongation as shown in the case of wsl 2 2 2 mooring chain failure tests the full scale static strength tests are conducted on 76 mm nominal diameter stud chains of r3 grade steel with minimum breaking load mbl of 4884 kn bs iso 1704 2008 table 3 summarizes the measurements of mooring chain specimens used in strength tests the dimensions of the chain links are as per the standard recommendations in bs iso 1704 2008 fig 3 a and 3 b shows the image and schematic diagram of the test setup with instrumentation and nomenclature details the load is applied using a hydraulic actuator of 10 000 kn capacity with a stroke length of 250 mm the loading actuator is connected to top link link 1 or l1 of chain with the help of a tension stud a green pin shackle and a pear link in order in between the bottom link link 5 or l5 is connected to the base deck with the help of a 110 mm diameter profiled pin the loading is applied by providing displacement to the top link l1 whereas any displacement at the bottom link l5 is restrained the specified minimum breaking load mbl of chain links used in the experimental study is much lower than the strength of the attachments as summarized in table 4 the test setup utilizes laser and mechanical transducers to measure the chain link displacements at mid height of each link as shown in the inset in fig 3 b the two laser transducers of range 600 mm and 400 mm are placed at mid height of l1 and l2 respectively additionally the three lvdts of 300 mm 100 mm and 50 mm measure displacements at the mid height of l3 l4 and l5 respectively the inter link displacements ild or displacement between links dbl δ is calculated by measuring the difference in displacements at mid height of subsequent chain links the 50 mm lvdt placed at mid height of bottom link l5 showed slight movement at higher loads 4000 4500 kn due displacement at the base deck therefore the displacement recorded at l5 is subtracted from displacement observed l1 to get elongation within the chain specimen the two chain specimens tested are named ct1 and ct2 chain test 1 and chain test 2 both the tests employ displacement controlled loading with the rate varying gradually from 0 05 mm min in the elastic stage to 1 mm min after the onset of yielding fig 4 a shows the global load p vs global displacement δ measured at the mid height of top link l1 the global displacement at l1 is corrected for base deck displacements by subtracting the displacement at the bottom link fig 4 b shows the normalized load vs normalized interlink displacements for ct1 and ct2 table 5 shows the normalizing load yield load for a single leg of chain link and normalizing displacement nominal diameter the top and bottom limits capture the scatter in the stiffness and displacements at each inter link contact as illustrated in fig 4 b and 4 c for both the tests ct1 and ct2 the inter link displacement ild between l2 and l3 is maximum and is around 35 mm ct1dbl2 3 and 40 mm ct2dbl2 3 respectively the ultimate strength tests on ct1 and ct2 show similar load vs global displacement and load vs inter link displacement behavior with approximate yield load of 3500 kn in both the tests the deformation in the chain links was not very obvious till around 4000 4100 kn which increases rapidly after around 4300 kn the inter link contact region between l2 and l3 shows maximum deformation and ultimate failure is observed in l3 in both the tests fig 5 a and 5 b show the un deformed and deformed just before failure state of l3 in ct2 and fig 5 c shows the superimposed image of both the un deformed and deformed l3 from fig 5 c it is evident that most of the inelastic activity occurs in contact regions and deformation at both the interlink contact regions may not be the same 3 calibration of the material model modeling of ductile failure in chains requires suitable material definition the present section explores and calibrates different material damage models which can be employed in conjunction with elastic plastic material definitions to model ductile failure in chain links the elastic plastic material definitions model material behavior in the elastic a b and plastic b c regions up to the onset of softening or damage initiation at c as illustrated in fig 6 a the material softening c d and ultimate failure at d is modeled using material degradation and failure models however these material damage models require calibration or establishing material parameters for a specific material the calibration of these material models utilizes stress strain results from the material tests and finite element fe simulations on the coupon model fig 6 b shows the 1 4th coupon model for the fe studies boundary conditions include symmetry boundary conditions along the two planes and fixed boundary condition at one end of the coupon model the model employs c3d8 eight node brick element with reduced integration 3 1 elastic plastic material definition the overall material behavior is divided into three regions refer to fig 6 a elastic a b plastic b c and material degradation c d followed by failure at d in the elastic regions the material strains vary linearly with stresses following hooke s law the material parameters used to model the material behavior in the elastic region are e 200 g p a and ν 0 3 in the plastic region the plastic strains cannot be uniquely determined by stresses alone and are dependent upon the whole loading history therefore to completely describe the material behavior in the plastic region an appropriate yield function a hardening rule and a flow rule are required the present study employs von mises yield surface criteria classical metal plasticity theory in abaqus with isotropic hardening and associated plastic flow for modeling the plastic region abaqus 2014 the governing equations provided in abaqus 2014 are 1 σ m p 1 3 σ 1 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ e f f 3 2 s s 3 j 2 3 j 2 1 6 σ 1 σ 2 2 σ 2 σ 3 2 σ 3 σ 1 2 4 f j 2 j 2 k 2 5 d ε i j p l g σ i j d φ where p is hydrostatic pressure σ m is the mean stress σ e f f is the von mises or effective stress and j 2 is the second invariant of the deviatory stress tensor k is the yield strength in pure shear setting f j 2 0 the equation 4 leads to j 2 k 2 which can be interpreted as the von mises yield surface the equation 5 represents associated flow when g f where f is the yield function d ε i j p l are the plastic strain increments g is the plastic potential function and d φ is a positive constant 3 2 material degradation and failure modeling fe analysis based on continuum mechanics cannot model the failure in chain links which involves material separation thus invalidating the primary assumption of continuum mechanics hence the ultimate strength of chain links cannot be determined through continuum mechanics therefore section explores 1 micromechanics and 2 phenomenological material models which work in conjunction with elastic plastic material definitions to model the material degradation or softening c d and ultimate failure at d refer to fig 6 a abaqus explicit package also allows for the removal of elements from the mesh simulating the material failure as shown in fig 6 c for the coupon model the three established material damage models explored and calibrated in the section are porous metal plasticity pmp model micromechanics based ductile damage dd model phenomenology based shear failure sf model phenomenology based 3 2 1 porous metal plasticity model the porous metal plasticity pmp model is based on the micro mechanical model of failure due to void nucleation growth and coalescence established by gurson 1975 1977 the gurson model simulates the plastic yield behavior of a material containing voids under the action of loading the material strain hardens void nucleates and grow and subsequent coalescence of these voids leads to deformation localization or necking and final failure the pmp model utilizes a potential function φ defining the plastic yield behavior for a porous ductile material and the yield condition as below 6 φ σ e f f σ y 2 2 q 1 f cosh q 2 3 p 2 σ y 1 q 3 f 2 0 where σ e f f refers to effective or von mises stress p is hydrostatic pressure σ y is material yield stress and f is current void volume fraction when f 0 no voids the equation reduces to von mises criteria σ e f f σ y the three q i i 1 2 and 3 were introduced by tvergaard 1981 to the original gurson model the material parameters were added to consider the interactions between voids and improve the gurson model s accuracy for typical metals the ranges of the parameters reported in the abaqus documentation are q 1 1 1 5 q 2 1 and q 3 q 1 2 1 2 25 the original gurson model is recovered when q 1 q 2 q 3 1 instead of f in the original gurson model q 1 f is used to represents void volume fraction therefore q 1 can be interpreted as an amplification factor for void volume fraction anderson 1994 previous research works have generally utilized the material parameters as q 1 1 5 q 2 1 and q 3 q 1 2 2 25 for the ductile metals qian et al 2005 hardin and beckermann 2007 the void volume change occurs from two sources the growth of existing voids and nucleation of new voids tvergaard 1981 the equation describing the growth rate of voids is 7 f f g r o w t h f n u c l e a t i o n 8 f n u l c e a t i o n a ε m p l the growth rate due to growing existing voids is determined from the conservation of mass and is dependent on current void fraction f and total plastic strain rate ε k k p l trace of the strain rate tensor the growth rate term due to nucleation is calculated by multiplying the equivalent plastic strain rate ε m p l by a scaling coefficient the scaling coefficient a in the porous metal plasticity model is 9 a f n s n 2 π exp 1 2 ε m p l ε n s n 2 it is assumed that the nucleation function a f n follows a normal distribution depending on the plastic strain range about a mean value ε n standard deviation s n and volume fraction of nucleated voids f n using void nucleation requires fitting the three parameters the current study adopts the values recommended in the abaqus documentation as initial values for parametric study ε n 0 1 0 3 s n 0 05 0 1 and f n 0 04 the present study varies material parameters q 1 1 1 5 q 2 1 1 15 and q 3 q 1 2 1 2 25 abaqus 2014 while keeping void nucleation parameter fixed fig 7 a and b shows the effect of model parameters q i i 1 2 and 3 on the gurson s yield function the results show that the parameters only affect the softening part of the stress strain plot the increase in q 1 and q 2 accelerates the effect of void volume fraction and hydrostatic pressure respectively which in turn accelerates the softening the final material parameters are selected on the basis of comparison of simulation results with experimental result of wsl 2 the final shortlisted model parameters q i i 1 2 and 3 are q 1 1 5 q 2 1 and q 3 q 1 2 2 25 which are similar to those used by qian et al 2005 and hardin and beckermann 2007 a coalescence model and failure criteria model was added to the porous metal plasticity theory by tvergaard and needleman 1984 where the void fraction f in equation 6 is replaced by an effective void volume fraction due to coalescence f 10 φ σ e f f σ y 2 2 q 1 f cosh q 2 3 p 2 σ y 1 q 3 f 2 0 where f f models the rapid loss of stress carrying capacity and is accompanied failure due to void coalescence this function is defined in terms of the void volume fraction 11 f f f c f f f f f c f f f c f f c i f f f c i f f c f f i f f f f in abaqus the value of f f is set using the material parameters by the equation 12 f f q 1 q 1 2 q 3 q 3 0 67 for q 1 1 5 and q 3 q 1 2 where f c is the critical value of the void volume fraction and f f is the final value of void volume fraction which governs the void coalescence and final material failure the parameters f c and f f models the material failure when f c f f f due to mechanisms such as micro fracture and void coalescence and when f f f total failure at the material point occurs 3 2 1 1 parametric study effect of ε n f n s n f c and f f the section explores the effect of void nucleation parameters ε n f n and s n along with the failure parameters f c and f f for typical metals ε n 0 1 0 3 f n 0 04 and s n 0 05 0 1 values are suggested in abaqus 2014 for the present study ε n varies from 0 0 0 5 f n varies from 0 0 0 1 and s n varies from 0 05 0 2 the results from the parametric analysis of ε n are provided in fig 8 a a very small value of ε n such as ε n 0 means immediate void nucleation and a large value of ε n 0 4 corresponds to the large ductility of the material the final value shortlisted is ε n 0 4 as the material showed decent ductility in the experiments fig 8 b shows the variation in stress strain plots due to the variation of f n a very small f n delays the nucleation of voids whereas a large value of f n accelerates the nucleation of voids the standard deviation s n has a very low sensitivity and has only secondary effect on the model behavior the final shortlisted values of f n and s n on the basis of comparison of numerical simulation with wsl 2 experimental results are 0 04 and 0 1 respectively the two more parameters which need to be defined to model failure are f c and f f fig 8 c shows the effect due to the variation in f c 0 0 0 07 for f c 0 nucleation can be seen just after yielding occurs a very high value of f c delays failure in the material the parameter f f governs the failure path therefore for a smaller value reduction in stiffness is sudden and for a slightly larger value the coalescence of void is slow the final shortlisted values of all the parameters are summarized in table 6 the simulation also uses an initial relative density r o defined as the ratio of the volume of solid material to the total volume of the material of the porous material typically the ratio of the volume of voids to the total volume of the material is assumed around 0 2 for steels r o 0 998 however defining the initial relative density is not necessary if the value is not specified abaqus assign it a value of 1 0 the simulations carried out using the two relative density values did not show any significant difference in the behavior fig 8 d shows the final comparison of numerical simulation will all the parameters as provided in table 6 with experimental results obtained from the wsl 2 coupon test 3 2 2 ductile damage model the ductile damage dd model incorporated in abaqus is similar to the continuum damage mechanics model proposed by lemaitre 1985 which treats damage as an internal variable describing the state of the continuum the internal damage variable phenomenologically models the void nucleation growth and coalescence in materials the damage variable controls damage initiation evolution and rupture criteria and is defined in terms of corrected area of cracks and cavities per unit surface lemaitre 1985 also proposed a relationship between fracture strain and stress triaxiality as below 13 p r ε r 2 3 1 ν 3 1 2 ν σ m σ e f f 2 1 where p r is the strain at rupture or fracture strain ε r is the uniaxial strain at fracture σ m is the mean or hydrostatic stress and σ e f f is the von mises equivalent stress η stress triaxiality is defined as the ratio of σ m and σ e f f lemaitre 1985 also suggested that the dependence of p r and p d on stress triaxiality is the same hence 14 p r ε r p d ε d f σ m σ e f f where p d is the damage strain and ε d is the uniaxial damage strain the damage model in abaqus is divided into two stages of damage initiation detection and damage evolution to identify the onset of damage a variable ω d is used which is defined as 15 ω d ⅆ ε p l ε d p l η ε p l 1 no damage 1 damage initiation where ε d p l is the equivalent plastic strain at damage initiation which is assumed to be a function of both the stress triaxiality and plastic strain rate ε d p l is denoted as p d in the lemaitre 1985 damage model the present study assumes p d to be only dependent upon stress triaxiality and ignores the effect of strain rates from equation 13 and 14 and poisson ratio ν 0 3 the relationship between damage strain to uniaxial damage strain reduces to 16 p d ε d 0 867 1 2 σ m σ e f f 2 1 the relationship between the damage strain and stress triaxiality for different uniaxial damage strain values is shown in fig 9 a damage initiation the first stage of the ductile damage model is identified using damage strain and stress triaxiality which is estimated by uniaxial damage strain value tensile coupon tests indicate that the ductile damage begins and load reaches an ultimate value at the onset of necking the stress localization at the onset of necking is insignificant and uniaxial state of stress is still valid therefore it is assumed that equivalent plastic strain at damage initiation is close to the plastic strain values at the onset of necking the second stage of damage evolution is characterized by progressive degradation of the material stiffness followed by failure fig 9 b shows the characteristic stress strain behavior of the material undergoing damage depicted by the softening of yield stress and degradation of elasticity σ y 0 and ε d p l are the yield stress and equivalent plastic strain at the onset of damage and ε f p l is the equivalent plastic strain at failure at which the overall damage variable reaches value d 1 the equivalent plastic strain at failure ε f p l depends on the characteristic length of the element and using it as a material parameter to specify the damage evolution will render the results mesh sensitive therefore the damage evolution law in abaqus is specified in terms of equivalent plastic displacement u p l or fracture energy dissipation g f the model employs a fracture energy proposal to reduce the mesh dependency by creating a stress displacement response after the onset of damage the energy required to open a unit area of crack g f as a material parameter is given as 17 g f ε 0 p l ε f p l l σ y d ε p l 0 u f p l σ y d u p l where l is defined as characteristic length the implementation of this stress displacement concept requires characteristic length l associated with the integration points equivalent plastic displacement u p l is also associated with an integration point and measured only after the damage initiation before damage initiation u p l 0 and after damage initiation u p l l ε p l consequently the softening response is characterized by the stress displacement response leading to minimized mesh dependency lemaitre 1985 observed that the damage evolution is linear to the equivalent plastic strain therefore when equivalent plastic displacement at failure u f p l and critical damage value d c is achieved the material stiffness reaches maximum degradation and failure occurs the relationship between the damage rate and equivalent plastic strain is given as 18 d d c u p l u f p l therefore in the ductile damage model the material damage behavior can be completely defined by utilizing three parameters ε d p l u f p l and d c the equivalent plastic strain at damage initiation ε d p l and critical damage d c can be evaluated through uniaxial experiments lemaitre and dufailly 1987 however effective plastic displacement at failure u f p l need to be evaluated through parametric studies the present study employs critical damage d c 0 2 established through parametric studies which is equivalent to the value utilized for steel specimens in previous research works lemaitre 1985 lemaitre and dufailly 1987 3 2 2 1 parametric study effect of ε d p l u f p l and d c the sensitivity analysis and identification of suitable parametric values are carried out by varying the three parameters ε d p l u f p l and d c alternatively the ε d p l and u f p l are varied in the simulations while d c is assumed to be 1 0 initially the effect of these parameters is explored using a 1 4th coupon fe model refer to fig 6 b at first only stain at damage initiation ε d p l is varied from 0 07 to 0 1 and plastic displacement at failure u f p l and critical damage d c are fixed at 1 0 each as shown in fig 10 a the ε d p l is varied keeping in mind the strain values at the maximum stresses observed in the experiments as summarized in table 2 the higher value of damage initiation strains delays the softening of the material or the strain at which ultimate stress is achieved hence the final value shortlisted for strain at damage initiation is equal to the strain at which maximum stress occurred in wsl 2 coupon strength test fig 10 b shows the variation in stress strain response due to variation in effective plastic displacement u f p l which controls the damage evolution or softening path the effect of u f p l is observed only after the initiation of softening for a larger value of u f p l the damage evolution is slow as compared to the relatively smaller u f p l value fig 10 c shows the effect of critical damage d c where ε d p l and u f p l are 0 087 and 1 0 respectively critical damage d c is varied from 0 1 to 0 4 and it is evident from fig 10 c that d c only governs the point at which failure occurs and does not affect the damage initiation or softening paths moreover the three parameters ε d p l u f p l and d c influence the damage initiation damage evolution and failure respectively and act independently without affecting the other the ε d p l and d c are independent of mesh size but the plastic displacement at failure is dependent on the mesh size and need to be established for a given element table 7 summarizes different plastic displacement at failure u f p l for the varying mesh sizes and characteristic element length l fig 10 d compares the numerical analysis results with the wsl 2 for different mesh sizes 3 2 3 shear failure model puttick 1959 observed that the mechanism of failure under shear in ductile materials is nucleation and growth of cavities within a localized shear band abaqus provides a shear failure sf model based on the shear band localizations the model is used in conjunction with the von mises plasticity and offers the element removal capability in abaqus explicit solver the damage parameter d is based on equivalent plastic strain at failure 19 d ε 0 p l δ ε p l ε f p l where ε 0 p l is the initial value of the equivalent plastic strain δ ε p l is an increment of the equivalent plastic strain and ε f p l is the equivalent plastic strain at failure accumulated over all increments in the analysis the failure is assumed to occur when the damage parameter d 1 3 2 3 1 parametric study effect of ε f p l the strain at failure ε f p l depends on the plastic strain rate ε p l and stress triaxiality η however the present study directly assumes the value of the equivalent plastic strain at fracture the ε f p l is treated as a parameter in the study and simulation results are compared with tensile coupon test results for the two extreme cases of elongations sl 1 and wsl 2 fig 11 a and 11 b shows the stress strain plot for varying equivalent plastic strain at failure along with the tests results from coupon sl 1 and wsl 2 respectively the comparison of simulation results with experimental observations estimates two extreme values of equivalent plastic strain at fracture ε f p l 0 6 and ε f p l 0 8 4 non linear fe analysis of mooring chains the section validates the material damage models and their parameters established by comparing numerical simulations on chain fe models with chain strength tests ct1 and ct2 non linear fe analysis of chain link model employs an assembly of two quarter links as shown in fig 12 the bottom link is fixed only in the y direction which allows it to translate in all other directions the model utilizes symmetry boundary condition in the xy plane and the load is applied by providing vertical displacement to the top link the material failure is assigned to the bottom link and top link has only elastic plastic material definition the model employs c3d8 eight node brick element with reduced integration in both the top and bottom links the refined mesh is provided to the bottom link with further refinement in the bend and crown regions to simulate ductile failure on the other hand the top link has a slightly coarser mesh to reduce computational time abaqus explicit analysis with element removal from the mesh is used to simulate ductile failure in the chain links the proof load and effect of friction study employs the same fe model however it does not consider any material degradation 4 1 proof loading proof loading is the application of direct load to a length of the chain after fabrication and heat treatment the mooring chains are mandatorily proof loaded after the manufacturing process or before supply the proof loadings specified in dnv os e302 2013 and api spec 2f 1997 are in the range 70 79 and 66 76 respectively of the minimum breaking load mbl of the chain links proof load application causes permanent elongation and residual stresses in the chain links shoup et al 1992a b and tipton and shoup 1992 the mooring chains used in the strength tests are proof loaded chains therefore it is vital to include the effect of proof loading in the numerical study as well the model is loaded to a proof load of 3416 kn and unloaded before the application of final loading as specified in dnv os e302 fig 13 a plots normalized load vs normalized displacement curve showing three stages of 1 proof load 2 unloading and 3 final loading 4 2 contact definition and effect of friction coefficient the two 1 4th links in the fe model are in contact with each other refer to fig 12 the load transfer mechanism between two links is modeled using the surface to surface contact with properties defined using the normal and tangential contact behavior in the study normal behavior is defined as hard contact which ensures unlimited contact pressure between the two contacting surfaces the tangential behavior is modeled using the penalty function method and friction coefficient μ the friction coefficient μ between two chain links normally varies in the range of 0 1 0 5 depending upon the material type surface finish and the medium in which the chain is deployed the friction coefficient is higher in air as compared to in seawater which acts as a lubricant between the two contacting surfaces the present study explored the effect of friction friction coefficient μ 0 0 0 5 on the load displacement behavior of the chain links as plotted in fig 13 b for μ 0 0 slip at the contact region is observed at a very early stage whereas for μ 0 2 the slipping is delayed leading to higher ultimate load prediction load displacement response does not shows any noticeable difference in for slightly higher values of friction coefficient μ 0 4 and μ 0 5 the load vs displacement behavior in the chain strength tests did not show any slip therefore for numerical simulations a slightly larger value of friction coefficient μ 0 4 is used in further study fig 13 c compares load vs inter link displacement ild for simulation with μ 0 4 with the ild of failed links and average link displacement the numerical simulation shows a slightly higher ultimate load however both the numerical simulation and strength tests show similar trend without any slip in the interlink contact region 4 3 chain failure simulation and comparison the section compares numerical simulations with the strength tests ct1 and ct2 in terms of failure mode maximum load and inter link displacement ild the failure modes for a porous metal plasticity pmp b ductile damage dd and c shear failure sf model are shown in fig 14 the maximum load and ductility for material degradation models and strength tests are summarized in table 8 the normalized ultimate load in numerical simulations and strength tests is approximately the same for all the material models however in terms of inter link displacement only dd and sf for ε d p l 0 6 model agree with the strength tests fig 15 a plots the normalized load vs normalized interlink displacement for numerical simulations with pmp dd and sf models and experimental average link displacement pmp gtn model simulation showed maximum inter link displacement ild and delayed failure refer to fig 15 a as compared to the other material damage models and strength tests moreover the failure pattern is more synonymous with the necking and tensile failure in the bend region as shown in fig 14 a the model over predicted ild due to its inability to capture damage under shear dominated loadings in shear loading the voids present in ductile material collapse into micro cracks which subsequently rotate and elongate in shear tvergaard 2009 whereas the pmp model cannot simulate the collapse of voids to micro cracks and rotation of cracks without including the void volume growth in shear to the total void volume fraction achouri et al 2013 although study suggests that pmp model may not be suitable for the present mode of failure it can be effectively used for the strength estimation of the chain links with reduced cross sections in the bend or straight sections which may cause the failure due to coalescence of voids the ductile damage dd model results are in good agreement with the strength tests in terms of failure mode ultimate load and maximum inter link displacement fig 14 b shows the failure pattern for dd model simulation which closely resembles the failure mode observed in the experimental tests ct1 and ct2 refer to 15 b slightly lower ild and higher maximum load before the final failure may have occurred due to differences in material properties in the bend regions as has already been observed in the coupon tests nonetheless the model is able to predict the nature of failure in the chain link within acceptable limits of errors the shear failure sf model with equivalent plastic strain at fracture ε f p l 0 6 is in good agreement with the strength tests in terms of failure mode maximum load and maximum ild refer figs 14 b and figure 15 c however the sf model is not suitable because it is difficult to obtain equivalent plastic strain at failure on which ild is highly dependent refer to table 8 however the model can be used to provide a lower and upper bound of maximum ilds for comparison with strength tests 5 summary and conclusions the present study explored the micromechanics and phenomenology based material models for strength estimation of the chain links the study utilized tensile coupon tests for the material damage parameter estimation and chain strength tests for the validation of material damage models non linear fe simulations with material damage effectively captured the failure modes failure load and inter link displacements as observed in the chain strength tests the results presented above support the following findings and conclusions 1 the material behavior varied slightly with location and the probable cause could be work hardening improper heat treatment or pre loading of chains the slight difference in material properties did not significantly affect the global behavior the chain strength tests ct 1 and ct 2 showed approximately similar ultimate strength deformations and were in good agreement with the numerical simulation results which employed material properties from wsl 2 the study also highlighted the importance of considering proof load in numerical simulations which caused permanent elongation and residual stresses in the chain links and delayed the large deformations in the post loading stage moreover the plastic deformations under large loads were mainly concentrated in the inter link contact regions 2 the pmp model could not capture damage under shear dominated loadings which led to the over prediction of failure load and inter link displacement however it can be used to model failure in the links with a reduced cross section in the straight section or bend region 3 although the shear failure model accurately predicted the failure mode failure load and inter link displacements it was highly dependent on equivalent plastic strain at fracture values which makes it less suitable to use however the shear failure models could still be used to provide upper and lower bounds values of ultimate strength and inter link displacement by treating equivalent plastic strain at fracture as a parameter 4 the ductile damage model predicted the failure mode accurately and provided conservative estimates for ultimate strength and inter link displacements the simple methodology of ductile damage parameter estimation and accurate failure mode modeling even for coarse mesh sizes makes it most suitable among the three models explored for modeling the ductile failure of chain links moreover the model can be easily used for different coupon test results by directly adjusting the ε d p l as the strain at which ultimate strength is achieved effective plastic displacement at failure u f p l which governs the softening path will have to be adjusted slightly using parametric analysis the critical damage d c may not need adjustments as it is usually around 0 2 for steel specimens 5 the present study successfully explored three failure models to model the ductile failure in the mooring chain links however a few areas need further investigation first a more comprehensive gtn model which also includes damage under shear will improve the simulation results second the ductile damage model will provide better simulation results if the variation of fracture strain vs stress triaxiality and critical damage vs plastic strain data is determined experimentally

22252,the hydrodynamic performance of a large scale set net in current was studied by means of numerical simulations based on finite element method and physical model test based on tauti s law the equilibrium configuration and the tension distribution of the set net was calculated and a series of physical model tests were conducted at flume tank the results showed the tension of the main mooring line was greater than other cables and was about 70 kn at the current velocity of 1 kn with the increasing current velocity the float rope of the set net was sinking and the sink rope was floating upward when the current velocity was less than 0 7 kn the set net can operate well accounting for the opened normally shape of its mesh the simulated results of the set net hydrodynamic performance were very close to the experimental results from the model test this study could reveal the tension of mooring line and the deformation of the set net for the design and application of the fishing gear in the future keywords set net finite element method model test numerical simulation 1 introduction large scale set net is a type of stationary fishing gear with trap nets and widely used in the coast of japan south korea and canada hiramoto 1994 1997 he and inoue 2010 as a large passive gear relying on target organisms to actively enter set net fisheries are considered to be energy efficient and environmentally friendly compared with the traditional trawl and can provide high quality catch allowing the fishermen to collect the fish alive without harming them which enables the operators to add value to the catch with more options suuronen et al 2012 wang and tsai 2014 set nets tend to also be labor saving due to ease of transport handling and hauling oitsuki 2004 kitazawa et al 2012 2018 due to the static nature of the gear they may also be used for the scientific sampling irawan et al 2018 with advancements in technology set nets are becoming increasingly selective allowing smaller fish to escape and preventing the unwanted catch of protected fish mammals and turtles lehtonen and suuronen 2004 suuronen et al 2006 königson et al 2013 in general the set net is an increasingly attractive fishing method due to its low energy consumption and minor impacts on the habitats and environment in the fishing ground as shown in fig 1 a set net system consists of a leader net a playground surrounded by net panels an ascending slope net and two box chamber nets the set net is usually set along the path of migrating fish in relatively shallow coastal waters where the current velocity is usually small about 1 kn fish individuals are channeled by the leader net and then guided into the playground eventually they follow the net contour to the final box chamber net many mooring lines from all sides anchor the net while various floats and weights help hold the net shape amidst currents he and inoue 2010 under large hydrodynamic loads in the currents and waves a set net can be deformed or damaged decreasing its effectiveness to combat this it is useful to conduct gear simulations and modifications common methods for studying hydrodynamic performance of fishing gear include model testing numerical simulation and full scale test at sea trial nguyen et al 2015 bi et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a 2019b wan et al 2002a used the finite element method to analyze the static response of fishing nets and ropes in a uniform current solving the nonlinear equilibrium equation of flexible gear structure and calculating equilibrium configuration and tension distribution of longlines plane nets and gillnets in a uniform flow the accuracy of the numerical method was then verified by flume tank experiments wan et al 2002b 2004 priour 2009 established a numerical model for the trawl design based on a similar finite element method for flexible netting structures in order to reduce the drag per swept area a numerical tool dedicated to the automatic

tank balash and sterling 2012 2014 balash et al 2015 wan et al 2019 designed a new antarctic krill trawl and studied its hydrodynamic performance by means of physical model test and numerical simulation in china the problems of fishery resource declines and environmental deterioration are very serious in coastal waters shen and heino 2014 the small scale set net which was called stow net was more popular the selectivity of the stow net should be improved and the bycatch should be reduced sun et al 2006 due to the increasing importance of set nets more empirical work is needed to develop high performance gears in this paper we designed a set net and evaluated its hydrodynamic performance in current using both numerical simulations and physical model tests in a flume tank the tension of mooring line and the deformation of the set net were explored and the simulated results were compared validated with the experimental results in order to assess the validity of numerical simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 numerical method 2 1 1 finite element dynamic analysis the standard finite element discretization of a structural system in a moving fluid environment results in the following system of differential equations tsukrov et al 2003 1 m a t ka t f t r t where a t is the vector of nodal displacements m is the mass matrix k is the global stiffness matrix r t is the equivalent nodal force vector due to gravity and buoyancy forces and f t is the equivalent nodal force vector due to relative fluid motion wave and current loads an overhead dot represents the derivative with respect to time consequently a t and a t are the vectors of nodal velocity and acceleration respectively the set net system consists of various kinds of nets and cables therefore it was necessary to choose suitable elements to simulate these structures the net is knotless and mesh grouping method was employed to reduce the computational effort the method consists of modeling a given number of actual meshes by a fictitious equivalent mesh the equivalent mesh has the same physical qualities as the actual meshes such as the projected area of the netting the specific mass the weight and so on li et al 2006 in this study we used a commercial program for finite element modeling and simulation pipe elements pipe59 in ansys are used to model the set net system a pipe element is a uniaxial element with tension compression torsion and bending capabilities and with member forces simulating ocean waves and currents cui et al 2013 the element has six degrees of freedom at each node translations in the nodal x y and z directions and rotations about the nodal x y and z axes the element loads include the hydrodynamic and buoyant effects of the water ansys 2009 2 1 2 the pipe element properties the net bars and cables in the set net system are modelled by the pipe element fig 2 d and d are outside diameter and inside diameter of the element respectively l is the length of the element we convert the element to the cable option by deleting the bending stiffness the element mass matrix and stiffness matrix are the same as for the elastic link element and can be calculated

hydrostatic effects buoyancy and hydrodynamic effects current loading hydrodynamic effects may occur because the relative motion between the set net and water a generalized morison s equation is used

physical model test 2 2 1 description of the set net model this work constituted the design and hydrodynamic performance study of a commercially realistic set net a 1 70 scale λ 70 ratio of the total scale of the set net model of the set net was manufactured based on tauti s law tauti 1934 with the small scale ratio λ 5 scale ratio of the net twine fig 3 mooring and floats system were shown in fig 3a and 3b showed nets and weights system 2 2 2 setup of the model test we conducted a series of physical model tests at the flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology japan 9 00 m length 2 20 m width 1 60 m height as shown in fig 4 the set net model was placed on a working platform to ensure a water depth of 343 mm tensions of main mooring lines e g left main mooring lines lmml right main mooring lines rmml and side mooring lines were measured through tension meters which were connected to the end of mooring lines the left was defined as the left side when facing the direction of incoming flow e g left side mooring line lsml right side mooring line rsml only the most upstream side mooring lines were measured the deformation of the set net was captured by a camera placed on the left side of the tank 3 results 3 1 determining the number of calculations in a current the set net deforms before eventually reaching an equilibrium state therefore we needed to determine when the system reaches stability with high precision for the simulation we chose a time step of 0 0005 s to ensure convergence several points were selected to calculate the displacement in x direction and the number of calculations was determined the points were the midpoints of the sink ropes of playground front net panel ascending slope net leader net and the second box chamber net rear net panel the result was shown in fig 5 at least 6000 calculation times the set net system can be stable 3 2 tension of main mooring line both measured values and simulated tension values were converted to the full scale fig 6 as expected the tension increased in a relatively linear manner with the increase of current velocity at the current velocity of 1 kn the tension of main mooring line was about 70 kn the tension of the lmml was slightly larger than that of the rmml for both mooring lines simulated values tracked closely to the measured values interestingly the simulated tension for both lines overestimated measured values for current velocities of 1kn and 1 5 kn 3 3 tension of side mooring line tensions of side mooring lines were comparatively smaller to the main mooring lines fig 7 with the increase of current velocity the tension of side mooring line increased with decreasing slope of the curve at a current velocity of 1 kn the tension of side mooring line was about 5 6 kn the experimental tension decreased when current velocity reached approximately 1 3 kn experimental tensions were lower than simulated values the tension of the lsml was slightly larger than that of the rsml the numerical simulation values were similar in magnitude and generally followed the experimental values particularly for low to moderate currents 3 4 shape and tension distribution of the set net shape of the set net at different current velocities was obtained by the camera and calculated by numerical simulation with the increase of current velocity the float rope began to depress sink and the sink rope moved upward fig 8 the deformation of the leader net was the largest followed by the playground and the box chamber net the shape of the set net obtained by numerical simulation was approximately similar to that obtained by the camera fig 9 the maximum displacement occurred in the sink rope of the leader net the displacement of the sink rope of the upstream net panel of playground was larger than the net panel of box chamber net floatation response of the sink rope of playground at the current velocity of 0 9 kn was larger than that at the current velocity of 0 7 kn tension distribution of the set net was calculated by numerical simulation fig 10 as can be seen the tension of main mooring line was the greatest with that of the lmml greater than the rmml the tension of the upstream main cable was greater than that of the downstream main cable the tension of the main cable in the playground was greater than that of the main cable in the box chamber net the tension of the net panel of the set net was smaller 4 discussion and conclusion in this paper we studied the hydrodynamic performance of a set net by means of flume tank test and numerical simulation the physical model of the set net was manufactured based on tauti s law and numerical model was established by using the finite element method the accuracy of the numerical simulation was verified by comparing with the experimental results the use of computer based numerical modeling and simulation is encouraged during the early stages of design for validating design concepts as a fast and convenient method nguyen et al 2015 while flume tank and other experimental applications are critical for visualizing over net performance simulation allows measurement of material properties that cannot be realistically obtained from an experimental model test encouragingly the tensions of mooring lines from numerical simulation were close to those from physical model test therefore the accuracy of numerical simulation and the appropriateness of our methods were confirmed the set net consists of a large number of net bars and cables it is a flexible structure system and can be deformed in a moving fluid environment to our best knowledge both link element and pipe element can be used to simulate the hydrodynamic performance of flexible structure in current cui et al 2013 cheng et al 2018 the pipe element was selected in this paper to establish the numerical model of the set net this element can be used for both rigid frames and flexible bars without bending stiffness under current and wave conditions ansys 2009 as mentioned this approach allows the user to gain a more holistic understanding of what contributes to net deformation moreover a simulation framework for hydrodynamic performance allows extensions to be evaluated e g waves complex currents future work should be done to explore these types of dynamics as fishing gear may be exposed to a variety of harsh conditions similarly these methods can be generalized to simulate other fishing structures including net cages cui et al 2013 and trawls however the discrepancies between the simulated results and experimental results might be caused by the differences between the real net wire and the pipe element moreover both the reduction of velocity because of passing through the net panel and the hydrodynamic force of floats were not taken into consideration in this study therefore the numerical simulation may overestimate the experimental force of the set net in this study because there was an obvious reduction in flow velocity downstream from the plane net bi et al 2013 2014 in addition there were also other sources bringing errors e g the system might have been tilted or the measurement error of instruments we may devote ourselves to reducing errors and improving the accuracy of simulation in the future the tension of mooring lines and the shape of fishing gear are important because large drag and deformation may increase cost of operation gear damage or loss and lead to low catch rates wan et al 2019 notably tensions of both the lmml and lsml were slightly larger than that of the rmml and rsml we hypothesize this result was due to the fact that the leader net was connected to the left side of the set net which may have increased the drag force of the left side when current velocity was equal to 1 kn the tension of main mooring line was about 70 kn comparable or exceeding a value which would be experienced at sea hu et al 2001 at the same current velocity the tension of side mooring line was about 5 6 kn far less than the tension of the main mooring line the tension of the experiment in the range of 0 9 kn to 1 3 kn was decreased with the velocity because the system might have been tilted collectively our results provide scientific support for the design and manufacture of a full scale set net the shapes of the set net at different current velocities were obtained by both camera and numerical simulation with the increase of current velocity the float rope of the set net was sinking and the sink rope was floating upward the deformation of the leader net was the largest followed by the playground and the deformation of the box chamber net was the smallest combined with the results of numerical simulation and model test the set net was suggested to be placed in the sea area where the current velocity should not exceed 0 7 kn if the current velocity was larger the floats and weights system of the leader net and the playground should be increased in conclusion numerical methods were verified by comparing simulated results with experimental results following this proof of concept future work should consider complex gear interactions including altered flow direction and net performance under wave conditions with the increase of current velocity the tension of main mooring line of the set net increased at the current velocity of 1 kn the tension of the main mooring line of the set net was about 70 kn the float rope of the set net was sinking and the sink rope was floating upward when the current velocity increased when the current velocity exceeded 0 7 kn the deformation of the set net increased obviously so the set net is suitable for sea areas with current velocity not exceeding 0 7 kn the set net can operate well with the current velocity less than 0 7 kn the large scale set net has the potential to be most advanced fishing technology in the future because it can mitigate the impacts of fishing operations on coastal and marine environments this study could provide scientific reference for design of the fishing gear and application of the set net in china in the future declaration

22252,the hydrodynamic performance of a large scale set net in current was studied by means of numerical simulations based on finite element method and physical model test based on tauti s law the equilibrium configuration and the tension distribution of the set net was calculated and a series of physical model tests were conducted at flume tank the results showed the tension of the main mooring line was greater than other cables and was about 70 kn at the current velocity of 1 kn with the increasing current velocity the float rope of the set net was sinking and the sink rope was floating upward when the current velocity was less than 0 7 kn the set net can operate well accounting for the opened normally shape of its mesh the simulated results of the set net hydrodynamic performance were very close to the experimental results from the model test this study could reveal the tension of mooring line and the deformation of the set net for the design and application of the fishing gear in the future keywords set net finite element method model test numerical simulation 1 introduction large scale set net is a type of stationary fishing gear with trap nets and widely used in the coast of japan south korea and canada hiramoto 1994 1997 he and inoue 2010 as a large passive gear relying on target organisms to actively enter set net fisheries are considered to be energy efficient and environmentally friendly compared with the traditional trawl and can provide high quality catch allowing the fishermen to collect the fish alive without harming them which enables the operators to add value to the catch with more options suuronen et al 2012 wang and tsai 2014 set nets tend to also be labor saving due to ease of transport handling and hauling oitsuki 2004 kitazawa et al 2012 2018 due to the static nature of the gear they may also be used for the scientific sampling irawan et al 2018 with advancements in technology set nets are becoming increasingly selective allowing smaller fish to escape and preventing the unwanted catch of protected fish mammals and turtles lehtonen and suuronen 2004 suuronen et al 2006 königson et al 2013 in general the set net is an increasingly attractive fishing method due to its low energy consumption and minor impacts on the habitats and environment in the fishing ground as shown in fig 1 a set net system consists of a leader net a playground surrounded by net panels an ascending slope net and two box chamber nets the set net is usually set along the path of migrating fish in relatively shallow coastal waters where the current velocity is usually small about 1 kn fish individuals are channeled by the leader net and then guided into the playground eventually they follow the net contour to the final box chamber net many mooring lines from all sides anchor the net while various floats and weights help hold the net shape amidst currents he and inoue 2010 under large hydrodynamic loads in the currents and waves a set net can be deformed or damaged decreasing its effectiveness to combat this it is useful to conduct gear simulations and modifications common methods for studying hydrodynamic performance of fishing gear include model testing numerical simulation and full scale test at sea trial nguyen et al 2015 bi et al 2017 zhao et al 2019a 2019b wan et al 2002a used the finite element method to analyze the static response of fishing nets and ropes in a uniform current solving the nonlinear equilibrium equation of flexible gear structure and calculating equilibrium configuration and tension distribution of longlines plane nets and gillnets in a uniform flow the accuracy of the numerical method was then verified by flume tank experiments wan et al 2002b 2004 priour 2009 established a numerical model for the trawl design based on a similar finite element method for flexible netting structures in order to reduce the drag per swept area a numerical tool dedicated to the automatic optimisation has been developed priour and khaled 2009 the prawn trawl innovations in order to reduce trawl system drag and improve the energy efficiency were investigated based on model test in flume tank balash and sterling 2012 2014 balash et al 2015 wan et al 2019 designed a new antarctic krill trawl and studied its hydrodynamic performance by means of physical model test and numerical simulation in china the problems of fishery resource declines and environmental deterioration are very serious in coastal waters shen and heino 2014 the small scale set net which was called stow net was more popular the selectivity of the stow net should be improved and the bycatch should be reduced sun et al 2006 due to the increasing importance of set nets more empirical work is needed to develop high performance gears in this paper we designed a set net and evaluated its hydrodynamic performance in current using both numerical simulations and physical model tests in a flume tank the tension of mooring line and the deformation of the set net were explored and the simulated results were compared validated with the experimental results in order to assess the validity of numerical simulation 2 materials and methods 2 1 numerical method 2 1 1 finite element dynamic analysis the standard finite element discretization of a structural system in a moving fluid environment results in the following system of differential equations tsukrov et al 2003 1 m a t ka t f t r t where a t is the vector of nodal displacements m is the mass matrix k is the global stiffness matrix r t is the equivalent nodal force vector due to gravity and buoyancy forces and f t is the equivalent nodal force vector due to relative fluid motion wave and current loads an overhead dot represents the derivative with respect to time consequently a t and a t are the vectors of nodal velocity and acceleration respectively the set net system consists of various kinds of nets and cables therefore it was necessary to choose suitable elements to simulate these structures the net is knotless and mesh grouping method was employed to reduce the computational effort the method consists of modeling a given number of actual meshes by a fictitious equivalent mesh the equivalent mesh has the same physical qualities as the actual meshes such as the projected area of the netting the specific mass the weight and so on li et al 2006 in this study we used a commercial program for finite element modeling and simulation pipe elements pipe59 in ansys are used to model the set net system a pipe element is a uniaxial element with tension compression torsion and bending capabilities and with member forces simulating ocean waves and currents cui et al 2013 the element has six degrees of freedom at each node translations in the nodal x y and z directions and rotations about the nodal x y and z axes the element loads include the hydrodynamic and buoyant effects of the water ansys 2009 2 1 2 the pipe element properties the net bars and cables in the set net system are modelled by the pipe element fig 2 d and d are outside diameter and inside diameter of the element respectively l is the length of the element we convert the element to the cable option by deleting the bending stiffness the element mass matrix and stiffness matrix are the same as for the elastic link element and can be calculated

hydrostatic effects buoyancy and hydrodynamic effects current loading hydrodynamic effects may occur because the relative motion between the set net and water a generalized morison s equation is used to compute a distributed load on the elements to account for the hydrodynamic force f li et al 2006 4 f 1 2 c d ρ w d l u n u n 1 4 c m ρ w π d 2 l v n 1 2 c t ρ w d l u t u t the equivalent nodal

physical model test 2 2 1 description of the set net model this work constituted the design and hydrodynamic performance study of a commercially realistic set net a 1 70 scale λ 70 ratio of the total scale of the set net model of the set net was manufactured based on tauti s law tauti 1934 with the small scale ratio λ 5 scale ratio of the net twine fig 3 mooring and floats system were shown in fig 3a and 3b showed nets and weights system 2 2 2 setup of the model test we conducted a series of physical model tests at the flume tank at tokyo university of marine science and technology japan 9 00 m length 2 20 m width 1 60 m height as shown in fig 4 the set net model was placed on a working platform to ensure a water depth of 343 mm tensions of main mooring lines e g left main mooring lines lmml right main mooring lines rmml and side mooring lines were measured through tension meters which were connected to the end of mooring lines the left was defined as the left side when facing the direction of incoming flow e g left side mooring line lsml right side mooring line rsml only the most upstream side mooring lines were measured the deformation of the set net was captured by a camera placed on the left side of the tank 3 results 3 1 determining the number of calculations in a current the set net deforms before eventually reaching an equilibrium state therefore we needed to determine when the system reaches stability with high precision for the simulation we chose a time step of 0 0005 s to ensure convergence several points were selected to calculate the displacement in x direction and the number of calculations was determined the points were the midpoints of the sink ropes of playground front net panel ascending slope net leader net and the second box chamber net rear net panel the result was shown in fig 5 at least 6000 calculation times the set net system can be stable 3 2 tension of main mooring line both measured values and simulated tension values were converted to the full scale fig 6 as expected the tension increased in a relatively linear manner with the increase of current velocity at the current velocity of 1 kn the tension of main mooring line was about 70 kn the tension of the lmml was slightly larger than that of the rmml for both mooring lines simulated values tracked closely to the measured values interestingly the simulated tension for both lines overestimated measured values for current velocities of 1kn and 1 5 kn 3 3 tension of side mooring line tensions of side mooring lines were comparatively smaller to the main mooring lines fig 7 with the increase of current velocity the tension of side mooring line increased with decreasing slope of the curve at a current velocity of 1 kn the tension of side mooring line was about 5 6 kn the experimental tension decreased when current velocity reached approximately 1 3 kn experimental tensions were lower than simulated values the tension of the lsml was slightly larger than that of the rsml the numerical simulation values were similar in magnitude and generally followed the experimental values particularly for low to moderate currents 3 4 shape and tension distribution of the set net shape of the set net at different current velocities was obtained by the camera and calculated by numerical simulation with the increase of current velocity the float rope began to depress sink and the sink rope moved upward fig 8 the deformation of the leader net was the largest followed by the playground and the box chamber net the shape of the set net obtained by numerical simulation was approximately similar to that obtained by the camera fig 9 the maximum displacement occurred in the sink rope of the leader net the displacement of the sink rope of the upstream net panel of playground was larger than the net panel of box chamber net floatation response of the sink rope of playground at the current velocity of 0 9 kn was larger than that at the current velocity of 0 7 kn tension distribution of the set net was calculated by numerical simulation fig 10 as can be seen the tension of main mooring line was the greatest with that of the lmml greater than the rmml the tension of the upstream main cable was greater than that of the downstream main cable the tension of the main cable in the playground was greater than that of the main cable in the box chamber net the tension of the net panel of the set net was smaller 4 discussion and conclusion in this paper we studied the hydrodynamic performance of a set net by means of flume tank test and numerical simulation the physical model of the set net was manufactured based on tauti s law and numerical model was established by using the finite element method the accuracy of the numerical simulation was verified by comparing with the experimental results the use of computer based numerical modeling and simulation is encouraged during the early stages of design for validating design concepts as a fast and convenient method nguyen et al 2015 while flume tank and other experimental applications are critical for visualizing over net performance simulation allows measurement of material properties that cannot be realistically obtained from an experimental model test encouragingly the tensions of mooring lines from numerical simulation were close to those from physical model test therefore the accuracy of numerical simulation and the appropriateness of our methods were confirmed the set net consists of a large number of net bars and cables it is a flexible structure system and can be deformed in a moving fluid environment to our best knowledge both link element and pipe element can be used to simulate the hydrodynamic performance of flexible structure in current cui et al 2013 cheng et al 2018 the pipe element was selected in this paper to establish the numerical model of the set net this element can be used for both rigid frames and flexible bars without bending stiffness under current and wave conditions ansys 2009 as mentioned this approach allows the user to gain a more holistic understanding of what contributes to net deformation moreover a simulation framework for hydrodynamic performance allows extensions to be evaluated e g waves complex currents future work should be done to explore these types of dynamics as fishing gear may be exposed to a variety of harsh conditions similarly these methods can be generalized to simulate other fishing structures including net cages cui et al 2013 and trawls however the discrepancies between the simulated results and experimental results might be caused by the differences between the real net wire and the pipe element moreover both the reduction of velocity because of passing through the net panel and the hydrodynamic force of floats were not taken into consideration in this study therefore the numerical simulation may overestimate the experimental force of the set net in this study because there was an obvious reduction in flow velocity downstream from the plane net bi et al 2013 2014 in addition there were also other sources bringing errors e g the system might have been tilted or the measurement error of instruments we may devote ourselves to reducing errors and improving the accuracy of simulation in the future the tension of mooring lines and the shape of fishing gear are important because large drag and deformation may increase cost of operation gear damage or loss and lead to low catch rates wan et al 2019 notably tensions of both the lmml and lsml were slightly larger than that of the rmml and rsml we hypothesize this result was due to the fact that the leader net was connected to the left side of the set net which may have increased the drag force of the

22253,shallow sea especially the reflection and absorption of seabed have significant influence on the vibroacoustic radiation and propagation properties of underwater structures an fem bem algorithm based on modal summation is adopted to calculate the modal source strengths and modal coordinate responses of a slender cylindrical shell in which the green function of sound field is obtained via virtual source chain model using the modal source strengths and modal coordinate responses obtained the near far field radiated sound pressure level spl of the slender cylindrical shell in uniform shallow sea is calculated adopting the 3 parameter seabed model by comparing the radiated power of all modal shapes the modes with greater contribution can be acquired results show that seabed parameters have influence on the far field acoustic radiation of the slender cylindrical shell mainly on the modal shapes with large grazing angle waves due to larger bottom loss while the small grazing angle waves are less susceptible to the seabed and propagate much farther keywords fem bem 3 parameter seabed model slender cylindrical shell acoustic radiation sound propagation 1 introduction slender cylindrical shell is the typical structure of underwater vehicle of which the underwater vibration and acoustic radiation properties have long attracted global attention in shallow sea the vibroacoustic radiation of underwater structure is susceptible to the additional influences of the reflection and absorption of seabed presently the fluid structure interactive vibration and acoustic radiation of lower bands can be computed using fem bem algorithm zhou and joseph 2005 adopting the helmholtz integral equation nashua everstine and henderson 1990 program can calculate the problem of lower bands yet with the normal derivative of the green function obtained in precedent which makes it impossible to couple the program with the bounded underwater acoustic environment like shallow sea the simple source integration adopted by l h chen chen and schweikert 1963 is based on single layer potential theory which avoids the calculation of the normal derivative of the green function therefore the decoupling algorithm can be applied to complicated underwater acoustic environment however it cannot solve the irregular frequency problem schenck 1967 induced by boundary element discretization in order to solve the problem zou et al zou et al 2018a proposed a closed virtual impedance surface method cvis which introduced a closed virtual surface into the decoupling algorithm to absorb the vibroacoustic energy so that the irregular frequencies are eliminated in uniform shallow sea the vibroacoustic radiation of the structure is strongly influenced by the reflection and absorption of seabed in ref zou and zhao 2004 the influence of the rigid seabed boundary condition on the vibroacoustic radiation of a cylinder island is considered but the boundary condition of real seabed is far more complicated than stiff seabed in the case of large grazing angle of near field the bottom power reflection coefficient is approximately constant liu and lei 2010 therefore zou et al zou et al 2013 2018b jiang et al 2018 employed the image solution to calculate the green function in which the bottom power reflection coefficient is considered as a constant therefore the near field structural acoustic radiation problem in shallow sea can be solved chen hongyang et al chen et al 2014 further considered the bottom power reflection coefficient as a function of the density and real sound velocity of seabed and proposed a numerical solution to the structural acoustic radiation and propagation problem in bounded waters yet the absorption coefficient of the seabed is neglected zhou si tong et al zhou et al 2018 reconstructed the radiated field of a complex vibrating structure in shallow sea employing normal mode method and wave superposition method in which the depth of the sea is 150 m and results show that the error of the near field reconstruction is small while that of the far field of which the distance larger than 800 m is not acceptable actually as a function of seabed density sound speed and decay coefficient the bottom reflection coefficient v varies with the grazing angle liu and lei 2010 therefore for the near field acoustic radiation prediction it is quite acceptable to treat the coefficient v as a constant or a function of bottom density and sound speed however for observation spot located far from the vibrating structure the decay coefficient of the seabed sediment must be considered although the far field acoustic radiation can be obtained by fem the calculation is really time consuming in this paper an algorithm solving near far field acoustic radiation of underwater structures in uniform shallow sea is proposed in which the reflection coefficient v is programmed using the three parameter sea bottom model wang and shang 2013 with the density sound velocity and decay coefficient of seabed considered this method is verified by comparing the results with those obtained using the algorithm proposed in ref zou et al 2013 the underwater vibration and near far field acoustic radiation of a slender cylindrical shell scs is calculated and the influence of seabed properties is discussed 2 acoustic

slender cylindrical shell in uniform shallow sea as is shown in fig 1 the depth of the sea is 50 m and the sound velocity of sea water is 1500 m s and the scs is displaced at the depth of 25 m the geometry of the scs are in accordance with ref zhou and joseph 2005 and extended into 5 cabins axially the dimensions of the single cabin are as follows 1905 mm in length 1270 mm in diameter and 7 rings with 50 8 mm in height are displaced axially the thickness of the shell rings and bulkheads can be seen from fig 2 a the elasticity modulus of the material is 2 06 1011 n m2 and the poisson ratio 0 3 the density 7850 kg m3 damping ratio 0 01 the finite element model of the scs is shown in fig 2b the size of the element is 4 elements between nearby rings 24 elements circumferentially in 180 the bands of excitation is 30 1000 hz with the step of 2 5 hz and the amplitude of 4 454n 1lb the positions of action are the bottom of the central ring of the left cabin noted by case f1 and the middle cabin noted by case f2 in the decoupling computation the dry modes are truncated at the quadruple of acting frequencies three series of parameters of typical seabed of hamilton continental shelf sediments zhang et al 2015 shown in table 1 are selected for the analysis of which the curves of bottom reflection coefficients are drawn in fig 3 each curve with a counterpart of zero sediment decay coefficient it can be seen that for near field observation spots where the grazing angle of incident sound rays are large the reflection coefficients are approximately constant while for far field spots where the grazing angle are small the reflection coefficients vary significantly with the grazing angle meanwhile the sediment decay coefficient has a strong influence on the bottom reflection coefficient at small grazing angle therefore in order to calculate the far field acoustic radiation of underwater structures in uniform shallow sea the sediment decay coefficient must be taken into consideration along with seabed density and sound speed the observation spot located at the depth of 25m and 50m away from the center of the scs at the direction of 90 the frequency response of the radiated spl at this spot is obtained using zou s method zou et al 2013 and the algorithm proposed in this paper respectively the seabed density sound speed and decay coefficient are 1 77 g cm3 1623 m s and 0 415db λ in zou s method the bottom reflection coefficient is considered a constant which is 0 29 for the calculation the comparison between the two methods is depicted in fig 4 a good agreement shows that the algorithm proposed in this paper is precise for the acting frequency of 400 hz the radiated spl of a linear sound field at the direction of 90 and depth of 25m calculated by zou s method zou et al 2013 and the algorithm proposed in this paper is shown in fig 5 it is shown that the curves coincide very well at the near field within 100m therefore the 3 parameter bottom model adopted in the proposed algorithm is valid the curves begin to diverse beyond this range which means the changes of bottom reflection coefficient resulted from seabed density sound speed and sediment decay coefficient must be taken into consideration 3 2 analyses of mean radiated spl as is shown in fig 1 a sound field in cylindrical shell shape is sketched with 300 m in radius and the scs is located at the centre of the field the receiving spots are equally displaced vertically and circumferentially and the intervals are 1 m and 2 respectively the radiated sound pressure of all spots in vertical are calculated and averaged in each directions therefore the mean radiated sound pressure in each direction is obtained and the averaged spl in each direction at all excitation frequencies can be calculated for the cases of f1 and f2 consider the influence of all three seabed parameters listed in tab 1 according to fig 2b the positive x direction is taken as 0 and the positive y direction as 90 the radiated frequency responses of spl in the direction range 0 180 the portside of the scs are calculated the results are shown in fig 6 in which the horizontal and vertical axes represent direction and frequency respectively it can be observed from the results that 1 the smaller the sound velocity of seabed the lower the average radiated spl the reason is that when the sound velocity of seabed is higher than that of water lower sound velocity of seabed results in smaller ϕ therefore sound waves in a larger angle range of ϕ π 2 will be sufficiently absorbed by seabed meanwhile for smaller ϕ the reflection coefficient is smaller and more energy carried by radiated waves are absorbed by seabed and contribute less to far field 2 the complexity of the directivity of radiated spl increases with the ascending of activating frequency the reason is that the wavelength of sound wave is shorter at higher frequency and sound radiation will be easier for the same mode 3 3 discussion on acoustic radiation and propagation at typical excitation frequency this part deals with the acoustic radiation in near field and propagation properties at typical direction in far field of the structure acted at 400 hz the influences of typical seabed parameters listed in tab 1 are discussed for case f1 and f2 firstly the near field radiated spl at the depth of 25 m with the radius of 150 m and the centre of the field is the geometric centre of the scs the results are shown in fig 7 it can be observed that 1 when the excitation force is acted in the plane of x 0 shown in fig 2b the radiated field is symmetric about the x 0 plane shown in fig 3d f when the force is acted in the left cabin the radiated field is asymmetric although to some degree similar to that of case f2 2 the radiated spl of case f2 and f1 are of similar level but that of case f1 is stronger at the main peak of direction of 110 3 seabed parameters have little influence on the near field spl for the excitation frequency of 400 hz further investigation focuses on the contribution of the dry modal shapes of scs on the acoustic radiation and propagation the radiated power is calculated of the 1st 1070th dry modal shapes of the 6 cases shown in fig 7 and the natural frequency of the 1070th dry mode is 1600 9 hz almost quadruple of the excitation frequency comparison shows that for case f1 the main contributors are the 125th 131th and 133rd modal shapes while for case f2 only the 131th mode the shapes of the 3 dry modes are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the shapes of the 131th dry modes are symmetric about the x 0 plane while that of the 125th and 133rd is anti symmetric which results in the asymmetry of the radiated field of case f1 the contribution of dry mode 125 131 133 for case f1 to the near field radiated spl are calculated and that of dry mode 131 also done for case f2 the results for the high sound speed seabed c bed 1836 m s is shown in fig 9 it can be concluded that spl induced by the main contributing modal shapes with highest radiating power is quite similar to that induced by all modes in lower bands the far field acoustic radiation and propagation at the direction of 110 of the scs is calculated for case f1 and f2 for the 3 typical parameters of seabed shown in tab 1 the results are shown in figs 10 and 11 it is shown that 1 higher sound speed of seabed results in larger reflection coefficient and the interference of the radiated field is more complicated also the far field spl is higher 2 the far field spl of case f2 is a bit lower than case f1 for case f1 the influence of seabed on near field radiation and far field propagation is explored on the 131th dry modal shapes at the directions of 110 and 0 the results are listed in figs 12 and 13 in which the near field distribution within 100 m are exhibited on the left and the far field in the range 100 m 2000 m on the right comparison among figs 11 13 shows that the 131th dry modal shape is the main contributor for the radiation and propagation at the direction of 110 but contributes almost nothing to the direction of 0 it can be seen from the left pictures in figs 12 and 13 that the radiated sound waves by the 131th dry mode mainly consists of the smaller grazing angle part at the direction of 110 and of larger grazing angle part at the direction of 0 the mechanism is analyzed as follows it can be calculated according to eq 5 that the critical grazing angle ϕ for seabed 1 2 3 in tab 1 are 9 3 22 45 and 35 22 at the direction of 110 the radiated sound wave mainly consists of the small grazing angle part and mostly totally reflected by seabed therefore propagates easily to far field but at the direction of 0 it mainly consists of the large grazing angle part and mostly absorbed by seabed therefore difficult for far field propagation comparison among fig 13a c shows that even though the radiated field of 131th dry mode is susceptible to the absorption of seabed and contributes less to far field but for the seabed with higher sound speed the critical angle of reflection ϕ is larger and to some degree maybe a contributor to far field propagation 4 conclusions in this paper the fem bem revised by cvis method combined with image field green function considering the three parameter sea bottom model is proposed to calculate structural vibration and acoustic radiation and propagation in uniform shallow sea by comparing the resulting radiated spl calculated using zou s method zou et al 2013 and the algorithm adopting 3 parameter bottom model the algorithm is verified a slender cylindrical shell acted vertically on ring is calculated for the near field acoustic radiation and far field acoustic propagation at typical direction radiated power of each dry modal shape has been calculated and compared of which the largest contributing modes are extracted and the contribution to near field radiation and far field propagation are analyzed conclusions are listed as follows 1 the far field radiated spl of scs is lower when submerged in shallow sea if the sound speed of the seabed is smaller while that will be higher with the sound speed of seabed larger also the interference of radiated field is more complicated that is due to the increase of critical grazing angle with the ascending of seabed sound speed which allows radiated sound in larger angle range totally reflected by seabed and propagated to far field 2 spl induced by the main contributing modes with highest radiating power approximates to that induced by all modes in lower bands the modes radiating small grazing angle sound waves are the main contributor to far field radiation and propagation because of the less influence of seabed which deserves greater emphasis for noise and vibration control declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have

22253,shallow sea especially the reflection and absorption of seabed have significant influence on the vibroacoustic radiation and propagation properties of underwater structures an fem bem algorithm based on modal summation is adopted to calculate the modal source strengths and modal coordinate responses of a slender cylindrical shell in which the green function of sound field is obtained via virtual source chain model using the modal source strengths and modal coordinate responses obtained the near far field radiated sound pressure level spl of the slender cylindrical shell in uniform shallow sea is calculated adopting the 3 parameter seabed model by comparing the radiated power of all modal shapes the modes with greater contribution can be acquired results show that seabed parameters have influence on the far field acoustic radiation of the slender cylindrical shell mainly on the modal shapes with large grazing angle waves due to larger bottom loss while the small grazing angle waves are less susceptible to the seabed and propagate much farther keywords fem bem 3 parameter seabed model slender cylindrical shell acoustic radiation sound propagation 1 introduction slender cylindrical shell is the typical structure of underwater vehicle of which the underwater vibration and acoustic radiation properties have long attracted global attention in shallow sea the vibroacoustic radiation of underwater structure is susceptible to the additional influences of the reflection and absorption of seabed presently the fluid structure interactive vibration and acoustic radiation of lower bands can be computed using fem bem algorithm zhou and joseph 2005 adopting the helmholtz integral equation nashua everstine and henderson 1990 program can calculate the problem of lower bands yet with the normal derivative of the green function obtained in precedent which makes it impossible to couple the program with the bounded underwater acoustic environment like shallow sea the simple source integration adopted by l h chen chen and schweikert 1963 is based on single layer potential theory which avoids the calculation of the normal derivative of the green function therefore the decoupling algorithm can be applied to complicated underwater acoustic environment however it cannot solve the irregular frequency problem schenck 1967 induced by boundary element discretization in order to solve the problem zou et al zou et al 2018a proposed a closed virtual impedance surface method cvis which introduced a closed virtual surface into the decoupling algorithm to absorb the vibroacoustic energy so that the irregular frequencies are eliminated in uniform shallow sea the vibroacoustic radiation of the structure is strongly influenced by the reflection and absorption of seabed in ref zou and zhao 2004 the influence of the rigid seabed boundary condition on the vibroacoustic radiation of a cylinder island is considered but the boundary condition of real seabed is far more complicated than stiff seabed in the case of large grazing angle of near field the bottom power reflection coefficient is approximately constant liu and lei 2010 therefore zou et al zou et al 2013 2018b jiang et al 2018 employed the image solution to calculate the green function in which the bottom power reflection coefficient is considered as a constant therefore the near field structural acoustic radiation problem in shallow sea can be solved chen hongyang et al chen et al 2014 further considered the bottom power reflection coefficient as a function of the density and real sound velocity of seabed and proposed a numerical solution to the structural acoustic radiation and propagation problem in bounded waters yet the absorption coefficient of the seabed is neglected zhou si tong et al zhou et al 2018 reconstructed the radiated field of a complex vibrating structure in shallow sea employing normal mode method and wave superposition method in which the depth of the sea is 150 m and results show that the error of the near field reconstruction is small while that of the far field of which the distance larger than 800 m is not acceptable actually as a function of seabed density sound speed and decay coefficient the bottom reflection coefficient v varies with the grazing angle liu and lei 2010 therefore for the near field acoustic radiation prediction it is quite acceptable to treat the coefficient v as a constant or a function of bottom density and sound speed however for observation spot located far from the vibrating structure the decay coefficient of the seabed sediment must be considered although the far field acoustic radiation can be obtained by fem the calculation is really time consuming in this paper an algorithm solving near far field acoustic radiation of underwater structures in uniform shallow sea is proposed in which the reflection coefficient v is programmed using the three parameter sea bottom model wang and shang 2013 with the density sound velocity and decay coefficient of seabed considered this method is verified by comparing the results with those obtained using the algorithm proposed in ref zou et al 2013 the underwater vibration and near far field acoustic radiation of a slender cylindrical shell scs is calculated and the influence of seabed properties is discussed 2 acoustic

slender cylindrical shell in uniform shallow sea as is shown in fig 1 the depth of the sea is 50 m and the sound velocity of sea water is 1500 m s and the scs is displaced at the depth of 25 m the geometry of the scs are in accordance with ref zhou and joseph 2005 and extended into 5 cabins axially the dimensions of the single cabin are as follows 1905 mm in length 1270 mm in diameter and 7 rings with 50 8 mm in height are displaced axially the thickness of the shell rings and bulkheads can be seen from fig 2 a the elasticity modulus of the material is 2 06 1011 n m2 and the poisson ratio 0 3 the density 7850 kg m3 damping ratio 0 01 the finite element model of the scs is shown in fig 2b the size of the element is 4 elements between nearby rings 24 elements circumferentially in 180 the bands of excitation is 30 1000 hz with the step of 2 5 hz and the amplitude of 4 454n 1lb the positions of action are the bottom of the central ring of the left cabin noted by case f1 and the middle cabin noted by case f2 in the decoupling computation the dry modes are truncated at the quadruple of acting frequencies three series of parameters of typical seabed of hamilton continental shelf sediments zhang et al 2015 shown in table 1 are selected for the analysis of which the curves of bottom reflection coefficients are drawn in fig 3 each curve with a counterpart of zero sediment decay coefficient it can be seen that for near field observation spots where the grazing angle of incident sound rays are large the reflection coefficients are approximately constant while for far field spots where the grazing angle are small the reflection coefficients vary significantly with the grazing angle meanwhile the sediment decay coefficient has a strong influence on the bottom reflection coefficient at small grazing angle therefore in order to calculate the far field acoustic radiation of underwater structures in uniform shallow sea the sediment decay coefficient must be taken into consideration along with seabed density and sound speed the observation spot located at the depth of 25m and 50m away from the center of the scs at the direction of 90 the frequency response of the radiated spl at this spot is obtained using zou s method zou et al 2013 and the algorithm proposed in this paper respectively the seabed density sound speed and decay coefficient are 1 77 g cm3 1623 m s and 0 415db λ in zou s method the bottom reflection coefficient is considered a constant which is 0 29 for the calculation the comparison between the two methods is depicted in fig 4 a good agreement shows that the algorithm proposed in this paper is precise for the acting frequency of 400 hz the radiated spl of a linear sound field at the direction of 90 and depth of 25m calculated by zou s method zou et al 2013 and the algorithm proposed in this paper is shown in fig 5 it is shown that the curves coincide very well at the near field within 100m therefore the 3 parameter bottom model adopted in the proposed algorithm is valid the curves begin to diverse beyond this range which means the changes of bottom reflection coefficient resulted from seabed density sound speed and sediment decay coefficient must be taken into consideration 3 2 analyses of mean radiated spl as is shown in fig 1 a sound field in cylindrical shell shape is sketched with 300 m in radius and the scs is located at the centre of the field the receiving spots are equally displaced vertically and circumferentially and the intervals are 1 m and 2 respectively the radiated sound pressure of all spots in vertical are calculated and averaged in each directions therefore the mean radiated sound pressure in each direction is obtained and the averaged spl in each direction at all excitation frequencies can be calculated for the cases of f1 and f2 consider the influence of all three seabed parameters listed in tab 1 according to fig 2b the positive x direction is taken as 0 and the positive y direction as 90 the radiated frequency responses of spl in the direction range 0 180 the portside of the scs are calculated the results are shown in fig 6 in which the horizontal and vertical axes represent direction and frequency respectively it can be observed from the results that 1 the smaller the sound velocity of seabed the lower the average radiated spl the reason is that when the sound velocity of seabed is higher than that of water lower sound velocity of seabed results in smaller ϕ therefore sound waves in a larger angle range of ϕ π 2 will be sufficiently absorbed by seabed meanwhile for smaller ϕ the reflection coefficient is smaller and more energy carried by radiated waves are absorbed by seabed and contribute less to far field 2 the complexity of the directivity of radiated spl increases with the ascending of activating frequency the reason is that the wavelength of sound wave is shorter at higher frequency and sound radiation will be easier for the same mode 3 3 discussion on acoustic radiation and propagation at typical excitation frequency this part deals with the acoustic radiation in near field and propagation properties at typical direction in far field of the structure acted at 400 hz the influences of typical seabed parameters listed in tab 1 are discussed for case f1 and f2 firstly the near field radiated spl at the depth of 25 m with the radius of 150 m and the centre of the field is the geometric centre of the scs the results are shown in fig 7 it can be observed that 1 when the excitation force is acted in the plane of x 0 shown in fig 2b the radiated field is symmetric about the x 0 plane shown in fig 3d f when the force is acted in the left cabin the radiated field is asymmetric although to some degree similar to that of case f2 2 the radiated spl of case f2 and f1 are of similar level but that of case f1 is stronger at the main peak of direction of 110 3 seabed parameters have little influence on the near field spl for the excitation frequency of 400 hz further investigation focuses on the contribution of the dry modal shapes of scs on the acoustic radiation and propagation the radiated power is calculated of the 1st 1070th dry modal shapes of the 6 cases shown in fig 7 and the natural frequency of the 1070th dry mode is 1600 9 hz almost quadruple of the excitation frequency comparison shows that for case f1 the main contributors are the 125th 131th and 133rd modal shapes while for case f2 only the 131th mode the shapes of the 3 dry modes are shown in fig 8 it can be seen that the shapes of the 131th dry modes are symmetric about the x 0 plane while that of the 125th and 133rd is anti symmetric which results in the asymmetry of the radiated field of case f1 the contribution of dry mode 125 131 133 for case f1 to the near field radiated spl are calculated and that of dry mode 131 also done for case f2 the results for the high sound speed seabed c bed 1836 m s is shown in fig 9 it can be concluded that spl induced by the main contributing modal shapes with highest radiating power is quite similar to that induced by all modes in lower bands the far field acoustic radiation and propagation at the direction of 110 of the scs is calculated for case f1 and f2 for the 3 typical parameters of seabed shown in tab 1 the results are shown in figs 10 and 11 it is shown that 1 higher sound speed of seabed results in larger reflection coefficient and the interference of the radiated field is more complicated also the far field spl is higher 2 the far field spl of case f2 is a bit lower than case f1 for case f1 the influence of seabed on near field radiation and far field propagation is explored on the 131th dry modal shapes at the directions of 110 and 0 the results are listed in figs 12 and 13 in which the near field distribution within 100 m are exhibited on the left and the far field in the range 100 m 2000 m on the right comparison among figs 11 13 shows that the 131th dry modal shape is the main contributor for the radiation and propagation at the direction of 110 but contributes almost nothing to the direction of 0 it can be seen from the left pictures in figs 12 and 13 that the radiated sound waves by the 131th dry mode mainly consists of the smaller grazing angle part at the direction of 110 and of larger grazing angle part at the direction of 0 the mechanism is analyzed as follows it can be calculated according to eq 5 that the critical grazing angle ϕ for seabed 1 2 3 in tab 1 are 9 3 22 45 and 35 22 at the direction of 110 the radiated sound wave mainly consists of the small grazing angle part and mostly totally reflected by seabed therefore propagates easily to far field but at the direction of 0 it mainly consists of the large grazing angle part and mostly absorbed by seabed therefore difficult for far field propagation comparison among fig 13a c shows that even though the radiated field of 131th dry mode is susceptible to the absorption of seabed and contributes less to far field but for the seabed with higher sound speed the critical angle of reflection ϕ is larger and to some degree maybe a contributor to far field propagation 4 conclusions in this paper the fem bem revised by cvis method combined with image field green function considering the three parameter sea bottom model is proposed to calculate structural vibration and acoustic radiation and propagation in uniform shallow sea by comparing the resulting radiated spl calculated using zou s method zou et al 2013 and the algorithm adopting 3 parameter bottom model the algorithm is verified a slender cylindrical shell acted vertically on ring is calculated for the near field acoustic radiation and far field acoustic propagation at typical direction radiated power of each dry modal shape has been calculated and compared of which the largest contributing modes are extracted and the contribution to near field radiation and far field propagation are analyzed conclusions are listed as follows 1 the far field radiated spl of scs is lower when submerged in shallow sea if the sound speed of the seabed is smaller while that will be higher with the sound speed of seabed larger also the interference of radiated field is more complicated that is due to the increase of critical grazing angle with the ascending of seabed sound speed which allows radiated sound in larger angle range totally reflected by seabed and propagated to far field 2 spl induced by the main contributing modes with highest radiating power approximates to that induced by all modes in lower bands the modes radiating small grazing angle sound waves are the main contributor to far field radiation and propagation because of the less influence of seabed which deserves

22254,this work presents an experimental study of the bistability phenomenon downstream of pairs of finite cylinders with aspect ratios h d of 3 and 4 in finite cylinders bistability is still poorly explored and understood the wake flow around a single finite cylinder with red 2 00 104 was studied after that the flow around two finite cylinders with diameters of 25 and 32 mm and aspect ratios of 3 and 4 was studied 3 86 103 red 4 81 104 hot wire anemometry in an aerodynamic channel and flow visualization by ink injection in water in a hydraulic channel were employed analysis of hot wire data employed statistics spectral and wavelet tools video analysis was made with editing software and statistical tools the flow visualization technique strengthens the interpretation of the results obtained through the hot wire anemometer technique in this work three concomitant flows are considered the upward flow from the cylinder base the downward flow from the top and the so called main flow by the vortex shedding at half height of the cylinders the results show the existence of two different levels of mean velocity in time series corresponding to two flow modes confirming the presence of the phenomenon of bistability for two finite cylinders placed side by side downward flow from the top of the cylinders with an aspect ratio of h d 4 studied also presents bistable characteristics keywords turbulent flow hot wires finite cylinders flow visualization bistability 1 introduction circular cylinders in cross flow have been a topic of research for many years due to both their practical and fundamental importance since this is a very common configuration in engineering applications such as heat exchangers pipelines and transmission lines furthermore the study of finite circular cylinders has technical attention since several structures are cylindrical including tall buildings and offshore oil platforms which can be simplified as finite cylinders with free ends park and lee 2000 recently vortex shedding has also been used for energy generation both in air and water vortexbladeless vortex hydro energy however laboratory conditions usually differ markedly from actual operating conditions of the mentioned structures due to scale and blockage issues influencing measurement results of the strouhal number as well as drag and lift forces the flow around a finite cylinder has different characteristics from the infinite cylinder with a finite cylinder being more complicated than the latter due to the three dimensional flow characteristics caused by longitudinal vortices at its free end and the influence of the cylinder aspect ratio h d height h to diameter d park and lee 2003 the influence of a cylinder s aspect ratio on the resulting flow structure was studied by okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 the h d ratios studied ranged from 0 5 to 23 75 and the reynolds number from 2 5 104 to 4 7 104 they reported the presence of symmetrical vortices shed from cylinders with 1 h d 2 while the shedding frequency decreased with increasing aspect ratio until it reached a minimum value of h d 3 from h d 4 to 7 the wake changed its shape after that the shedding frequency increased as the aspect ratio increased rooney et al 1995 studied the shedding frequency behind cylinders with aspect ratios from 0 67 to 11 33 and reynolds numbers from 7 3 103 to 2 0 104 authors identified that the strouhal number gradually increased and then decreased to a range of 0 67 h d 5 33 showing no apparent relationship with the aspect ratio in the range of 5 33 h d 11 33 the strouhal number increased as the aspect ratio increased luo et al 1996 focused on the pressure distribution along finite cylinders with h d 4 6 and 8 and red 3 33 104 the results suggested that the magnitude of the drag coefficient is strongly dependent on the flow structure especially in the region near the free end sumner et al 2004 studied the vorticity field downstream of finite cylinders with h d 3 5 7 and 9 partially immersed in a boundary layer and a reynolds number of red 2 0 104 to 9 0 104 the flow from the free end was characterized by a pair of counter rotating vortices which caused a downward flow another pair of vortices near the base of the cylinder caused an upward flow the effect of the aspect ratio on the flow structure was observed where there were no vortices at the base of low aspect ratio cylinders unlike the flow structure for high aspect ratio cylinders adaramola et al 2006 also focused on the wake structure of a finite cylinder mounted on a flat wall with aspect ratios of h d 3 5 7 e 9 and red 6 0 104 a similar turbulent wake structure mean velocity turbulence intensity and reynolds shear stress distributions was found for cylinders of h d 5 7 and 9 while the behavior of the wake structure for h d 3 was distinctly different with the absence of the vortices and of the upward flow near the base donnert et al 2007 used a flow visualization technique to study the flow distribution on finite cylinders with aspect ratios of 2 5 and 5 red 4 4 104 and red 2 2 104 in this study it was reported that with a higher aspect ratio a strong downward flow occurred downstream of the finite cylinder and a lower intensity upward flow occurred downstream of the finite cylinder with a lower aspect ratio more recently gonçalves et al 2015 employed flow visualizations and piv techniques in the flow study on cylinders with very low aspect ratios h d 0 1 to 2 0 and a reynolds number range from 1 0 104 to 5 0 104 for the h d ratios lower than 0 5 studied they found a predominance of the free end effects while after this value even in the absence of a von kármán vortex street vortex shedding was capable of producing alternate forces on the cylinders a large number of recent studies have been performed on square cross section finite cylinders according to möller et al 2015a the wake behind prismatic cylinders is more regular than a circular cylinder with sharper energy concentration at the shedding frequency in fourier spectra wang and zhou 2009 found through their studies in a wind tunnel using hot wires lda and piv that the flow around a finite length square cylinder vertically mounted on a wall is highly three dimensional consisting of free end downwash flow spanwise shear flow and upwash flow from the wall the three dimensional characteristics of the two opposite signed vortex rolls found in the wake flow are much more complicated than in a two dimensional wake they depend on the interaction between the wake flow from von kármán vortices with the downwash upwash flows from the upper free extremity and the lower extremity attached to the wall the maximum longitudinal extent of the reverse flow zone occurs near the midspan and is significantly larger than in a two dimensional cylinder wake this zone contracts when approaching the wall and the free end of the cylinder under the influence of upwash and downwash flows also using hot wires and piv in a similar configuration with a fixed aspect ratio of 4 sattari et al 2012 found two main wake regimes regime a related to the von kármán vortices and regime b which consisted of a coexisting pair of counter rotating vortices observed in the formation region throughout the shedding cycle while counter rotating vortices were alternately shed from the end of the formation region in general the shedding frequency was close to the nominal frequency yauwenas et al 2019 used hot wires and a pressure transducer to support their les studies of the wake flow behind finite square cylinders with aspect ratios of 1 4 4 3 10 0 and 18 6 when both base and tip vortices are present there are a total of four streamwise vortices downstream of the cylinder and the structure is referred to as quadrupole similarly the flow structure is referred to as dipole for the cases where only one vortex pair is present however neither tip nor base vortices form at very low aspect ratios particularly for the aspect ratio of 4 3 which is close to the aspect ratios investigated in this paper a dipole wake structure is present the wake flow behind a finite height cylinder mounted on a flat surface can therefore be summarized as a horseshoe vortex due to the ground plane boundary layer separation producing a horseshoe vortex inducing an upward flow behind the cylinder a free end counter rotating vortex structure inducing a downward flow behind the cylinder and a von kármán vortex street between both aforementioned regions provided that the cylinder is sufficiently slender typically for h d values greater than 3 in the study of flow past infinite and finite height cylinders blockage ratio plays an important role for infinite cylinders a classification of the magnitude of the effect of the blockage is given by zdravkovich 2003 with d being the cylinder diameter and l the width of the channel the blockage ratio is given by d l thus d l 10 blockage effect is small and can be ignored 10 d l 60 blockage changes the flow corrections in the measured data are necessary d l 60 blockage radically alters the flow around the cylinder and corrections in the data make no sense the work of maskell 1963 presents a correction procedure for the drag coefficient according to the blockage ratio while in a study about blockage ratio from infinite cylinders möller et al 2015a proposed an expression for the prediction of the strouhal number as a function of the blockage ratio 1 s t r 0 179 d l 0 195 the increase in the cylinder diameter increased the blockage ratio so that the decrease in the vortex shedding frequency was reduced whilst the strouhal number still increased therefore at high blockage ratios the strouhal number increases due to the increased diameter of the cylinders despite the decrease in the vortex shedding frequency for finite height cylinders the blockage ratio is not determined solely by d and l but by the cylinder front area and by the channel cross sectional area west and apelt 1982 performed careful measurements where small changes in the flow characteristics of finite cylinders could be distinguished with blockages from 2 to 6 the aspect ratio of the cylinders with values of 4 6 8 and 10 was controlled by end plates on both extremities of the cylinder they showed that for blockage ratios less than 6 the effects on drag coefficient and strouhal number were negligible while from 6 to 16 there were complex effects due to the flow distortion produced by the blockage the increase in the blockage ratio reduced the wall pressure measured at the cylinder s mid length downstream of the separation point for blockage ratios greater than 6 the separation point was shifted upstream when two circular cylinders placed side by side at a distance in the range of 1 2 p d 2 0 also called intermediate pitch ratio are submitted to a turbulent cross flow the resulting flow is characterized by a wide near wake behind one cylinder and a narrow near wake behind the other this phenomenon results from the interaction of the von kármán wakes behind each cylinder generating two dominant vortex shedding frequencies each one associated with one of the wakes through the gap flow is biased towards the back side of one cylinder forming a narrow wake bistable flow is characterized by the switching of this gap flow from the back side of one cylinder to the other at irregular time intervals this phenomenon called bistability is considered in literature to be an intrinsic property of the flow zdravkovich and stonebanks 1990 to be independent of the reynolds number and to be unrelated to external influence or misalignments between the cylinders a bistable system can be characterized by having two states of rest or of minimum energy analysis by de paula and möller 2018 from the point of view of dynamical systems and the theory of deterministic chaos lead to positive largest lyapunov exponents meaning that according to the criteria employed bistability has a chaotic behavior in order to analyze this phenomenon several studies used numerical and experimental techniques which provide enormous amounts of data leading to a laborious process to make them more efficient techniques such as flow visualization are used together with signal analysis in order to obtain detailed information on the structure of the flow for sumner et al 1999 depending on the distances between the centers of the cylinders pitch p the cross steady flow through two side by side circular cylinders with the same diameter d can present a wake with different modes for different pitch to diameter ratios p d the flow is characterized by a wide near wake behind a cylinder and a narrow near wake behind the other and it occurs at intermediate p d ratios 1 2 p d 2 0 as shown schematically in fig 1 a and b named flow modes 1 and 2 the characteristic velocity signals acquired with two hot wire probes are presented in fig 1c where the velocity change occurs at 8 s in the bistable phenomenon there are two dominant vortex shedding frequencies where the higher frequency is associated with the narrow wake and the lower frequency is associated with the wide wake according to kim and durbin 1988 the transition between the asymmetric states is completely random and is not associated with a natural frequency with the time scale between transitions about 103 times larger than the vortex shedding period sumner et al 1997 did not identify the bistable phenomenon in an experiment with two cylinders arranged side by side across the flow for p d ratios between 1 and 6 and reynolds numbers which ranged between 5 0 102 and 3 0 103 the authors attributed this to the combined effects of the small degree of misalignment of the cylinders and experimental effects such as and aspect and blockage ratios using hot wires piv lda and laser illuminated flow visualizations zhou 2003 studied the wake flow behind three cylinders side by side with a p d ratio of 1 5 results show a stable flow configuration with two narrow wakes behind the side cylinders and a wide wake behind the central one olinto et al 2009 studied the bistable phenomenon on two cylinders arranged side by side with red 3 104 in an aerodynamic channel bistability was present in signals from measurements until y d 0 93 where y is the distance of the probe to the center of the cylinders bistability is also present in the flow behind side by side square cylinders as shown by ozgoren and dogan 2012 they used piv to obtain instantaneous and time averaged flow structures behind single square cylinders and side by side square cylinders with gap ratios g d in the range of 1 0 3 0 where g is the gap width with reynolds number values of 1050 2450 and 3400 in a previous study ozgoren 2006 made a comprehensive piv measurement of the flow characteristics of the wake behind square cylinders at several orientation angles by means of hot wire measurements in an aerodynamic channel and flow visualizations de paula and möller 2013 observed several changes of velocity during the entire period of data acquisition in a study of the wake downstream of two side by side cylinders with p d 1 26 and a reynolds number of 2 27 104 during the changes between the flow modes an increase in the axial velocity component was accompanied by an increase of the transverse component and their pdf probability density function presented the predominance of two major states of energy a double well energy model described the bistable behavior of the velocity components the higher velocity mode lasted for longer time intervals than the lower velocity mode with a high non symmetrical pattern suggesting the presence of more than two flow modes the use of images in science is constantly growing both in the area of fluid mechanics and in other areas where visualization techniques are being developed sumner et al 1999 used two different techniques in flow analysis on cylinder arrays the first for flow visualization through ink injection and the second through piv particle image velocity for 500 red 3000 williamson 1985 used the wind tunnel smoke injection technique to visualize the modes of generation and detachment of vortices on a pair of cylinders for 50 red 200 guillaume and larue 1999 used smoke injection in a wind tunnel illuminated by a laser light plane to visualize the bistable flow regime in two three and four cylinder arrangements with reynolds numbers between 2 5 103 and 4 4 103 xu et al 2003 used laser induced fluorescence flow visualization particle image velocimetry and hot wire techniques to study the effect of the reynolds number on the flow structure behind two cylinders positioned side by side in their experiment the reynolds number varied from 1 5 102 to 1 43 104 hiramoto and higuchi 2003 used the hydrogen bubble and smoke wire methods in water and air respectively to visualize the flow and dpiv digital particle image velocity in the study of vortex detachment on a pair of cylinders side by side with a small angle between the cylinders and re 440 the technique of ink injection in a hydraulic channel to visualize bistable flow on circular cylinders was used by de paula et al 2013 de paula and möller 2013 and olinto et al 2009 to visualize the flow and presence of bistability with two cylinders arranged side by side three cylinders one upstream and two downstream and tube banks in various configurations indrusiak and möller 2011 showed that wavelets can be used for the analysis of accelerating flows in their paper the authors showed that the transient strouhal number obtained from a single data acquisition taken as the blower accelerated from zero to a certain velocity and analyzed with wavelets has close agreement with a set of data acquisitions in steady flows taken at several incidence velocities by means of the les technique afgan et al 2011 obtained images from numerical simulation of the flow around two side by side circular cylinders where symmetrical behavior of the wakes was observed during the transition from one mode to another the authors showed the bistable phenomenon in time series where two modes were presented they also studied flow past a single cylinder derakhshandeh et al 2014 used ansys fluent software to compare kω sst and kω sst sas in the analysis of vortex induced vibration viv for the flow around two circular cylinders showing that kω sst sas has better performance than kω sst in this kind of problem numerical results by neumeister et al 2018 using the finite volumes method for a urans simulation unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes with the kω sst sas shear stress tensor scale adaptive simulation turbulence model corroborated hot wire measurements in the wake of two side by side circular cylinders with p d 1 26 numerical results presented the process of the wake formation showing that bistability does not occur simultaneously along the cylinder corroborated by a delay in the switching process of the simultaneously measured velocities and the cross correlation function this process was associated with the occurrences of vortex shedding dislocation along a cylinder observed by miau et al 2007 although the fine flow structures were not depicted by the method results on vortex dynamics as well as drag and lift forces were obtained with less computational effort than les flow visualization techniques together with wavelet analysis were employed by e g alam et al 2003 alam and sakamoto 2005 and de paula and möller 2013 in the study of bistable flow on two cylinders side by side the use of these combined techniques enhanced the study of non stationary flow phenomena in laboratory conditions in their study on finite cylinders roh and park 2003 showed that the flow over the free end surface is topologically characterized by two spiral nodes foci and a separation saddle point in the front portion of the free end surface and two attachment nodes and a separation saddle point in the rear part of the free end surface this paper aims to analyze the wake from two finite cylinders with aspect ratios h d of 3 and 4 arranged side by side in an aerodynamic channel submitted to a turbulent flow perpendicular to the cylinder s axes the cylinder assemblies have a pitch to diameter ratio of p d 1 26 and different blockage ratios depending on the cylinders diameters and heights three concomitant flows are considered in this analysis upward flow characterized by the vortex structure at the cylinder base downward flow characterized by the vortex structure at the top and the so called main flow characterized by the vortex shedding at half height of the cylinders the study focuses on the following aspects is the bistability phenomenon present in the main flow downstream of the finite cylinders arranged side by side for the reynolds number range investigated in the presence of the bistability phenomenon in the main flow is it influenced by the free end flow pattern in the presence of the bistability phenomenon in the main flow is it influenced by the base flow pattern is there a relation between the aspect ratio and the interference of the upward flow and the downward flow in the bistability phenomenon for these purposes results of velocity and velocity fluctuations measured in the wake of the cylinders by means of hot wire anemometry are presented and analyzed by means of wavelet transform analysis was made with support from flow visualizations in a water channel with the same geometric dimensions as the aerodynamic channel 2 experimental techniques 2 1 aerodynamic channel the aerodynamic channel was the same as used by de paula and möller 2013 2018 fig 2 it was made of acrylic with a cross section of 0 147 m in height and 0 193 m in width air at room temperature was the working fluid driven by a centrifugal blower of 0 75 kw passed by a diffuser and a set of grids honeycombs and screens which reduced the turbulence intensity in the channel to about 1 a frequency inverter controlled the blower speed so that the flow velocity in the aerodynamic channel could be varied from 0 to 15 m s to measure the reference velocity a pitot tube fixed before the test section was used reference velocity together with the cylinder diameter was used for the calculation of the reynolds number of the experiments with values of red 2 0 104 and re 2 5 104 the diameters of the cylinders were 25 and 32 mm they were rigidly mounted in a vertical position on the channel wall so that no vibration of the cylinders was observed pitch to diameter ratio was constant p d 1 26 following observations from möller et al 2015b instantaneous velocity measurements were made by means of a dantec streamline hot wire anemometer two single hot wire probes were placed simultaneously in the wake region in a location x 10 mm downstream of the cylinders as shown in fig 2b and c fig 2d shows the detailed location of the probes for the measurement at the free end center and base locations in this step among the different tests performed the number of times the switching process occurred during the observation time was qualitatively evaluated data acquisition was performed with a 16 bit a d board ni 9215 a with a usb interface using dantec streamware 3 4 software with a sampling frequency of 1000 hz and a low pass filter at 300 hz data series were 32 768 s long they had 215 elements 2 2 water channel flow visualizations were performed in the closed circuit hydraulic channel shown in fig 3 the hydraulic channel had a chamber with a honeycomb which acted as a flow straightener a 4 6 m long open channel 3 6 m upstream 1 0 m downstream the test section with a 0 193 m 0 147 m rectangular cross section the same dimensions as the aerodynamic channel and a discharge tank with a return pipe to close the circuit the water flow rate was read by an electronic flowmeter and varied from 1 66 10 6 to 1 93 10 3 m³ s resulting in velocities of up to 0 068 m s the flow rate and the water level were controlled by a set of valves in the feeding pipeline and in the discharge line to the water tank water was driven by two centrifugal pumps texius model tbhli of 0 373 kw connected in parallel which drew water from a 400 l tank located below the hydraulic channel through two 50 mm diameter water pipes the reynolds number in the flow visualization experiments was 2 0 103 based on the cylinder diameter of 0 032 m and the kinematic viscosity of the water at 15 c of 1 14 106 m2 s the turbulence intensity in the hydraulic channel was about 4 the side wall of the test section was made of acrylic to allow flow visualization two circular finite cylinders arranged side by side with p d 1 26 were mounted in the visualization section of the hydraulic channel the cylinders were rigidly attached through magnets installed inside the cylinders and at the side wall of the test section no vibration of the cylinders was observed the cylinders were built with commercial pvc tubes with diameters of 25 mm and 32 mm and their ends were filled with resin to reproduce the same conditions as those of the measurements in the aerodynamic channel an upper plate was used to close the visualization section and to avoid the effect of gravitational waves so that no submergence effect was present in the test section this procedure was used successfully by olinto et al 2009 and de paula et al 2012 for example the water level was maintained at 0 2 m in the test section during the experiments 0 007 m above the upper plate an ink distribution system was mounted to provide an adequate ink injection upstream of the cylinders it consisted of two tanks with red and blue ink each one with a volume of about 0 001 m3 connected to pvc valves to control the ink flow by flexible pvc tubes with diameters of 2 mm and then to two injection cannulas needles ink was fed by gravity the bottom and the side walls were covered by a thin white pvc film with the purpose of enhancing the contrast of the ink traces a digital camera placed above the cylinders was used for taking picture shots 5 0 mp or digital movies full hd 1920 1080 pixels 30 frames per second a second digital camera placed at the side of the cylinders was used for digital movies wvga 800 480 pixels 240 frames per second in addition a 30 inclined mirror was placed above the cylinders in the hydraulic channel fig 3 which allowed both the top and lateral flow visualization simultaneously results of the flow visualizations are presented through static pictures obtained from the movies where the flow direction is from left to right 2 3 uncertainty analysis the error in a measurement is given by the difference between the actual value and the measured value uncertainty analysis is based on the value of the primary uncertainties in the experiment and the uncertainty of a certain variable as presented by moffat 1988 the uncertainty regarding cylinder dimensions and side by side mounting was estimated to be 0 05 mm probe positioning was done manually with the help of a caliper leading to a positioning uncertainty value of 0 15 mm the uncertainty in velocity reading depends on the evaluation method used to convert the voltage values obtained by the hot wire anemometer in velocity units in this work the method proposed by möller 1988 was adapted leading to an uncertainty range for the instantaneous velocity values between 1 and 6 the uncertainty in the vortex shedding frequencies using fourier analysis depends on the bandwidth used be and the mean statistical error ε of each acquisition performed bendat and piersol 1986 typical values are 3 hz be 4 hz and 8 ε 12 for the frequencies obtained by the wavelet packet transform the error was half the width of the frequency band 3 background fourier and wavelet transforms in this work the analysis was made by fourier transform and the fourier spectrum with the aim of obtaining a frequency domain analysis spectral analysis was carried out through the power spectral density function psd since fourier transform uses trigonometric functions as basis an ergodic hypothesis of the time series is necessary for its use failing in time varying series where the mean values are not constant with time modern literature presents wavelet transform as a tool to analyze such class of problems including time varying series and discontinuities in these series the wavelet bases are generated by dilations and translations of functions called wavelets with finite energy and zero average which generates a wavelet basis wavelets characteristics allow the distribution of the signal s energy over time and frequency domains to be visually represented by a spectrogram the velocity signals were analyzed using wavelet transforms to obtain the energy distribution of the turbulent flow over time frequency domain the continuous wavelet transform of a time function x t is given by 2 x a b x t ψ a b t d t where ψ is the wavelet function and the parameters a and b are scale and position coefficients respectively a b ε r and a 0 the respective wavelet spectrum is defined as 3 p x x a b x a b 2 in the wavelet spectrum eq 3 the energy is related to each time and scale or frequency daubechies 1992 this characteristic allows the spectrogram representation of the signal s energy distribution over time and frequency domains the discrete wavelet transform dwt is a judicious sub sampling of the continuous wavelet transform cwt dealing with dyadic scales and given by percival and walden 2000 4 d j k t x t ψ j k t where the scale and position coefficients j k are dyadic sub samples of a b the definition of the discrete wavelet spectrum is given by 5 p x x j k d j k 2 in this work daubechies db20 functions were selected to perform both discrete and continuous wavelet transforms mathematical tools were developed using matlab software and its specific toolboxes for statistical spectral and wavelet analysis 4 results in the preliminary studies carried out for the elaboration of this work the behavior of the flow around a single finite cylinder was analyzed subsequently the study of two cylinders side by side was performed geometric characteristics are presented in table 1 where the pitch p and the p d ratio apply only to the case of two cylinders side by side the blockage ratio mostly influences the shedding frequency möller et al 2015a and the drag coefficient maskell 1963 therefore in spite of the high blockage ratios observed in table 1 no attempt was made to correct its effects because measurements and flow visualizations were made on scaled test sections 4 1 single finite cylinders 25 and 32 mm for the measurement of velocity and velocity fluctuations a single hot wire probe was placed at half cylinder height in a location one diameter downstream of the cylinder in the analysis of the vortex shedding for a single finite cylinder table 1 the strouhal number found was 0 167 for 25 mm diameter cylinders in both aspect ratios however for 32 mm diameter cylinders the values of 0 172 for h d 3 and 0 186 for h d 4 were found these values are between 9 3 and 15 6 lower than those given by west and appelt 1982 but higher than the values of 0 12 0 13 for square cylinders side by side ozgoren and dogan 2012 according to sumner et al 2004 for finite cylinders of small aspect ratio the flow around the free end may suppress the kármán vortex shedding process for cylinders of larger aspect ratios the dimensionless vortex shedding frequency or strouhal number may vary continuously in this work cylinders with h d 3 are not considered to be of small aspect ratio so in fig 4 there is no vortex suppression but a reduction in power spectral density psd is noted in cylinders with h d 4 the psd has a peak with greater intensity when a cylinder is very close to the top of the aerodynamic channel the vortex shedding occurs at a higher frequency this explains why the cylinder with a 32 mm diameter and h d 4 has a larger strouhal number additionally in both cases the proximity to the upper wall seems to increase the interaction of the cylinder free end flow with the von kármán vortices similarly to the results for a square cylinder as described by yauwenas et al 2019 4 2 finite cylinders with 25 mm diameter side by side fig 5 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal u uref from the measurement with the 25 mm diameter cylinders with h d 4 the bistability is clearly seen through the two alternating velocity levels in the probe signals characterizing two flow modes as previously described in fig 1 in this case approximately 33 mode changes occurred in the flow during the measurement time interval 32 7 s mode changes occur randomly without any defined period confirming the presence of a chaotic behavior de paula and möller 2018 to analyze the energy distribution from streamwise velocity signals spectrograms from the continuous wavelet transform are shown in fig 5b the signal analyzed shows the mode changes characterizing the bistable phenomenon where in the periods when the velocity is high the energy is higher than in periods when the velocity is lower for this aspect ratio the flow above the cylinder tends to be of higher velocity being deflected downwards with higher velocity values thus transverse flow causes the change of mode to become faster affecting the time period between modes visualization of the main flow in the hydraulic channel clearly shows the bistability fig 6 in both the flow visualization and hot wire anemometry signal it is noted that there is some interference in the main flow since the wake remains in each mode for a short period in addition to the large number of mode changes for h d 3 the bistable phenomenon was also identified as the aspect ratio decreased the blockage in the aerodynamic channel was reduced increasing the interference in the main flow from the high recirculation at the top of the cylinders likewise interferences in the bistable flow are noticed which are reflected in an increasing number of mode changes compared to the case of infinite cylinders möller et al 2015a this may be due to the influence of the downward flow produced on the free extremity of the cylinders fig 7 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal u uref measured with probe 1 where the bistability and interferences are observed indicated by the signal which shows quick oscillations at high and low velocities in a short period of time as observed in fig 5 no defined period between mode changes was present with the same random behavior the strouhal number from the cylinder wake found in this case is 0 167 in accordance with the values of 0 14 and 0 16 by olinto et al 2006 for the same p d ratio 1 26 by analyzing the energy distribution fig 7b it can be seen that there is more energy concentration than in the case of h d 4 fig 5b this increase in the energy levels can be imputed to the influence of the downward flow from the cylinder top added to the main flow with occurrence of the bistable phenomenon this may be one of the factors that increase the occurrence of mode changes due to the interference in the bistable flow behind the cylinders main flow caused by the downward flow fig 8 shows the flow visualization confirming that for this geometry there is the occurrence of the switching process between flow modes in this analysis it is also noted that there is an interference which may be produced by the downward flow from the free end of the cylinders as the wake alternates several times and remains in each mode for a short time for both figs 5 and 7 there is a remarkable increase of the energy in almost all frequency ranges observed before the occurrence of a mode change this may indicate that a turbulent energy buildup is required for the mode change to occur to better understand how interference occurs an analysis of the images from the visualization movies was performed around the measurement location marked as center in fig 2 by assigning a geometric point on a line parallel to the cylinder axis at the same distance x where the measurements by hot wire anemometry were taken from in this way one can draw location points where the wake from the free end of the cylinders reaches the measurement location and determine by means of the distance y from this location to the center location how much interference could occur in the main flow as shown schematically in fig 9 when comparing the location where the free end wake crosses the line of the center location for the 25 mm diameter cylinders with different aspect ratios h d 3 and 4 in the hydraulic channel fig 10 it is possible to identify that on cylinders with h d 4 the wake from the free end mostly remains distant from the geometric point however when the wake from the free end reaches the center location it causes little interference in the bistable flow indicating a steepening of the angle formed by the flow from the top of the cylinder with the cylinder axis in the cylinders with h d 3 the downward flow reaches this point several times causing greater interference in the main flow and disturbing the bistability phenomenon 4 3 finite cylinders with a 32 mm diameter side by side fig 11 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal u uref from probe 1 and fig 12 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal from probe 2 for the 32 mm diameter cylinders with an aspect ratio of h d 4 bistability is clearly identified however with the increase in the diameter of the cylinders the interferences found are smaller in relation to 25 mm cylinders with the same aspect ratio this may be due to increased blockage and the distance from the top of the cylinder to the upper wall of the aerodynamic channel reducing interference to the main flow this case presented about 18 flow mode changes during the observation time values of 0 172 and 0 187 were found for the strouhal number these values are higher than the values of 0 14 and 0 16 found by olinto et al 2006 for the same diameter and pitch to diameter ratio investigated figs 11b and 12b and show the energy distribution of the velocity signals through spectrograms made from the continuous wavelet transform through this analysis in this configuration the downward flow increased compared to the 25 mm diameter case the height of the cylinder was 0 128 m so that its extremity was relatively close to the top wall of the aerodynamic channel where there was a recirculation region that affected the bistable flow between the cylinders the crossflow affected the changes of mode and the time between changes as seen in the time interval between 8 and 12 s however the increase in energy before the occurrence of a mode change observed in figs 5 and 7 was present when visualizing the flow in the hydraulic channel the bistable phenomenon was observed in the wake of the 32 mm cylinders with h d 4 fig 13 as there was a large wake behind one of the cylinders and a narrow wake behind the other after a short time interval this pattern changed and the cylinder that had the wide wake then had a narrow wake and vice versa when using finite cylinders with a 32 mm diameter and h d 3 the bistable phenomenon was also identified fig 14 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal measured with probe 1 velocity from probe 2 is shown in fig 15 a bistability is clearly seen in the signals by means of the mode changes between 11 and 13 s and between 21 5 and 27 5 s analysis of the spectrograms figs 14b and 15b showed the changes of mode characterizing the bistable phenomenon in general energy was concentrated in the lower frequencies however during the switching from one mode to the other either increasing or decreasing the mean velocity peaks of higher energy up to about 80 hz are noticeable at e g 2s 3 5s 4s etc for this aspect ratio there were fewer influences of the free end downward flow which did not interfere significantly with the changes of flow mode the higher energy content in this time interval is relative to the high velocity measured from the biased flow and the lower energy content is relative to the low velocity measured from the wide wake it is noticeable that switching between two modes does not occur instantaneously but it starts with an increase in the energy of the velocity fluctuations for several frequencies as observed by alam et al 2003 in both the flow visualization fig 16 and the hot wire anemometry results figs 14a and 15a it is noted that there was no direct interference of the downstream flow from the free end since the wake remained in each mode for a longer period fig 17 shows the cases of the cylinders with diameters of 32 mm and h d 3 and 4 where the ink needles were positioned at the free ends of the cylinders in the case of cylinders with h d 4 the downward flow from the free end reaches the measuring point a few times causing interference in the main flow and also in the bistability but on average it stays further away from this point as a result the free end flow had a higher velocity until the half height of the cylinders than in the case of h d 3 on the other hand in the case of cylinders with h d 3 the downward flow mostly remained more distant from the measurement point not directly influencing the occurrence of the bistable phenomenon this means that the downward flow interference occurred downstream of the measuring point x 10 mm and the hot wire probe did not denote the interference of the upward and or the downward flows in the wakes of the finite cylinders with h d 3 therefore it can be affirmed that the interference of the free end in the occurrence of the bistable phenomenon increases with the increase of the aspect ratio finally it is possible to conclude that for finite cylinders of 32 mm in diameter the increase of the aspect ratio leads to an increase in interferences of the bistable flow however the influence of the reduced gap between the cylinder top and the upper wall on increasing the flow velocity will prevent the detached vortices from reaching the center location when visualizing fig 18 the free end flow of the finite cylinders with diameters of 32 mm and h d 3 the presence of the bistability phenomenon at the top of the cylinders is noted in addition due to the velocity of the flow emerging from the cylinder gap the narrow wake behind one of the cylinders causes a downward flow with greater speed than in the wide wake in the top view of fig 18a the narrow wake nw shown in blue ink and the wide wake ww shown in red ink are clearly visible observing the side view the downward flow with greater intensity corresponds to the blue ink also noted nw another important detail is the angle formed by the downward flow in relation to the cylinders resulting in the downward flow reaching the half height of the cylinders at approximately 2d downstream of the cylinders away from the measuring point at x 0 010 m and without producing interference at the other bistable flow which occurs at half height of the cylinders the top view of fig 18 b shows the role of the deviated jet emanating from the gap between the cylinders on stretching the narrow wake and displacing the outer vortex indicated by an arrow coinciding with the results for two square cylinders presented by ozgoren and dogan 2012 when the analysis is performed at the free end through the side view and top view it is noted that the downward flow has variations indicating a bistable phenomenon at the free end with strong turbulence the main difference between the two aspect ratios is the inclination angle of the downward flow relative to the cylinder due to the smaller slope the flow is deviated downwards and its velocity is increased producing a flip flop flow downstream of the cylinder at half height of it in addition the flows on the free end surface and the side tip vortices continue to develop with downstream distance without merging they follow each other independently in fig 19 the structure of the vortices on finite cylinders arranged side by side is represented through the visualizations it can be concluded that although the extent of the horseshoe vortex is not as large as that of the upward flow the horseshoe vortex has higher energy and stability than the upward flow as in the free end the pressure is lower on one side than the other and tends to be in a bistable configuration in the cylinder free end bistability when the velocity of the narrow wake decreases mode switching occurs and a wide wake behind the corresponding cylinder is formed in addition the narrow wake due to the higher velocity descends towards the main flow when mode switching occurs as shown in fig 20 the cylinder with a narrow wake changes to a wide wake and the cylinder with a wide wake changes to a narrow wake which produces a downward flow with higher speed the result is that the flow on the cylinder free end is also bistable due to bistability in the main flow as there is the influence of one flow in the other 5 concluding remarks the objective of this work was to study the influence of the free end flow on the bistability phenomenon downstream of finite cylinders with aspect ratios h d of 3 and 4 and high blockage ratios with this purpose two experimental studies were performed in the first one the vortex shedding from a single finite cylinder was evaluated after that the study was continued with two finite cylinders placed side by side to evaluate the influence of free end flow on the bistability phenomenon the wake flow was studied by means of the hot wire anemometry technique using an aerodynamic channel and flow visualizations in a hydraulic channel three concomitant flows were considered in this analysis the upward flow characterized by the vortex structure at the cylinder base the downward flow by the vortex structure at the top and the here called main flow characterized by the vortex shedding at half height of the cylinders measurements in the wake of finite single cylinders showed that in comparison with infinite cylinders the vortex shedding frequency is smaller in finite cylinders of the same diameter however the strouhal number increases as the diameter increases with increased blockage this behavior corresponds to that observed in studies performed on infinite cylinders by möller et al 2015a the interaction of the cylinder free end flow with the main flow vortices are similar to the results for a square cylinder as described by yauwenas et al 2019 concerning two side by side finite cylinders it can be stated that bistability phenomenon is present in the main flow downstream of the finite cylinders arranged side by side for the reynolds number range investigated bistability effect was found in all four experiments with two finite cylinders placed side by side the wavelet analysis of hot wire measurement results together with the flow visualization technique have shown to be valuable tools for the identification of bistable flow phenomenon features in general by analyzing all four experiments it can be inferred that by reducing the aspect ratio of finite cylinders the vortices generated at the top of the cylinders detach downstream of the measurement point and the recirculation regions gradually decrease generating less turbulence in the flow it was observed that the switching between two modes does not occur instantaneously but starts with an increase in the velocity fluctuations for several frequencies confirming results by alam et al 2003 bistability in the main flow is influenced by the free end flow pattern interferences of downward flows in the main flow bistability increase in finite cylinders with smaller aspect ratios in conjunction with smaller blockages in the case of larger blockages in smaller aspect ratios interferences of downward flows may or may not occur the hydraulic channel flow visualizations demonstrate the existence of the bistability phenomenon in the main wake flow of finite cylinders for both aspect ratios studied in addition bistability was also found at the free end flow from the top of the cylinder apparently unrelated to the occurrence of bistability in the main flow in relation to the main flow it can be stated that the interference from the free end in the occurrence of bistability increases with the increase of the aspect ratio however with an aspect ratio equal to 3 perturbations occur further downstream of the cylinders due to the larger angle formed without directly interfering with the main flow in the occurrence of the bistability phenomenon in the free end the narrow wake induces a downward flow due to the higher velocity at the top alternating as the mode changes occur bistability is not significantly influenced by the base flow pattern although the extent of the horseshoe vortex is not as large as that of the upward flow the horseshoe vortex has higher energy and stability than the downward flow but is limited to the region near the wall not significantly affecting the bistable process there is a relation between the aspect ratio and the interference of the upward and downward flows in the bistability phenomenon the interferences of downward flows in the main flow bistability increase as the aspect ratio and the blockage are reduced so that in cylinders with the smaller aspect ratios investigated interferences of downward flows may or may not occur acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento científico e tecnológico cnpq brazil for the financial support bpp program this study

22254,this work presents an experimental study of the bistability phenomenon downstream of pairs of finite cylinders with aspect ratios h d of 3 and 4 in finite cylinders bistability is still poorly explored and understood the wake flow around a single finite cylinder with red 2 00 104 was studied after that the flow around two finite cylinders with diameters of 25 and 32 mm and aspect ratios of 3 and 4 was studied 3 86 103 red 4 81 104 hot wire anemometry in an aerodynamic channel and flow visualization by ink injection in water in a hydraulic channel were employed analysis of hot wire data employed statistics spectral and wavelet tools video analysis was made with editing software and statistical tools the flow visualization technique strengthens the interpretation of the results obtained through the hot wire anemometer technique in this work three concomitant flows are considered the upward flow from the cylinder base the downward flow from the top and the so called main flow by the vortex shedding at half height of the cylinders the results show the existence of two different levels of mean velocity in time series corresponding to two flow modes confirming the presence of the phenomenon of bistability for two finite cylinders placed side by side downward flow from the top of the cylinders with an aspect ratio of h d 4 studied also presents bistable characteristics keywords turbulent flow hot wires finite cylinders flow visualization bistability 1 introduction circular cylinders in cross flow have been a topic of research for many years due to both their practical and fundamental importance since this is a very common configuration in engineering applications such as heat exchangers pipelines and transmission lines furthermore the study of finite circular cylinders has technical attention since several structures are cylindrical including tall buildings and offshore oil platforms which can be simplified as finite cylinders with free ends park and lee 2000 recently vortex shedding has also been used for energy generation both in air and water vortexbladeless vortex hydro energy however laboratory conditions usually differ markedly from actual operating conditions of the mentioned structures due to scale and blockage issues influencing measurement results of the strouhal number as well as drag and lift forces the flow around a finite cylinder has different characteristics from the infinite cylinder with a finite cylinder being more complicated than the latter due to the three dimensional flow characteristics caused by longitudinal vortices at its free end and the influence of the cylinder aspect ratio h d height h to diameter d park and lee 2003 the influence of a cylinder s aspect ratio on the resulting flow structure was studied by okamoto and sunabashiri 1992 the h d ratios studied ranged from 0 5 to 23 75 and the reynolds number from 2 5 104 to 4 7 104 they reported the presence of symmetrical vortices shed from cylinders with 1 h d 2 while the shedding frequency decreased with increasing aspect ratio until it reached a minimum value of h d 3 from h d 4 to 7 the wake changed its shape after that the shedding frequency increased as the aspect ratio increased rooney et al 1995 studied the shedding frequency behind cylinders with aspect ratios from 0 67 to 11 33 and reynolds numbers from 7 3 103 to 2 0 104 authors identified that the strouhal number gradually increased and then decreased to a range of 0 67 h d 5 33 showing no apparent relationship with the aspect ratio in the range of 5 33 h d 11 33 the strouhal number increased as the aspect ratio increased luo et al 1996 focused on the pressure distribution along finite cylinders with h d 4 6 and 8 and red 3 33 104 the results suggested that the magnitude of the drag coefficient is strongly dependent on the flow structure especially in the region near the free end sumner et al 2004 studied the vorticity field downstream of finite cylinders with h d 3 5 7 and 9 partially immersed in a boundary layer and a reynolds number of red 2 0 104 to 9 0 104 the flow from the free end was characterized by a pair of counter rotating vortices which caused a downward flow another pair of vortices near the base of the cylinder caused an upward flow the effect of the aspect ratio on the flow structure was observed where there were no vortices at the base of low aspect ratio cylinders unlike the flow structure for high aspect ratio cylinders adaramola et al 2006 also focused on the wake structure of a finite cylinder mounted on a flat wall with aspect ratios of h d 3 5 7 e 9 and red 6 0 104 a similar turbulent wake structure mean velocity turbulence intensity and reynolds shear stress distributions was found for cylinders of h d 5 7 and 9 while the behavior of the wake structure for h d 3 was distinctly different with the absence of the vortices and of the upward flow near the base donnert et al 2007 used a flow visualization technique to study the flow distribution on finite cylinders with aspect ratios of 2 5 and 5 red 4 4 104 and red 2 2 104 in this study it was reported that with a higher aspect ratio a strong downward flow occurred downstream of the finite cylinder and a lower intensity upward flow occurred downstream of the finite cylinder with a lower aspect ratio more recently gonçalves et al 2015 employed flow visualizations and piv techniques in the flow study on cylinders with very low aspect ratios h d 0 1 to 2 0 and a reynolds number range from 1 0 104 to 5 0 104 for the h d ratios lower than 0 5 studied they found a predominance of the free end effects while after this value even in the absence of a von kármán vortex street vortex shedding was capable of producing alternate forces on the cylinders a large number of recent studies have been performed on square cross section finite cylinders according to möller et al 2015a the wake behind prismatic cylinders is more regular than a circular cylinder with sharper energy concentration at the shedding frequency in fourier spectra wang and zhou 2009 found through their studies in a wind tunnel using hot wires lda and piv that the flow around a finite length square cylinder vertically mounted on a wall is highly three dimensional consisting of free end downwash flow spanwise shear flow and upwash flow from the wall the three dimensional characteristics of the two opposite signed vortex rolls found in the wake flow are much more complicated than in a two dimensional wake they depend on the interaction between the wake flow from von kármán vortices with the downwash upwash flows from the upper free extremity and the lower extremity attached to the wall the maximum longitudinal extent of the reverse flow zone occurs near the midspan and is significantly larger than in a two dimensional cylinder wake this zone contracts when approaching the wall and the free end of the cylinder under the influence of upwash and downwash flows also using hot wires and piv in a similar configuration with a fixed aspect ratio of 4 sattari et al 2012 found two main wake regimes regime a related to the von kármán vortices and regime b which consisted of a coexisting pair of counter rotating vortices observed in the formation region throughout the shedding cycle while counter rotating vortices were alternately shed from the end of the formation region in general the shedding frequency was close to the nominal frequency yauwenas et al 2019 used hot wires and a pressure transducer to support their les studies of the wake flow behind finite square cylinders with aspect ratios of 1 4 4 3 10 0 and 18 6 when both base and tip vortices are present there are a total of four streamwise vortices downstream of the cylinder and the structure is referred to as quadrupole similarly the flow structure is referred to as dipole for the cases where only one vortex pair is present however neither tip nor base vortices form at very low aspect ratios particularly for the aspect ratio of 4 3 which is close to the aspect ratios investigated in this paper a dipole wake structure is present the wake flow behind a finite height cylinder mounted on a flat surface can therefore be summarized as a horseshoe vortex due to the ground plane boundary layer separation producing a horseshoe vortex inducing an upward flow behind the cylinder a free end counter rotating vortex structure inducing a downward flow behind the cylinder and a von kármán vortex street between both aforementioned regions provided that the cylinder is sufficiently slender typically for h d values greater than 3 in the study of flow past infinite and finite height cylinders blockage ratio plays an important role for infinite cylinders a classification of the magnitude of the effect of the blockage is given by zdravkovich 2003 with d being the cylinder diameter and l the width of the channel the blockage ratio is given by d l thus d l 10 blockage effect is small and can be ignored 10 d l 60 blockage changes the flow corrections in the measured data are necessary d l 60 blockage radically alters the flow around the cylinder and corrections in the data make no sense the work of maskell 1963 presents a correction procedure for the drag coefficient according to the blockage ratio while in a study about blockage ratio from infinite cylinders möller et al 2015a proposed an expression for the prediction of the strouhal number as a function of the blockage ratio 1 s t r 0 179 d l 0 195 the increase in the cylinder diameter increased the blockage ratio so that the decrease in the vortex shedding frequency was reduced whilst the strouhal number still increased therefore at high blockage ratios the strouhal number increases due to the increased diameter of the cylinders despite the decrease in the vortex shedding frequency for finite height cylinders the blockage ratio is not determined solely by d and l but by the cylinder front area and by the channel cross sectional area west and apelt 1982 performed careful measurements where small changes in the flow characteristics of finite cylinders could be distinguished with blockages from 2 to 6 the aspect ratio of the cylinders with values of 4 6 8 and 10 was controlled by end plates on both extremities of the cylinder they showed that for blockage ratios less than 6 the effects on drag coefficient and strouhal number were negligible while from 6 to 16 there were complex effects due to the flow distortion produced by the blockage the increase in the blockage ratio reduced the wall pressure measured at the cylinder s mid length downstream of the separation point for blockage ratios greater than 6 the separation point was shifted upstream when two circular cylinders placed side by side at a distance in the range of 1 2 p d 2 0 also called intermediate pitch ratio are submitted to a turbulent cross flow the resulting flow is characterized by a wide near wake behind one cylinder and a narrow near wake behind the other this phenomenon results from the interaction of the von kármán wakes behind each cylinder generating two dominant vortex shedding frequencies each one associated with one of the wakes through the gap flow is biased towards the back side of one cylinder forming a narrow wake bistable flow is characterized by the switching of this gap flow from the back side of one cylinder to the other at irregular time intervals this phenomenon called bistability is considered in literature to be an intrinsic property of the flow zdravkovich and stonebanks 1990 to be independent of the reynolds number and to be unrelated to external influence or misalignments between the cylinders a bistable system can be characterized by having two states of rest or of minimum energy analysis by de paula and möller 2018 from the point of view of dynamical systems and the theory of deterministic chaos lead to positive largest lyapunov exponents meaning that according to the criteria employed bistability has a chaotic behavior in order to analyze this phenomenon several studies used numerical and experimental techniques which provide enormous amounts of data leading to a laborious process to make them more efficient techniques such as flow visualization are used together with signal analysis in order to obtain detailed information on the structure of the flow for sumner et al 1999 depending on the distances between the centers of the cylinders pitch p the cross steady flow through two side by side circular cylinders with the same diameter d can present a wake with different modes for different pitch to diameter ratios p d the flow is characterized by a wide near wake behind a cylinder and a narrow near wake behind the other and it occurs at intermediate p d ratios 1 2 p d 2 0 as shown schematically in fig 1 a and b named flow modes 1 and 2 the characteristic velocity signals acquired with two hot wire probes are presented in fig 1c where the velocity change occurs at 8 s in the bistable phenomenon there are two dominant vortex shedding frequencies where the higher frequency is associated with the narrow wake and the lower frequency is associated with the wide wake according to kim and durbin 1988 the transition between the asymmetric states is completely random and is not associated with a natural frequency with the time scale between transitions about 103 times larger than the vortex shedding period sumner et al 1997 did not identify the bistable phenomenon in an experiment with two cylinders arranged side by side across the flow for p d ratios between 1 and 6 and reynolds numbers which ranged between 5 0 102 and 3 0 103 the authors attributed this to the combined effects of the small degree of misalignment of the cylinders and experimental effects such as and aspect and blockage ratios using hot wires piv lda and laser illuminated flow visualizations zhou 2003 studied the wake flow behind three cylinders side by side with a p d ratio of 1 5 results show a stable flow configuration with two narrow wakes behind the side cylinders and a wide wake behind the central one olinto et al 2009 studied the bistable phenomenon on two cylinders arranged side by side with red 3 104 in an aerodynamic channel bistability was present in signals from measurements until y d 0 93 where y is the distance of the probe to the center of the cylinders bistability is also present in the flow behind side by side square cylinders as shown by ozgoren and dogan 2012 they used piv to obtain instantaneous and time averaged flow structures behind single square cylinders and side by side square cylinders with gap ratios g d in the range of 1 0 3 0 where g is the gap width with reynolds number values of 1050 2450 and 3400 in a previous study ozgoren 2006 made a comprehensive piv measurement of the flow characteristics of the wake behind square cylinders at several orientation angles by means of hot wire measurements in an aerodynamic channel and flow visualizations de paula and möller 2013 observed several changes of velocity during the entire period of data acquisition in a study of the wake downstream of two side by side cylinders with p d 1 26 and a reynolds number of 2 27 104 during the changes between the flow modes an increase in the axial velocity component was accompanied by an increase of the transverse component and their pdf probability density function presented the predominance of two major states of energy a double well energy model described the bistable behavior of the velocity components the higher velocity mode lasted for longer time intervals than the lower velocity mode with a high non symmetrical pattern suggesting the presence of more than two flow modes the use of images in science is constantly growing both in the area of fluid mechanics and in other areas where visualization techniques are being developed sumner et al 1999 used two different techniques in flow analysis on cylinder arrays the first for flow visualization through ink injection and the second through piv particle image velocity for 500 red 3000 williamson 1985 used the wind tunnel smoke injection technique to visualize the modes of generation and detachment of vortices on a pair of cylinders for 50 red 200 guillaume and larue 1999 used smoke injection in a wind tunnel illuminated by a laser light plane to visualize the bistable flow regime in two three and four cylinder arrangements with reynolds numbers between 2 5 103 and 4 4 103 xu et al 2003 used laser induced fluorescence flow visualization particle image velocimetry and hot wire techniques to study the effect of the reynolds number on the flow structure behind two cylinders positioned side by side in their experiment the reynolds number varied from 1 5 102 to 1 43 104 hiramoto and higuchi 2003 used the hydrogen bubble and smoke wire methods in water and air respectively to visualize the flow and dpiv digital particle image velocity in the study of vortex detachment on a pair of cylinders side by side with a small angle between the cylinders and re 440 the technique of ink injection in a hydraulic channel to visualize bistable flow on circular cylinders was used by de paula et al 2013 de paula and möller 2013 and olinto et al 2009 to visualize the flow and presence of bistability with two cylinders arranged side by side three cylinders one upstream and two downstream and tube banks in various configurations indrusiak and möller 2011 showed that wavelets can be used for the analysis of accelerating flows in their paper the authors showed that the transient strouhal number obtained from a single data acquisition taken as the blower accelerated from zero to a certain velocity and analyzed with wavelets has close agreement with a set of data acquisitions in steady flows taken at several incidence velocities by means of the les technique afgan et al 2011 obtained images from numerical simulation of the flow around two side by side circular cylinders where symmetrical behavior of the wakes was observed during the transition from one mode to another the authors showed the bistable phenomenon in time series where two modes were presented they also studied flow past a single cylinder derakhshandeh et al 2014 used ansys fluent software to compare kω sst and kω sst sas in the analysis of vortex induced vibration viv for the flow around two circular cylinders showing that kω sst sas has better performance than kω sst in this kind of problem numerical results by neumeister et al 2018 using the finite volumes method for a urans simulation unsteady reynolds averaged navier stokes with the kω sst sas shear stress tensor scale adaptive simulation turbulence model corroborated hot wire measurements in the wake of two side by side circular cylinders with p d 1 26 numerical results presented the process of the wake formation showing that bistability does not occur simultaneously along the cylinder corroborated by a delay in the switching process of the simultaneously measured velocities and the cross correlation function this process was associated with the occurrences of vortex shedding dislocation along a cylinder observed by miau et al 2007 although the fine flow structures were not depicted by the method results on vortex dynamics as well as drag and lift forces were obtained with less computational effort than les flow visualization techniques together with wavelet analysis were employed by e g alam et al 2003 alam and sakamoto 2005 and de paula and möller 2013 in the study of bistable flow on two cylinders side by side the use of these combined techniques enhanced the study of non stationary flow phenomena in laboratory conditions in their study on finite cylinders roh and park 2003 showed that the flow over the free end surface is topologically characterized by two spiral nodes foci and a separation saddle point in the front portion of the free end surface and two attachment nodes and a separation saddle point in the rear part of the free end surface this paper aims to analyze the wake from two finite cylinders with aspect ratios h d of 3 and 4 arranged side by side in an aerodynamic channel submitted to a turbulent flow perpendicular to the cylinder s axes the cylinder assemblies have a pitch to diameter ratio of p d 1 26 and different blockage ratios depending on the cylinders diameters and heights three concomitant flows are considered in this analysis upward flow characterized by the vortex structure at the cylinder base downward flow characterized by the vortex structure at the top and the so called main flow characterized by the vortex shedding at half height of the cylinders the study focuses on the following aspects is the bistability phenomenon present in the main flow downstream of the finite cylinders arranged side by side for the reynolds number range investigated in the presence of the bistability phenomenon in the main flow is it influenced by the free end flow pattern in the presence of the bistability phenomenon in the main flow is it influenced by the base flow pattern is there a relation between the aspect ratio and the interference of the upward flow and the downward flow in the bistability phenomenon for these purposes results of velocity and velocity fluctuations measured in the wake of the cylinders by means of hot wire anemometry are presented and analyzed by means of wavelet transform analysis was made with support from flow visualizations in a water channel with the same geometric dimensions as the aerodynamic channel 2 experimental techniques 2 1 aerodynamic channel the aerodynamic channel was the same as used by de paula and möller 2013 2018 fig 2 it was made of acrylic with a cross section of 0 147 m in height and 0 193 m in width air at room temperature was the working fluid driven by a centrifugal blower of 0 75 kw passed by a diffuser and a set of grids honeycombs and screens which reduced the turbulence intensity in the channel to about 1 a frequency inverter controlled the blower speed so that the flow velocity in the aerodynamic channel could be varied from 0 to 15 m s to measure the reference velocity a pitot tube fixed before the test section was used reference velocity together with the cylinder diameter was used for the calculation of the reynolds number of the experiments with values of red 2 0 104 and re 2 5 104 the diameters of the cylinders were 25 and 32 mm they were rigidly mounted in a vertical position on the channel wall so that no vibration of the cylinders was observed pitch to diameter ratio was constant p d 1 26 following observations from möller et al 2015b instantaneous velocity measurements were made by means of a dantec streamline hot wire anemometer two single hot wire probes were placed simultaneously in the wake region in a location x 10 mm downstream of the cylinders as shown in fig 2b and c fig 2d shows the detailed location of the probes for the measurement at the free end center and base locations in this step among the different tests performed the number of times the switching process occurred during the observation time was qualitatively evaluated data acquisition was performed with a 16 bit a d board ni 9215 a with a usb interface using dantec streamware 3 4 software with a sampling frequency of 1000 hz and a low pass filter at 300 hz data series were 32 768 s long they had 215 elements 2 2 water channel flow visualizations were performed in the closed circuit hydraulic channel shown in fig 3 the hydraulic channel had a chamber with a honeycomb which acted as a flow straightener a 4 6 m long open channel 3 6 m upstream 1 0 m downstream the test section with a 0 193 m 0 147 m rectangular cross section the same dimensions as the aerodynamic channel and a discharge tank with a return pipe to close the circuit the water flow rate was read by an electronic flowmeter and varied from 1 66 10 6 to 1 93 10 3 m³ s resulting in velocities of up to 0 068 m s the flow rate and the water level were controlled by a set of valves in the feeding pipeline and in the discharge line to the water tank water was driven by two centrifugal pumps texius model tbhli of 0 373 kw connected in parallel which drew water from a 400 l tank located below the hydraulic channel through two 50 mm diameter water pipes the reynolds number in the flow visualization experiments was 2 0 103 based on the cylinder diameter of 0 032 m and the kinematic viscosity of the water at 15 c of 1 14 106 m2 s the turbulence intensity in the hydraulic channel was about 4 the side wall of the test section was made of acrylic to allow flow visualization two circular finite cylinders arranged side by side with p d 1 26 were mounted in the visualization section of the hydraulic channel the cylinders were rigidly attached through magnets installed inside the cylinders and at the side wall of the test section no vibration of the cylinders was observed the cylinders were built with commercial pvc tubes with diameters of 25 mm and 32 mm and their ends were filled with resin to reproduce the same conditions as those of the measurements in the aerodynamic channel an upper plate was used to close the visualization section and to avoid the effect of gravitational waves so that no submergence effect was present in the test section this procedure was used successfully by olinto et al 2009 and de paula et al 2012 for example the water level was maintained at 0 2 m in the test section during the experiments 0 007 m above the upper plate an ink distribution system was mounted to provide an adequate ink injection upstream of the cylinders it consisted of two tanks with red and blue ink each one with a volume of about 0 001 m3 connected to pvc valves to control the ink flow by flexible pvc tubes with diameters of 2 mm and then to two injection cannulas needles ink was fed by gravity the bottom and the side walls were covered by a thin white pvc film with the purpose of enhancing the contrast of the ink traces a digital camera placed above the cylinders was used for taking picture shots 5 0 mp or digital movies full hd 1920 1080 pixels 30 frames per second a second digital camera placed at the side of the cylinders was used for digital movies wvga 800 480 pixels 240 frames per second in addition a 30 inclined mirror was placed above the cylinders in the hydraulic channel fig 3 which allowed both the top and lateral flow visualization simultaneously results of the flow visualizations are presented through static pictures obtained from the movies where the flow direction is from left to right 2 3 uncertainty analysis the error in a measurement is given by the difference between the actual value and the measured value uncertainty analysis is based on the value of the primary uncertainties in the experiment and the uncertainty of a certain variable as presented by moffat 1988 the uncertainty regarding cylinder dimensions and side by side mounting was estimated to be 0 05 mm probe positioning was done manually with the help of a caliper leading to a positioning uncertainty value of 0 15 mm the uncertainty in velocity reading depends on the evaluation method used to convert the voltage values obtained by the hot wire anemometer in velocity units in this work the method proposed by möller 1988 was adapted leading to an uncertainty range for the instantaneous velocity values between 1 and 6 the uncertainty in the vortex shedding frequencies using fourier analysis depends on the bandwidth used be and the mean statistical error ε of each acquisition performed bendat and piersol 1986 typical values are 3 hz be 4 hz and 8 ε 12 for the frequencies obtained by the wavelet packet transform the error was half the width of the frequency band 3 background fourier and wavelet transforms in this work the analysis was made by fourier transform and the fourier spectrum with the aim of obtaining a frequency domain analysis spectral analysis was carried out through the power spectral density function psd since fourier transform uses trigonometric functions as basis an ergodic hypothesis of the time series is necessary for its use failing in time varying series where the mean values are not constant with time modern literature presents wavelet transform as a tool to analyze such class of problems including time varying series and discontinuities in these series the wavelet bases are generated by dilations and translations of functions called wavelets with finite energy and zero average which generates a wavelet basis wavelets characteristics allow the distribution of the signal s energy over time and frequency domains to be visually represented by a spectrogram the velocity signals were analyzed using wavelet transforms to obtain the energy distribution of the turbulent flow over time frequency domain the continuous wavelet transform of a time function x t is given by 2 x a b x t ψ a b t d t where ψ is the wavelet function and the parameters a and b are scale and position coefficients respectively a b ε r and a 0 the respective wavelet spectrum is defined as 3 p x x a b x a b 2 in the wavelet spectrum eq 3 the energy is related to each time and scale or frequency daubechies 1992 this characteristic allows the spectrogram representation of the signal s energy distribution over time and frequency domains the discrete wavelet transform dwt is a judicious sub sampling of the continuous wavelet transform cwt dealing with dyadic scales and given by percival and walden 2000 4 d j k t x t ψ j k t where the scale and position coefficients j k are dyadic sub samples of a b the definition of the discrete wavelet spectrum is given by 5 p x x j k d j k 2 in this work daubechies db20 functions were selected to perform both discrete and continuous wavelet transforms mathematical tools were developed using matlab software and its specific toolboxes for statistical spectral and wavelet analysis 4 results in the preliminary studies carried out for the elaboration of this work the behavior of the flow around a single finite cylinder was analyzed subsequently the study of two cylinders side by side was performed geometric characteristics are presented in table 1 where the pitch p and the p d ratio apply only to the case of two cylinders side by side the blockage ratio mostly influences the shedding frequency möller et al 2015a and the drag coefficient maskell 1963 therefore in spite of the high blockage ratios observed in table 1 no attempt was made to correct its effects because measurements and flow visualizations were made on scaled test sections 4 1 single finite cylinders 25 and 32 mm for the measurement of velocity and velocity fluctuations a single hot wire probe was placed at half cylinder height in a location one diameter downstream of the cylinder in the analysis of the vortex shedding for a single finite cylinder table 1 the strouhal number found was 0 167 for 25 mm diameter cylinders in both aspect ratios however for 32 mm diameter cylinders the values of 0 172 for h d 3 and 0 186 for h d 4 were found these values are between 9 3 and 15 6 lower than those given by west and appelt 1982 but higher than the values of 0 12 0 13 for square cylinders side by side ozgoren and dogan 2012 according to sumner et al 2004 for finite cylinders of small aspect ratio the flow around the free end may suppress the kármán vortex shedding process for cylinders of larger aspect ratios the dimensionless vortex shedding frequency or strouhal number may vary continuously in this work cylinders with h d 3 are not considered to be of small aspect ratio so in fig 4 there is no vortex suppression but a reduction in power spectral density psd is noted in cylinders with h d 4 the psd has a peak with greater intensity when a cylinder is very close to the top of the aerodynamic channel the vortex shedding occurs at a higher frequency this explains why the cylinder with a 32 mm diameter and h d 4 has a larger strouhal number additionally in both cases the proximity to the upper wall seems to increase the interaction of the cylinder free end flow with the von kármán vortices similarly to the results for a square cylinder as described by yauwenas et al 2019 4 2 finite cylinders with 25 mm diameter side by side fig 5 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal u uref from the measurement with the 25 mm diameter cylinders with h d 4 the bistability is clearly seen through the two alternating velocity levels in the probe signals characterizing two flow modes as previously described in fig 1 in this case approximately 33 mode changes occurred in the flow during the measurement time interval 32 7 s mode changes occur randomly without any defined period confirming the presence of a chaotic behavior de paula and möller 2018 to analyze the energy distribution from streamwise velocity signals spectrograms from the continuous wavelet transform are shown in fig 5b the signal analyzed shows the mode changes characterizing the bistable phenomenon where in the periods when the velocity is high the energy is higher than in periods when the velocity is lower for this aspect ratio the flow above the cylinder tends to be of higher velocity being deflected downwards with higher velocity values thus transverse flow causes the change of mode to become faster affecting the time period between modes visualization of the main flow in the hydraulic channel clearly shows the bistability fig 6 in both the flow visualization and hot wire anemometry signal it is noted that there is some interference in the main flow since the wake remains in each mode for a short period in addition to the large number of mode changes for h d 3 the bistable phenomenon was also identified as the aspect ratio decreased the blockage in the aerodynamic channel was reduced increasing the interference in the main flow from the high recirculation at the top of the cylinders likewise interferences in the bistable flow are noticed which are reflected in an increasing number of mode changes compared to the case of infinite cylinders möller et al 2015a this may be due to the influence of the downward flow produced on the free extremity of the cylinders fig 7 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal u uref measured with probe 1 where the bistability and interferences are observed indicated by the signal which shows quick oscillations at high and low velocities in a short period of time as observed in fig 5 no defined period between mode changes was present with the same random behavior the strouhal number from the cylinder wake found in this case is 0 167 in accordance with the values of 0 14 and 0 16 by olinto et al 2006 for the same p d ratio 1 26 by analyzing the energy distribution fig 7b it can be seen that there is more energy concentration than in the case of h d 4 fig 5b this increase in the energy levels can be imputed to the influence of the downward flow from the cylinder top added to the main flow with occurrence of the bistable phenomenon this may be one of the factors that increase the occurrence of mode changes due to the interference in the bistable flow behind the cylinders main flow caused by the downward flow fig 8 shows the flow visualization confirming that for this geometry there is the occurrence of the switching process between flow modes in this analysis it is also noted that there is an interference which may be produced by the downward flow from the free end of the cylinders as the wake alternates several times and remains in each mode for a short time for both figs 5 and 7 there is a remarkable increase of the energy in almost all frequency ranges observed before the occurrence of a mode change this may indicate that a turbulent energy buildup is required for the mode change to occur to better understand how interference occurs an analysis of the images from the visualization movies was performed around the measurement location marked as center in fig 2 by assigning a geometric point on a line parallel to the cylinder axis at the same distance x where the measurements by hot wire anemometry were taken from in this way one can draw location points where the wake from the free end of the cylinders reaches the measurement location and determine by means of the distance y from this location to the center location how much interference could occur in the main flow as shown schematically in fig 9 when comparing the location where the free end wake crosses the line of the center location for the 25 mm diameter cylinders with different aspect ratios h d 3 and 4 in the hydraulic channel fig 10 it is possible to identify that on cylinders with h d 4 the wake from the free end mostly remains distant from the geometric point however when the wake from the free end reaches the center location it causes little interference in the bistable flow indicating a steepening of the angle formed by the flow from the top of the cylinder with the cylinder axis in the cylinders with h d 3 the downward flow reaches this point several times causing greater interference in the main flow and disturbing the bistability phenomenon 4 3 finite cylinders with a 32 mm diameter side by side fig 11 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal u uref from probe 1 and fig 12 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal from probe 2 for the 32 mm diameter cylinders with an aspect ratio of h d 4 bistability is clearly identified however with the increase in the diameter of the cylinders the interferences found are smaller in relation to 25 mm cylinders with the same aspect ratio this may be due to increased blockage and the distance from the top of the cylinder to the upper wall of the aerodynamic channel reducing interference to the main flow this case presented about 18 flow mode changes during the observation time values of 0 172 and 0 187 were found for the strouhal number these values are higher than the values of 0 14 and 0 16 found by olinto et al 2006 for the same diameter and pitch to diameter ratio investigated figs 11b and 12b and show the energy distribution of the velocity signals through spectrograms made from the continuous wavelet transform through this analysis in this configuration the downward flow increased compared to the 25 mm diameter case the height of the cylinder was 0 128 m so that its extremity was relatively close to the top wall of the aerodynamic channel where there was a recirculation region that affected the bistable flow between the cylinders the crossflow affected the changes of mode and the time between changes as seen in the time interval between 8 and 12 s however the increase in energy before the occurrence of a mode change observed in figs 5 and 7 was present when visualizing the flow in the hydraulic channel the bistable phenomenon was observed in the wake of the 32 mm cylinders with h d 4 fig 13 as there was a large wake behind one of the cylinders and a narrow wake behind the other after a short time interval this pattern changed and the cylinder that had the wide wake then had a narrow wake and vice versa when using finite cylinders with a 32 mm diameter and h d 3 the bistable phenomenon was also identified fig 14 a shows the normalized streamwise velocity signal measured with probe 1 velocity from probe 2 is shown in fig 15 a bistability is clearly seen in the signals by means of the mode changes between 11 and 13 s and between 21 5 and 27 5 s analysis of the spectrograms figs 14b and 15b showed the changes of mode characterizing the bistable phenomenon in general energy was concentrated in the lower frequencies however during the switching from one mode to the other either increasing or decreasing the mean velocity peaks of higher energy up to about 80 hz are noticeable at e g 2s 3 5s 4s etc for this aspect ratio there were fewer influences of the free end downward flow which did not interfere significantly with the changes of flow mode the higher energy content in this time interval is relative to the high velocity measured from the biased flow and the lower energy content is relative to the low velocity measured from the wide wake it is noticeable that switching between two modes does not occur instantaneously but it starts with an increase in the energy of the velocity fluctuations for several frequencies as observed by alam et al 2003 in both the flow visualization fig 16 and the hot wire anemometry results figs 14a and 15a it is noted that there was no direct interference of the downstream flow from the free end since the wake remained in each mode for a longer period fig 17 shows the cases of the cylinders with diameters of 32 mm and h d 3 and 4 where the ink needles were positioned at the free ends of the cylinders in the case of cylinders with h d 4 the downward flow from the free end reaches the measuring point a few times causing interference in the main flow and also in the bistability but on average it stays further away from this point as a result the free end flow had a higher velocity until the half height of the cylinders than in the case of h d 3 on the other hand in the case of cylinders with h d 3 the downward flow mostly remained more distant from the measurement point not directly influencing the occurrence of the bistable phenomenon this means that the downward flow interference occurred downstream of the measuring point x 10 mm and the hot wire probe did not denote the interference of the upward and or the downward flows in the wakes of the finite cylinders with h d 3 therefore it can be affirmed that the interference of the free end in the occurrence of the bistable phenomenon increases with the increase of the aspect ratio finally it is possible to conclude that for finite cylinders of 32 mm in diameter the increase of the aspect ratio leads to an increase in interferences of the bistable flow however the influence of the reduced gap between the cylinder top and the upper wall on increasing the flow velocity will prevent the detached vortices from reaching the center location when visualizing fig 18 the free end flow of the finite cylinders with diameters of 32 mm and h d 3 the presence of the bistability phenomenon at the top of the cylinders is noted in addition due to the velocity of the flow emerging from the cylinder gap the narrow wake behind one of the cylinders causes a downward flow with greater speed than in the wide wake in the top view of fig 18a the narrow wake nw shown in blue ink and the wide wake ww shown in red ink are clearly visible observing the side view the downward flow with greater intensity corresponds to the blue ink also noted nw another important detail is the angle formed by the downward flow in relation to the cylinders resulting in the downward flow reaching the half height of the cylinders at approximately 2d downstream of the cylinders away from the measuring point at x 0 010 m and without producing interference at the other bistable flow which occurs at half height of the cylinders the top view of fig 18 b shows the role of the deviated jet emanating from the gap between the cylinders on stretching the narrow wake and displacing the outer vortex indicated by an arrow coinciding with the results for two square cylinders presented by ozgoren and dogan 2012 when the analysis is performed at the free end through the side view and top view it is noted that the downward flow has variations indicating a bistable phenomenon at the free end with strong turbulence the main difference between the two aspect ratios is the inclination angle of the downward flow relative to the cylinder due to the smaller slope the flow is deviated downwards and its velocity is increased producing a flip flop flow downstream of the cylinder at half height of it in addition the flows on the free end surface and the side tip vortices continue to develop with downstream distance without merging they follow each other independently in fig 19 the structure of the vortices on finite cylinders arranged side by side is represented through the visualizations it can be concluded that although the extent of the horseshoe vortex is not as large as that of the upward flow the horseshoe vortex has higher energy and stability than the upward flow as in the free end the pressure is lower on one side than the other and tends to be in a bistable configuration in the cylinder free end bistability when the velocity of the narrow wake decreases mode switching occurs and a wide wake behind the corresponding cylinder is formed in addition the narrow wake due to the higher velocity descends towards the main flow when mode switching occurs as shown in fig 20 the cylinder with a narrow wake changes to a wide wake and the cylinder with a wide wake changes to a narrow wake which produces a downward flow with higher speed the result is that the flow on the cylinder free end is also bistable due to bistability in the main flow as there is the influence of one flow in the other 5 concluding remarks the objective of this work was to study the influence of the free end flow on the bistability phenomenon downstream of finite cylinders with aspect ratios h d of 3 and 4 and high blockage ratios with this purpose two experimental studies were performed in the first one the vortex shedding from a single finite cylinder was evaluated after that the study was continued with two finite cylinders placed side by side to evaluate the influence of free end flow on the bistability phenomenon the wake flow was studied by means of the hot wire anemometry technique using an aerodynamic channel and flow visualizations in a hydraulic channel three concomitant flows were considered in this analysis the upward flow characterized by the vortex structure at the cylinder base the downward flow by the vortex structure at the top and the here called main flow characterized by the vortex shedding at half height of the cylinders measurements in the wake of finite single cylinders showed that in comparison with infinite cylinders the vortex shedding frequency is smaller in finite cylinders of the same diameter however the strouhal number increases as the diameter increases with increased blockage this behavior corresponds to that observed in studies performed on infinite cylinders by möller et al 2015a the interaction of the cylinder free end flow with the main flow vortices are similar to the results for a square cylinder as described by yauwenas et al 2019 concerning two side by side finite cylinders it can be stated that bistability phenomenon is present in the main flow downstream of the finite cylinders arranged side by side for the reynolds number range investigated bistability effect was found in all four experiments with two finite cylinders placed side by side the wavelet analysis of hot wire measurement results together with the flow visualization technique have shown to be valuable tools for the identification of bistable flow phenomenon features in general by analyzing all four experiments it can be inferred that by reducing the aspect ratio of finite cylinders the vortices generated at the top of the cylinders detach downstream of the measurement point and the recirculation regions gradually decrease generating less turbulence in the flow it was observed that the switching between two modes does not occur instantaneously but starts with an increase in the velocity fluctuations for several frequencies confirming results by alam et al 2003 bistability in the main flow is influenced by the free end flow pattern interferences of downward flows in the main flow bistability increase in finite cylinders with smaller aspect ratios in conjunction with smaller blockages in the case of larger blockages in smaller aspect ratios interferences of downward flows may or may not occur the hydraulic channel flow visualizations demonstrate the existence of the bistability phenomenon in the main wake flow of finite cylinders for both aspect ratios studied in addition bistability was also found at the free end flow from the top of the cylinder apparently unrelated to the occurrence of bistability in the main flow in relation to the main flow it can be stated that the interference from the free end in the occurrence of bistability increases with the increase of the aspect ratio however with an aspect ratio equal to 3 perturbations occur further downstream of the cylinders due to the larger angle formed without directly interfering with the main flow in the occurrence of the bistability phenomenon in the free end the narrow wake induces a downward flow due to the higher velocity at the top alternating as the mode changes occur bistability is not significantly influenced by the base flow pattern although the extent of the horseshoe vortex is not as large as that of the upward flow the horseshoe vortex has higher energy and stability than the downward flow but is limited to the region near the wall not significantly affecting the bistable process there is a relation between the aspect ratio and the interference of the upward and downward flows in the bistability phenomenon the interferences of downward flows in the main flow bistability increase as the aspect ratio and the blockage are reduced so that in cylinders with the smaller aspect ratios investigated interferences of downward flows may or may not occur acknowledgments the authors are grateful to the conselho nacional de desenvolvimento científico e tecnológico cnpq brazil for the financial support bpp program this study
