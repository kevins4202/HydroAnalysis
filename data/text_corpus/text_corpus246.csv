1230,blesbokspruit wetland is one of the least conserved ecosystems in the southern africa region with active and latent threats of anthropogenic contamination stretching over decades of mining wastewater discharge agricultural run off and a consistent influx of untreated sewage this study provides an insight into the present day spatial distribution of heavy metal contamination and the role of localised macrophytes in their phytoremediation with exception of the first sampling point the concentration of heavy metals in water samples throughout the wetland was within limits however findings from sediment samples were the inverse the concentrations of chromium and nickel significantly exceeded both effect range low erl and effect range medium erm limits 250 430 mg kg and 73 151 mg kg respectively as set out by international sediment quality guidelines emergent phragmites australis typha capensis and free flowing eichhornia crassipes macrophytes which are naturally localised to the wetland were found to have varying bioaccumulation potential for different heavy metals bioconcentration of heavy metals in emergent macrophytes was relatively low especially for nickel and chromium compared to free flowing macrophytes e crassipes accumulated significant amounts of the heavy metals with root concentrations of up to 17 23 116 6 330 5 and 342 9 mg kg for arsenic lead nickel and chromium respectively the emergent macrophytes were however found to bioconcentrate arsenic up to 1 15 l kg t capensis and 9 9 l kg p australis at sites 4 and 5 respectively findings with regards to bioconcentration especially of the e crassipes validate recommendations for the utilization of hyperaccumulating macrophytes for the natural recovery of these heavy metals towards alleviating the anthropogenic stress on this valuable ecosystem keywords bioaccumulation heavy metals pollution phytoremediation water resource management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction central to the economic outlook of south africa is the extraction and processing of a wide range of minerals such as coal diamond gold copper lead iron ore chrome emerald fluorspar ilmenite manganese nickel vanadium zinc tin silica uranium zircon and phosphate ebenebe et al 2017 the consequence of these mining activities is the generation of vast amounts of waste which directly contributes to localised concentrations of heavy metals that are released into the environment heavy metals including zn ni co cu fe cr i b mn se as ag cd pb hg and mo burden receiving aquifers are toxic to living organisms at concentrations above their respective threshold limits tchounwou et al 2012 alloway 2013 in addition to leachates from mining operations other anthropogenic sources of heavy metals include fertilizers pesticides untreated industrial wastewater e wastes wastes from smelting ores sewage sludge etc ramachandra et al 2018 heavy metals are non degradable by any biological or chemical mechanism and as a result they remain in the environment providing a considerable hazard to people in the long run accumulating in the human body through biomagnification and creating a serious health risk sarwar et al 2010 rehman et al 2021 evidence of physiological and psychological diseases linked to heavy metals in humans have received substantial attention in the literature and continues to do so arif et al 2016 ali and khan 2018 ali et al 2019 yan et al 2020 ali et al 2021 wetlands are important aquatic ecosystems that provide critical functions to the natural environment and society the south african national water act national water act 1998 defined wetlands as areas of land which is transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems by virtue of relatively high water table levels usually at or near the surface a consequence of which being the land is periodically saturated wetlands typically support vegetation hydrophytes which are adapted to life in saturated soil cowardin and golet 1995 wetland ecosystems are characterised by relatively higher carbon density relative to terrestrial ecosystems thus they are significant players in biogeochemical and carbon cycles moomaw et al 2018 their role in short carbon cycling is highlighted by approximately 30 of land based carbon being stored in peatlands limpens et al 2008 in addition they act as sponges trapping floodwater and contaminants including heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms through several biological and chemical processes bae et al 2017 kumar and kanaujia 2018 despite their importance as emphasized by local and international regulations recent biodiversity assessments of wetlands suggest they are the most threatened and the least protected ecosystem in southern africa skowno et al 2019 threats to wetland diversity in the region have been directly linked to ecologically toxic agents emerging from the aforementioned anthropogenic sources the blesbokspruit wetland system is a high altitude ramsar wetland of global significance and the largest permanent wetland in the highveld region of south africa mckay et al 2018 ecological degradation of blesbokspruit wetland have been a matter of intense interest for decades with literature proof of the effects of acid mine water discharge from the surrounding mine dumps in particular secondary salinity high organic loads from incessant sewerage discharge and invasive plant species domination which are all suggestive of compromised water quality ultra mineralisation eutrophication and ecological degradation of the aquatic ecosystem du plessis et al 2014 ambani and annegarn 2015 the montreux record of ramsar site degradation 1996 recognised the blesbokspruit wetland over 2 decades ago flagging the active threats of mine water discharge pollution to the ecosystem with the aim of initiating remedial measures however trends in influx continue to oppose resource conservation strategies necessary to revive the ecological health of the wetland sedietso 2019 naidoo 2022 wetland biodiversity is highly susceptible to compromise by heavy metal influx and deposition either in solid or dissolved forms the inorganics by means of sedimentation are absorbed by the granular medium of the wetland and can be released back into the water via deposition dissociation dissolution including redox processes violante et al 2010 the primary factor influencing the mobilization and demobilization processes is the physicochemical conditions of the media air water and sediments influencing bioavailability and the risk of biomagnification du laing et al 2008 sobolev and begonia 2008 in addition to sedimentation the accumulation of heavy metals by localised macrophytes also plays a significant role in maintaining the eco balance of wetland ecosystems macrophytes are natural bioaccumulators of heavy metals with varying absorbance capacity for heavy metals removed from the environment huang et al 2020 ouma et al 2022 phytoremediation by macrophytes can be accomplished through various mechanisms including phytodegradation rhizofiltration phytovolatilization and phytoaccumulation phytoextraction during phytodegradation macrophytes release certain enzymes e g nitrilase dehalogenase nitrate reductase laccase peroxidases peroxygenases cytochrome p450 glutathione s transferases and carboxylesterases to transform which often lead to mineralisation of organic compounds such as nitrates phosphates sulfates dyes and pesticides into non toxic or less toxic compounds which could be incorporated in macrophytes tissues and result within the enhancement of certain metabolic activities and growth of the macrophytes öztürk et al 2016 durand et al 2018 arora 2020 rhizofiltration limits heavy metal motility by adsorption on the roots surface of macrophytes including in certain cases absorption thus confining these contaminants into subterranean water tiwari et al 2018 this form of remediation is efficient for eradicating radioactive contaminants agricultural runoff and heavy metals such as ca cr cu pb and zn which are normally locked up in the sediments eevers et al 2017 ali et al 2020 another mechanism by which macrophytes ease heavy metal concentration of water soil and trophic biota is by phytovolatilization wherein they absorb heavy metals e g hg se as from the sediments or water convert them to a less hazardous volatile form and then release them into the atmosphere when they transpire via their foliage system limmer and burken 2016 obrist et al 2018 in phytoextraction phytoaccumulation processes macrophytes may absorb readily bioavailable as cd cu se ni zn moderately bioavailable co fe mn hg and least bioavailable cr pb u metals from sediments or water and accumulate translocate and eventually store them in their shoots awa and hadibarata 2020 yan et al 2020 at the underlining processes for phytoextraction could involve mobilization of the heavy metal root uptake xylem loading root to shoot transport cellular compartmentation and sequestration bioavailability of heavy metals is optimized by means of root exudates secretion which modulates rhizosphere conditions in favour of cell wall sorption and the passive diffusion or active transport of the metals across the plasma membrane mediated by metal ion carriers or complexing agents peer et al 2005a 2005b mahmood et al 2010 yeh et al 2015 ismail and moustafa 2016 as such macrophytes especially are regarded as excellent indicators of heavy metal contamination in wetland systems and hyperaccumulators especially doubling as eco friendly biofilters with potential for remediation application krems et al 2013 ladislas et al 2012 preliminary findings as informed by previous reports on the blesbokspruit wetland suggest an interesting wetland ecosystem characterised by relatively high concentrations of heavy metals as such this study explored the potentials for biomonitoring and phytoremediation of different macrophytes localised to the blesbokspruit wetland the solute burdening of the blesbokspruit wetland is hypothesized here to be reflected in the concentrations of heavy metals in the biotic tissue of emergent macrophytes phragmites australis and typha capensis and free floating macrophytes eichhornia crassipes and abiotic components of the wetland the concentration of heavy metals were analysed in water samples and sediments while detected metals as cr ni pb listed as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2007 were also analysed for in the macrophytes tissues of the aforementioned plants growing at different locations across the wetland these findings were correlated to quality criteria and regulatory threshold limits for the respective contaminants in addition the bioaccumulation potential established by means of calculating the bioconcentration and translocation factors of the different macrophytes are as presented in relation to recommendations of the potentials of localised macrophytes for phytoextraction towards the ecological restoration of the wetland 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in mid summer of the year 2021 at blesbokspruit wetland from 26010l56 65ll s 28028l24 84ll e to 26015l20 31ll s 28029l58 53ll e the blesbokpruit wetland covers 1858 ha and stretches about 21 km at an altitude of 1585 m amsl anglogold and ashanti 2004 du plessis et al 2014 ambani and annegarn 2015 the blesbokspruit wetland is surrounded by 5 towns in the east rand region springs boksburg benoni brakpan and nigel making this wetland an important ecosystem within a highly urbanised economic hub this wetland is a major tributary of the vaal river which provides water to 10 million people du plessis et al 2014 mckay et al 2018 the six sampling sites ss were selected along the blesbokspruit wetland and they were designated as upstream ss 1 2 middle stream ss 3 4 and downstream ss 5 6 table 1 ss 1 is surrounded by agricultural lands which was upstream from the wastewater treatment dams and wastewater treatment plants gold mine waste and domestic waste the site experienced minimal urban and industrial effluent except for some agricultural inputs and the macrophyte that was found growing there was phragmites australis ss 2 was situated approximately 2 52 km downstream from site 1 ss 2 is in close proximity 1km northwest to industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants and cowles dam confluent and mine tailing this sampling point site experiences medium urban run off and high industrial effluent mckay et al 2018 and the macrophytes that were found there were phragmites australis typha capensis and eichhornia crassipes table 2 ss 3 and 4 were located approximately 1 11 km and 1 75 km downstream respectively from ss 2 after the confluence of both industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants and dams as well as the mine tailing phragmites australis typha capensis and eichhornia crassipes were found growing in these sites ss 5 and 6 were located approximately 3 57 km and 4 21 km downstream respectively from ss 4 just after the confluent of all the mine tailings waste and other confluence from upstream the wetland however ss 6 also experienced the confluent from the acid mine drainage treatment plant which was located in the western north of this sampling site these sampling sites experienced high urban runoff and the phragmites australis was dominant here 2 2 environmental water samples analysis 2 2 1 in situ parameter analysis representative water samples were taken in triplicates from six different sampling points at the blesbokspruit wetland which were identified using geographic information system mapping gism fig 1 these samples were collected for environmental elemental analysis preliminary in situ analysis of the sampling points was conducted using an h19829 multiparameter analytic instrument from hanna instruments usa water samples were collected using 100 ml schott bottles which were rinsed thoroughly three times with water from each sampling point to remove possible contaminants and then filled 1 ml of 1 v v hno3 was immediately added to the bottle of collected sample water to prevent the metals from precipitating sampling bottles were labelled according to the date time location coordinates as well as the specific location of sampling i e upstream ss 1 2 middle ss 3 4 downstream ss 5 6 as shown in table 1 the samples were placed in a cooler box with ice to maintain the temperature at about 4 c during transportation the samples were stored cool in the dark at 4 c before analysis using the standard inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes from arcos spectro analytical kleve germany procedure for the determination of heavy metal concentration readings from the multiparameter analyses was statistically analysed including the mean standard deviation and anova 2 2 2 ex situ parameter analysis icp oes the icp oes standards for ag as au cr cd cu fe hg mn ni pb and zn were prepared following the manufacturer s protocol to construct a calibration curve for these metals before quantification in icp oes deionized water was used as a blank before sample analysis the water samples were acidified by adding one drop of 5 hno3 to keep metals in the solution acidified water samples were then filtered using 0 4 μm filters the filtered water samples were delivered in 15 ml tubes and they were analysed in icp oes 2 3 macrophytes and sediments sampling for elemental analysis visual inspection and observation of different macrophytes species that exist in the blesbokspruit wetland were done at each sampling point to see which macrophytes species are thriving the species of macrophytes that were discovered were phragmites australis typha capensis and eichhornia crassipes fig 2 at each sampling site the most thriving macrophyte species were sampled along with water and or sediments using clean sterilized plastic buckets and containers 2 4 elemental analysis of macrophytes and sediments samples 2 4 1 icp oes analysis of sediments and macrophytes sediments and macrophytes samples roots and shoots from the sampling points were oven dried at 105 c for 6 h approximately 0 25 g of the crushed samples were transferred into a microwave digesting tube 9 ml of hno3 and 3 ml of hcl were added respectively the tubes were closed tightly and placed in a microwave digester anton paar multiwave 5000 country where the samples were treated at 180 c for 10 min after digestion the samples were diluted to a mark in a 50 ml falcon tube with deionized water the solution was then filtered through 0 45 μm filters then it was delivered into 15 ml tubes and they were analysed using icp oes 2 5 metal bio concentration and translocation the bioconcentration factor bcf and the translocation factor tf are imperative parameters for assessing the phytoremediation potential of macrophytes usman et al 2019 the bcf is the ratio of metal concentration in plant tissues to metal concentration in the sediments water whereas tf is the ratio of the metal concentration in the shoot to metal concentration in the roots bcf for roots is calculated as root sediment and shoots as shoot sediments for anchored macrophytes whereas free floating as root water and shoot water respectively tf is calculated as shoot root as shown in equations below 1 root bioconcentration factor bcf r c root c soil water 2 shoot bioconcentration factor bcf s c shoot c soil water 3 translocation factor tf bcf shoot bcf root where c root shoot is the concentration of heavy metals in macrophyte tissues mg kg and c soil water is the concentration of heavy metals in the surrounding environment mg kg or mg l bcf r is a bioconcentration factor of the roots l kg bcf s is a bioconcentration factor of the shoots l kg the bcf and tf of as cr ni and pb in macrophytes found at different sampling sites at the blesbokspruit wetland were evaluated and the method was adapted from usman et al 2020 2 6 morphological characterization of macrophytes roots 2 6 1 light microscope morphological characterization of the macrophytes samples was done by preparing permanent slides for a light microscope firstly the cross sections of macrophytes tissue roots samples were cut using a scalpel razor the plants specimen was then placed on a slide with a thin layer of film of mayer s albumen that has been spread uniformly by rubbing a drop of albumen on the surface of a slide vigorously with an index finger the instantaneous stoppage of all the activities of life of the tissue in their respective original state was done by adding a few drops of absolute alcohol over the specimen placed on the slide and the alcohol was allowed to evaporate the next step was the fixation and hardening of the plant tissue with formaldehyde and thorough washing of the fixative with 70 alcohol to ensure that the fixative doesn t spoil the plant tissue after fixation and hardening have been done staining with aqueous safranin for 3 to 4 mins was done then followed by a thorough washing of the tissue sample with water until the water remains colourless afterward dehydration was achieved by passing the tissue through a gradually increasing percentage of alcohol 15 alcohol 30 alcohol 50 alcohol 70 alcohol and 90 alcohol followed by staining with fast green prepared in 90 alcohol and then distaining with 90 alcohol followed absolute alcohol the samples were then decolorized with a gradually increasing percentage of xylol 25 xylol 50 xylol 70 xylol 90 xylol and pure xylol which was changed twice the samples were then mounted in canada balsam then the morphological study of the tissue sample was conducted under a light olympus cx23 microscope from futurama south africa using the phase contrast technique and this method was adapted from baldantoni et al 2009 gärtner and schweingruber 2013 2 6 2 scanning electron microscope the samples roots of macrophytes from each sampling site along the blesbokspruit wetland were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water the samples were then allowed to dry slowly at room temperature in the oven for 48 h the dried samples were mounted with a conductive bridge copper paste connected from the top surface of the sample holder the samples were then delivered into sample holders in scanning electron microscopy sem from joel instruments japan and the analysis was done 3 results and discussion 3 1 analyses of wetland water samples 3 1 1 in situ physio chemical analysis the in situ parameter analysis of the water samples at each sampling site was conducted using an h19829 multi parameter hanna instruments south africa and the results were recorded as shown in table 3 the average water temperature was 26 9 c with the highest temperature recorded at ss 2 28 1 c with the lowest in ss 3 at approximately 25 8 c the average pressure kpa was 84 08 kpa and the pressure in all the sampling sites was more or less the same with less significant changes further downstream the average ph was 7 40 with the highest in ss 6 followed by ss 1 3 2 4 and 5 respectively and all the ph values were within the who specifications dissolved oxygen do is a very important indicator of water quality as it directly informs the ability of the aquatic resource to support life do decrease from upstream to downstream with the highest do recorded at ss 1 however all of which were below recommended standards of saturation 80 120 dwa 1996 do is influenced by a number of factors especially organic matter decomposition biotic interaction with do is perceived to be non linear and dependent on species sensitivity baßmann et al 2020 observed the african catfish clarias gariepinus showed good growth parameters at 8 mg l oxygen do level while tilapia fish oreochromis niloticus was found to survive at low do concentrations of 0 5 1 0 mg l el sayed 2006 however fish species local to the blesbokspruit such as the common carp cyprinus carpio which are extremely tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions including extremely low dissolved oxygen waters were observed to record optimal specific growth rate of 5 5 d 1 at do range of 5 5 6 4 mgl 1 furthermore the increase in deoxygenation as observed downstream of the wetland have been shown to correlate with the decrease in orp wang et al 2015 redox potential orp plays a very important role in the modulation of biological and chemical processes in freshwater systems ge et al 2015 orp was within the range of 45 mv across the sampling sites with the highest recorded at ss 5 followed by ss 6 1 3 2 and 4 respectively orp ranging between 300 and 500 mv is a positive indication of water quality however the influx of sewage and industrial wastewater e g high in sulfite has the tendency of reducing the parameter in groundwater in the case of the blesbokspruit wetland the effect of point source discharge of acid mine drainage amd discharge with high concentrations of dissolved salt content including sulphates into the wetland have been recently reported in the literature lourenco and curtis 2021 using a before after control impact design to probe monitoring data their work established the impact of discharge resulting from amd wastewater treatment on water quality variables specifically conductivity downstream furthermore observations from this work suggest a positive correlation between conductivity and total dissolved solids tds rsq 0 99 both consistently increasing across the wetland ss 1 to 6 lourenco and curtis 2021 found conductivity at their study s proposed impact sites in the range of 70 131 ms m conditions deemed non acceptable given local regulations the average ec of 57 4 ms m and tds of 315 9 mg l across all sampling sites were validated by monitoring data by the dwa and recent reports tds of 416 mg l as positively correlated to high turbidity 113 ntu and reduced dissolved oxygen values 2 5 mg l reported in sampling site 6 is also suggestive of point source industrial discharge downstream exceeding both international regulatory standards the observed parameters suggested the dynamics of aquifer contamination are spatial considering the different sampling points showed different physicochemical characteristics the potential for wetland mineralisation was more localised to specific site locations and as facilitated by point discharge of industrial wastewater and agricultural run off incidents to be common around ss 2 and 3 based on the physicochemical profile especially with regards to water quality across the wetland the dynamics of pollutant influx as a direct function in the progression of eutrophication across the wetland is as critical as the indirect effect with regards to consequences for salt concentrations and cycling a redox potential range of 150 200 mv throughout the wetland suggests high nitrate and phosphate concentrations persist across the sampling points this in addition to evidence supporting the in flux frequency mineralisation considering tds as an excellent indicator of positive solute burdening across the sampling points peaking downstream at ss 5 and 6 and including the growth of invasive aquatic plant species are proof of a highly eutrophicated ecosystem albano pérez et al 2011 surmised the challenge of water hyacinth invasion of sa water resources is closely linked to phosphate concentration and dissolved oxygen profiles of the wetlands given the seeds of the plant have a selective advantage to grow rather quickly in such conditions 3 1 2 icp oes analyses of water samples water samples from the different sampling sites were analysed for their concentration of nine 9 heavy metals as cr co cu fe mn ni pb and zn evidence of the capacity of the blesbokspruit to continue to facilitate the attenuation of in stream heavy metals concentration is as illustrated in fig 2 this wetland function was found to be critical especially with regards to concentrations of lead zinc and manganese which as shown in table 4 very well exceeded the permissible limits by local regulation at ss1 but quickly neutralized to within target range downstream this trend was uniform for all heavy metals analysed with the respective mean concentrations in water sampled in ss 1 found to be significantly different p 0 05 with the exception of as p 0 05 our findings suggest the dynamics of as influx into the wetland is more uniform relative to other metals possibly from the oxidation of as sulphides like arsenopyrite and as rich pyrite by o2 and fe3 speciation resulting from geochemical processes relating to amd discharge into the wetland however as concentration despite maintaining levels in water was marginal and within the target range of water quality regulations the same report cannot be made of cu concentrations which continuously increased from ss2 5 exceeding the proposed target concentrations in the range 1 4 μg l reaching acute threshold effect range of 7 13 μg l metal speciation in aquatic ecosystem is a function of numerous biophysicochemical variables upon which ecological impacts including the risks of biomagnification toxicity bioavailability environmental mobility biogeochemical behaviour and potential risk are strongly dependent this is especially true for cu which in its ionic form is toxic to phytoplanktons and other essential aquatic species millero 2001 3 2 elemental analysis of sediments 3 2 1 icp oes analysis sediment as a non point source of wetland contamination and biomagnification risk is centred on their role in contaminant motility sediments can bind contaminants ultimately accumulating them and depending on physicochemical conditions release the heavy metals back into the water column at different potentially uncontaminated sites anzecc and armcanz 2000 icp oes analysis of the sediment samples as shown in fig 4 obtained across the blesbokspruit wetland revealed the pattern of respective heavy metal distribution in the wetland concentrations of chromium lead nickel and arsenic in the sediments were significantly high with chromium lead and arsenic peaking at 430 91 143 66 and 14 44 mg kg respectively at ss 4 manganese copper cobalt iron and zinc concentrations were also found to be significant in the benthic zone of the wetland a major bone of contention in sediment contamination analysis is the bioavailability of specific contaminants in the sediment and the causality especially with regard to physicochemical interactions and consequent ecological impacts gordon and muller 2010 in their report proposed the need for sqg and associated regulations in south africa however different standard methods such as the noaa have been applied internationally in countries including australia and new zealand while the us epa considers the equilibrium partitioning approach other methods include the consensus approach which integrates the strength of different methodologies across key variables such as causality bioavailability and mixture effects in sediment contamination assessment mccauley et al 2000 this study leveraged as a standard comparative reference the consensus based approach to heavy metal concentrations across probable pec and toxic tec threshold effects of the heavy metal concentration in freshwater sediments as proposed by macdonald et al 2000 table 5 evidence of nickel sediment contamination within the range of 150 10 mg kg was pronounced at ss 1 2 and 6 exceeding the critical limits for metals including erl erm tec and pec in sediments the observed concentrations of nickel in sediments at ss 1 and 2 can be directly correlated to the significantly high concentration of the metal in water samples at ss 1 fig 4 biomagnification of nickel like most of the investigated heavy metals have been linked with various pathological complications the most prevalent and well known of which is allergy in the form of contact dermatitis ahlström et al 2019 furthermore pulmonary fibrosis respiratory tract cancer iatrogenic intoxication liver damage and cardiovascular and kidney diseases could be observed which may be attributed to selective nickel deposition in the lungs heart diaphragm brain and spinal cord after inhalation and in bones parenchymal organs myocardium skin hair and various glands after ingestion genchi et al 2020 dudek adamska et al 2021 similarly chromium contamination also exceeded up to 3 5 times the severe effect threshold for the heavy metal in ss4 and at least 2 times other critical limits including threshold effect concentration tec and probable effect concentration pec in all the other sampling sites at 240 10 mgkg 1 the concentration of as in ss 3 4 and 5 exceeds effect range low erl but across all sampling sites is less than effect range medium erm table 4 only in ss 3 4 the concentration of as was found to be greater than the tec but across all the sampling sites its concentration was less than the pec limit also pb concentration in ss 3 4 exceeded the erl and tec limits however in all sampling sites pec limit was not exceeded the concentrations of as pb cr and ni in water at ss 1 were higher than what was found downstream at ss 4 fig 3 whereas in sediments it was the opposite as pb and cr sedimentation increased steadily from ss1 to ss4 before dropping further downstream ni sedimentation however decreased from ss1 to ss4 before slightly increasing in ss5 and ss6 respectively the leading hypothesis as regards considered the relatively low orp measurements at ss4 and the role of vegetation cover in the speciation of the heavy metals albeit with the knowledge of ni overload in ss1 ss4 is the first open water body of the first four sampling sites with extensive macrophyte cover which reduces water velocity thereby enhancing metal adsorption to soil organic matter and consequently sedimentation kotze 2000 heavy metal sedimentation and subsequent sequestration is a chief wetland function helping reduce the circulation of the metals and as a result limiting their harmful effect on living organisms see fig 4 3 3 phytoremediation of heavy metals in the blesbokspruit wetland phytoremediation is described as the bioaccumulation of contaminants from the ecosystem by natural plants with the help of associated microorganisms which accentuates the reduction of their bioavailability in the environment like sedimentation phytoextraction is also an important wetland process limiting the potential of biomagnification as it relates to the exposure of humans and macroorganisms to heavy metal toxicity an important technique gaining applicability in the reclamation of heavy metals and metalloids from contaminated sites phytoextraction involves the mobilization of heavy metals in the rhizosphere uptake by roots translocation sequestration and compartmentalisation in plant tissues ali et al 2013 three types of macrophytes found randomly distributed in the blesbokspruit wetland were the emergent phragmites australis pa and typha capensis tc and free flowing macrophytes eichhornia crassipes ec these macrophytes are monocots as validated by light and electron microscopy images which shows their vascular tissues forming a ring around the pith at the centre of the roots figs 5 and 6 to survive in anoxic environments these macrophytes developed aerenchyma in their roots which are enormous gas filled pockets bound together in a porous tissue facilitating improved diffusion of gases van dongen et al 2014 phragmites australis does not only have shallow widespread interweaving roots but also have adventitious roots which facilitate both water and nutrient uptake essential and non essential in wetlands armstrong et al 2000 typha capensis has thick fibrous roots that grow from the rhizome which helps to anchor the plant allowing it to withstand strong currents i e winds and water musara and aladejana 2020 eichhornia crassipes capture minute particles and remove the nutrients from the water column through their widespread branching roots with fine feathery hairs around the main fibrous roots williams 2006 during bioaccumulation these macrophytes store the elemental pollutants either in their roots or translocate them to the shoots 3 3 1 heavy metal concentration in macrophytes tissues proof of the phytoremedial capacities of the macrophytes species localised to the blesbokspruit abounds in literature klink 2017 odjegba and fasidi 2007 swain et al 2014 rezania et al 2019 bello et al 2018 the natural capability to adsorb heavy metals from aquatic ecosystems in tissues have mainly underlined recommendations for their application as an eco active approach to wetland sustainability the concentrations of heavy metals in shoots and root tissues of the three 3 macrophytes phragmites australis typha capensis and eichhornia crassipes as shown in figs 7 and 8 validates previous findings in literature a cumulative average across the three macrophytes shows the highest concentration in roots compared to the concentrations in shoots the concentration of metals in the shoots of emergent macrophytes phragmites australis typha capensis followed this trend ss 1 cr ni pb as ss 2 5 ni cr pb as ss 6 ni cr as pb while the metal concentration in the roots followed this trend ss 1 4 6 ni cr pb as and ss 5 ni as cr pb furthermore in e crassipes which was only found in ss2 3 and 4 the concentration of the metal in the shoot followed the trend ni cr pb as same as for emergent macrophytes at the same sites and the roots followed the trend cr ni pb as considering the consistency in the e crassipes bioaccumulation profile another remarkable finding from this study is that concentrations of metals found in the roots at ss3 were significantly higher than were found for t capensis and p australis at the other sampling sites neither t capensis nor p australis was found in ss3 and a high accumulation of ni in p australis root of 208 mg kg was recorded in ss5 and t capensis was 85 mg kg in ss2 while e crassipes roots had a ni concentration of 330 mg kg including cr and pb concentrations of approximately 342 mg kg and 116 mg kg respectively similarly the shoots of e crassipes held significantly higher concentrations of ni 51 5 mg kg and cr relative to the other macrophytes which held 50 of respective concentrations of the metals it is highly probable that competition for nutrients and resources also plays an important role in the spatial distribution of the macrophytes across the wetland the geophysical dynamics of ss3 favoured the growth and phytoactivities of ec relative to p australis and t capensis while high concentrations of metals suggest that the free floating macrophytes have a considerably higher bioaccumulation potential fig 9 3 3 2 bioconcentration factor bfc and translocation factor tf measurements the bioaccumulation and translocation of metals in macrophytes tissues roots and shoots have been evaluated using two important parameters which are the bioconcentration factor and translocation factor bioconcentration factor of macrophytes is an indication of the phenotypic trait of heavy metal adsorption accumulation in tissues while translocation factor provides valuable insights on the intra motility of the inorganics plants with relatively higher affinities ultra tolerance and adaptations for heavy metal uptake in plants as assessed using the bcf are referred to as hyperaccumulators hyperaccumulators possess ultra functional extraction abilities fast growth rates with considerable biomass densities and extensive root systems and resistance to pathogens which could play key roles in the geochemical cycling of inorganics in this kind of environment macrophytes with a bioconcentration factor bcf value greater than one are considered hyperaccumulators while the ones with a value less than one are non hyperaccumulators yan et al 2020 furthermore a translocation tf value of greater than one implies the macrophytes are very efficient in translocating heavy metals from the root to the shoot and as such have the potential for phytoextraction or rhizofiltration of heavy metals in sediments and water to this end tf values less than one indicate poor metal translocation implying the macrophytes deposit metals in their roots and rhizomes rather than their shoots and leaves mcgrath and zhao 2003 validated the aforementioned when they suggested macrophytes classified as hyperaccumulators have in addition shoot concentrations of cr ni and pb metals in excess of 1000 mg kg the use of plants as phytoextractors which do not exceed the aforementioned requirements can yet find applicability still considering characteristics including considerable biomass production short life cycle adaptation to the environment and non edibility the root bcf of emergent macrophytes pa and tc found in ss1 2 4 5 6 were found to all follow the trends ss1 6 as pb ni cr ss4 5 as ni pb cr ss2 pb as ni cr while the shoot bfc trends were ss1 2 ni pb as cr ss5 ss6 as ni pb cr and ss4 ni as pb cr furthermore the shoot and root bcf of both emergent macrophytes was less than one 1 across all four heavy metals of interest to this study throughout the different sampling sites the exception to this was with p australis bioconcentration of as and ni in ss5 which recorded 9 908 l kg and 2 825 l kg respectively and lastly the t capensis accumulation of as in ss4 1 145 l kg likewise tf for emergent macrophytes fig 10 suggested poor distribution of the heavy metals from root to shoot with maximum tf recorded at 0 794 1 for pa translocation of cr bcf findings for ni and cr accumulation and internal distribution in emergent macrophytes were consistent with values of 0 46 and 0 31 respectively which are in the range of previous findings reported in the literature for p australis bonanno and vymazal 2017 hooda 2007 nawrot et al 2021 reported bcf of up to 0 5 in the p australis of cr and ni of 0 7 1 1 the tf of p australis follows the trends i site 1 cr ni pb as ii site 5 ni pb cr as iii site 6 as ni pb cr and tf of t capensis follows the trends i site 2 cr ni pb as site 4 ni cr pb as the tf of both p australis and t capensis across all metals was less than one 1 the shoot bcf for all metals across the free floating macrophyte e crassipes found at various sampling sites ranges from 0 201 to 42 881 and the root bcf ranges from 0 389 to 40 5 l kg bcf trends pb cr ni as was consistent for both the shoot and root tissues in addition to which bcf values of 1 was obtained for the heavy metals regardless of plant tissue with the exception of ni and pb concentration in the shoots 0 2 and 0 6 l kg

the tf value of 1 for cr in e crassipes at ss2 the highest of all the analysed macrophytes fig 11 hyperaccumulation of heavy metals by e crassipes in the blesbokspruit is fundamental to the rhizofiltration and phytoextractive functions of the wetland 4 heavy metal contamination of the blesbokspruit wetland evidence of the distribution of heavy metals ni cr pb and as across the biotic and abiotic components of the blesbokspruit wetland are as summarized and visualized in table 6 the concentration gradients are represented in descending order from black 300 mg l red 150 300 mg l green 50 149 mg l yellow 5 49 mg l blue 0 4 9 mg l nickel is an essential trace metal required by organisms for their growth process but it also presents a moderate pollution potential especially in its bioavailable form chuan and yunus 2019 leguizamo et al 2017 proposed that ni becomes toxic to most plants at concentrations of 10 15 mg kg above which the metal can form reactive oxygen species ros in plants and induce membrane lipid peroxidase activity leading to chlorosis and necrosis ramachandra et al 2018 in humans the risk of exposure to ni includes skin rash dizziness coronary disease respiratory disorders headaches and fatigue khan et al 2008 evidence as presented by this study found ni concentration as high as 165 mg l in the water samples at ss 1 and a mean concentration of 41 5 mg l at all the sampling sites food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1985 permissible limit for ni and cr concentrations in water fit for agricultural use is 0 2 and 0 1 mg l respectively ni is used extensively in a number of industrial processes such as electroplating chemical marine and oil refining spikes in aqueous ni concentration is a commonly reported phenomenon upstream with starke 2004 reporting a 42 mg l concentration of nickel to an average of 2 mg l across 21 sampling points second highest was 0 2 mg l starke 2004 however the reported spike was from samples recovered from the now defunct geduld mine wastewater outlet cowles dam on map fig 1 high nickel concentrations as currently being presented is further up north surrounded by agricultural land as such the most probable cause of significant nickel contamination of water at ss 1 is very likely as a result of use of phosphatic fertilizers in extensive agricultural operations upstream fig 1 previous reports have drawn valid correlations between the application of phosphate fertilizer to nickel and chromium contamination of soil kabata pendias and mukherjee 2007 chauhan et al 2008 in south africa despite relatively low demand for fertilizers produced from phosphate rocks approximately 100 000tons annum 10 year average 2009 2018 are still used on local farmlands department of forestry and fisheries r of s a 2019 the hypothesis of ni influx through agricultural runoff around ss 1 however does not explain the relatively high concentration of the metal in water compared to the other metals of interest to this study across all the points investigated a consistent influx throughout the wetland or ni mobilization from pyrite oxidation processing resulting from acid mine drainage are secondary hypotheses cr which is also well concentrated in the wetland is characterised by relatively lower concentrations in water samples but significantly higher concentrations in sediments compared to nickel larsen and postma 1997 solubilisation of metals is crucial to their bioavailability and potential for biomagnification starke 2004 found approximately 78 of cr speciation in the blesbokspruit wetland to be in the inert fraction while up to 80 of ni was complexated with organic matter femn oxides and carbonates all of which facilitates the latter s solubility and bioavailability starke 2004 findings from the present study including the bioaccumulation trend by the different macrophytes is consistent with this hypothesis nickel uptake by all macrophytes was found to be relatively higher than for the other heavy metals even in t capensis bioaccumulating up to 85 mg kg root and shoot tissues at ss2 e crassipes was found to give the highest bioaccumulation potentials for all the heavy metals sequestrating up to 342 95 mg kg 330 51 mg kg and 116 63 mg kg of cr ni and pb in the root tissue p australis achieved the uptake of 208 38 mg kg 92 56 mg kg and 82 06 mg l in the root tissues for the heavy metals 4 1 control of wetland macrophytes a case for wetland bioeconomy the prevalence of wetland macrophytes is a significant factor in the natural hydrogeological processes necessary for the sustenance of the biodiversity in the blesbokspruit ecosystem macrophytes studied in this work showed varying potentials for the stabilization adsorption and accumulation of heavy metals present however these macrophytes also present other sets of challenges for freshwater ecology and chemistry p australis and t capensis prevalence in freshwater systems are associated with decreases in flora and faunal habitat diversity paxton and watts 2003 the direct effects of 1 macrophytes growth on nutrient deficiencies as positively correlated to phytoplankton productivity and 2 dead macrophyte decomposition on dissolved oxygen concentrations and increased anoxicity vis a vis the consequences for aquatic life underlines the environmental concerns of the prevalence of macrophytes species such as e crassipes e crassipes is widely acknowledged as a menacing species especially in tropical regions of the globe with even more damning socio economic impacts in water scarce regions such as south africa hill and olckers 2001 the plant is classified as a category 1b weed in terms of the national environmental management biodiversity act 2004 republic of south africa 2004 which according to the alien and invasive species regulations 2012 should be eradicated wherever possible evidently the prevention and removal of invasive species as a strategy for wetland maintenance is without doubt an environmental priority for local and international stakeholders three 3 main approaches are deployed in the local management of e crasspies in freshwater systems across the country and they include 1 mechanical cutting and or removal of the macrophytes 2 chemical control use of herbicides 3 biological control villamagna and murphy 2010 in situ eradication operations as typical of the chemical and biological control strategies are not without ecological consequences given the negative impacts on water quality wilson et al 2007 found neochetina spp weevils reduce the floatability of e crassipes causing them to sink to the wetland floor and decompose wilson et al 2007 the effects of this in the long term include significant water deoxygenation nutrient heavy metal deposition eutrophication algal bloom and other degrading ecological traits in addition the selectivity of herbicides and biological agents also presents valid causes of concern considering the threat of the strategies to non target components of the ecosystem simberloff and stiling 1996 ideally a nutrient reduction plan is the most sustainable solution for controlling e crassipes invasion musil and breen 1977 however active factors driving invasive macrophytes control cases in south africa are informed by site specific conditions e g size configuration seasonal weather patterns thayer and ramey 1986 designated uses of the waterbody gibbons et al 1994 and budget constraints in the case of the blesbokspruit and other wetlands across south africa the economic cost of removal as informed by macrophyte removal rate cost of labour cost of equipment and the frequency of treatment is currently the predominant and most important factor in deployed operations with regards as such these eradication focussed strategies have failed in part due to nominal commitment to the mitigation of solute burdening and a structured approach to the remediation of wetlands to this end recommendations of a circular bioeconomy model consolidating the nutrient accumulation potential and beneficiation of these wetland macrophytes could suffice fig 11 describes a number of this integrated biorefinery scenarios using e crasspies as subjects the respective scenarios combine the use of e crassipes as a rhizolfiltrating agent absorbing anthropogenic inorganics and as feedstock for low value high volume lv hv bio based commodities such as biogas biochar biofibres the models as described in the literature circumvent conventional risks with mechanical removal of macrophytes such as challenges with traditional disposal methods including the release of the immobilized heavy metals to the biosphere 5 conclusion the findings of the present study confirmed the presence of ni as cr and pb in water sediments and tissues of macrophytes growing along the blesbokspruit wetland heavy metal removal from this environment is primarily accomplished by sedimentation and of such metals ni and cr concentrations were very high in the sediments across the sampling sites phytoremediation in all three macrophytes indicates that heavy metals are stored in root tissues p australis had the highest bioaccumulation potential for ni as cr and pb at ss 5 where these metals were discovered in high quantities in the root tissues but in much lower concentrations in the shoot tissues despite high levels of ni in the water indicating that the retention threshold has been surpassed the high concentration of heavy metals in sediments and macrophyte tissues relative to water suggest that the wetland is still ultrafunctional in heavy metal decontamination p australis and e crassipes are well adapted and conditioned to absorb ni as and cr from the wetland ecosystem whereas t capensis was the least adapted and conditioned for ni as and cr absorption the contamination stress caused by ni cr and pb is highest between sites 3 and 4 with a noticeable increase in ni absorption by site 5 macrophytes possibly indicating a spill over it is important to remember that this could be the result of contaminated influx near the site or even a build up of influx from the source especially given the variations in wetland geography at site 4 on the magnitude of the other heavy metals evaluated in this study there was no evidence of high arsenic pollution the ni saturation is evident across both sedimentation and phytoremediation mechanisms of heavy metal removal with high concentrations found in sediments root tissues of p australis site 5 t capensis site 2 and e crassipes sites 3 and 4 e crassipes sites 3 4 and p australis site 5 root tissues had the highest ni concentrations and also cr concentrations were significantly high in the roots of e crassipes in site 3 therefore efforts to reduce the contamination of these heavy metals are clearly critical in order to conserve the blesbokspruit wetland ecosystem declaration of competing interest the

1230,blesbokspruit wetland is one of the least conserved ecosystems in the southern africa region with active and latent threats of anthropogenic contamination stretching over decades of mining wastewater discharge agricultural run off and a consistent influx of untreated sewage this study provides an insight into the present day spatial distribution of heavy metal contamination and the role of localised macrophytes in their phytoremediation with exception of the first sampling point the concentration of heavy metals in water samples throughout the wetland was within limits however findings from sediment samples were the inverse the concentrations of chromium and nickel significantly exceeded both effect range low erl and effect range medium erm limits 250 430 mg kg and 73 151 mg kg respectively as set out by international sediment quality guidelines emergent phragmites australis typha capensis and free flowing eichhornia crassipes macrophytes which are naturally localised to the wetland were found to have varying bioaccumulation potential for different heavy metals bioconcentration of heavy metals in emergent macrophytes was relatively low especially for nickel and chromium compared to free flowing macrophytes e crassipes accumulated significant amounts of the heavy metals with root concentrations of up to 17 23 116 6 330 5 and 342 9 mg kg for arsenic lead nickel and chromium respectively the emergent macrophytes were however found to bioconcentrate arsenic up to 1 15 l kg t capensis and 9 9 l kg p australis at sites 4 and 5 respectively findings with regards to bioconcentration especially of the e crassipes validate recommendations for the utilization of hyperaccumulating macrophytes for the natural recovery of these heavy metals towards alleviating the anthropogenic stress on this valuable ecosystem keywords bioaccumulation heavy metals pollution phytoremediation water resource management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction central to the economic outlook of south africa is the extraction and processing of a wide range of minerals such as coal diamond gold copper lead iron ore chrome emerald fluorspar ilmenite manganese nickel vanadium zinc tin silica uranium zircon and phosphate ebenebe et al 2017 the consequence of these mining activities is the generation of vast amounts of waste which directly contributes to localised concentrations of heavy metals that are released into the environment heavy metals including zn ni co cu fe cr i b mn se as ag cd pb hg and mo burden receiving aquifers are toxic to living organisms at concentrations above their respective threshold limits tchounwou et al 2012 alloway 2013 in addition to leachates from mining operations other anthropogenic sources of heavy metals include fertilizers pesticides untreated industrial wastewater e wastes wastes from smelting ores sewage sludge etc ramachandra et al 2018 heavy metals are non degradable by any biological or chemical mechanism and as a result they remain in the environment providing a considerable hazard to people in the long run accumulating in the human body through biomagnification and creating a serious health risk sarwar et al 2010 rehman et al 2021 evidence of physiological and psychological diseases linked to heavy metals in humans have received substantial attention in the literature and continues to do so arif et al 2016 ali and khan 2018 ali et al 2019 yan et al 2020 ali et al 2021 wetlands are important aquatic ecosystems that provide critical functions to the natural environment and society the south african national water act national water act 1998 defined wetlands as areas of land which is transitional between terrestrial and aquatic systems by virtue of relatively high water table levels usually at or near the surface a consequence of which being the land is periodically saturated wetlands typically support vegetation hydrophytes which are adapted to life in saturated soil cowardin and golet 1995 wetland ecosystems are characterised by relatively higher carbon density relative to terrestrial ecosystems thus they are significant players in biogeochemical and carbon cycles moomaw et al 2018 their role in short carbon cycling is highlighted by approximately 30 of land based carbon being stored in peatlands limpens et al 2008 in addition they act as sponges trapping floodwater and contaminants including heavy metals and pathogenic microorganisms through several biological and chemical processes bae et al 2017 kumar and kanaujia 2018 despite their importance as emphasized by local and international regulations recent biodiversity assessments of wetlands suggest they are the most threatened and the least protected ecosystem in southern africa skowno et al 2019 threats to wetland diversity in the region have been directly linked to ecologically toxic agents emerging from the aforementioned anthropogenic sources the blesbokspruit wetland system is a high altitude ramsar wetland of global significance and the largest permanent wetland in the highveld region of south africa mckay et al 2018 ecological degradation of blesbokspruit wetland have been a matter of intense interest for decades with literature proof of the effects of acid mine water discharge from the surrounding mine dumps in particular secondary salinity high organic loads from incessant sewerage discharge and invasive plant species domination which are all suggestive of compromised water quality ultra mineralisation eutrophication and ecological degradation of the aquatic ecosystem du plessis et al 2014 ambani and annegarn 2015 the montreux record of ramsar site degradation 1996 recognised the blesbokspruit wetland over 2 decades ago flagging the active threats of mine water discharge pollution to the ecosystem with the aim of initiating remedial measures however trends in influx continue to oppose resource conservation strategies necessary to revive the ecological health of the wetland sedietso 2019 naidoo 2022 wetland biodiversity is highly susceptible to compromise by heavy metal influx and deposition either in solid or dissolved forms the inorganics by means of sedimentation are absorbed by the granular medium of the wetland and can be released back into the water via deposition dissociation dissolution including redox processes violante et al 2010 the primary factor influencing the mobilization and demobilization processes is the physicochemical conditions of the media air water and sediments influencing bioavailability and the risk of biomagnification du laing et al 2008 sobolev and begonia 2008 in addition to sedimentation the accumulation of heavy metals by localised macrophytes also plays a significant role in maintaining the eco balance of wetland ecosystems macrophytes are natural bioaccumulators of heavy metals with varying absorbance capacity for heavy metals removed from the environment huang et al 2020 ouma et al 2022 phytoremediation by macrophytes can be accomplished through various mechanisms including phytodegradation rhizofiltration phytovolatilization and phytoaccumulation phytoextraction during phytodegradation macrophytes release certain enzymes e g nitrilase dehalogenase nitrate reductase laccase peroxidases peroxygenases cytochrome p450 glutathione s transferases and carboxylesterases to transform which often lead to mineralisation of organic compounds such as nitrates phosphates sulfates dyes and pesticides into non toxic or less toxic compounds which could be incorporated in macrophytes tissues and result within the enhancement of certain metabolic activities and growth of the macrophytes öztürk et al 2016 durand et al 2018 arora 2020 rhizofiltration limits heavy metal motility by adsorption on the roots surface of macrophytes including in certain cases absorption thus confining these contaminants into subterranean water tiwari et al 2018 this form of remediation is efficient for eradicating radioactive contaminants agricultural runoff and heavy metals such as ca cr cu pb and zn which are normally locked up in the sediments eevers et al 2017 ali et al 2020 another mechanism by which macrophytes ease heavy metal concentration of water soil and trophic biota is by phytovolatilization wherein they absorb heavy metals e g hg se as from the sediments or water convert them to a less hazardous volatile form and then release them into the atmosphere when they transpire via their foliage system limmer and burken

involve mobilization of the heavy metal root uptake xylem loading root to shoot transport cellular compartmentation and sequestration bioavailability of heavy metals is optimized by means of root exudates secretion which modulates rhizosphere conditions in favour of cell wall sorption and the passive diffusion or active transport of the metals across the plasma membrane mediated by metal ion carriers or complexing agents peer et al 2005a 2005b mahmood et al 2010 yeh et al 2015 ismail and moustafa 2016 as such macrophytes especially are regarded as excellent indicators of heavy metal contamination in wetland systems and hyperaccumulators especially doubling as eco friendly biofilters with potential for remediation application krems et al 2013 ladislas et al 2012 preliminary findings as informed by previous reports on the blesbokspruit wetland suggest an interesting wetland ecosystem characterised by relatively high concentrations of heavy metals as such this study explored the potentials for biomonitoring and phytoremediation of different macrophytes localised to the blesbokspruit wetland the solute burdening of the blesbokspruit wetland is hypothesized here to be reflected in the concentrations of heavy metals in the biotic tissue of emergent macrophytes phragmites australis and typha capensis and free floating macrophytes eichhornia crassipes and abiotic components of the wetland the concentration of heavy metals were analysed in water samples and sediments while detected metals as cr ni pb listed as priority pollutants by the united states environmental protection agency usepa usepa 2007 were also analysed for in the macrophytes tissues of the aforementioned plants growing at different locations across the wetland these findings were correlated to quality criteria and regulatory threshold limits for the respective contaminants in addition the bioaccumulation potential established by means of calculating the bioconcentration and translocation factors of the different macrophytes are as presented in relation to recommendations of the potentials of localised macrophytes for phytoextraction towards the ecological restoration of the wetland 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study was conducted in mid summer of the year 2021 at blesbokspruit wetland from 26010l56 65ll s 28028l24 84ll e to 26015l20 31ll s 28029l58 53ll e the blesbokpruit wetland covers 1858 ha and stretches about 21 km at an altitude of 1585 m amsl anglogold and ashanti 2004 du plessis et al 2014 ambani and annegarn 2015 the blesbokspruit wetland is surrounded by 5 towns in the east rand region springs boksburg benoni brakpan and nigel making this wetland an important ecosystem within a highly urbanised economic hub this wetland is a major tributary of the vaal river which provides water to 10 million people du plessis et al 2014 mckay et al 2018 the six sampling sites ss were selected along the blesbokspruit wetland and they were designated as upstream ss 1 2 middle stream ss 3 4 and downstream ss 5 6 table 1 ss 1 is surrounded by agricultural lands which was upstream from the wastewater treatment dams and wastewater treatment plants gold mine waste and domestic waste the site experienced minimal urban and industrial effluent except for some agricultural inputs and the macrophyte that was found growing there was phragmites australis ss 2 was situated approximately 2 52 km downstream from site 1 ss 2 is in close proximity 1km northwest to industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants and cowles dam confluent and mine tailing this sampling point site experiences medium urban run off and high industrial effluent mckay et al 2018 and the macrophytes that were found there were phragmites australis typha capensis and eichhornia crassipes table 2 ss 3 and 4 were located approximately 1 11 km and 1 75 km downstream respectively from ss 2 after the confluence of both industrial and municipal wastewater treatment plants and dams as well as the mine tailing phragmites australis typha capensis and eichhornia crassipes were found growing in these sites ss 5 and 6 were located approximately 3 57 km and 4 21 km downstream respectively from ss 4 just after the confluent of all the mine tailings waste and other confluence from upstream the wetland however ss 6 also experienced the confluent from the acid mine drainage treatment plant which was located in the western north of this sampling site these sampling sites experienced high urban runoff and the phragmites australis was dominant here 2 2 environmental water samples analysis 2 2 1 in situ parameter analysis representative water samples were taken in triplicates from six different sampling points at the blesbokspruit wetland which were identified using geographic information system mapping gism fig 1 these samples were collected for environmental elemental analysis preliminary in situ analysis of the sampling points was conducted using an h19829 multiparameter analytic instrument from hanna instruments usa water samples were collected using 100 ml schott bottles which were rinsed thoroughly three times with water from each sampling point to remove possible contaminants and then filled 1 ml of 1 v v hno3 was immediately added to the bottle of collected sample water to prevent the metals from precipitating sampling bottles were labelled according to the date time location coordinates as well as the specific location of sampling i e upstream ss 1 2 middle ss 3 4 downstream ss 5 6 as shown in table 1 the samples were placed in a cooler box with ice to maintain the temperature at about 4 c during transportation the samples were stored cool in the dark at 4 c before analysis using the standard inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry icp oes from arcos spectro analytical kleve germany procedure for the determination of heavy metal concentration readings from the multiparameter analyses was statistically analysed including the mean standard deviation and anova 2 2 2 ex situ parameter analysis icp oes the icp oes standards for ag as au cr cd cu fe hg mn ni pb and zn were prepared following the manufacturer s protocol to construct a calibration curve for these metals before quantification in icp oes deionized water was used as a blank before sample analysis the water samples were acidified by adding one drop of 5 hno3 to keep metals in the solution acidified water samples were then filtered using 0 4 μm filters the filtered water samples were delivered in 15 ml tubes and they were analysed in icp oes 2 3 macrophytes and sediments sampling for elemental analysis visual inspection and observation of different macrophytes species that exist in the blesbokspruit wetland were done at each sampling point to see which macrophytes species are thriving the species of macrophytes that were discovered were phragmites australis typha capensis and eichhornia crassipes fig 2 at each sampling site the most thriving macrophyte species were sampled along with water and or sediments using clean sterilized plastic buckets and containers 2 4 elemental analysis of macrophytes and sediments samples 2 4 1 icp oes analysis of sediments and macrophytes sediments and macrophytes samples roots and shoots from the sampling points were oven dried at 105 c for 6 h approximately 0 25 g of the crushed samples were transferred into a microwave digesting tube 9 ml of hno3 and 3 ml of hcl were added respectively the tubes were closed tightly and placed in a microwave digester anton paar multiwave 5000 country where the samples were treated at 180 c for 10 min after digestion the samples were diluted to a mark in a 50 ml falcon tube with deionized water the solution was then filtered through 0 45 μm filters then it was delivered into 15 ml tubes and they were analysed using icp oes 2 5 metal bio concentration and translocation the bioconcentration factor bcf and the translocation factor tf are imperative parameters for assessing the phytoremediation potential of macrophytes usman et al 2019 the bcf is the ratio of metal concentration in plant tissues to metal concentration in the sediments water whereas tf is the ratio of the metal concentration in the shoot to metal concentration in the roots bcf for roots is calculated as root sediment and shoots as shoot sediments for anchored macrophytes whereas free floating as root water and shoot water respectively tf is calculated as shoot root as shown in equations below 1 root bioconcentration factor bcf r c root c soil water 2 shoot bioconcentration factor bcf s c shoot c soil water 3 translocation factor tf bcf shoot bcf root where c root shoot is the concentration of heavy metals in macrophyte tissues mg kg and c soil water is the concentration of heavy metals in the surrounding environment mg kg or mg l bcf r is a bioconcentration factor of the roots l kg bcf s is a bioconcentration factor of the shoots l kg the bcf and tf of as cr ni and pb in macrophytes found at different sampling sites at the blesbokspruit wetland were evaluated and the method was adapted from usman et al 2020 2 6 morphological characterization of macrophytes roots 2 6 1 light microscope morphological characterization of the macrophytes samples was done by preparing permanent slides for a light microscope firstly the cross sections of macrophytes tissue roots samples were cut using a scalpel razor the plants specimen was then placed on a slide with a thin layer of film of mayer s albumen that has been spread uniformly by rubbing a drop of albumen on the surface of a slide vigorously with an index finger the instantaneous stoppage of all the activities of life of the tissue in their respective original state was done by adding a few drops of absolute alcohol over the specimen placed on the slide and the alcohol was allowed to evaporate the next step was the fixation and hardening of the plant tissue with formaldehyde and thorough washing of the fixative with 70 alcohol to ensure that the fixative doesn t spoil the plant tissue after fixation and hardening have been done staining with aqueous safranin for 3 to 4 mins was done then followed by a thorough washing of the tissue sample with water until the water remains colourless afterward dehydration was achieved by passing the tissue through a gradually increasing percentage of alcohol 15 alcohol 30 alcohol 50 alcohol 70 alcohol and 90 alcohol followed by staining with fast green prepared in 90 alcohol and then distaining with 90 alcohol followed absolute alcohol the samples were then decolorized with a gradually increasing percentage of xylol 25 xylol 50 xylol 70 xylol 90 xylol and pure xylol which was changed twice the samples were then mounted in canada balsam then the morphological study of the tissue sample was conducted under a light olympus cx23 microscope from futurama south africa using the phase contrast technique and this method was adapted from baldantoni et al 2009 gärtner and schweingruber 2013 2 6 2 scanning electron microscope the samples roots of macrophytes from each sampling site along the blesbokspruit wetland were rinsed thoroughly with deionized water the samples were then allowed to dry slowly at room temperature in the oven for 48 h the dried samples were mounted with a conductive bridge copper paste connected from the top surface of the sample holder the samples were then delivered into sample holders in scanning electron microscopy sem from joel instruments japan and the analysis was done 3 results and discussion 3 1 analyses of wetland water samples 3 1 1 in situ physio chemical analysis the in situ parameter analysis of the water samples at each sampling site was conducted using an h19829 multi parameter hanna instruments south africa and the results were recorded as shown in table 3 the average water temperature was 26 9 c with the highest temperature recorded at ss 2 28 1 c with the lowest in ss 3 at approximately 25 8 c the average pressure kpa was 84 08 kpa and the pressure in all the sampling sites was more or less the same with less significant changes further downstream the average ph was 7 40 with the highest in ss 6 followed by ss 1 3 2 4 and 5 respectively and all the ph values were within the who specifications dissolved oxygen do is a very important indicator of water quality as it directly informs the ability of the aquatic resource to support life do decrease from upstream to downstream with the highest do recorded at ss 1 however all of which were below recommended standards of saturation 80 120 dwa 1996 do is influenced by a number of factors especially organic matter decomposition biotic interaction with do is perceived to be non linear and dependent on species sensitivity baßmann et al 2020 observed the african catfish clarias gariepinus showed good growth parameters at 8 mg l oxygen do level while tilapia fish oreochromis niloticus was found to survive at low do concentrations of 0 5 1 0 mg l el sayed 2006 however fish species local to the blesbokspruit such as the common carp cyprinus carpio which are extremely tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions including extremely low dissolved oxygen waters were observed to record optimal specific growth rate of 5 5 d 1 at do range of 5 5 6 4 mgl 1 furthermore the increase in deoxygenation as observed downstream of the wetland have been shown to correlate with the decrease in orp wang et al 2015 redox potential orp plays a very important role in the modulation of biological and chemical processes in freshwater systems ge et al 2015 orp was within the range of 45 mv across the sampling sites with the highest recorded at ss 5 followed by ss 6 1 3 2 and 4 respectively orp ranging between 300 and 500 mv is a positive indication of water quality however the influx of sewage and industrial wastewater e g high in sulfite has the tendency of reducing the parameter in groundwater in the case of the blesbokspruit wetland the effect of point source discharge of acid mine drainage amd discharge with high concentrations of dissolved salt content including sulphates into the wetland have been recently reported in the literature lourenco and curtis 2021 using a before after control impact design to probe monitoring data their work established the impact of discharge resulting from amd wastewater treatment on water quality variables specifically conductivity downstream furthermore observations from this work suggest a positive correlation between conductivity and total dissolved solids tds rsq 0 99 both consistently increasing across the wetland ss 1 to 6 lourenco and curtis 2021 found conductivity at their study s proposed impact sites in the range of 70 131 ms m conditions deemed non acceptable given local regulations the average ec of 57 4 ms m and tds of 315 9 mg l across all sampling sites were validated by monitoring data by the dwa and recent reports tds of 416 mg l as positively correlated to high turbidity 113 ntu and reduced dissolved oxygen values 2 5 mg l reported in sampling site 6 is also suggestive of point source industrial discharge downstream exceeding both international regulatory standards the observed parameters suggested the dynamics of aquifer contamination are spatial considering the different sampling points showed different physicochemical characteristics the potential for wetland mineralisation was more localised to specific site locations and as facilitated by point discharge of industrial wastewater and agricultural run off incidents to be common around ss 2 and 3 based on the physicochemical profile especially with regards to water quality across the wetland the dynamics of pollutant influx as a direct function in the progression of eutrophication across the wetland is as critical as the indirect effect with regards to consequences for salt concentrations and cycling a redox potential range of 150 200 mv throughout the wetland suggests high nitrate and phosphate concentrations persist across the sampling points this in addition to evidence supporting the in flux frequency mineralisation considering tds as an excellent indicator of positive solute burdening across the sampling points peaking downstream at ss 5 and 6 and including the growth of invasive aquatic plant species are proof of a highly eutrophicated ecosystem albano pérez et al 2011 surmised the challenge of water hyacinth invasion of sa water resources is closely linked to phosphate concentration and dissolved oxygen profiles of the wetlands given the seeds of the plant have a selective advantage to grow rather quickly in such conditions 3 1 2 icp oes analyses of water samples water samples from the different sampling sites were analysed for their concentration of nine 9 heavy metals as cr co cu fe mn ni pb and zn evidence of the capacity of the blesbokspruit to continue to facilitate the attenuation of in stream heavy metals concentration is as illustrated in fig 2 this wetland function was found to be critical especially with regards to concentrations of lead zinc and manganese which as shown in table 4 very well exceeded the permissible limits by local regulation at ss1 but quickly neutralized to within target range downstream this trend was uniform for all heavy metals analysed with the respective mean concentrations in water sampled in ss 1 found to be significantly different p 0 05 with the exception of as p 0 05 our findings suggest the dynamics of as influx into the wetland is more uniform relative to other metals possibly from the oxidation of as sulphides like arsenopyrite and as rich pyrite by o2 and fe3 speciation resulting from geochemical processes relating to amd discharge into the wetland however as concentration despite maintaining levels in water was marginal and within the target range of water quality regulations the same report cannot be made of cu concentrations which continuously increased from ss2 5 exceeding the proposed target concentrations in the range 1 4 μg l reaching acute threshold effect range of 7 13 μg l metal speciation in aquatic ecosystem is a function of numerous biophysicochemical variables upon which ecological impacts including the risks of biomagnification toxicity bioavailability environmental mobility biogeochemical behaviour and potential risk are strongly dependent this is especially true for cu which in its ionic form is toxic to phytoplanktons and other essential aquatic species millero 2001 3 2 elemental analysis of sediments 3 2 1 icp oes analysis sediment as a non point source of wetland contamination and biomagnification risk is centred on their role in contaminant motility sediments can bind contaminants ultimately accumulating them and depending on physicochemical conditions release the heavy metals back into the water column at different potentially uncontaminated sites anzecc and armcanz 2000 icp oes analysis of the sediment samples as shown in fig 4 obtained across the blesbokspruit wetland revealed the pattern of respective heavy metal distribution in the wetland concentrations of chromium lead nickel and arsenic in the sediments were significantly high with chromium lead and arsenic peaking at 430 91 143 66 and 14 44 mg kg respectively at ss 4 manganese copper cobalt iron and zinc concentrations were also found to be significant in the benthic zone of the wetland a major bone of contention in sediment contamination analysis is the bioavailability of specific contaminants in the sediment and the causality especially with regard to physicochemical interactions and consequent ecological impacts gordon and muller 2010 in their report proposed the need for sqg and associated regulations in south africa however different standard methods such as the noaa have been applied internationally in countries including australia and new zealand while the us epa considers the equilibrium partitioning approach other methods include the consensus approach which integrates the strength of different methodologies across key variables such as causality bioavailability and mixture effects in sediment contamination assessment mccauley et al 2000 this study leveraged as a standard comparative reference the consensus based approach to heavy metal concentrations across probable pec and toxic tec threshold effects of the heavy metal concentration in freshwater sediments as proposed by macdonald et al 2000 table 5 evidence of nickel sediment contamination within the range of 150 10 mg kg was pronounced at ss 1 2 and 6 exceeding the critical limits for metals including erl erm tec and pec in sediments the observed concentrations of nickel in sediments at ss 1 and 2 can be directly correlated to the significantly high concentration of the metal in water samples at ss 1 fig 4 biomagnification of nickel like most of the investigated heavy metals have been linked with various pathological complications the most prevalent and well known of which is allergy in the form of contact dermatitis ahlström et al 2019 furthermore pulmonary fibrosis respiratory tract cancer iatrogenic intoxication liver damage and cardiovascular and kidney diseases could be observed which may be attributed to selective nickel deposition in the lungs heart diaphragm brain and spinal cord after inhalation and in bones parenchymal organs myocardium skin hair and various glands after ingestion genchi et al 2020 dudek adamska et al 2021 similarly chromium contamination also exceeded up to 3 5 times the severe effect threshold for the heavy metal in ss4 and at least 2 times other critical limits including threshold effect concentration tec and probable effect concentration pec in all the other sampling sites at 240 10 mgkg 1 the concentration of as in ss 3 4 and 5 exceeds effect range low erl but across all sampling sites is less than effect range medium erm table 4 only in ss 3 4 the concentration of as was found to be greater than the tec but across all the sampling sites its concentration was less than the pec limit also pb concentration in ss 3 4 exceeded the erl and tec limits however in all sampling sites pec limit was not exceeded the concentrations of as pb cr and ni in water at ss 1 were higher than what was found downstream at ss 4 fig 3 whereas in sediments it was the opposite as pb and cr sedimentation increased steadily from ss1 to ss4 before dropping further downstream ni sedimentation however decreased from ss1 to ss4 before slightly increasing in ss5 and ss6 respectively the leading hypothesis as regards considered the relatively low orp measurements at ss4 and the role of vegetation cover in the speciation of the heavy metals albeit with the knowledge of ni overload in ss1 ss4 is the first open water body of the first four sampling sites with extensive macrophyte cover which reduces water velocity thereby enhancing metal adsorption to soil organic matter and consequently sedimentation kotze 2000 heavy metal sedimentation and subsequent sequestration is a chief wetland function helping reduce the circulation of the metals and as a result limiting their harmful effect on living organisms see fig 4 3 3 phytoremediation of heavy metals in the blesbokspruit wetland phytoremediation is described as the bioaccumulation of contaminants from the ecosystem by natural plants with the help of associated microorganisms which accentuates the reduction of their bioavailability in the environment like sedimentation phytoextraction is also an important wetland process limiting the potential of biomagnification as it relates to the exposure of humans and macroorganisms to heavy metal toxicity an important technique gaining applicability in the reclamation of heavy metals and metalloids from contaminated sites phytoextraction involves the mobilization of heavy metals in the rhizosphere uptake by roots translocation sequestration and compartmentalisation in plant tissues ali et al 2013 three types of macrophytes found randomly distributed in the blesbokspruit wetland were the emergent phragmites australis pa and typha capensis tc and free flowing macrophytes eichhornia crassipes ec these macrophytes are monocots as validated by light and electron microscopy images which shows their vascular tissues forming a ring around the pith at the centre of the roots figs 5 and 6 to survive in anoxic environments these macrophytes developed aerenchyma in their roots which are enormous gas filled pockets bound together in a porous tissue facilitating improved diffusion of gases van dongen et al 2014 phragmites australis does not only have shallow widespread interweaving roots but also have adventitious roots which facilitate both water and nutrient uptake essential and non essential in wetlands armstrong et al 2000 typha capensis has thick fibrous roots that grow from the rhizome which helps to anchor the plant allowing it to withstand strong currents i e winds and water musara and aladejana 2020 eichhornia crassipes capture minute particles and remove the nutrients from the water column through their widespread branching roots with fine feathery hairs around the main fibrous roots williams 2006 during bioaccumulation these macrophytes store the elemental pollutants either in their roots or translocate them to the shoots 3 3 1 heavy metal concentration in macrophytes tissues proof of the phytoremedial capacities of the macrophytes species localised to the blesbokspruit abounds in literature klink 2017 odjegba and fasidi 2007 swain et al 2014 rezania et al 2019 bello et al 2018 the natural capability to adsorb heavy metals from aquatic ecosystems in tissues have mainly underlined recommendations for their application as an eco active approach to wetland sustainability the concentrations of heavy metals in shoots and root tissues of the three 3 macrophytes phragmites australis typha capensis and eichhornia crassipes as shown in figs 7 and 8 validates previous findings in literature a cumulative average across the three macrophytes shows the highest concentration in roots compared to the concentrations in shoots the concentration of metals in the shoots of emergent macrophytes phragmites australis typha capensis followed this trend ss 1 cr ni pb as ss 2 5 ni cr pb as ss 6 ni cr as pb while the metal concentration in the roots followed this trend ss 1 4 6 ni cr pb as and ss 5 ni as cr pb furthermore in e crassipes which was only found in ss2 3 and 4 the concentration of the metal in the shoot followed the trend ni cr pb as same as for emergent macrophytes at the same sites and the roots followed the trend cr ni pb as considering the consistency in the e crassipes bioaccumulation profile another remarkable finding from this study is that concentrations of metals found in the roots at ss3 were significantly higher than were found for t capensis and p australis at the other sampling sites neither t capensis nor p australis was found in ss3 and a high accumulation of ni in p australis root of 208 mg kg was recorded in ss5 and t capensis was 85 mg kg in ss2 while e crassipes roots had a ni concentration of 330 mg kg including cr and pb concentrations of approximately 342 mg kg and 116 mg kg respectively similarly the shoots of e crassipes held significantly higher concentrations of ni 51 5 mg kg and cr relative to the other macrophytes which held 50 of respective concentrations of the metals it is highly probable that competition for nutrients and resources also plays an important role in the spatial distribution of the macrophytes across the wetland the geophysical dynamics of ss3 favoured the growth and phytoactivities of ec relative to p australis and t capensis while high concentrations of metals suggest that the free floating macrophytes have a considerably higher bioaccumulation potential fig 9 3 3 2 bioconcentration factor bfc and translocation factor tf measurements the bioaccumulation and translocation of metals in macrophytes tissues roots and shoots have been evaluated using two important parameters which are the bioconcentration factor and translocation factor bioconcentration factor of macrophytes is an indication of the phenotypic trait of heavy metal adsorption accumulation in tissues while translocation factor provides valuable insights on the intra motility of the inorganics plants with relatively higher affinities ultra tolerance and adaptations for heavy metal uptake in plants as assessed using the bcf are referred to as hyperaccumulators hyperaccumulators possess ultra functional extraction abilities fast growth rates with considerable biomass densities and extensive root systems and resistance to pathogens which could play key roles in the geochemical cycling of inorganics in this kind of environment macrophytes with a bioconcentration factor bcf value greater than one are considered hyperaccumulators while the ones with a value less than one are non hyperaccumulators yan et al 2020 furthermore a translocation tf value of greater than one implies the macrophytes are very efficient in translocating heavy metals from the root to the shoot and as such have the potential for phytoextraction or rhizofiltration of heavy metals in sediments and water to this end tf values less than one indicate poor metal translocation implying the macrophytes deposit metals in their roots and rhizomes rather than their shoots and leaves mcgrath and zhao 2003 validated the aforementioned when they suggested macrophytes classified as hyperaccumulators have in addition shoot concentrations of cr ni and pb metals in excess of 1000 mg kg the use of plants as phytoextractors which do not exceed the aforementioned requirements can yet find applicability still considering characteristics including considerable biomass production short life cycle adaptation to the environment and non edibility the root bcf of emergent macrophytes pa and tc found in ss1 2 4 5 6 were found to all follow the trends ss1 6 as pb ni cr ss4 5 as ni pb cr ss2 pb as ni cr while the shoot bfc trends were ss1 2 ni pb as cr ss5 ss6 as ni pb cr and ss4 ni as pb cr furthermore the shoot and root bcf of both emergent macrophytes was less than one 1 across all four heavy metals of interest to this study throughout the different sampling sites the exception to this was with p australis bioconcentration of as and ni in ss5 which recorded 9 908 l kg and 2 825 l kg respectively and lastly the t capensis accumulation of as in ss4 1 145 l kg likewise tf for emergent macrophytes fig 10 suggested poor distribution of the heavy metals from root to shoot with maximum tf recorded at 0 794 1 for pa translocation of cr bcf findings for ni and cr accumulation and internal distribution in emergent macrophytes were consistent with values of 0 46 and 0 31 respectively which are in the range of previous findings reported in the literature for p australis bonanno and vymazal 2017 hooda 2007 nawrot et al 2021 reported bcf of up to 0 5 in the p australis of cr and ni of 0 7 1 1 the tf of p australis follows the trends i site 1 cr ni pb as ii site 5 ni pb cr as iii site 6 as ni pb cr and tf of t capensis follows the trends i site 2 cr ni pb as site 4 ni cr pb as the tf of both p australis and t capensis across all metals was less than one 1 the shoot bcf for all metals across the free floating macrophyte e crassipes found at various sampling sites ranges from 0 201 to 42 881 and the root bcf ranges from 0 389 to 40 5 l kg bcf trends pb cr ni as was consistent for both the shoot and root tissues in addition to which bcf values of 1 was obtained for the heavy metals regardless of plant tissue with the exception of ni and pb concentration in the shoots 0 2 and 0 6 l kg respectively and ni bioconcentration in roots 0 389 l kg of the plant at ss2 furthermore the mobilization of chromium especially validates the potential of the plant for hyperaccumulation considering the tf value of 1 for cr in e crassipes at ss2 the highest of all the analysed macrophytes fig 11 hyperaccumulation of heavy metals by e crassipes in the blesbokspruit is fundamental to the rhizofiltration and phytoextractive functions of the wetland 4 heavy metal contamination of the blesbokspruit wetland evidence of the distribution of heavy metals ni cr pb and as across the biotic and abiotic components of the blesbokspruit wetland are as summarized and visualized in table 6 the concentration gradients are represented in descending order from black 300 mg l red 150 300 mg l green 50 149 mg l yellow 5 49 mg l blue 0 4 9 mg l nickel is an essential trace metal required by organisms for their growth process but it also presents a moderate pollution potential especially in its bioavailable form chuan and yunus 2019 leguizamo et al 2017 proposed that ni becomes toxic to most plants at concentrations of 10 15 mg kg above which the metal can form reactive oxygen species ros in plants and induce membrane lipid peroxidase activity leading to chlorosis and necrosis ramachandra et al 2018 in humans the risk of exposure to ni includes skin rash dizziness coronary disease respiratory disorders headaches and fatigue khan et al 2008 evidence as presented by this study found ni concentration as high as 165 mg l in the water samples at ss 1 and a mean concentration of 41 5 mg l at all the sampling sites food and agriculture organization of the united nations fao 1985 permissible limit for ni and cr concentrations in water fit for agricultural use is 0 2 and 0 1 mg l respectively ni is used extensively in a number of industrial processes such as electroplating chemical marine and oil refining spikes in aqueous ni concentration is a commonly reported phenomenon upstream with starke 2004 reporting a 42 mg l concentration of nickel to an average of 2 mg l across 21 sampling points second highest was 0 2 mg l starke 2004 however the reported spike was from samples recovered from the now defunct geduld mine wastewater outlet cowles dam on map fig 1 high nickel concentrations as currently being presented is further up north surrounded by agricultural land as such the most probable cause of significant nickel contamination of water at ss 1 is very likely as a result of use of phosphatic fertilizers in extensive agricultural operations upstream fig 1 previous reports have drawn valid correlations between the application of phosphate fertilizer to nickel and chromium contamination of soil kabata pendias and mukherjee 2007 chauhan et al 2008 in south africa despite relatively low demand for fertilizers produced from phosphate rocks approximately 100 000tons annum 10 year average 2009 2018 are still used on local farmlands department of forestry and fisheries r of s a 2019 the hypothesis of ni influx through agricultural runoff around ss 1 however does not explain the relatively high concentration of the metal in water compared to the other metals of interest to this study across all the points investigated a consistent influx throughout the wetland or ni mobilization from pyrite oxidation processing resulting from acid mine drainage are secondary hypotheses cr which is also well concentrated in the wetland is characterised by relatively lower concentrations in water samples but significantly higher concentrations in sediments compared to nickel larsen and postma 1997 solubilisation of metals is crucial to their bioavailability and potential for biomagnification starke 2004 found approximately 78 of cr speciation in the blesbokspruit wetland to be in the inert fraction while up to 80 of ni was complexated with organic matter femn oxides and carbonates all of which facilitates the latter s solubility and bioavailability starke 2004 findings from the present study including the bioaccumulation trend by the different macrophytes is consistent with this hypothesis nickel uptake by all macrophytes was found to be relatively higher than for the other heavy metals even in t capensis bioaccumulating up to 85 mg kg root and shoot tissues at ss2 e crassipes was found to give the highest bioaccumulation potentials for all the heavy metals sequestrating up to 342 95 mg kg 330 51 mg kg and 116 63 mg kg of cr ni and pb in the root tissue p australis achieved the uptake of 208 38 mg kg 92 56 mg kg and 82 06 mg l in the root tissues for the heavy metals 4 1 control of wetland macrophytes a case for wetland bioeconomy the prevalence of wetland macrophytes is a significant factor in the natural hydrogeological processes necessary for the sustenance of the biodiversity in the blesbokspruit ecosystem macrophytes studied in this work showed varying potentials for the stabilization adsorption and accumulation of heavy metals present however these macrophytes also present other sets of challenges for freshwater ecology and chemistry p australis and t capensis prevalence in freshwater systems are associated with decreases in flora and faunal habitat diversity paxton and watts 2003 the direct effects of 1 macrophytes growth on nutrient deficiencies as positively correlated to phytoplankton productivity and 2 dead macrophyte decomposition on dissolved oxygen concentrations and increased anoxicity vis a vis the consequences for aquatic life underlines the environmental concerns of the prevalence of macrophytes species such as e crassipes e crassipes is widely acknowledged as a menacing species especially in tropical regions of the globe with even more damning socio economic impacts in water scarce regions such as south africa hill and olckers 2001 the plant is classified as a category 1b weed in terms of the national environmental management biodiversity act 2004 republic of south africa 2004 which according to the alien and invasive species regulations 2012 should be eradicated wherever possible evidently the prevention and removal of invasive species as a strategy for wetland maintenance is without doubt an environmental priority for local and international stakeholders three 3 main approaches are deployed in the local management of e crasspies in freshwater systems across the country and they include 1 mechanical cutting and or removal of the macrophytes 2 chemical control use of herbicides 3 biological control villamagna and murphy 2010 in situ eradication operations as typical of the chemical and biological control strategies are not without ecological consequences given the negative impacts on water quality wilson et al 2007 found neochetina spp weevils reduce the floatability of e crassipes causing them to sink to the wetland floor and decompose wilson et al 2007 the effects of this in the long term include significant water deoxygenation nutrient heavy metal deposition eutrophication algal bloom and other degrading ecological traits in addition the selectivity of herbicides and biological agents also presents valid causes of concern considering the threat of the strategies to non target components of the ecosystem simberloff and stiling 1996 ideally a nutrient reduction plan is the most sustainable solution for controlling e crassipes invasion musil and breen 1977 however active factors driving invasive macrophytes control cases in south africa are informed by site specific conditions e g size configuration seasonal weather patterns thayer and ramey 1986 designated uses of the waterbody gibbons et al 1994 and budget constraints in the case of the blesbokspruit and other wetlands across south africa the economic cost of removal as informed by macrophyte removal rate cost of labour cost of equipment and the frequency of treatment is currently the predominant and most important factor in deployed operations with regards as such these eradication focussed strategies have failed in part due to nominal commitment to the mitigation of solute burdening and a structured approach to the remediation of wetlands to this end recommendations of a circular bioeconomy model consolidating the nutrient accumulation potential and beneficiation of these wetland macrophytes could suffice fig 11 describes a number of this integrated biorefinery scenarios using e crasspies as subjects the respective scenarios combine the use of e crassipes as a rhizolfiltrating agent absorbing anthropogenic inorganics and as feedstock for low value high volume lv hv bio based commodities such as biogas biochar biofibres the models as described in the literature circumvent conventional risks with mechanical removal of macrophytes such as challenges with traditional disposal methods including the release of the immobilized heavy metals to the biosphere 5 conclusion the findings of the present study confirmed the presence of ni as cr and pb in water sediments and tissues of macrophytes growing along the blesbokspruit wetland heavy metal removal from this environment is primarily accomplished by sedimentation and of such metals ni and cr concentrations were very high in the sediments across the sampling sites phytoremediation in all three macrophytes indicates that heavy metals are stored in root tissues p australis had the highest bioaccumulation potential for ni as cr and pb at ss 5 where these metals were discovered in high quantities in the root tissues but in much lower concentrations in the shoot tissues despite high levels of ni in the water indicating that the retention threshold has been surpassed the high concentration of heavy metals in sediments and macrophyte tissues relative to water suggest that the wetland is still ultrafunctional in heavy metal decontamination p australis and e crassipes are well adapted and conditioned to absorb ni as and cr from the wetland ecosystem whereas t capensis was the least adapted and conditioned for ni as and cr absorption the contamination stress caused by ni cr and pb is highest between sites 3 and 4 with a noticeable increase in ni absorption by site 5 macrophytes possibly indicating a spill over it is important to remember that this could be the result of contaminated influx near the site or even a build up of influx from the source especially given the variations in wetland geography at site 4 on the magnitude of the other heavy metals evaluated in this study there was no evidence of high arsenic pollution the ni saturation is evident across both sedimentation and phytoremediation mechanisms of heavy metal removal with high concentrations found in sediments root tissues of p australis site 5 t capensis site 2 and e crassipes sites 3 and 4 e crassipes sites 3 4 and p australis site 5 root tissues had the highest ni concentrations and also cr concentrations were significantly high in the roots of e crassipes in site 3 therefore efforts to reduce the contamination of these heavy metals are clearly critical in order to conserve the blesbokspruit wetland ecosystem declaration of competing interest the

1231,historical contamination of freshwater lakes with hydrocarbons hc due to anthropogenic activities represents a serious problem worldwide this study was focused on hydrocarbons contaminated sediments sampled in lake alūksne of glacial origin in northeast latvia the batch experiments were aimed at evaluating the effect of bio stimulation and bioaugmentation on the biodegradation of hydrocarbons in lake sediments ls as well as changes in microbial community structure and metabolic activity the sediments were sampled from two points of the lake 4 5 m and 8 m depth respectively these samples slightly differed by colour count of diatoms microbial respiration intensity and colour intensity of 2 6 dichlorophenolindophenol nevertheless the trend in biodegradation activity was similar for both ls samples the concentration of hc in ls during the 32 day incubation decreased in average from 465 mg kg to 165 mg kg and 117 5 mg kg in the ls amended with nutrients and nutrients microbial community respectively different treatment types of ls resulted in differences in microbial respiration and hc degrading activity the shotgun sequencing has revealed the main phyla present in the intact ls being proteobacteria 48 8 actinobacteria 24 4 firmicutes 10 4 and bacteroidetes 5 0 incubation of ls for 32 days resulted in increasing abundance of proteobacteria from 48 8 in the raw ls to 58 62 mainly due to the increase of betaproteobacteria the functional annotation of gene families revealed that the most abundant gene families were associated with atp binding metal ion magnesium ion sulfur cluster zinc ion binding dna binding and other essential components for cell functioning the shannon biodiversity index of culturable microorganisms in ecoplates ranged from 2 28 to 2 85 the data obtained in this study indicated that the suggested approach is a potent remediation technology for further ex situ scaling up graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

organic contaminants representing one of the main sources of pollution therefore posing medium term and long term risks to humans and ecosystem health in general similarly many industrial wastes and effluents particularly those from primary metal petroleum refining pulp and paper and chemical industries are genotoxic thus threatening the health and viability of aquatic biota chen and white 2004 lofrano et al 2017 in recent years many remediation technologies including physical chemical biological and combined methods have been proposed and adopted for the purpose of solving the problems of sediment contamination song et al 2017 one of the remediation methods microbial bioremediation has proven itself to be one of the most cost effective highly efficient and with a low adverse impact to the surrounding environment zhang et al 2012 microbial bioremediation transforms or degrades hazardous chemicals like petroleum products into nontoxic or less toxic substances by bacteria yeast or fungi kumar et al 2018 most common approaches of bioremediation are bioaugmentation addition of pre grown microbial cultures to intensify the degradation of unwanted compounds and bio stimulation addition of nutrients and other components to enhance the remediation process tribedi et al 2018 tyagi et al 2011 indigenous microbial populations may not have the full ability to process the complex mixture of spilled petroleum products therefore addition of nutrients to the system improves the degradation potential of the inhabiting microbial population mapelli et al 2017 tyagi et al 2011 one of the aspects of bio stimulation is that it also enhances the microbe ability to produce biosurfactants which are amphiphiles of microbial origin with surface active properties jahan et al 2020 using a microbial community rather than a pure culture for the bioremediation is more advantageous as it provides the metabolic diversity and robustness needed for field applications tyagi et al 2011 the ability of the newly introduced microbial consortia to compete with indigenous bacteria predators and numerous abiotic factors is also critical to the process success tribedi et al 2018 the bioaugmentation method has been used with promising results but it has also failed insufficient substrates temperature variations ph nutritional limits competition between foreign and indigenous microorganisms phase infections pollution load shock protozoa grazing and factors connected with quorum sensing qs have all been cited as probable causes of failure nzila et al 2016 the use of geotextile tubes for collection and dewatering of contaminated lake sediments has been proposed by many authors alimohammadi et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 ma et al 2021 physical and chemical properties of sediments as well as contamination type should be characterized to develop the most feasible cost effective and practical solution the subject for this study in alūksne s lake was organic sediments with thickness varied from 1 to 12 m these ls are water saturated contain high amounts of humus and characterized as historically contaminated with hydrocarbons hc due to certain hydrological conditions there is a risk of overgrowth between the island of maria and the west coast of the lake where the depth doesn t exceed almost two meters the best solution to avoid this overgrowth would be removal of sediments we hypothesized that dewatering of ls in geotextile tubes could be accompanied with bioremediation processes in that case it is critical to understand the roles and network interactions in sediment microbial communities as well as their responses to environmental changes yan et al 2021 our study was aimed at evaluating the effect of bio stimulation and bioaugmentation in the biodegradation of hc contaminated ls experiment setup was designed for further ex situ bioremediation in geotextile tubes the parameters tested in this study include taxonomic and functional

dichlorophenolindophenol dcpip as well as biodegradation of hc 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of alūksne lake and sediment collection alūksne lake is the eleventh largest lake in latvia 15 7 km2 situated 183 7 m above the sea level the main subject for research in alūksne s lake is organic sediments such as sludge or mud hereafter sludge its thickness varies from 1 m to 12 m with the typical colour of sludge being black sludge contains high amount of humus and is water saturated the average dry matter is roughly 20 and organic substances between 20 and 60 the natural sludge moisture content of alūksne lake around 65 85 dry matter concentration 15 35 the surface of sludge is affected by the oxidation of fes2 which occurs from air contact and changes colour from grey to brown grey in terms of odours the presence of oil and hydrogen sulphide pollution is not to feel as it differs from organic substances which has an odour of swampy sediments there is a risk of overgrowth between the island of maria and the west coast of the lake where depth doesn t exceed almost 2 m the best solution to avoid this overgrowth would be removal of sediments which would result in the increase of depth in this sector at least for 2 m sludge thickness in alūksne lake is most significant in the west sector the shallowness of the lake allows to increase the growth of reeds which leads to overgrowth of 10 30 m wide belt of historical coastline the formation and accumulation of these sludge sediments occurred because of the present hydrological conditions that is why the upper part of west coast of alūksne lake is characterized as low bearing capacity layer and has no economical use the establishment of sludge sediments and crossection of organic sediment beds are described in fig 1 the sediments were sampled from two points of the lake ls 1 4 5 m and ls 2 8 m using a kc van veen bottom grab sampler fig 1 2 2 batch experiment with lake sediments the laboratory experiment was established immediately the batch incubation was performed in polypropylene 5 l vessels for a total period of 32 days which was divided in two stages differed by treatment types the first stage 15 days represented bio stimulation while the next 17 days were bioaugmentation one kg of wet ls dry weight of ls 1 and ls 2 was 5 20 0 24 and 10 43 0 01 respectively was placed in a

to 1 kg of ls in six containers while ls in another three containers remained without nutrients the preparation bioversal is an aqueous combination of detergents polyvalent compounds and hetero organic substances the prepared mixtures were incubated for 15 days at 23 c with periodic aeration and mixing daily for the next 17 days of incubation six containers with nutrient amended ls were divided into two groups i e three of them did not receive any amendments while another three containers were bioaugmented with a microbial community which was previously isolated from hc contaminated soils the physical conditions of incubation remained the same at 23 c with periodic aeration and mixing daily the experiment setup is shown in fig s1 abbreviation for the types of ls treatment are as follows raw ls non incubated and non treated ls which was immediately frozen on the sampling day ls k incubated ls without amendments for 32 days ls n incubated ls with nutrient amendments for 32 days

laser scanning microscopy the samples of ls were fixed with 96 ethanol and stained with propidium iodide pi at a concentration of 20 μm ml the samples were analysed with a leica dm ra 2 confocal laser scanning microscope germany equipped with a tcs sl confocal scanning head the dye pi molecules were excited with a 488 nm laser band and the fluorescence was detected between 600 nm and 640 nm wavelengths the diatom quantification method of abrantes et al 2005 was modified and used in this study temporary microscope slides were prepared by adding a drop of ls to a slide and covering it with a coverslip quantification of diatoms was done at 400 magnification using a light microscope motic china estimation of the relative abundance of the diatoms was based on the percentage of the total number of algae obtained for each genus from the counting of 10 random fields of view on 3 replicate slides for each sample 2 6 testing of microbial dna in ls 2 6 1 dna extraction and shotgun

performed using non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds with bray curtis distance method employing phyloseq package 3 results 3 1 the counts of colony forming units in lake sediments upon incubation changes on the number of culturable microorganisms in lake sediments serve as one of the most important criteria for evaluating the treatment efficacy especially at the beginning of bioremediation as shown in fig 2 incubation of ls stimulated proliferation of microorganisms was because of intensive mixing and aeration addition of nutrients at the beginning of incubation resulted in notable increasing in cfu count as compared to the non amended ls particularly in both biostimulated sediments derived from ls 1 and ls 2 the number of cfu increased up to 1 5 2 0 orders while non amended sediments were up 1 order respectively addition of microbial community for bioaugmentation during the next 17 days did not result in a significant rise of cfu growth fig 2 3 2 respiration intensity and hydrocarbons degrading ability of microorganisms after 32 days of incubation microbial respiration is widely used for measuring the catabolitic response profile of microorganisms in different environments including ls torres et al 2011 in our study the microbial respiration in the raw and treated ls samples was compared in order to assess the changes of catabolic activity upon treatment as shown in fig 3a the raw ls demonstrated the highest respiration intensity comparing with treated samples with the lowest values detected in ls k after 32 days of incubation dropping by 72 5 and 72 9 in ls 1 and ls 2 respectively this fact may indicate to the high metabolic activity of microbial communities during incubation which resulted in exhausting of available c sources in ls k and therefore decreasing respiration activity in turn biostimulation and bioaugmentation resulted only in a slight decrease of respiration intensity as compared to the raw ls fig 3a moreover the nutrient amendments which were added at the beginning of incubation still supported microbial respiration even after 32 days furthermore this effect could be explained by a higher functional adaptation of microorganisms in utilizing c substrates including hc substrate as will be reported below biodegradation of hc in ls n and ls b was considerably higher than in ls k fig 4 biodegradation potentials of microbes present in ls before and after treatment were determined using a colorimetric approach utilizing the dcpip which detects the oxidation of nadh to nad related to hc degradation by bacteria the utilization of substrate can be observed based on the loss of indicator s blue colour this method has also been reported to be used as a preliminary approach for isolating hc degrading bacteria in a number of studies habib et al 2017 kubota et al 2008 muter et al 2019 in our lake sediment samples ls 1 showed a higher dcpip utilization in raw ls compared to that of ls 2 sediment with od620 of ls being 0 08 0 01 and 0 07 0 01 respectively fig 3b bioaugmented sample in ls 1 had a 50 decrease in dcpip indicator colour intensity comparing to the raw ls with od620 values decreasing from 0 08 0 01 to 0 04 0 02 whereas the ls b sample in ls 2 had a 20 6 decrease with od620 values decreasing from 0 07 0 01 in raw ls to 0 05 0 01 in ls b fig 3b this presents higher bioaugmentation effectivity in the ls 1 sample it might be possible that the microbial community for bioaugmentation wasn t as effective in the ls 2 sample because of nutritional limits pollution load shock or the petroleum product particles present might be too large for microbes to metabolize in both ls 1 and ls 2 samples mixing and aeration in ls k showed the most effectivity with od620 values 0 04 0 01 and 0 03 0 01 respectively fig 3b 3 2 1 biodegradation of petroleum products the concentration of petroleum products in ls containing mixtures was measured at the end of the 32 day experiment results indicated that aeration and mixing in ls k reduced the petroleum concentration by 22 7 in ls 1 and 9 8 in ls 2 biostimulation by addition of nutrients and surfactants ls n reduced it by 65 4 in ls 1 and 63 4 in ls 2 and addition of microbial community for bioaugmentation ls b to biostimulated mixtures reduced petroleum product concentration by 79 8 in ls 1 and 68 3 in ls 2 fig 4 the contribution of biostimulation for hc biodegradation was higher than that of bioaugmentation particularly an average reduction of petroleum products in biostimulated and bioaugmented sets ls b was only by 9 7 higher than that in biostimulated sets ls n as compared to ls fig 4 nevertheless bioaugmentation remains to be a powerful tool in biodegradation processes in a similar experiment done by yuan et al 2018 it was proven that bioaugmentation was more effective than bio stimulation in removing petroleum products importantly the efficiency of bioremediation depends on composition of contamination containing potentially toxic compounds the recent study on contamination of the alūksne lake reported by purmalis and burlakovs 2017 showed that concentration of total hc in the contaminated part of the lake varied in the range from 24 to 906 to mg kg tested in a depth up to 2 m authors noted that oil products in the lake diffuse close by source due to lack of hydrological dynamics and properties of pollutants which bind with organic matter in sediments concentrations of heavy metals i e cr ni cu zn cd pb as in the tested samples did not exceed geochemical background purmalis and burlakovs 2017 3 3 abundance of diatoms several genus of diatoms were identified and counted in samples ls 1 and ls 2 most common of which include cocconeis melosira navicula pinnularia cyclotella surirella and gomphonema fig s2 s3 diatoms unicellular algae which are frequently the most abundant component of stream biofilms are sensitive to changes in water chemistry and respond quickly to environmental changes such as the rise of pollution tolerant species lavoie et al 2018 the total amount of diatom cells counted in ls 2 sample was 2 6 3 3 times less than in the ls 1 sample data not shown due to the ls 2 sample being visibly more polluted with crystal like sediment particles seen under the microscope there might have been less light availability making the environment less suitable to diatom growth lange et al 2011 also recorded the decrease of relative abundance of common diatom taxa under reduced light 3 4 taxonomic analysis of microbial communities for the taxonomic analysis of microbial communities we chose the ls 1 sample being one of two representative ls samples examination of the metagenome revealed prevalence of bacterial dna among classified reads which varied in the range from 22 3 to 27 4 of reads for the treated ls samples and for the raw ls and microbial community was 16 0 and 97 4 of reads over 70 of reads in the treated samples remained unclassified fig s4a the percentage of viral reads were 0 04 for raw ls as well as all the treated ls samples the amount of fungal reads were 0 12 for both ls n and ls b and 0 13 for raw ls and ls k as for the proportion of protozoan reads ls n and ls b showed a 33 3 increase from the raw ls with values of 0 08 and 0 06 respectively microbial community for bioaugmentation showed the smallest amount of protozoan viral and fungal reads ranging between 0 003 and 0 005 fig s4b lake sediment incubated without treatment showed a decreased eukaryote dna by 2 5 and increased bacteria dna by 3 9 compared to the raw ls fig s4c the treatment of ls resulted in significant changes in the bacterial community fig 5 the main phyla present in ls samples were proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes particularly proteobacteria dominated in the ls k with 61 7 reads which consisted of 31 9 14 9 14 3 and 4 3 of betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria respectively incubation of ls for 32 days resulted in increasing abundance of proteobacteria from 48 8 in the raw ls to 61 7 59 3 and 58 0 in ls k ls n and ls b respectively mainly due to increase of betapoteobacteria the highest abundance of proteobacteria among the treated samples were in ls k with 61 7 reads where betaproteobacteria was dominating at 31 9 fig 5a and b importantly this effect was observed also for ls b which was amended with a microbial community where gammaproteobacteria dominated 91 6 fig 5b in similar studies of petroleum product contaminated lakes sequences of proteobacteria 17 48 actinobacteria 19 44 and cyanobacteria 17 48 dominated in the communities at all sites the epsilon and delta classes were the least represented while the alpha beta and gamma classes were the most represented zemskaya et al 2015 regarding the role of betaproteobacteria in degradation processes many isolates are capable of aerobic or anaerobic degradation of aromatic hc parales 2010 on an order level the most abundant among treated samples was burkholderiales with relative abundance of 32 5 in ls k 32 2 in ls b and 29 3 in ls n fig 5c the importance of the burkholderiales order in the degradation of a wide range of aromatic compounds including a number of priority pollutants has been widely assumed pérez pantoja et al 2012 more specifically comamonadaceae a family of bacteria belonging to the order burkholderiales had the highest relative abundance across treated samples on a family level with 35 5 of reads in ls k 34 7 in ls b and 28 6 in ls n fig 5d the comamonadaceae family has been shown to be capable of degrading gasoline additives toluene and aromatics chen et al 2015 nicholls et al 2020 regarding gammaproteobacteria the treatment with nutrients only in ls n resulted in a higher relative abundance of pseudomonas compared to biostimulated and bioaugmented sample with 35 8 and 21 0 of reads respectively fig 5e more specifically the effect of biostimulation with nutrients at species level showed a high relative abundance of pseudomonas sp hls 6 with 77 1 of reads and 37 2 of reads in ls b fig 5f pseudomonas are one of the biosurfactant producers in oil contaminated marine waters worldwide mapelli et al 2017 similar to the nutritional needs of other organisms oil degrading microbes also require nutrients for optimal growth and development these nutrients are available in the natural environment but occur in low quantities macaulay 2015 thus this may explain the high yield of pseudomonas in the nutrient treated samples abundance of actinobacteria reduced significantly in the treated samples from 24 4 in the raw ls to 9 1 15 8 in the ls after incubation with the highest value being in ls k whereas all the treated samples showed an increase of bacteroidetes ranging from 12 7 to 15 2 the highest reads being in ls n compared to the raw ls with 5 0 fig 5a alpha and beta diversity measurements of the samples sequenced by shotgun methodology are presented in fig 6 the shift in the microbial community structure as a result of biostimulation is quite predictable however the changes are specific and depend on the properties of sediments treatment type and composition of nutrients added different types of surfactants which are used in case of hydrophobic contamination considerably influence the metabiome changes can cause a decrease in metabolic activity but not decrease the biodiversity of the studied system staninska pięta et al 2019 these changes often occur at the initial stage of treatment thus szczepaniak and coauthors szczepaniak et al 2016 reported that bioaugmentation and addition of surfactants rhamnolipids to the soil spiked with polycyclic aromatic hc positively influenced the bioremediation process especially during the early stage of treatment i e first three months of the 12 month experiment in our study the commercially available preparation of surfactants that contain structures comparable to naturally occurring microbial surfactants have been widely used in large scale bioremediation applications as well as research experiments martienssen and schirmer 2007 nevertheless the effect of the surfactants preparation alone on biodegradation efficiency was not tested in our study 3 5 functional analysis functional analysis of the ls 1 revealed 4128 gene families from which the most abundant gene families were associated with atp binding go 0005524 5 8 6 2 cytoplasm go 0005737 5 8 7 1 metal ion binding go 0046872 2 7 2 9 dna binding go 0003677 1 9 2 7 and integral component of membrane go 0016021 1 9 3 2 fig s5 all of which are necessary components of microorganisms the metabolic pathway relative abundance in the treated and non treated ls after 32 days of incubation is presented in fig s6 among 28 pathways detected at least in one of the sets above 1 the most abundant was pwy 3781 aerobic respiration i cytochrome c with a relative abundance of 1 30 1 44 0 95 and 0 96 in ls ls k ls n and ls b respectively fig s6 these data are quite unexpected because of sampling depth 4 5 m and 8 m and therefore need to be clarified in further research 3 6 metabolic biodiversity of culturable microorganisms biolog ecoplates were used to assess bacterial functional diversity by measuring their ability to oxidize carbon substrates microorganisms release free electrons while using carbon sources which causes a specific colour response with tetrazolium violet and the depth of the chroma indicates the microorganisms carbon source consumption level ge et al 2018 ls1 used more carbon sources than ls2 when comparing the two ls samples with 20 substrates in ls1 and 11 in ls2 the most utilized substrates in ls1 sample were d galacturonic acid tween 40 and d mannitol while for ls2 sample were tween 80 i erythriol and tween 40 with 0 55 the shannon diversity index for intact ls 1 and ls 2 was found to be 2 85 and 2 28 respectively 4 conclusions the main results obtained in this study are summarized in the following conclusions 1 biostimulation and bioaugmentation as the treatment methods of the historically hc contaminated ls demonstrated an average decrease of hc concentrations after 32 days of incubation by 65 and 75 respectively two ls samples taken at different sites of the alūksne lake have shown the similar trend on microbial respiration intensity hc degrading activity and degradation of hc that evidence representativeness of the tested sediments 2 the contribution of biostimulation alone for hc biodegradation ls n was higher than that of bioaugmentation which was applied in combination with biostimulation ls b particularly an average reduction of petroleum products in biostimulated and bioaugmented sets ls b was only by 9 7 higher than that in biostimulated sets ls n as compared to ls nevertheless bioaugmentation remains to be a powerful tool in biodegradation processes the yield of bioaugmentation could considerably change if the treatment scheme is altered such as by the addition of a microbial community at the beginning of the treatment together with nutrients or without nutrients the data on shotgun sequencing have shown that gammaproteobacteria which dominated in the microbial community have been displaced by betaproteobacteria which dominated in all treated ls samples after 32 days of incubation this fact indicated that the tested conditions were not appropriate for microbial community used for bioaugmentation 3 characterization of catabolic activity of microbial communities before and after treatments have revealed a prolonged after 32 days respiration intensity in ls n and ls b while the potential hc degrading activity was found to be increased in all treated samples i e ls k ls n and ls b 4 among the most abundant gene families the genes responsible for aerobic respiration were dominant in this respect aerobic conditions were chosen for this study as the most appropriate on the other hand it would be important to check the hc degradation potential for this microbial community also under anaerobic conditions 5 regarding application of the bioremediation processes in geotextile tubes further research is necessary to develop most feasible cost effective and practical solution in particular scaling up of this approach should emphasize a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field and

1231,historical contamination of freshwater lakes with hydrocarbons hc due to anthropogenic activities represents a serious problem worldwide this study was focused on hydrocarbons contaminated sediments sampled in lake alūksne of glacial origin in northeast latvia the batch experiments were aimed at evaluating the effect of bio stimulation and bioaugmentation on the biodegradation of hydrocarbons in lake sediments ls as well as changes in microbial community structure and metabolic activity the sediments were sampled from two points of the lake 4 5 m and 8 m depth respectively these samples slightly differed by colour count of diatoms microbial respiration intensity and colour intensity of 2 6 dichlorophenolindophenol nevertheless the trend in biodegradation activity was similar for both ls samples the concentration of hc in ls during the 32 day incubation decreased in average from 465 mg kg to 165 mg kg and 117 5 mg kg in the ls amended with nutrients and nutrients microbial community respectively different treatment types of ls resulted in differences in microbial respiration and hc degrading activity the shotgun sequencing has revealed the main phyla present in the intact ls being proteobacteria 48 8 actinobacteria 24 4 firmicutes 10 4 and bacteroidetes 5 0 incubation of ls for 32 days resulted in increasing abundance of proteobacteria from 48 8 in the raw ls to 58 62 mainly due to the increase of betaproteobacteria the functional annotation of gene families revealed that the most abundant gene families were associated with atp binding metal ion magnesium ion sulfur cluster zinc ion binding dna binding and other essential components for cell functioning the shannon biodiversity index of culturable microorganisms in ecoplates ranged from 2 28 to 2 85 the data obtained in this study indicated that the suggested approach is a potent remediation technology for further ex situ scaling up graphical abstract unlabelled image keywords

effluents particularly those from primary metal petroleum refining pulp and paper and chemical industries are genotoxic thus threatening the health and viability of aquatic biota chen and white 2004 lofrano et al 2017 in recent years many remediation technologies including physical chemical biological and combined methods have been proposed and adopted for the purpose of solving the problems of sediment contamination song et al 2017 one of the remediation methods microbial bioremediation has proven itself to be one of the most cost effective highly efficient and with a low adverse impact to the surrounding environment zhang et al 2012 microbial bioremediation transforms or degrades hazardous chemicals like petroleum products into nontoxic or less toxic substances by bacteria yeast or fungi kumar et al 2018 most common approaches of bioremediation are bioaugmentation addition of pre grown microbial cultures to intensify the degradation of unwanted compounds and bio stimulation addition of nutrients and other components to enhance the remediation process tribedi et al 2018 tyagi et al 2011 indigenous microbial populations may not have the full ability to process the complex mixture of spilled petroleum products therefore addition of nutrients to the system improves the degradation potential of the inhabiting microbial population mapelli et al 2017 tyagi et al 2011 one of the aspects of bio stimulation is that it also enhances the microbe ability to produce biosurfactants which are amphiphiles of microbial origin with surface active properties jahan et al 2020 using a microbial community rather than a pure culture for the bioremediation is more advantageous as it provides the metabolic diversity and robustness needed for field applications tyagi et al 2011 the ability of the newly introduced microbial consortia to compete with indigenous bacteria predators and numerous abiotic factors is also critical to the process success tribedi et al 2018 the bioaugmentation method has been used with promising results but it has also failed insufficient substrates temperature variations ph nutritional limits competition between foreign and indigenous microorganisms phase infections pollution load shock protozoa grazing and factors connected with quorum sensing qs have all been cited as probable causes of failure nzila et al 2016 the use of geotextile tubes for collection and dewatering of contaminated lake sediments has been proposed by many authors alimohammadi et al 2020 zhang et al 2011 ma et al 2021 physical and chemical properties of sediments as well as contamination type should be characterized to develop the most feasible cost effective and practical solution the subject for this study in alūksne s lake was organic sediments with thickness varied from 1 to 12 m these ls are water saturated contain high amounts of humus and characterized as historically contaminated with hydrocarbons hc due to certain hydrological conditions there is a risk of overgrowth between the island of maria and the west coast of the lake where the depth doesn t exceed almost two meters the best solution to avoid this overgrowth would be removal of sediments we hypothesized that dewatering of ls in geotextile tubes could be accompanied with bioremediation processes in that case it is critical to understand the roles and network interactions in sediment microbial communities as well as their responses to environmental changes yan et al 2021 our study was aimed at evaluating the effect of bio stimulation and bioaugmentation in the biodegradation of hc contaminated ls experiment setup was designed for further ex situ bioremediation in geotextile tubes the parameters tested in this study include taxonomic and functional

dichlorophenolindophenol dcpip as well as biodegradation of hc 2 materials and methods 2 1 characterization of alūksne lake and sediment collection alūksne lake is the eleventh largest lake in latvia 15 7 km2 situated 183 7 m above the sea level the main subject for research in alūksne s lake is organic sediments such as sludge or mud hereafter sludge its thickness varies from 1 m to 12 m with the typical colour of sludge being black sludge contains high amount of humus and is water saturated the average dry matter is roughly 20 and organic substances between 20 and 60 the natural sludge moisture content of alūksne lake around 65 85 dry matter concentration 15 35 the surface of sludge is affected by the oxidation of fes2 which occurs from air contact and changes colour from grey to brown grey in terms of odours the presence of oil and hydrogen sulphide pollution is not to feel as it differs from organic substances which has an odour of swampy sediments there is a risk of overgrowth between the island of maria and the west coast of the lake where depth doesn t exceed almost 2 m the best solution to avoid this overgrowth would be removal of sediments which would result in the increase of depth in this sector at least for 2 m sludge thickness in alūksne lake is most significant in the west sector the shallowness of the lake allows to increase the growth of reeds which leads to overgrowth of 10 30 m wide belt of historical coastline the formation and accumulation of these sludge sediments occurred because of the present hydrological conditions that is why the upper part of west coast of alūksne lake is characterized as low bearing capacity layer and has no economical use the establishment of sludge sediments and crossection of organic sediment beds are described in fig 1 the sediments were sampled from two points of the lake ls 1 4 5 m and ls 2 8 m using a kc van veen bottom grab sampler fig 1 2 2 batch experiment with lake sediments the laboratory experiment was established immediately the batch incubation was performed in polypropylene 5 l vessels for a total period of 32 days which was divided in two stages differed by treatment types the first stage 15 days represented bio stimulation while the next 17 days were bioaugmentation one kg of wet ls dry weight of ls 1 and ls 2 was 5 20 0 24 and 10 43 0 01 respectively was placed in a container for the bio stimulation study the nutrient amendment 3 3 ml of 30 beet molasses 30 ml of cabbage leaf extract 5 ml of 10 yeast extract 1 biosurfactant bioversal hc hc s 1 austria was added to 1 kg of ls in six containers while ls in another three containers remained without nutrients the preparation bioversal is an aqueous combination of detergents polyvalent compounds and hetero organic substances the prepared mixtures were incubated for 15 days at 23 c with periodic aeration and mixing daily for the next 17 days of incubation six containers with nutrient amended ls were divided into two groups i e three of them did not receive any amendments while another three containers were bioaugmented with a microbial community which was previously isolated from hc contaminated soils the physical conditions of incubation remained the same at 23 c with periodic aeration and mixing daily the experiment setup is shown in fig s1 abbreviation for the types of ls treatment are as follows raw ls non incubated and non treated ls which was immediately frozen on the sampling day ls k incubated ls without amendments for 32 days ls n incubated ls with nutrient amendments for 32 days

microbial respiration was measured in 5 l incubation vessels containing the ls fig s1 the respiration assay was performed after 32 days of incubation the carbon dioxide produced during the 24 h incubation period was collected in a glass vial with 5 ml of 0 1 m naoh which was placed directly on the ls in the vessel incubation included a blank which was a sealed vessel with a naoh trap but no ls after 24 h of incubation measurement of the co2 dissolved in naoh was performed by titration of the naoh solutions with a 0 1 m aqueous hcl solution 2 3 3 estimation of hydrocarbons degrading

scanning microscope germany equipped with a tcs sl confocal scanning head the dye pi molecules were excited with a 488 nm laser band and the fluorescence was detected between 600 nm and 640 nm wavelengths the diatom quantification method of abrantes et al 2005 was modified and used in this study temporary microscope slides were prepared by adding a drop of ls to a slide and covering it with a coverslip quantification of diatoms was done at 400 magnification using a light microscope motic china estimation of the relative abundance of the diatoms was based on the percentage of the total number of algae obtained for each genus from the counting of 10 random fields of view on 3 replicate slides for each sample 2 6 testing of microbial dna in ls 2 6 1 dna extraction and shotgun sequencing dna from the samples were isolated using fastdna spin kit for soil mp biomedicals usa according to the manufacturer s guidelines dna samples for the shotgun metagenomic analyses were

standard workflow 2 6 2 shotgun sequencing data analysis quality trimming of the obtained raw paired end reads was performed by trimmomatic v 0 39 bolger et al 2014 with the leading quality of q30 and trailing quality of q30 and sequences shorter than 36 nt were discarded quality filtered sequences were then aligned to the human genome reference hg19 and complementary sequences were removed by bowtie2 langmead and salzberg 2012 v 2 3 5 1 sequences were then sorted by read names with samtools li et al 2009 and divided into paired files by bedtools2 dale et al 2011 the taxonomic profile was obtained by kraken2 wood et al 2019 software and the internal kraken2 database which contain taxonomical reference information on bacterial fungal viral and protozoan domains taxonomical agglomeration

alignment of sequences against the uniref 90 suzek et al 2015 protein reference database was performed by diamond buchfink et al 2014 software 2 7 statistical analysis the data presented in the figures is expressed as the mean value standard deviation the differences between the treatments were assessed by the student s t test and one way analysis of variance anova in microsoft excel office365 alpha diversity metrics chao1 shannon and simpson index were calculated using the vegan v 2 5 6 package and visualized using the phyloseq v 1 30 0 package beta diversity analysis was performed using non metric multi dimensional scaling nmds with bray curtis distance method employing phyloseq package 3 results 3 1 the counts of colony forming units in lake sediments upon incubation changes on the number of culturable microorganisms in lake sediments serve as one of the most important criteria for evaluating the treatment efficacy especially at the beginning of bioremediation as shown in fig 2 incubation of ls stimulated proliferation of microorganisms was because of intensive mixing and aeration addition of nutrients at the beginning of incubation resulted in notable increasing in cfu count as compared to the non amended ls particularly in both biostimulated sediments derived from ls 1 and ls 2 the number of cfu increased up to 1 5 2 0 orders while non amended sediments were up 1 order respectively addition of microbial community for bioaugmentation during the next 17 days did not result in a significant rise of cfu growth fig 2 3 2 respiration intensity and hydrocarbons degrading ability of microorganisms after 32 days of incubation microbial respiration is widely used for measuring the catabolitic response profile of microorganisms in different environments including ls torres et al 2011 in our study the microbial respiration in the raw and treated ls samples was compared in order to assess the changes of catabolic activity upon treatment as shown in fig 3a the raw ls demonstrated the highest respiration intensity comparing with treated samples with the lowest values detected in ls k after 32 days of incubation dropping by 72 5 and 72 9 in ls 1 and ls 2 respectively this fact may indicate to the high metabolic activity of microbial communities during incubation which resulted in exhausting of available c sources in ls k and therefore decreasing respiration activity in turn biostimulation and bioaugmentation resulted only in a slight decrease of respiration intensity as compared to the raw ls fig 3a moreover the nutrient amendments which were added at the beginning of incubation still supported microbial respiration even after 32 days furthermore this effect could be explained by a higher functional adaptation of microorganisms in utilizing c substrates including hc substrate as will be reported below biodegradation of hc in ls n and ls b was considerably higher than in ls k fig 4 biodegradation potentials of microbes present in ls before and after treatment were determined using a colorimetric approach utilizing the dcpip which detects the oxidation of nadh to nad related to hc degradation by bacteria the utilization of substrate can be observed based on the loss of indicator s blue colour this method has also been reported to be used as a preliminary approach for isolating hc degrading bacteria in a number of studies habib et al 2017 kubota et al 2008 muter et al 2019 in our lake sediment samples ls 1 showed a higher dcpip utilization in raw ls compared to that of ls 2 sediment with od620 of ls being 0 08 0 01 and 0 07 0 01 respectively fig 3b bioaugmented sample in ls 1 had a 50 decrease in dcpip indicator colour intensity comparing to the raw ls with od620 values decreasing from 0 08 0 01 to 0 04 0 02 whereas the ls b sample in ls 2 had a 20 6 decrease with od620 values decreasing from 0 07 0 01 in raw ls to 0 05 0 01 in ls b fig 3b this presents higher bioaugmentation effectivity in the ls 1 sample it might be possible that the microbial community for bioaugmentation wasn t as effective in the ls 2 sample because of nutritional limits pollution load shock or the petroleum product particles present might be too large for microbes to metabolize in both ls 1 and ls 2 samples mixing and aeration in ls k showed the most effectivity with od620 values 0 04 0 01 and 0 03 0 01 respectively fig 3b 3 2 1 biodegradation of petroleum products the concentration of petroleum products in ls containing mixtures was measured at the end of the 32 day experiment results indicated that aeration and mixing in ls k reduced the petroleum concentration by 22 7 in ls 1 and 9 8 in ls 2 biostimulation by addition of nutrients and surfactants ls n reduced it by 65 4 in ls 1 and 63 4 in ls 2 and addition of microbial community for bioaugmentation ls b to biostimulated mixtures reduced petroleum product concentration by 79 8 in ls 1 and 68 3 in ls 2 fig 4 the contribution of biostimulation for hc biodegradation was higher than that of bioaugmentation particularly an average reduction of petroleum products in biostimulated and bioaugmented sets ls b was only by 9 7 higher than that in biostimulated sets ls n as compared to ls fig 4 nevertheless bioaugmentation remains to be a powerful tool in biodegradation processes in a similar experiment done by yuan et al 2018 it was proven that bioaugmentation was more effective than bio stimulation in removing petroleum products importantly the efficiency of bioremediation depends on composition of contamination containing potentially toxic compounds the recent study on contamination of the alūksne lake reported by purmalis and burlakovs 2017 showed that concentration of total hc in the contaminated part of the lake varied in the range from 24 to 906 to mg kg tested in a depth up to 2 m authors noted that oil products in the lake diffuse close by source due to lack of hydrological dynamics and properties of pollutants which bind with organic matter in sediments concentrations of heavy metals i e cr ni cu zn cd pb as in the tested samples did not exceed geochemical background purmalis and burlakovs 2017 3 3 abundance of diatoms several genus of diatoms were identified and counted in samples ls 1 and ls 2 most common of which include cocconeis melosira navicula pinnularia cyclotella surirella and gomphonema fig s2 s3 diatoms unicellular algae which are frequently the most abundant component of stream biofilms are sensitive to changes in water chemistry and respond quickly to environmental changes such as the rise of pollution tolerant species lavoie et al 2018 the total amount of diatom cells counted in ls 2 sample was 2 6 3 3 times less than in the ls 1 sample data not shown due to the ls 2 sample being visibly more polluted with crystal like sediment particles seen under the microscope there might have been less light availability making the environment less suitable to diatom growth lange et al 2011 also recorded the decrease of relative abundance of common diatom taxa under reduced light 3 4 taxonomic analysis of microbial communities for the taxonomic analysis of microbial communities we chose the ls 1 sample being one of two representative ls samples examination of the metagenome revealed prevalence of bacterial dna among classified reads which varied in the range from 22 3 to 27 4 of reads for the treated ls samples and for the raw ls and microbial community was 16 0 and 97 4 of reads over 70 of reads in the treated samples remained unclassified fig s4a the percentage of viral reads were 0 04 for raw ls as well as all the treated ls samples the amount of fungal reads were 0 12 for both ls n and ls b and 0 13 for raw ls and ls k as for the proportion of protozoan reads ls n and ls b showed a 33 3 increase from the raw ls with values of 0 08 and 0 06 respectively microbial community for bioaugmentation showed the smallest amount of protozoan viral and fungal reads ranging between 0 003 and 0 005 fig s4b lake sediment incubated without treatment showed a decreased eukaryote dna by 2 5 and increased bacteria dna by 3 9 compared to the raw ls fig s4c the treatment of ls resulted in significant changes in the bacterial community fig 5 the main phyla present in ls samples were proteobacteria actinobacteria firmicutes and bacteroidetes particularly proteobacteria dominated in the ls k with 61 7 reads which consisted of 31 9 14 9 14 3 and 4 3 of betaproteobacteria gammaproteobacteria alphaproteobacteria and deltaproteobacteria respectively incubation of ls for 32 days resulted in increasing abundance of proteobacteria from 48 8 in the raw ls to 61 7 59 3 and 58 0 in ls k ls n and ls b respectively mainly due to increase of betapoteobacteria the highest abundance of proteobacteria among the treated samples were in ls k with 61 7 reads where betaproteobacteria was dominating at 31 9 fig 5a and b importantly this effect was observed also for ls b which was amended with a microbial community where gammaproteobacteria dominated 91 6 fig 5b in similar studies of petroleum product contaminated lakes sequences of proteobacteria 17 48 actinobacteria 19 44 and cyanobacteria 17 48 dominated in the communities at all sites the epsilon and delta classes were the least represented while the alpha beta and gamma classes were the most represented zemskaya et al 2015 regarding the role of betaproteobacteria in degradation processes many isolates are capable of aerobic or anaerobic degradation of aromatic hc parales 2010 on an order level the most abundant among treated samples was burkholderiales with relative abundance of 32 5 in ls k 32 2 in ls b and 29 3 in ls n fig 5c the importance of the burkholderiales order in the degradation of a wide range of aromatic compounds including a number of priority pollutants has been widely assumed pérez pantoja et al 2012 more specifically comamonadaceae a family of bacteria belonging to the order burkholderiales had the highest relative abundance across treated samples on a family level with 35 5 of reads in ls k 34 7 in ls b and 28 6 in ls n fig 5d the comamonadaceae family has been shown to be capable of degrading gasoline additives toluene and aromatics chen et al 2015 nicholls et al 2020 regarding gammaproteobacteria the treatment with nutrients only in ls n resulted in a higher relative abundance of pseudomonas compared to biostimulated and bioaugmented sample with 35 8 and 21 0 of reads respectively fig 5e more specifically the effect of biostimulation with nutrients at species level showed a high relative abundance of pseudomonas sp hls 6 with 77 1 of reads and 37 2 of reads in ls b fig 5f pseudomonas are one of the biosurfactant producers in oil contaminated marine waters worldwide mapelli et al 2017 similar to the nutritional needs of other organisms oil degrading microbes also require nutrients for optimal growth and development these nutrients are available in the natural environment but occur in low quantities macaulay 2015 thus this may explain the high yield of pseudomonas in the nutrient treated samples abundance of actinobacteria reduced significantly in the treated samples from 24 4 in the raw ls to 9 1 15 8 in the ls after incubation with the highest value being in ls k whereas all the treated samples showed an increase of bacteroidetes ranging from 12 7 to 15 2 the highest reads being in ls n compared to the raw ls with 5 0 fig 5a alpha and beta diversity measurements of the samples sequenced by shotgun methodology are presented in fig 6 the shift in the microbial community structure as a result of biostimulation is quite predictable however the changes are specific and depend on the properties of sediments treatment type and composition of nutrients added different types of surfactants which are used in case of hydrophobic contamination considerably influence the metabiome changes can cause a decrease in metabolic activity but not decrease the biodiversity of the studied system staninska pięta et al 2019 these changes often occur at the initial stage of treatment thus szczepaniak and coauthors szczepaniak et al 2016 reported that bioaugmentation and addition of surfactants rhamnolipids to the soil spiked with polycyclic aromatic hc positively influenced the bioremediation process especially during the early stage of treatment i e first three months of the 12 month experiment in our study the commercially available preparation of surfactants that contain structures comparable to naturally occurring microbial surfactants have been widely used in large scale bioremediation applications as well as research experiments martienssen and schirmer 2007 nevertheless the effect of the surfactants preparation alone on biodegradation efficiency was not tested in our study 3 5 functional analysis functional analysis of the ls 1 revealed 4128 gene families from which the most abundant gene families were associated with atp binding go 0005524 5 8 6 2 cytoplasm go 0005737 5 8 7 1 metal ion binding go 0046872 2 7 2 9 dna binding go 0003677 1 9 2 7 and integral component of membrane go 0016021 1 9 3 2 fig s5 all of which are necessary components of microorganisms the metabolic pathway relative abundance in the treated and non treated ls after 32 days of incubation is presented in fig s6 among 28 pathways detected at least in one of the sets above 1 the most abundant was pwy 3781 aerobic respiration i cytochrome c with a relative abundance of 1 30 1 44 0 95 and 0 96 in ls ls k ls n and ls b respectively fig s6 these data are quite unexpected because of sampling depth 4 5 m and 8 m and therefore need to be clarified in further research 3 6 metabolic biodiversity of culturable microorganisms biolog ecoplates were used to assess bacterial functional diversity by measuring their ability to oxidize carbon substrates microorganisms release free electrons while using carbon sources which causes a specific colour response with tetrazolium violet and the depth of the chroma indicates the microorganisms carbon source consumption level ge et al 2018 ls1 used more carbon sources than ls2 when comparing the two ls samples with 20 substrates in ls1 and 11 in ls2 the most utilized substrates in ls1 sample were d galacturonic acid tween 40 and d mannitol while for ls2 sample were tween 80 i erythriol and tween 40 with 0 55 the shannon diversity index for intact ls 1 and ls 2 was found to be 2 85 and 2 28 respectively 4 conclusions the main results obtained in this study are summarized in the following conclusions 1 biostimulation and bioaugmentation as the treatment methods of the historically hc contaminated ls demonstrated an average decrease of hc concentrations after 32 days of incubation by 65 and 75 respectively two ls samples taken at different sites of the alūksne lake have shown the similar trend on microbial respiration intensity hc degrading activity and degradation of hc that evidence representativeness of the tested sediments 2 the contribution of biostimulation alone for hc biodegradation ls n was higher than that of bioaugmentation which was applied in combination with biostimulation ls b particularly an average reduction of petroleum products in biostimulated and bioaugmented sets ls b was only by 9 7 higher than that in biostimulated sets ls n as compared to ls nevertheless bioaugmentation remains to be a powerful tool in biodegradation processes the yield of bioaugmentation could considerably change if the treatment scheme is altered such as by the addition of a microbial community at the beginning of the treatment together with nutrients or without nutrients the data on shotgun sequencing have shown that gammaproteobacteria which dominated in the microbial community have been displaced by betaproteobacteria which dominated in all treated ls samples after 32 days of incubation this fact indicated that the tested conditions were not appropriate for microbial community used for bioaugmentation 3 characterization of catabolic activity of microbial communities before and after treatments have revealed a prolonged after 32 days respiration intensity in ls n and ls b while the potential hc degrading activity was found to be increased in all treated samples i e ls k ls n and ls b 4 among the most abundant gene families the genes responsible for aerobic respiration were dominant in this respect aerobic conditions were chosen for this study as the most appropriate on the other hand it would be important to check the hc degradation potential for this microbial community also under anaerobic conditions 5 regarding application of the bioremediation processes in geotextile tubes further research is necessary to develop most feasible cost effective and practical solution in particular scaling up of this approach should emphasize a heterogeneous hydraulic conductivity field and other parameters and conditions which may considerably affect the outcome of bioremediation and technology expenses funding this study was financially supported by the program of scientific excellence

1232,hydrogeological settings and natural radionuclides of saline geothermal fields along the coastlines of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea in southern thailand are currently not fully understood six saline geothermal springs have been discovered in surat thani province southern thailand s east coast sr2 sr3 and sr7 sites krabi province southern thailand s west coast kb2 kb3 and kb4 sites based on total dissolved solid contents we divided the saline geothermal springs into three categories a slightly saline geothermal spring had only sr7 1828 mg l b moderately saline geothermal spring consisted of sr2 10 196 mg l and kb3 3448 mg l and c very saline geothermal spring comprised sr3 11 856 mg l kb2 17 014 mg l and kb4 18 070 mg l the major ions in the saline geothermal groundwater represent decreasing trends with the distance from the coastline stable isotope signatures δ18o and δ2h relative to the vsmow plotted in comparison with the global meteoric water line and local meteoric water line are presumably of meteoric origin and influenced by seawater brackish water however the sr7 and kb3 sites indicated that the isotopic signatures were mainly recharged by rainwater significantly the na k ca mg geothermometer can reasonably estimate the reservoir temperatures for the five saline geothermal springs to be in the range of 120 c kb3 to 169 c sr2 while the sr7 the silica quartz geothermometer is proposed of approximately 115 c however the silica chalcedony and other cation geothermometers fail to estimate suitable reservoir temperatures on the other hand the radon concentrations in the saline geothermal groundwater along the gulf of thailand and andaman sea were assessed by rad7 h2o which varied from 18 64 0 96 kbq m3 kb2 andaman sea side to 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 sr7 gulf of thailand side a comparison of radon activity with the saltwater intrusion showed that the saline geothermal groundwater on the gulf of thailand side had higher levels than that at the andaman sea side the deposition of quaternary sediments combined with significant saltwater inflow enriched with radon resulted from the decay of uranium from both non marine and coastal deposits related to granitic mountain weathering along the gulf of thailand radon concentrations in the geothermal groundwater were highly influenced by the local geological environment and coastal sediments keywords hydrogeological environment radon saline geothermal spring gulf of thailand andaman sea data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction high salinity geothermal springs are widely distributed in many coastal areas of the world s seas such as holts landing state park delaware usa sperchios basin central greece and wenquanzhen in the eastern sichuan basin southwest china andrés et al 2010 duque et al 2019 duriez et al 2008 guo et al 2018 in addition to beautiful beaches and islands thailand s southern region also has many popular tourist destinations e g mountain ranges mangrove forests and natural hot springs at least six saline geothermal spring attractions were discovered on the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea and at least two saline geothermal springs are the most visited in southeast asia dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 1 the khlong thom hot spring kb4 in krabi province and located along the shoreline of the andaman sea and 2 the thasathon hot spring sr7 in surat thani province situated along the coastland of the gulf of thailand dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 ngansom and duerrast 2019 other natural saline hot springs can be found in surat thani province southern thailand s east coast the sr2 and sr3 sites and krabi province southern thailand s west coast and the kb2 and kb3 sites which are mostly located near brackish waterways estuaries that are connected to mangrove areas dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 ngansom and duerrast 2019 in general geochemical properties of geothermal groundwater along coastlands especially with fluctuating salinity tds content primarily depend on layers of marine sediments tidal influences and distances between estuary seashore and geothermal spring sites baioumy et al 2015 chenaker et al 2018 dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 for instance the kb4 and sr3 sites are particularly interesting due to the shortest distance from krabi s estuary 0 5 km and surat thani s estuary 2 km and the highest tds contents approximately 18 070 mg l and 11 856 mg l respectively ngansom and duerrast 2019 ngansom and dürrast 2021 nevertheless a complete interpretation of the geochemical analysis of the saline geothermal spring waters along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea in southern thailand has not been considered previously malain et al 2010 at the local scale the geothermal aquifers in the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands in southern thailand are mostly considered unconfined and their related coastal sediments have unconsolidated marine sediments of altered granite sandstone dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 these highly vulnerable aquifers constitute critical target areas of saltwater intrusion into geothermal groundwater systems dürrast and ngansom 2022 guo et al 2019 significantly the influence of geological control on hot groundwater flow paths has decreased dramatically such as saltwater intrusion into geothermal aquifers kanellopoulos et al 2020 mao et al 2021 the upstream movement of seawater brackish water might directly affect shallow geothermal reservoirs especially the state of weathering and certain physical properties e g soil and water resistivity mao et al 2021 pétré et al 2020 and ri et al 2022 therefore a possible explanation for high salinity geothermal systems along coastlands has been attributed to 1 modern seawater intrusion into a local geothermal aquifer mao et al 2021 ri et al 2022 stieglitz et al 2013 2 contributions of deep seawaters andrés et al 2010 duriez et al 2008 guo et al 2018 and 3 water rock interaction in a geothermal reservoir kanellopoulos et al 2020 mao et al 2022 except for the brackish water in estuaries salinity increased during the summer dry season when a natural supply e g rainwater and groundwater decreased andrés et al 2010 duque et al 2019 duriez et al 2008 another perspective of saline geothermal springs along coastlands is the monitoring of environmental radiation in geothermal groundwater which has typically focused on specific radionuclides in seawater e g uranium 238 radium 226 and potassium 40 bonotto and bueno 2008 duque et al 2019 krishan et al 2015 remarkably radon 222 as part of the radioactive decay series of uranium is of most concern in geothermal spring waters especially saline geothermal groundwater with higher concentrations of seawater abadi et al 2016 duque et al 2019 stieglitz et al 2013 telahigue et al 2018 at coastlands radium 226 and radon 222 can be absorbed from clayey sediments exhibited in geothermal aquifers and mixed with saltwater fresh groundwater thus they are more radioactive telahigue et al 2018 stieglitz et al 2013 duque et al 2019 a concentration of natural radionuclides has been estimated and evaluated in combination with geochemical investigations e g ph and major and trace ions kanellopoulos et al 2018 lopez et al 2020 investigating the natural sources of radon in geothermal systems with different geological environments and physical chemical characteristics of geothermal groundwaters is the critical challenge abadi et al 2016 abdel mageed et al 2013 telahigue et al 2018 tripathi et al 2013 therefore radon levels might be used as a tracer of saltwater intrusion into geothermal aquifers because radium has salinity dependent desorption behavior krishan et al 2015 yehia et al 2017 yii et al 2009 furthermore previous studies have reported strong spatial relationships between radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater and fault zone that is represented radon levels significantly higher than background levels abadi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 davidson et al 2016 tsunomori et al 2017 radon is constantly being produced by radium decay in granitic aquifers chen et al 2018 duque et al 2019 fault zones are exceptional migration pathways for radioactive gas from a deep structure to the earth s surface due to their enhanced permeability and porosity compared to surrounding rock enabling gases to buoyantly migrate upwards abadi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 davidson et al 2016 tsunomori et al 2017 local fluctuations may have resulted from radioactive gas flows associated with high permeability fault zones increasing temperature in geothermal reservoirs seems to enhance radon dissolution from the reservoir rocks chao et al 2020 iwaoka et al 2013 mao et al 2021 ngansom et al 2022 moreover radon is released mainly by minerals containing radioactive elements through various geologic processes including release from the subsurface during decay and through physical chemical weathering into the air via open fractures and joints abadi et al 2016 tsunomori et al 2017 wu et al 2021 hence in southern thailand there is a short distance between fault lines and geothermal fields and a short distance between shorelines and hot spring sites which might affect radon concentrations in hot springs through both geological environments fault and saltwater intrusion bonotto and bueno 2008 shu aibu et al 2021 stieglitz et al 2013 therefore this study aims to 1 investigate the understanding of the hydrogeological environment of saline hot springs in southern thailand using the geochemical characterization i e stable isotopes cations and anions of such waters 2 estimate and assign geothermometers to saline geothermal springs and 3 evaluate natural radionuclides with emphasis on radon concentrations which might relate to the geological environmental setting along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea 2 geological environment setting the coastal regions of thailand relate to the gulf of thailand in the east and the andaman sea in the west as shown in fig 1a and b ridd 2009 ridd 2012 sautter et al 2017 the gulf of thailand coastline has a distance of approximately 1670 km and represents an emergent coastline with beaches and lagoons chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 kanjanapayont 2014 on the western side of the thai peninsula with the andaman sea the related shoreline is approximately 750 km long and comprises of various types of geological features such as cliffs islands short narrow beaches and a drowned valley fig 1b curray 2005 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 furthermore the khlong marui fault kmf and the ranong fault rf zones are the major nne ssw trending strike slip faults which cut across the thai peninsula as shown in fig 1b kanjanapayont et al 2012 ridd 2012 watkinson et al 2008 although both fault zones have not been traced offshore these faults might intersect in the northern gulf of thailand fig 1b ridd 2012 watkinson et al 2008 the kmf can be traced from phuket province in the southwest toward surat thani province in the northeast while the rf can be followed from phang nga province takua pa district in the southwest to prachuap khiri khan province pran buri district in the northeast both crossing the peninsula entirely fig 1b kanjanapayont et al 2012 ridd 2009 2012 watkinson et al 2008 thus the recent tectonic evolution and local geological setting of the parts of the southern region have been the related of these consequential active faults presently geological surveys of the saline geothermal fields along the coastlines of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea have discovered at least six saline hot springs on the coastland of krabi and surat thani provinces as shown in fig 1c to 1h significantly the saline geothermal springs have been considered unique geological features in this region because most are non saline hot springs approximately 29 geothermal spring sites ngansom and duerrast 2019 ngansom and dürrast 2021 geologic studies carried out in three saline geothermal spring areas sr2 sr3 and sr7 in surat thani province are located on coastal sediments that are connected to mangrove areas fig 1c to 1e chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 on the other hand krabi province which is famous for its beautiful white sand beaches saline hot springs including kb2 kb3 and kb4 are situated near the krabi estuary of the khlong thom river fig 1f to 1h dürrast and ngansom 2022 the local geology at the surat thani geothermal springs sr2 sr3 and sr7 show various rock types of ages ranging from precambrian to tertiary chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 kanjanapayont 2014 physical characteristics visible at their outcrops can be classified as granitic rocks as well as sedimentary and metamorphic rocks chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 sautter et al 2017 granitic rocks are located in the northeast and southeast of the sr3 site remarkably the sr2 and sr3 are located next to each other and the samui and phangan islands fig 1b chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 kanjanapayont et al 2012 all granite mountains in surat thani province are tin bearing granites and are oriented approximately north south chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 furthermore the quaternary sediments around the saline geothermal springs especially sr2 and sr3 can be classified based on the geological environment into non marine lithofacies e g colluvium and alluvium and coastal lithofacies e g deltaic sediments estuarine and intertidal mud flat and coastal barrier sand chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 the sr2 and sr3 sites geological environments consist of coastal sediments where tide dominated shorelines are largely enclosed with sandy and muddy sediments transported by tidal currents fig 1c and d chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 the coastland along the estuary which has extensive mangrove areas and muddy intertidal flats is generally covered with sandy marine sediments fig 1c and d furthermore the local geological setting of the saline hot springs in both surat thani and krabi provinces is related to saltmarshes and intertidal flats chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 dürrast and ngansom 2022 they are usually located adjacent to the shoreline and are extensive at river mouths therefore hydrogeological studies of both non geothermal and geothermal waters in the study area are usually emphasized on saltwater intrusion mechanisms on the other hand the geological structure of krabi province is indirectly affected by the rf and kmf zones as shown in fig 1b and f to 1h curray 2005 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 watkinson et al 2008 local geological surveys have been reported on different outcrops of the same stratigraphy of the triassic formations such as siltstone e g brick red thin bedded and dolomitic limestone lenses and sandstone e g light brown fine to medium grained and thin to medium bedded fig 1b and g dürrast and ngansom 2022 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 almost all of the bedrocks are sandstone jurassic and triassic and to a small extent limestone permian and permian to carboniferous petersen and ratanasthien 2011 sautter et al 2017 geothermal springs including the saline hot springs kb2 kb3 and kb4 are widely distributed throughout small fault zones dürrast and ngansom 2022 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 watkinson et al 2008 as freshwater aquifers are part of geothermal spring systems and as they connected to the unconfined aquifers of coastal sediments such faults may provide pathways for seawater intrusion into geothermal systems at depth fig 1f dürrast and ngansom 2022 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 therefore both fractured bedrocks and minor faults might be inferred to play a critical role in the recharge and discharge of the krabi geothermal waters as infiltration channels of marine water 3 methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis saline geothermal fields along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea in southern thailand were considered in this study fig 1a six natural saline hot springs sr2 sr3 sr7 kb2 kb3 and kb4 and one brackish water sample were collected and the sampling locations are reported in table 1 all saline geothermal groundwater samples were collected in december 2021 from outlets of the natural hot spring pools and were immediately filtered through a 0 45 lm membrane filter in situ prior to any geochemical analysis after cooling naturally the saline groundwater samples were stored in one liter for qualitative analysis cations and anions and a quarter of a liter for the stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o pre sterilized polythene bottles nitrogen oxoacid hno3 ph values below 1 was used to acidify geothermal groundwater samples for cation analysis no chemical reagents were added to the geothermal groundwater samples used for the stable water isotope and anion analyses exit temperatures ph hco3 and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ at the sampling sites by a portable ph meter ion meter pxs hco3 and conductivity meter hi2003 respectively furthermore all the locations of sampling points were recorded by a garmin device a gps system etrex venture hc usa a qualitative analysis cations and anions was performed at the laboratory of water analysis co ltd iso iec 17025 2017 phra nakhon si ayutthaya thailand the stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o were measured by the laboratory of the nuclear technology research and development center ntrdc nakhon nayok thailand methods of the geochemical analysis and detection limits of these parameters are shown in table 2 3 2 geothermometers geothermometry is a geochemical tool for temperature determination in geothermal reservoirs baioumy et al 2015 bayram 2001 blasco et al 2017 most geothermal reservoirs have been in deep intrusive heat sources that usually refer to geological events e g crystallization of magma metamorphism of preexisting rocks and radioactive decay blasco et al 2017 chenaker et al 2018 li et al 2020 the assumption of geothermometer estimation is mainly considered in geochemical equilibrium states between geothermal groundwater and mineral solution equilibria of geothermal reservoir rocks fournier 1977 fournier and truesdell 1973 giggenbach 1988 kolesar and degraff 1977 pope et al 1987 nitschke et al 2018 therefore insights from silica and cation geothermometers as shown in eqs 1 to 7

total of six saline geothermal groundwater samples and one brackish water seawater sample were collected from the natural hot spring pools and the estuary of surat thani province for their use in measuring radon concentrations the rad7 electronic radon detector by durridge company inc billerica ma equipped with a rad h2o water accessory was used to measure the radon concentration in these saline geothermal waters the saline geothermal groundwater and brackish water samples were collected in 250 ml vials designed for use appropriate for measuring radon levels the sampling was done in december 2021 and the weather conditions during the sampling period were fairly stable the freshness of the groundwater samples saline hot springs and brackish water was ensured by sampling to a depth of approximately 0 3 m below the water surface in contrast geothermal groundwater sampling is complex because the gas easily escapes from groundwater and therefore has to be done without any operation which might lead to outgassing csige et al 2013 stojković et al 2015 saline geothermal groundwater and brackish water samples were collected in such a way that there was no bubbling furthermore the groundwater samples were analyzed immediately at the sampling site of the natural hot spring pools the time difference between taking the geothermal groundwater sampling and measuring it was only a few minutes so there was no need for decay correction stojković et al 2015 the measurement sensitivity of the rad7 device to radon concentrations in its lower limit of detection was 0 37 bq l the rad h2o required a desiccant to be used at all times to dry the air stream before it entered the device stojković et al 2015 the relative humidity readings during the measurement should remain below 10 stojković et al 2015 in addition to circulate sample air through the desiccant and the rad7 device without further aerating the groundwater sample a bypass may be allowed for the airflow to bypass the aerator a valve in the bypass system must be turned off during the first five minutes while the groundwater sample is aerated after the first cycle the bypass valve was opened to prevent further aeration of the groundwater sample therefore to determine the radon concentration in the saline geothermal groundwater sample after a sniff protocol reading it will be necessary to multiply the radon in air measurement by a factor whose value can be found from a measurement with the wat250 protocol the operation of the rad h2o device in this study is as follows a radon is evicted from the saline geothermal groundwater sample by using a bubbling kit b evicted radon enters a hemisphere chamber by air circulation c polonium decayed from radon is collected onto a silicon solid state detector by an electric field and d radon concentration is computed from the count rate of polonium 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeological analysis of the saline geothermal springs 4 1 1 hydrochemical characteristics geochemical concentrations of major ions cations and anions ph values and tds contents of the six saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea are represented in table 1 the site specific selection of the high salinity geothermal springs tds contents 1828 to 18 070 mg l is located near shorelines of the andaman sea krabi geothermal province kb2 kb3 and kb4 sites and gulf of thailand surat thani geothermal province sr2 sr3 and sr7 sites ranging between 0 5 km kb4 site and 25 km sr7 site table 1 it is notable that they have high tds contents varying significantly ranging from 1828 mg l the sr7 site to 18 070 mg l the kb4 site as shown in table 1 the ph values of the saline geothermal spring samplings are between 7 20 and 7 78 average ph 7 55 indicating that the geothermal groundwater are slightly alkaline in nature especially the sr2 ph 7 78 sr3 ph 7 70 and kb4 ph 7 60 geothermal sites the dominant ions and features of the saline geothermal groundwater emerging along the shorelines of southern thailand are an average concentration of na 2890 mg l ca2 1621 5 mg l and cl 6532 9 mg l as shown in table 1 the piper diagram of the six saline geothermal springs in southern thailand mainly highlights the ca nacl type i e kb3 and kb4 nacl type i e sr2 sr3 and kb2 and cacl type i e sr7 as shown in fig 2 the sr7 geothermal spring has a large difference from other saline geothermal springs exhibited with low cl content 19 mg l the nacl type comprising the sr2 sr3 and kb2 geothermal springs compared with the brackish water sample shows that the major components are higher than those of the chemical composition of the brackish water in particular so4 2 ca2 and na contents indicate that hot spring water is influenced by saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers fig 2 duriez et al 2008 pétré et al 2020 ri et al 2022 the majority of dissolved ions in the saline geothermal spring waters are shown in table 1 and fig 3 the sr7 concentrations are obviously less than those at other hot spring sampling points except f and so4 2 contents high concentrations of na and cl in saline geothermal spring waters may arise from saltwater intrusion and dissolution of saline sediments in coastal wetlands pétré et al 2020 ri et al 2022 stieglitz et al 2013 hence the na and cl contents can be used to distinguish different types of hot spring waters because the chemical properties of their waters are related to environmental factors the ca2 content is predominant in the sr3 kb2 and kb4 geothermal sites and is found in very small amounts in the sr2 and kb3 geothermal springs which influence the calcification of sedimentary formation waters table 1 and fig 3 on the other hand the highest br content is indicated in kb4 which accumulated in organic rich mudstones of seawater controlled by organic sources from the krabi estuary duriez et al 2008 kanellopoulos et al 2020 ri et al 2022 from another perspective the distinguished relationship between the tds and other concentrations of na k cl and br in the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea exhibited decreasing trends with the distance from the estuary as shown in table 1 and fig 4 while the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 showed fluctuating trends fig 4 these properties of the saline geothermal springs except for sr7 geothermal site were probably due to the relative saltwater intrusion with distance into the estuary which enriches na cl and the other major ions rather than hco3 in the local groundwater system baioumy et al 2015 pétré et al 2020 ri et al 2022 a relationship between the total dissolved solid tds content and geothermal water salinity can be used to group the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of southern thailand into three categories andrés et al 2010 guo et al 2018 guo et al 2019 a slightly saline geothermal spring with a tds content of 1000 to 3000 mg l here sr7 1828 mg l b moderately saline geothermal springs with tds content of 3000 to 11 000 mg l here sr2 10 196 mg l and kb3 3448 mg l and c very saline geothermal springs with tds content of 11 000 mg l here sr3 11 856 mg l kb2 17 014 mg l and kb4 18 070 mg l as shown in fig 4 in the slightly saline geothermal spring of sr7 the ion concentrations e g na mg2 cl and hco3 are lower than those of the moderately saline geothermal springs table 1 and fig 4 although most of the major elements of sr7 are low the so4 2 content 1162 mg l is obviously higher than that of the kb2 site 843 mg l of the very saline geothermal spring moreover the ion compositions of the sr7 site such as cl 19 mg l br 8 63 mg l k 13 mg l and na 37 mg l are significantly distinct from the contents of the seawater sample cl 13 965 mg l br 45 3 mg l k 317 6 mg l and na 2603 mg l hence the saline geothermal groundwater of the sr7 site is not related to saltwater intrusion into the shallow geothermal aquifer in the moderately saline geothermal springs the chemical properties of kb3 tds content 3448 mg l and sr2 tds content 10 196 mg l are quite different such as the contents of hco3 kb3 281 8 mg l and sr2 144 9 mg l cl kb3 1927 mg l and sr2 7158 5 mg l ca2 kb3 324 7 mg l and sr2 580 5 mg l and na kb3 351 mg l and sr2 3684 mg l as shown in table 1 and fig 4 a higher hco3 content of the kb3 site indicates the weathering of geological material of carbonaceous rocks and the na content might be attributed to mineral dissolution in porous rocks duque et al 2019 kanellopoulos et al 2020 its conditions lead to the slow movement of geothermal groundwater providing enough time for mineral dissolution kanellopoulos et al 2020 wu et al 2021 on the other hand the very saline geothermal springs i e sr3 kb2 and kb4 indicated that the cation concentration of na was highest at the kb2 site at approximately 4863 mg l whereas a dominant anion of cl was observed at the kb4 site at approximately 11 918 mg l bicarbonate ions hco3 ranged between 108 mg l sr3 and 142 mg l kb2 and appeared as the third dominant anion after cl and so4 2 possessing enhanced geothermal groundwaters table 1 and fig 4 moreover the large concentrations of k in kb2 236 mg l and kb4 180 mg l may be attributed to various environmental and anthropogenic activities stieglitz et al 2013 wu et al 2021 consequently the variation trends of the ion concentrations of the sr3 kb2 and kb4 geothermal springs are similar fig 4 indicating that they have similar processes to saltwater intrusion duriez et al 2008 pétré et al 2020 ri et al 2022 a high concentration of the major ions in the moderately saline geothermal springs sr2 and kb3 and the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 especially cl na so4 2 mg2 ca2 and k may suggest that fresh groundwater has mixed with saltwater in the geothermal aquifers duan et al 2022 duriez et al 2008 kanellopoulos et al 2020 ri et al 2022 meanwhile concentrations of the major ions of sr7 and kb3 are lower than the average concentration of the saline geothermal springs which might be irrelevant for saltwater intrusion in fractured geothermal aquifers kanellopoulos et al 2020 ri et al 2022 apart from that the ca excess versus na deficit diagram fig 5a and ca excess versus mg deficit diagram fig 5b was applied to explain the initial geochemical composition with respect to seawater davisson and criss 1996 morales arredondo et al 2017 bagheri et al 2014 calculated using the following equations 8 ca excess ca meas ca cl sw cl meas 2 40 08 9 na deficit na cl sw cl meas na meas 1 22 99 10 mg deficit mg cl sw cl meas mg meas 2 24 3 where the ca excess na deficit and mg deficit are in meq l and the subscripts sw and meas show the ion concentrations of seawater and saline geothermal groundwater in mg l respectively according to fig 5a the basinal fluid line bfl is represented the unique correlation achieved among ca2 na and cl while the ca excesses and na deficits do not significantly correlate with other major dissolved constituents e g k so4 2 and hco3 fig 5a for the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 ca2 concentrations were in substantial excess and na were in substantial deficit meaning they are formed by mixed brackish water with relatively high concentrations birkle et al 2009 davisson and criss 1996 the sr2 geothermal spring was probably affected by the dolomitization and then by mixing with saltwater produced from a mechanism of seawater intrusion whereas the sr7 and kb3 geothermal springs located right and over the seawater evaporation fig 5a can be explained by the direct cation exchange take their place between marine clays exhibited in the geothermal sites which releases na to the solution and captures ca2 and or mg2 on the other hand the ca excess versus mg deficit diagram is considered in the saline geothermal groundwater to indicate the processes of dolomitization mg2 precipitation and calcite and gypsum dissolution fig 5b davisson and criss 1996 bagheri et al 2014 clearly the geochemical compositions of the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 are distinct from the slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 that the geothermal fluids are poor correlations with the dolomitization process fig 5b whereas the sr2 and kb3 geothermal springs are exhibited as minor precipitations of mg2 ion after evaporation 4 1 2 stable isotope compositions a stable isotope is reflected in the conservative signature of geothermal groundwater and it is a good geochemical factor for extrapolating geothermal groundwater origin mixing and evaporation processes as well as a proxy for monitoring saltwater intrusion into geothermal aquifers durowoju et al 2019 mao et al 2021 satrio et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 the six saline geothermal groundwater samples along the coastlands in southern thailand two rainwater samples from phuket province southern thailand s west coast and surat thani province southern thailand s east coast and one brackish water sample from the chaiya estuary canal surat thani province were collected for the δ18o and δ2h analysis as represented in table 3 significantly the isotopic data from the rainwaters table 3 rainwater pk and rainwater sr are also used as reference of the local isotopic composition of the saline geothermal spring groundwater and brackish water samples saline geothermal springs located near the shoreline of the andaman sea e g kb2 and kb4 and the gulf of thailand e g sr3 and sr7 are possessing a geochemical composition that reflect mixed brackish water except for the sr7 and kb3 geothermal springs fig 2 and fig 5 the geothermal groundwater samples taken from the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 are the most enriched with the highest values compared to the brackish water δ18o 0 78 and δ2h 7 8 of approximately 3 0 for δ18o and reach to 20 18 for δ2h in kb2 as shown in table 3 whereas sr7 reported the highest negative value of approximately 6 58 indicating clearly that the geothermal groundwater sample is mixture of freshwater and very small amounts of saltwater mao et al 2021 satrio et al 2020 interestingly the kb2 and kb4 had very similar isotopic compositions table 3 which could be considered either to the hydrogeological settings or the geochemical properties the δ2h difference between the sr2 and kb3 is indicated that the presence of saltwater in the geothermal aquifer of the kb3 is less than that of the sr2 table 3 however although the stable isotope compositions are different between the hot spring groups slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 moderately saline geothermal spring sr2 and kb3 and very saline geothermal spring sr3 kb2 and kb4 the sr7 site represented as not directly affected by saltwater intrusion which is a meteoric origin similar to the moderately and very saline geothermal springs duriez et al 2008 lopez et al 2020 mao et al 2021 hence highly negative values of the slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 and the moderately saline geothermal springs sr2 and kb3 were indicated that could not possibly originate from seepage of the brackish water in these geothermal aquifers lopez et al 2020 mao et al 2021 stable isotope signatures δ18o and δ2h relative to vsmow are plotted in comparison with the global meteoric water line gmwl and local meteoric water line lmwl as shown in fig 6 the sr7 and kb3 geothermal spring waters are plotted in the vicinity of the gmwl δ18o 8 02δ18o 9 47 craig 1961 and particularly these corresponding to the lmwl lines lmwl pk δ18o 7 50δ18o 11 83 and lmwl sr δ18o 7 23δ18o 7 08 hydro informatics institute 2021 in contrast the saline geothermal springs e g sr3 kb2 and kb4 located below the gmwl are meteoric origin with mixed between saltwater e g seawater and brackish water and freshwater lopez et al 2020 mao et al 2021 therefore the very saline geothermal springs have been distinguished from rainwaters which made in the depletion of heavy isotopes due to saltwater intrusion fig 6 the sr7 and kb3 geothermal springs were located on the lmwl sr and lmwl pk indicating that geothermal spring waters have homology with rainwater in origin to some extent in addition the local groundwater is heated to geothermal groundwater by heating source in deep circulation whereas the kb2 and kb4 geothermal springs whose δ18o and δ2h values deviated from the lmwl and inclined to the higher δ18o value due to brackish water absorbed by geothermal aquifers as shown in fig 6 moreover at high temperatures of the sr3 and sr7 the δ18o enrichment might be due to the oxygen exchange in geothermal groundwater with oxygen in rock minerals resulting in a significant δ18o shifted and increased in geothermal spring water mao et al 2021 satrio et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 hence the sr7 geothermal spring the isotopic compositions decreases with the increase in precipitation elevation and the δ18o shift occurs due to high temperature geothermal field therefore heavy isotopes are gradually enriched baioumy et al 2015 mao et al 2021 morales arredondo et al 2016 from another perspective the relationship based isotope plots of δ18o versus tds and cl as shown in fig 7 were rather reliable to confirm that most of the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of southern thailand exhibited evidence of the existence of saltwater in local groundwater systems duriez et al 2008 mao et al 2021 except for sr7 the isotopic compositions are not influenced by brackish water intrusion consequently the hot water samples from the very saline geothermal spring sr3 kb2 and kb4 represent a slightly enriched stable isotope signature compared to the slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 and the moderately saline geothermal spring sr2 and kb3 fig 7 as reflected by the greater contamination of saltwater in those shallow geothermal aquifers mao et al 2021 even the trend of the moderately saline geothermal spring of kb3 tds content 3448 mg l is shifted toward the gmwl as shown in fig 6 the sr7 site from the slightly saline geothermal spring tds content 1828 mg l is located within the meteoric water line confirming the weak influence of seawater brackish water in this geothermal system moreover the isotopic signatures δ18o and δ2h of the sr7 and kb3 sites indicate that they are mainly recharged by rainfall whereas the sr2 sr3 kb2 and kb4 sites are recharged by brackish water a distinction of the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 was found to be a blend of different sources with a major contribution from saltwater therefore key points of the stable isotope analysis in the six saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea in southern thailand are mainly of natural origin with the major contribution through saltwater intrusion e g the sr3 kb2 and kb4 sites and the partial input from ion exchange in the shallow geothermal reservoir sr7 site outstanding interpretation of the stable isotope is acceptable to identify the origin of salinity in the geothermal groundwaters which could be either brackish water seawater or dissolved mineral elements 4 1 3 chemical geothermometers the na k mg triangle diagram as shown in fig 8 has been used to consider the equilibrium states of the six saline hot spring waters in southern thailand which allows for assessing the suitability of various cation exchange geothermometers a primary result was that most of the saline geothermal springs failed to reach immature waters except that the sr2 spring was partially equilibrated waters fig 8 it could be inferred that during the ascent of geothermal springs mixing with infiltrating local groundwater freshwater saltwater interactions mostly dominate the formation of saline geothermal systems baioumy et al 2015 blasco et al 2017 chenaker et al 2018 additionally the groundwater properties displaying a mixing process of non geothermal groundwater are almost uniformly agreeable with the chemical properties of saltwater except for sr7 which is not yet clear as shown in fig 8 moreover the geochemical characteristics of the six saline hot spring waters in southern thailand are distinct from those of non saline groundwater which shows that the saline geothermal waters are recharged by highly saline waters therefore based on data the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands in southern thailand are not in fully equilibrated state representing challenges in selecting suitable geothermometers in conditions of infiltrating saline groundwater concentrations of major cations e g na k ca2 and mg2 will increase linearly due to mixing with the infiltrating local groundwater without evident reforms caused by further water mineral reactions therefore different geothermometers comprising silica quartz and chalcedony and cations e g nak kmg and na k ca have been used to estimate subsurface temperatures of saline geothermal springs in southern thailand as shown in table 4 first the sio2 concentrations of geothermal groundwater has been used for estimating subsurface temperatures eq 1 to 2 the more concentrated the hot spring water is in silica the higher the subsurface temperature surat thani geothermal springs sr2 sr3 and sr7 exhibit higher sio2 contents than krabi geothermal springs kb2 kb3 and kb4 as affirmed by a linear correlation shown in fig 8 therefore the subsurface temperatures of the saline geothermal springs calculated by the silica geothermometers are represented by different silica phases consisting of quartz geothermometer results ranging from 77 to 115 c and chalcedony geothermometer yields ranging between 44 c and 87 c as shown in table 4 the maximum and minimum subsurface temperatures of the silica geothermometers are represented in the kb7 and kb3 geothermal springs respectively the second method to estimate the subsurface temperatures is indicated by different cation geothermometers e g na k mg and nak geothermometers as represented by eq 2 to 7 a calculation as represented in table 4 shows that some cation geothermometers deviate largely from the silica quartz temperatures eq 1 77 to 115 c such as the nak geothermometer eq 5 106 to 372 c and na k ca geothermometer eq 7 27 to 144 c the silica quartz and kmg geothermometers showed that the subsurface temperatures in the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 have similar patterns that might be underestimate temperature for these geothermal systems as expected a relatively small difference was observed between the silica quartz and nak geothermometer estimates for the sr2 eq 1 93 c and eq 5 108 c and the sr3 eq 1 109 c and eq 5 106 c because the chemical characteristics of geothermal groundwater have similar contents mao et al 2022 li et al 2020 remarkably the nak geothermometer was controlled by the dissolution equilibrium between albite and k feldspar minerals mao et al 2022 nitschke et al 2018 li et al 2020 therefore for geothermal groundwater with high so4 2 and ca2 concentrations the nak geothermometer is not suitable giggenbach 1988 swanberg 1974 the na k ca geothermometer eq 7 indicates higher exit temperatures in most saline geothermal springs except the sr7 site grouped in the slightly saline geothermal spring which represents a negative subsurface temperature the subsurface temperatures of the na k mg geothermometer eq 3 range also in negative territory interestingly for the moderately to very saline groundwater with relatively low ca2 contents their subsurface temperatures computed by the na k ca geothermometer also exhibited apparent deviations from the quartz silica temperatures therefore it is difficult to consider a constant subsurface temperature with the na k ca geothermometer in the event of relatively high na contents in groundwater therefore the subsurface temperatures of the saline geothermal groundwater systems estimated by the na k ca geothermometer could infer a poor performance in which the geothermal fluids cannot reach the nak equilibrium stage significantly the na k ca mg geothermometer eq 4 results deviate from those of the silica quartz geothermometer eq 1 due to relatively high na and ca2 concentrations which may include the influence of the mixing process between geothermal groundwater and local groundwater it seems difficult to reach a fully equilibrated water status for this reason the na k ca mg geothermometer is suitable for estimating the subsurface temperatures for saline geothermal springs in southern thailand 4 1 4 subsurface temperature based on the subsurface temperatures estimated by the chemical geothermometers of the six saline geothermal springs in southern thailand it is suggested that the geothermal systems were inferred to be low temperature reservoirs of approximately 86 to 169 c for the na k ca mg geothermometer table 4 and fig 9 ordinarily the geothermal groundwater ascends along pathways with different geological structures it has mixed with infiltrating local groundwater and the scale of dilution is speculated to be the exit temperature of geothermal springs blasco et al 2017 chenaker et al 2018 li et al 2020 a reliable estimation of subsurface temperatures calculated by geothermometers must be higher than the measured exit temperatures of geothermal sites baioumy et al 2015 blasco et al 2017 li et al 2020 it could possibly represent a geothermal subsurface temperature of the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand although geothermal fluids of the saline geothermal groundwater have originated from unknown sources a typical characteristic of local hot groundwater is represented by a relatively shallow catchment dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 ngansom et al 2020 significantly the na k ion exchange reaction between albite and k feldspar failed to reach equilibrium fig 7 because the local groundwater sample points deviated from the na k mg equilibrium line to varying degrees giggenbach 1988 kolesar and degraff 1977 nitschke et al 2018 moreover the geochemical properties of the saline geothermal springs could be confirmed to have infiltrated local groundwater e g seawater and brackish water during the ascending process resulting in the varying geochemical compositions of the saline geothermal groundwater table 1 and fig 4 especially for the very saline geothermal springs tds content 11 000 mg l it is still difficult to achieve an accurate estimation of subsurface temperature as shown in figs 8 and 9 hence the inability to select a suitable application for geothermometers resulted in the prediction of subsurface temperatures deviating considerably from a suitable temperature according to the slightly saline geothermal spring of the sr7 site both silica chalcedony and some cation geothermometers e g na k mg nak and na k ca did not provide a valid subsurface temperature except the silica quartz 115 c and the na k ca mg 86 c geothermometers may suitable for this geothermal system fig 9 in contrast for the moderately saline geothermal springs sr2 and kb3 only the na k ca mg geothermometers can reflect subsurface temperatures while other geothermometers e g silica chalcedony kmg and na k ca geothermometers are unable to represent a suitable subsurface temperature fig 9 remarkably the subsurface temperature deviations observed when the nak geothermometer is applied to saline geothermal groundwater are attributed to the non attendance of equilibrium between albite and potassium feldspar minerals in the saline geothermal reservoir this observation suggests that higher na concentrations in the geothermal groundwater of the moderately saline geothermal springs may have originated from infiltrating local groundwater through geological pathways blasco et al 2017 chenaker et al 2018 li et al 2020 for this reason the nak geothermometer might seem like a subsurface temperature that was controlled by saltwater rather than mineral groundwater chemical equilibrium hence the nak geothermometer estimated subsurface temperatures are unsuitable for the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand as shown in fig 9 although the heat sources for the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand are unknown all of them are related to non volcanic geological settings ngansom and duerrast 2019 ngansom et al 2020 the only possible heat source is emphasized on radioactive decay of long lived isotopes e g u 238 u 235 and th 232 radon under ambient conditions of the high pressure and temperature in porous reservoir rocks is higher groundwater solubility davidson et al 2016 ngansom et al 2022 tsunomori et al 2017 its behavior is basically determined by the physical processes and not by the geochemical interactions therefore reservoir temperature levels could be related to the radon concentration in geothermal groundwater as shown in fig 9 the reservoir temperatures of the very saline geothermal springs computed by the na k ca mg geothermometer represent an average reservoir temperature of approximately 163 c which is appropriate to geological characterizations in these geothermal systems in contrast the radon concentrations in the geothermal groundwater are widely different comprising of the highest level in sr3 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 kb4 123 60 0 22 kbq m3 and kb2 101 06 0 29 kbq m3 as shown in fig 9 and table 5 exceptionally the highest radon level of the sr3 apart from radiogenic sources at the deep structure of reservoir rocks is also dependent on available natural radionuclides in depositional environments along the coastland of the gulf of thailand hence the reservoir temperature differences of any saline geothermal spring system in southern thailand seem to depend on the properties of reservoir rocks rather than radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater fig 9 because a fractures and fault structure related to geothermal springs provide an easy pathway for to release of radioactive gas to the atmosphere duque et al 2019 ngansom et al 2022 tsunomori et al 2018 although a direct relationship between reservoir temperatures and radon concentrations in the saline geothermal groundwater was not clear the radon spreads are mostly controlled by convection flow in high temperature zone of geothermal fields 4 2 natural radioactivity in saline geothermal groundwater system 4 2 1 naturally occurring background radiation a field observed background radiation level of the saline geothermal spring fields along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea from direct measurement of the radiation in the environment was reported in table 5 high levels of natural background radiation can be considered as an indicator radon concentrations with fast upward flow through rock discontinuities davidson et al 2016 tsunomori et al 2018 notably the process of transporting the natural radioactive gas may be linked to high natural background radiation of the saline geothermal field according to direct measurements of the background radiation in the saline geothermal spring fields the highest dose at the sr3 site surat thani province southern thailand s east coast and the lowest dose at the kb3 site krabi province southern thailand s west coast followed by the outlet hot spring ranged from 0 08 0 01 μsv h to 27 84 1 06 μsv h at 1 m from the outlet between 0 07 0 01 μsv h and 25 53 1 38 μsv h and at 3 m from the outlet hot spring approximately 0 05 0 02 μsv h and 5 70 0 98 μsv h respectively as shown in table 5 the background radiation level has increased considerably in the sr3 site related to granitic mountains that are found in the west releasing weathered minerals containing radioactive elements via river systems into the ban don bay in this case the high natural background radiation might be associate with natural radioactive gases that might be related to reservoir rocks and unconsolidated marine sediments the kmf fault zone might encourage vertical natural radioactive gas diffuses to interact with deeper geological formations these results might imply that the high natural background radiation is a yield of decay of uranium present in geothermal reservoir rocks as granite based sediments form part of the geothermal aquifers in addition the kb4 site which is located along the shoreline of the andaman sea and has slightly higher radiation in the environment than other saline geothermal springs in this zone approximately 1 52 0 18 μsv h the natural radioactive gas emanation increase correlates with increased tds content uranium is more soluble in carbonate groundwater furthermore the integration of several geological factors particularly minor faults and small fractures the detection of natural background radiations the kb4 site filled with marine sediments of weathered sandstone outcrops and geochemical reactions occurring in the geothermal aquifers contribute to the high concentrations of radon on the other hand the presence of a high natural background radiation might in the saline geothermal spring areas confirm to existence of local faults in the study sites the contributions from terrestrial radiation that appeared may be ascribed mainly to the contribution of radon activity as the daughter radionuclide of the uranium series which are not constant and depend on the local geological setting chao et al 2020 ghaffari et al 2020 interestingly heat sources of geothermal springs in southern thailand may associate with radioactive decay of certain minerals exhibit in reservoir rocks for instance granite intrusions may contain uranium minerals 4 2 2 radon concentration radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater measured in the six saline geothermal spring areas along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea are comprising of the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 the moderately saline geothermal springs sr2 and kb3 the slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 and one brackish water from the chaiya estuary canals as reported in table 5 the very saline springs represent radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater which range from 101 06 0 29 kbq m3 at the kb2 site to 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 at the sr3 site with an overall average value of 2910 71 0 52 kbq m3 for this group as shown in table 5 both the moderately and slightly saline geothermal springs display radon activity in geothermal groundwater which ranges from 18 64 0 96 kbq m3 at the kb3 site to 40 65 2 11 kbq m3 at the sr2 site with an overall average of 31 37 0 89 kbq m3 table 5 in contrast for brackish water at a distance from the sr3 site 15 km indicates radon in saline water of approximately 0 71 0 02 kbq m3 the highest radon concentration in the saline geothermal groundwater were found at the sr3 site at approximately 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 at a distance from the shoreline of the chaiya estuary of approximately 2 km tds content 11 856 mg l the very saline geothermal spring the lowest radon concentration in geothermal groundwater was found at the kb3 site at approximately 18 64 0 96 kbq m3 at a distance from the krabi estuary of approximately 10 km tds content 3448 mg l the moderately saline geothermal spring notably the rad7 device displayed a large gap between the lowest kb3 18 64 0 96 kbq m3 and highest sr3 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 radon activity in geothermal groundwater for each saline geothermal spring in southern thailand based on geochemical studies of saline geothermal springs the results showed that the salinity tds contents table 1 and fig 4 decreases with the distance from the estuary and ranges between 18 070 mg l at kb4 0 5 km from the krabi estuary and 1828 mg l at sr7 25 km from the surat thani estuary the relationship between the radon concentrations in the saline geothermal groundwater and the major ions of na mg2 k ca2 and cl contents displays no significant correlation as shown in fig 10 this suggests that the activities of measured radon concentrations do not depend on their geochemical properties but on the geological environment and material of their coastal sediments abadi et al 2016 duque et al 2019 krishan et al 2015 telahigue et al 2018 another analysis of the saline geothermal springs in surat thani province sr2 sr3 and sr7 has showed high radon levels however it is not yet clear whether the geochemical properties and the distances between the seashore and geothermal field table 1 are relevant to the levels of radon in these saline geothermal springs fig 10 the sr7 site is located approximately 25 km from the coastlines of the gulf of thailand and is also known for its low tds content 1828 mg l however most of the saline geothermal areas especially the sr3 site are highly influenced by tide dominated coasts that are covered with muddy sediments transported by tidal currents therefore the local geological setting is considered the most significant variable for explaining the high radon concentration in the saline geothermal groundwater in southern thailand because geothermal fluid passes through many layered rocks sediments e g igneous rock limestone and clay sediment that are highly concentrated with radon activity radon can be detected in geothermal groundwater reddy et al 2006 telahigue et al 2018 this can be explained by the fact that in geological environments such as coastal sediments where brackish water comes in contact with local groundwater it can absorb radon from clayey coastal sediments exhibit in geothermal aquifers and mix with freshwater making them more radioactive duque et al 2019 krishan et al 2015 stieglitz et al 2013 telahigue et al 2018 in particular saltwater intrusion into geothermal systems confirmed by geochemical analyses may cause the enhancement of radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater by contamination with radioactive materials introduced in the geological environment e g sandy sediments and muddy intertidal flats it is also considered that the impacts of shallow geothermal reservoirs might cause uranium contamination for instance the kb4 and sr3 sites have controlled groundwater quality by saltmarsh and intertidal flats that are filled with sandy and muddy sediments deposited hence levels of radon concentration in geothermal aquifers may depend on contamination from clayey sediment that represents atmospheric radon and makes groundwater more radioactive duque et al 2019 stieglitz et al 2013 telahigue et al 2018 furthermore it is also possible that radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater might have received discharges from weathering of silicic igneous rocks uranium deposits at depth abadi et al 2016 telahigue et al 2018 tsunomori et al 2017 ordinarily natural hot springs associated with granitic rocks usually have much higher radon activity in geothermal groundwater than sedimentary metamorphic rocks because granites may contain veins of naturally occurring radioactive elements and can generally be detected in geothermal groundwater abadi et al 2016 krishan et al 2015 shu aibu et al 2021 stieglitz et al 2013 hence the concentration of radon in the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand may also be associated with uranium derived from the weathering process of granitic rocks in geothermal reservoirs at depth high radon concentrations are also found near the faults especially along the klong marui fault of the surat thani geothermal province e g sr2 and sr3 table 5 hence the radon concentrations in the geothermal groundwater of saline geothermal fields in southern thailand are found to be highly variable in accordance with the geological environment and rock type of the regional geological setting 5 conclusions the hydrogeochemical analysis and natural radioactivity in the six saline geothermal springs surat thani geothermal spring sr2 sr3 and sr7 and krabi geothermal spring kb2 kb3 and kb4 along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea in southern thailand were investigated the physical and chemical properties of saline geothermal waters were different depending on their geological environment and location based on the tds values of the saline geothermal springs they can be classified into three categories a slightly saline geothermal spring in sr7 b moderately saline geothermal spring in sr2 and kb3 and c very saline geothermal spring in sr3 kb2 and kb4 the quantitative analysis of anions and cations represents decreasing trends with distance from coastlines the stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h indicate that the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand are mixed between saltwater and freshwater and originate from precipitation derived waters significantly the sr3 kb2 and kb4 which are grouped in the very saline geothermal springs are the most enriched with the highest values of approximately 3 0 for δ18o and reach 20 18 for δ2h in kb2 except for the sr7 of the slightly saline geothermal spring located on southern thailand s east coast which is still unconfirmed to be contaminated by saltwater intrusion it was probably mixed with saltwater before being heated and not affected by saline water intrusion again afterwards the other geothermal spring waters e g sr3 and kb4 are most likely to be mixed with saltwater both before and after being heated in the geothermal reservoir according to the geothermometers silica and cation the sr3 and sr7 sites along the seashore of the gulf of thailand have the highest reservoir temperatures refer to the na k ca mg geothermometer ranging from 86 to 169 c on the other hand the silica chalcedony and some cation geothermometers e g na k mg nak and kmg were unreliable due to saltwater intrusion representing the lack of a water mineral equilibrium state of geothermal fluids the spatial variation in radon concentrations in the saline geothermal groundwater along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea is controlled by the local geological environments radon enrichment in the geothermal groundwater systems along southern thailand s east coast e g sr2 and sr3 is mainly controlled by quaternary sediments originated from weathered granitic rocks inland and adjacent coastal areas in addition the brackish water inflow may transport weathering products of granitic rocks from the northeast and southeast of the sr3 site and the koh samui and koh phangan islands were deposited on the coastlands of the gulf of thailand intruded seawater brackish water has desorbed natural radionuclides e g ra 226 and u 238 from clayey sediments and hence the emanation of radon and the enhancement of its concentration in geothermal groundwater for instance the observed radon concentration in the kb4 site southern thailand s west coast may be associated with muddy coastal sediments derived from the mangrove forest moreover it might also be noted that the high radon concentration in southern thailand may be related to major fault zones of the kmf and rf since the hot spring waters are flowing through rocks sediments highly concentrated with natural radionuclides the local faults provided support in the distribution of the radon from the geothermal aquifer in a vertical direction regarding natural radionuclides in the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand it was suggested that the radon concentrations in the geothermal groundwater were highly influenced by the local geological environment and coastal sediments results of this study will extend the understanding of the hydrogeological processes and radon concentrations in the saline geothermal spring systems along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea in southern thailand declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing

1232,hydrogeological settings and natural radionuclides of saline geothermal fields along the coastlines of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea in southern thailand are currently not fully understood six saline geothermal springs have been discovered in surat thani province southern thailand s east coast sr2 sr3 and sr7 sites krabi province southern thailand s west coast kb2 kb3 and kb4 sites based on total dissolved solid contents we divided the saline geothermal springs into three categories a slightly saline geothermal spring had only sr7 1828 mg l b moderately saline geothermal spring consisted of sr2 10 196 mg l and kb3 3448 mg l and c very saline geothermal spring comprised sr3 11 856 mg l kb2 17 014 mg l and kb4 18 070 mg l the major ions in the saline geothermal groundwater represent decreasing trends with the distance from the coastline stable isotope signatures δ18o and δ2h relative to the vsmow plotted in comparison with the global meteoric water line and local meteoric water line are presumably of meteoric origin and influenced by seawater brackish water however the sr7 and kb3 sites indicated that the isotopic signatures were mainly recharged by rainwater significantly the na k ca mg geothermometer can reasonably estimate the reservoir temperatures for the five saline geothermal springs to be in the range of 120 c kb3 to 169 c sr2 while the sr7 the silica quartz geothermometer is proposed of approximately 115 c however the silica chalcedony and other cation geothermometers fail to estimate suitable reservoir temperatures on the other hand the radon concentrations in the saline geothermal groundwater along the gulf of thailand and andaman sea were assessed by rad7 h2o which varied from 18 64 0 96 kbq m3 kb2 andaman sea side to 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 sr7 gulf of thailand side a comparison of radon activity with the saltwater intrusion showed that the saline geothermal groundwater on the gulf of thailand side had higher levels than that at the andaman sea side the deposition of quaternary sediments combined with significant saltwater inflow enriched with radon resulted from the decay of uranium from both non marine and coastal deposits related to granitic mountain weathering along the gulf of thailand radon concentrations in the geothermal groundwater were highly influenced by the local geological environment and coastal sediments keywords hydrogeological environment radon saline geothermal spring gulf of thailand andaman sea data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction high salinity geothermal springs are widely distributed in many coastal areas of the world s seas such as holts landing state park delaware usa sperchios basin central greece and wenquanzhen in the eastern sichuan basin southwest china andrés et al 2010 duque et al 2019 duriez et al 2008 guo et al 2018 in addition to beautiful beaches and islands thailand s southern region also has many popular tourist destinations e g mountain ranges mangrove forests and natural hot springs at least six saline geothermal spring attractions were discovered on the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea and at least two saline geothermal springs are the most visited in southeast asia dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 1 the khlong thom hot spring kb4 in krabi province and located along the shoreline of the andaman sea and 2 the thasathon hot spring sr7 in surat thani province situated along the coastland of the gulf of thailand dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 ngansom and duerrast 2019 other natural saline hot springs can be found in surat thani province southern thailand s east coast the sr2 and sr3 sites and krabi province southern thailand s west coast and the kb2 and kb3 sites which are mostly located near brackish waterways estuaries that are connected to mangrove areas dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 ngansom and duerrast 2019 in general geochemical properties of geothermal groundwater along coastlands especially with fluctuating salinity tds content primarily depend on layers of marine sediments tidal influences and distances between estuary seashore and geothermal spring sites baioumy et al 2015 chenaker et al 2018 dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 for instance the kb4 and sr3 sites are particularly interesting due to the shortest distance from krabi s estuary 0 5 km and surat thani s estuary 2 km and the highest tds contents approximately 18 070 mg l and 11 856 mg l respectively ngansom and duerrast 2019 ngansom and dürrast 2021 nevertheless a complete interpretation of the geochemical analysis of the saline geothermal spring waters along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea in southern thailand has not been considered previously malain et al 2010 at the local scale the geothermal aquifers in the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands in southern thailand are mostly considered unconfined and their related coastal sediments have unconsolidated marine sediments of altered granite sandstone dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 these highly vulnerable aquifers constitute critical target areas of saltwater intrusion into geothermal groundwater systems dürrast and ngansom 2022 guo et al 2019 significantly the influence of geological control on hot groundwater flow paths has decreased dramatically such as saltwater intrusion into geothermal aquifers kanellopoulos et al 2020 mao et al 2021 the upstream movement of seawater brackish water might directly affect shallow geothermal reservoirs especially the state of weathering and certain physical properties e g soil and water resistivity mao et al 2021 pétré et al 2020 and ri et al 2022 therefore a possible explanation for high salinity geothermal systems along coastlands has been attributed to 1 modern seawater intrusion into a local geothermal aquifer mao et al 2021 ri et al 2022 stieglitz et al 2013 2 contributions of deep seawaters andrés et al 2010 duriez et al 2008 guo et al 2018 and 3 water rock interaction in a geothermal reservoir kanellopoulos et al 2020 mao et al 2022 except for the brackish water in estuaries salinity increased during the summer dry season when a natural supply e g rainwater and groundwater decreased andrés et al 2010 duque et al 2019 duriez et al 2008 another perspective of saline geothermal springs along coastlands is the monitoring of environmental radiation in geothermal groundwater which has typically focused on specific radionuclides in seawater e g uranium 238 radium 226 and potassium 40 bonotto and bueno 2008 duque et al 2019 krishan et al 2015 remarkably radon 222 as part of the radioactive decay series of uranium is of most concern in geothermal spring waters especially saline geothermal groundwater with higher concentrations of seawater abadi et al 2016 duque et al 2019 stieglitz et al 2013 telahigue et al 2018 at coastlands radium 226 and radon 222 can be absorbed from clayey sediments exhibited in geothermal aquifers and mixed with saltwater fresh groundwater thus they are more radioactive telahigue et al 2018 stieglitz et al 2013 duque et al 2019 a concentration of natural radionuclides has been estimated and evaluated in combination with geochemical investigations e g ph and major and trace ions kanellopoulos et al 2018 lopez et al 2020 investigating the natural sources of radon in geothermal systems with different geological environments and physical chemical characteristics of geothermal groundwaters is the critical challenge abadi et al 2016 abdel mageed et al 2013 telahigue et al 2018 tripathi et al 2013 therefore radon levels might be used as a tracer of saltwater intrusion into geothermal aquifers because radium has salinity dependent desorption behavior krishan et al 2015 yehia et al 2017 yii et al 2009 furthermore previous studies have reported strong spatial relationships between radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater and fault zone that is represented radon levels significantly higher than background levels abadi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 davidson et al 2016 tsunomori et al 2017 radon is constantly being produced by radium decay in granitic aquifers chen et al 2018 duque et al 2019 fault zones are exceptional migration pathways for radioactive gas from a deep structure to the earth s surface due to their enhanced permeability and porosity compared to surrounding rock enabling gases to buoyantly migrate upwards abadi et al 2016 chen et al 2018 davidson et al 2016 tsunomori et al 2017 local fluctuations may have resulted from radioactive gas flows associated with high permeability fault zones increasing temperature in geothermal reservoirs seems to enhance radon dissolution from the reservoir rocks chao et al 2020 iwaoka et al 2013 mao et al 2021 ngansom et al 2022 moreover radon is released mainly by minerals containing radioactive elements through various geologic processes including release from the subsurface during decay and through physical chemical weathering into the air via open fractures and joints abadi et al 2016 tsunomori et al 2017 wu et al 2021 hence in southern thailand there is a short distance between fault lines and geothermal fields and a short distance between shorelines and hot spring sites which might affect radon concentrations in hot springs through both geological environments fault and saltwater intrusion bonotto and bueno 2008 shu aibu et al 2021 stieglitz et al 2013 therefore this study aims to 1 investigate the understanding of the hydrogeological environment of saline hot springs in southern thailand using the geochemical characterization i e stable isotopes cations and anions of such waters 2 estimate and assign geothermometers to saline geothermal springs and 3 evaluate natural radionuclides with emphasis on radon concentrations which might relate to the geological environmental setting along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea 2 geological environment setting the coastal regions of thailand relate to the gulf of thailand in the east and the andaman sea in the west as shown in fig 1a and b ridd 2009 ridd 2012 sautter et al 2017 the gulf of thailand coastline has a distance of approximately 1670 km and represents an emergent coastline with beaches and lagoons chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 kanjanapayont 2014 on the western side of the thai peninsula with the andaman sea the related shoreline is approximately 750 km long and comprises of various types of geological features such as cliffs islands short narrow beaches and a drowned valley fig 1b curray 2005 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 furthermore the khlong marui fault kmf and the ranong fault rf zones are the major nne ssw trending strike slip faults which cut across the thai peninsula as shown in fig 1b kanjanapayont et al 2012 ridd 2012 watkinson et al 2008 although both fault zones have not been traced offshore these faults might intersect in the northern gulf of thailand fig 1b ridd 2012 watkinson et al 2008 the kmf can be traced from phuket province in the southwest toward surat thani province in the northeast while the rf can be followed from phang nga province takua pa district in the southwest to prachuap khiri khan province pran buri district in the northeast both crossing the peninsula entirely fig 1b kanjanapayont et al 2012 ridd 2009 2012 watkinson et al 2008 thus the recent tectonic evolution and local geological setting of the parts of the southern region have been the related of these consequential active faults presently geological surveys of the saline geothermal fields along the coastlines of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea have discovered at least six saline hot springs on the coastland of krabi and surat thani provinces as shown in fig 1c to 1h significantly the saline geothermal springs have been considered unique geological features in this region because most are non saline hot springs approximately 29 geothermal spring sites ngansom and duerrast 2019 ngansom and dürrast 2021 geologic studies carried out in three saline geothermal spring areas sr2 sr3 and sr7 in surat thani province are located on coastal sediments that are connected to mangrove areas fig 1c to 1e chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 on the other hand krabi province which is famous for its beautiful white sand beaches saline hot springs including kb2 kb3 and kb4 are situated near the krabi estuary of the khlong thom river fig 1f to 1h dürrast and ngansom 2022 the local geology at the surat thani geothermal springs sr2 sr3 and sr7 show various rock types of ages ranging from precambrian to tertiary chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 kanjanapayont 2014 physical characteristics visible at their outcrops can be classified as granitic rocks as well as sedimentary and metamorphic rocks chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 sautter et al 2017 granitic rocks are located in the northeast and southeast of the sr3 site remarkably the sr2 and sr3 are located next to each other and the samui and phangan islands fig 1b chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 kanjanapayont et al 2012 all granite mountains in surat thani province are tin bearing granites and are oriented approximately north south chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 furthermore the quaternary sediments around the saline geothermal springs especially sr2 and sr3 can be classified based on the geological environment into non marine lithofacies e g colluvium and alluvium and coastal lithofacies e g deltaic sediments estuarine and intertidal mud flat and coastal barrier sand chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 the sr2 and sr3 sites geological environments consist of coastal sediments where tide dominated shorelines are largely enclosed with sandy and muddy sediments transported by tidal currents fig 1c and d chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 the coastland along the estuary which has extensive mangrove areas and muddy intertidal flats is generally covered with sandy marine sediments fig 1c and d furthermore the local geological setting of the saline hot springs in both surat thani and krabi provinces is related to saltmarshes and intertidal flats chotikasathien and kohpina 1993 dürrast and ngansom 2022 they are usually located adjacent to the shoreline and are extensive at river mouths therefore hydrogeological studies of both non geothermal and geothermal waters in the study area are usually emphasized on saltwater intrusion mechanisms on the other hand the geological structure of krabi province is indirectly affected by the rf and kmf zones as shown in fig 1b and f to 1h curray 2005 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 watkinson et al 2008 local geological surveys have been reported on different outcrops of the same stratigraphy of the triassic formations such as siltstone e g brick red thin bedded and dolomitic limestone lenses and sandstone e g light brown fine to medium grained and thin to medium bedded fig 1b and g dürrast and ngansom 2022 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 almost all of the bedrocks are sandstone jurassic and triassic and to a small extent limestone permian and permian to carboniferous petersen and ratanasthien 2011 sautter et al 2017 geothermal springs including the saline hot springs kb2 kb3 and kb4 are widely distributed throughout small fault zones dürrast and ngansom 2022 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 watkinson et al 2008 as freshwater aquifers are part of geothermal spring systems and as they connected to the unconfined aquifers of coastal sediments such faults may provide pathways for seawater intrusion into geothermal systems at depth fig 1f dürrast and ngansom 2022 petersen and ratanasthien 2011 therefore both fractured bedrocks and minor faults might be inferred to play a critical role in the recharge and discharge of the krabi geothermal waters as infiltration channels of marine water 3 methods 3 1 sample collection and analysis saline geothermal fields along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea in southern thailand were considered in this study fig 1a six natural saline hot springs sr2 sr3 sr7 kb2 kb3 and kb4 and one brackish water sample were collected and the sampling locations are reported in table 1 all saline geothermal groundwater samples were collected in december 2021 from outlets of the natural hot spring pools and were immediately filtered through a 0 45 lm membrane filter in situ prior to any geochemical analysis after cooling naturally the saline groundwater samples were stored in one liter for qualitative analysis cations and anions and a quarter of a liter for the stable water isotopes

geothermal groundwater samples used for the stable water isotope and anion analyses exit temperatures ph hco3 and electrical conductivity ec were measured in situ at the sampling sites by a portable ph meter ion meter pxs hco3 and conductivity meter hi2003 respectively furthermore all the locations of sampling points were recorded by a garmin device a gps system etrex venture hc usa a qualitative analysis cations and anions was performed at the laboratory of water analysis co ltd iso iec 17025 2017 phra nakhon si ayutthaya thailand the stable water isotopes δ2h and δ18o were measured by the laboratory of the nuclear technology research and development center ntrdc nakhon nayok thailand methods of the geochemical analysis and detection limits of these parameters are shown in table 2 3 2 geothermometers geothermometry is a geochemical tool for temperature determination in geothermal reservoirs baioumy et al 2015 bayram 2001 blasco et al 2017 most geothermal reservoirs have been in deep intrusive heat sources that usually refer to geological events e g crystallization of magma metamorphism of preexisting rocks and radioactive decay blasco et al 2017 chenaker et al 2018 li et al

fournier 1977 fournier and truesdell 1973 giggenbach 1988 kolesar and degraff 1977 pope et al 1987 nitschke et al 2018 therefore insights from silica and cation geothermometers as shown in eqs 1 to 7

total of six saline geothermal groundwater samples and one brackish water seawater sample were collected from the natural hot spring pools and the estuary of surat thani province for their use in measuring radon concentrations the rad7 electronic radon detector by durridge company inc billerica ma equipped with a rad h2o water accessory was used to measure the radon concentration in these saline geothermal waters the saline geothermal groundwater and brackish water samples were collected in 250 ml vials designed for use appropriate for measuring radon levels the sampling was done in december 2021 and the weather conditions during the sampling period were fairly stable the freshness of the groundwater samples saline hot springs and brackish water was ensured by sampling to a depth of approximately 0 3 m below the water surface in contrast geothermal groundwater sampling is complex because the gas easily escapes from groundwater and therefore has to be done without any operation which might lead to outgassing csige et al 2013 stojković et al 2015 saline geothermal groundwater and brackish water samples were collected in such a way that there was no bubbling furthermore the groundwater samples were analyzed immediately at the sampling site of the natural hot spring pools the time difference between taking the geothermal groundwater sampling and measuring it was only a few minutes so there was no need for decay correction stojković et al 2015 the measurement sensitivity of the rad7 device to radon concentrations in its lower limit of detection was 0 37 bq l the rad h2o required a desiccant to be used at all times to dry the air stream before it entered the device stojković et al 2015 the relative humidity readings during the measurement should remain below 10 stojković et al 2015 in addition to circulate sample air through the desiccant and the rad7 device without further aerating the groundwater sample a bypass may be allowed for the airflow to bypass the aerator a valve in the bypass system must be turned off during the first five minutes while the groundwater sample is aerated after the first cycle the bypass valve was opened to prevent further aeration of the groundwater sample therefore to determine the radon concentration in the saline geothermal groundwater sample after a sniff protocol reading it will be necessary to multiply the radon in air measurement by a factor whose value can be found from a measurement with the wat250 protocol the operation of the rad h2o device in this study is as follows a radon is evicted from the saline geothermal groundwater sample by using a bubbling kit b evicted radon enters a hemisphere chamber by air circulation c polonium decayed from radon is collected onto a silicon solid state detector by an electric field and d radon concentration is computed from the count rate of polonium 4 results and discussion 4 1 hydrogeological analysis of the saline geothermal springs 4 1 1 hydrochemical characteristics geochemical concentrations of major ions cations and anions ph values and tds contents of the six saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea are represented in table 1 the site specific selection of the high salinity geothermal springs tds contents 1828 to 18 070 mg l is located near shorelines of the andaman sea krabi geothermal province kb2 kb3 and kb4 sites and gulf of thailand surat thani geothermal province sr2 sr3 and sr7 sites ranging between 0 5 km kb4 site and 25 km sr7 site table 1 it is notable that they have high tds contents varying significantly ranging from 1828 mg l the sr7 site to 18 070 mg l the kb4 site as shown in table 1 the ph values of the saline geothermal spring samplings are between 7 20 and 7 78 average ph 7 55 indicating that the geothermal groundwater are slightly alkaline in nature especially the sr2 ph 7 78 sr3 ph 7 70 and kb4 ph 7 60 geothermal sites the dominant ions and features of the saline geothermal groundwater emerging along the shorelines of southern thailand are an average concentration of na 2890 mg l ca2 1621 5 mg l and cl 6532 9 mg l as shown in table 1 the piper diagram of the six saline geothermal springs in southern thailand mainly highlights the ca nacl type i e kb3 and kb4 nacl type i e sr2 sr3 and kb2 and cacl type i e sr7 as shown in fig 2 the sr7 geothermal spring has a large difference from other saline geothermal springs exhibited with low cl content 19 mg l the nacl type comprising the sr2 sr3 and kb2 geothermal springs compared with the brackish water sample shows that the major components are higher than those of the chemical composition of the brackish water in particular so4 2 ca2 and na contents indicate that hot spring water is influenced by saltwater intrusion into freshwater aquifers fig 2 duriez et al 2008 pétré et al 2020 ri et al 2022 the majority of dissolved ions in the saline geothermal spring waters are shown in table 1 and fig 3 the sr7 concentrations are obviously less than those at other hot spring sampling points except f and so4 2 contents high concentrations of na and cl in saline geothermal spring waters may arise from saltwater intrusion and dissolution of saline sediments in coastal wetlands pétré et al 2020 ri et al 2022 stieglitz et al 2013 hence the na and cl contents can be used to distinguish different types of hot spring waters because the chemical properties of their waters are related to environmental factors the ca2 content is predominant in the sr3 kb2 and kb4 geothermal sites and is found in very small amounts in the sr2 and kb3 geothermal springs which influence the calcification of sedimentary formation waters table 1 and fig 3 on the other hand the highest br content is indicated in kb4 which accumulated in organic rich mudstones of seawater controlled by organic sources from the krabi estuary duriez et al 2008 kanellopoulos et al 2020 ri et al 2022 from another perspective the distinguished relationship between the tds and other concentrations of na k cl and br in the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea exhibited decreasing trends with the distance from the estuary as shown in table 1 and fig 4 while the concentrations of ca2 mg2 and hco3 showed fluctuating trends fig 4 these properties of the saline geothermal springs except for sr7 geothermal site were probably due to the relative saltwater intrusion with distance into the estuary which enriches na cl and the other major ions rather than hco3 in the local groundwater system baioumy et al 2015 pétré et al 2020 ri et al 2022 a relationship between the total dissolved solid tds content and geothermal water salinity can be used to group the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of southern thailand into three categories andrés et al 2010 guo et al 2018 guo et al 2019 a slightly saline geothermal spring with a tds content of 1000 to 3000 mg l here sr7 1828 mg l b moderately saline geothermal springs with tds content of 3000 to 11 000 mg l here sr2 10 196 mg l and kb3 3448 mg l and c very saline geothermal springs with tds content of 11 000 mg l here sr3 11 856 mg l kb2 17 014 mg l and kb4 18 070 mg l as shown in fig 4 in the slightly saline geothermal spring of sr7 the ion concentrations e g na mg2 cl and hco3 are lower than those of the moderately saline geothermal springs table 1 and fig 4 although most of the major elements of sr7 are low the so4 2 content 1162 mg l is obviously higher than that of the kb2 site 843 mg l of the very saline geothermal spring moreover the ion compositions of the sr7 site such as cl 19 mg l br 8 63 mg l k 13 mg l and na 37 mg l are significantly distinct from the contents of the seawater sample cl 13 965 mg l br 45 3 mg l k 317 6 mg l and na 2603 mg l hence the saline geothermal groundwater of the sr7 site is not related to saltwater intrusion into the shallow geothermal aquifer in the moderately saline geothermal springs the chemical properties of kb3 tds content 3448 mg l and sr2 tds content 10 196 mg l are quite different such as the contents of hco3 kb3 281 8 mg l and sr2 144 9 mg l cl kb3 1927 mg l and sr2 7158 5 mg l ca2 kb3 324 7 mg l and sr2 580 5 mg l and na kb3 351 mg l and sr2 3684 mg l as shown in table 1 and fig 4 a higher hco3 content of the kb3 site indicates the weathering of geological material of carbonaceous rocks and the na content might be attributed to mineral dissolution in porous rocks duque et al 2019 kanellopoulos et al 2020 its conditions lead to the slow movement of geothermal groundwater providing enough time for mineral dissolution kanellopoulos et al 2020 wu et al 2021 on the other hand the very saline geothermal springs i e sr3 kb2 and kb4 indicated that the cation concentration of na was highest at the kb2 site at approximately 4863 mg l whereas a dominant anion of cl was observed at the kb4 site at approximately 11 918 mg l bicarbonate ions hco3 ranged between 108 mg l sr3 and 142 mg l kb2 and appeared as the third dominant anion after cl and so4 2 possessing enhanced geothermal groundwaters table 1 and fig 4 moreover the large concentrations of k in kb2 236 mg l and kb4 180 mg l may be attributed to various environmental and anthropogenic activities stieglitz et al 2013 wu et al 2021 consequently the variation trends of the ion concentrations of the sr3 kb2 and kb4 geothermal springs are similar fig 4 indicating that they have similar processes to saltwater intrusion duriez et al 2008 pétré et al 2020 ri et al 2022 a high concentration of the major ions in the moderately saline geothermal springs sr2 and kb3 and the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 especially cl na so4 2 mg2 ca2 and k may suggest that fresh groundwater has mixed with saltwater in the geothermal aquifers duan et al 2022 duriez et al 2008 kanellopoulos et al 2020 ri et al 2022 meanwhile concentrations of the major ions of sr7 and kb3 are lower than the average concentration of the saline geothermal springs which might be irrelevant for saltwater intrusion in fractured geothermal aquifers kanellopoulos et al 2020 ri et al 2022 apart from that the ca excess versus na deficit diagram fig 5a and ca excess versus mg deficit diagram fig 5b was applied to explain the initial geochemical composition with respect to seawater davisson and criss 1996 morales arredondo et al 2017 bagheri et al 2014 calculated using the following equations 8 ca excess ca meas ca cl sw cl meas 2 40 08 9 na deficit na cl sw cl meas na meas 1 22 99 10 mg deficit mg cl sw cl meas mg meas 2 24 3 where the ca excess na deficit and mg deficit are in meq l and the subscripts sw and meas show the ion concentrations of seawater and saline geothermal groundwater in mg l respectively according to fig 5a the basinal fluid line bfl is represented the unique correlation achieved among ca2 na and cl while the ca excesses and na deficits do not significantly correlate with other major dissolved constituents e g k so4 2 and hco3 fig 5a for the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 ca2 concentrations were in substantial excess and na were in substantial deficit meaning they are formed by mixed brackish water with relatively high concentrations birkle et al 2009 davisson and criss 1996 the sr2 geothermal spring was probably affected by the dolomitization and then by mixing with saltwater produced from a mechanism of seawater intrusion whereas the sr7 and kb3 geothermal springs located right and over the seawater evaporation fig 5a can be explained by the direct cation exchange take their place between marine clays exhibited in the geothermal sites which releases na to the solution and captures ca2 and or mg2 on the other hand the ca excess versus mg deficit diagram is considered in the saline geothermal groundwater to indicate the processes of dolomitization mg2 precipitation and calcite and gypsum dissolution fig 5b davisson and criss 1996 bagheri et al 2014 clearly the geochemical compositions of the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 are distinct from the slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 that the geothermal fluids are poor correlations with the dolomitization process fig 5b whereas the sr2 and kb3 geothermal springs are exhibited as minor precipitations of mg2 ion after evaporation 4 1 2 stable isotope compositions a stable isotope is reflected in the conservative signature of geothermal groundwater and it is a good geochemical factor for extrapolating geothermal groundwater origin mixing and evaporation processes as well as a proxy for monitoring saltwater intrusion into geothermal aquifers durowoju et al 2019 mao et al 2021 satrio et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 the six saline geothermal groundwater samples along the coastlands in southern thailand two rainwater samples from phuket province southern thailand s west coast and surat thani province southern thailand s east coast and one brackish water sample from the chaiya estuary canal surat thani province were collected for the δ18o and δ2h analysis as represented in table 3 significantly the isotopic data from the rainwaters table 3 rainwater pk and rainwater sr are also used as reference of the local isotopic composition of the saline geothermal spring groundwater and brackish water samples saline geothermal springs located near the shoreline of the andaman sea e g kb2 and kb4 and the gulf of thailand e g sr3 and sr7 are possessing a geochemical composition that reflect mixed brackish water except for the sr7 and kb3 geothermal springs fig 2 and fig 5 the geothermal groundwater samples taken from the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 are the most enriched with the highest values compared to the brackish water δ18o 0 78 and δ2h 7 8 of approximately 3 0 for δ18o and reach to 20 18 for δ2h in kb2 as shown in table 3 whereas sr7 reported the highest negative value of approximately 6 58 indicating clearly that the geothermal groundwater sample is mixture of freshwater and very small amounts of saltwater mao et al 2021 satrio et al 2020 interestingly the kb2 and kb4 had very similar isotopic compositions table 3 which could be considered either to the hydrogeological settings or the geochemical properties the δ2h difference between the sr2 and kb3 is indicated that the presence of saltwater in the geothermal aquifer of the kb3 is less than that of the sr2 table 3 however although the stable isotope compositions are different between the hot spring groups slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 moderately saline geothermal spring sr2 and kb3 and very saline geothermal spring sr3 kb2 and kb4 the sr7 site represented as not directly affected by saltwater intrusion which is a meteoric origin similar to the moderately and very saline geothermal springs duriez et al 2008 lopez et al 2020 mao et al 2021 hence highly negative values of the slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 and the moderately saline geothermal springs sr2 and kb3 were indicated that could not possibly originate from seepage of the brackish water in these geothermal aquifers lopez et al 2020 mao et al 2021 stable isotope signatures δ18o and δ2h relative to vsmow are plotted in comparison with the global meteoric water line gmwl and local meteoric water line lmwl as shown in fig 6 the sr7 and kb3 geothermal spring waters are plotted in the vicinity of the gmwl δ18o 8 02δ18o 9 47 craig 1961 and particularly these corresponding to the lmwl lines lmwl pk δ18o 7 50δ18o 11 83 and lmwl sr δ18o 7 23δ18o 7 08 hydro informatics institute 2021 in contrast the saline geothermal springs e g sr3 kb2 and kb4 located below the gmwl are meteoric origin with mixed between saltwater e g seawater and brackish water and freshwater lopez et al 2020 mao et al 2021 therefore the very saline geothermal springs have been distinguished from rainwaters which made in the depletion of heavy isotopes due to saltwater intrusion fig 6 the sr7 and kb3 geothermal springs were located on the lmwl sr and lmwl pk indicating that geothermal spring waters have homology with rainwater in origin to some extent in addition the local groundwater is heated to geothermal groundwater by heating source in deep circulation whereas the kb2 and kb4 geothermal springs whose δ18o and δ2h values deviated from the lmwl and inclined to the higher δ18o value due to brackish water absorbed by geothermal aquifers as shown in fig 6 moreover at high temperatures of the sr3 and sr7 the δ18o enrichment might be due to the oxygen exchange in geothermal groundwater with oxygen in rock minerals resulting in a significant δ18o shifted and increased in geothermal spring water mao et al 2021 satrio et al 2020 zhou et al 2022 hence the sr7 geothermal spring the isotopic compositions decreases with the increase in precipitation elevation and the δ18o shift occurs due to high temperature geothermal field therefore heavy isotopes are gradually enriched baioumy et al 2015 mao et al 2021 morales arredondo et al 2016 from another perspective the relationship based isotope plots of δ18o versus tds and cl as shown in fig 7 were rather reliable to confirm that most of the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of southern thailand exhibited evidence of the existence of saltwater in local groundwater systems duriez et al 2008 mao et al 2021 except for sr7 the isotopic compositions are not influenced by brackish water intrusion consequently the hot water samples from the very saline geothermal spring sr3 kb2 and kb4 represent a slightly enriched stable isotope signature compared to the slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 and the moderately saline geothermal spring sr2 and kb3 fig 7 as reflected by the greater contamination of saltwater in those shallow geothermal aquifers mao et al 2021 even the trend of the moderately saline geothermal spring of kb3 tds content 3448 mg l is shifted toward the gmwl as shown in fig 6 the sr7 site from the slightly saline geothermal spring tds content 1828 mg l is located within the meteoric water line confirming the weak influence of seawater brackish water in this geothermal system moreover the isotopic signatures δ18o and δ2h of the sr7 and kb3 sites indicate that they are mainly recharged by rainfall whereas the sr2 sr3 kb2 and kb4 sites are recharged by brackish water a distinction of the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 was found to be a blend of different sources with a major contribution from saltwater therefore key points of the stable isotope analysis in the six saline geothermal springs along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea in southern thailand are mainly of natural origin with the major contribution through saltwater intrusion e g the sr3 kb2 and kb4 sites and the partial input from ion exchange in the shallow geothermal reservoir sr7 site outstanding interpretation of the stable isotope is acceptable to identify the origin of salinity in the geothermal groundwaters which could be either brackish water seawater or dissolved mineral elements 4 1 3 chemical geothermometers the na k mg triangle diagram as shown in fig 8 has been used to consider the equilibrium states of the six saline hot spring waters in southern thailand which allows for assessing the suitability of various cation exchange geothermometers a primary result was that most of the saline geothermal springs failed to reach immature waters except that the sr2 spring was partially equilibrated waters fig 8 it could be inferred that during the ascent of geothermal springs mixing with infiltrating local groundwater freshwater saltwater interactions mostly dominate the formation of saline geothermal systems baioumy et al 2015 blasco et al 2017 chenaker et al 2018 additionally the groundwater properties displaying a mixing process of non geothermal groundwater are almost uniformly agreeable with the chemical properties of saltwater except for sr7 which is not yet clear as shown in fig 8 moreover the geochemical characteristics of the six saline hot spring waters in southern thailand are distinct from those of non saline groundwater which shows that the saline geothermal waters are recharged by highly saline waters therefore based on data the saline geothermal springs along the coastlands in southern thailand are not in fully equilibrated state representing challenges in selecting suitable geothermometers in conditions of infiltrating saline groundwater concentrations of major cations e g na k ca2 and mg2 will increase linearly due to mixing with the infiltrating local groundwater without evident reforms caused by further water mineral reactions therefore different geothermometers comprising silica quartz and chalcedony and cations e g nak kmg and na k ca have been used to estimate subsurface temperatures of saline geothermal springs in southern thailand as shown in table 4 first the sio2 concentrations of geothermal groundwater has been used for estimating subsurface temperatures eq 1 to 2 the more concentrated the hot spring water is in silica the higher the subsurface temperature surat thani geothermal springs sr2 sr3 and sr7 exhibit higher sio2 contents than krabi geothermal springs kb2 kb3 and kb4 as affirmed by a linear correlation shown in fig 8 therefore the subsurface temperatures of the saline geothermal springs calculated by the silica geothermometers are represented by different silica phases consisting of quartz geothermometer results ranging from 77 to 115 c and chalcedony geothermometer yields ranging between 44 c and 87 c as shown in table 4 the maximum and minimum subsurface temperatures of the silica geothermometers are represented in the kb7 and kb3 geothermal springs respectively the second method to estimate the subsurface temperatures is indicated by different cation geothermometers e g na k mg and nak geothermometers as represented by eq 2 to 7 a calculation as represented in table 4 shows that some cation geothermometers deviate largely from the silica quartz temperatures eq 1 77 to 115 c such as the nak geothermometer eq 5 106 to 372 c and na k ca geothermometer eq 7 27 to 144 c the silica quartz and kmg geothermometers showed that the subsurface temperatures in the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 have similar patterns that might be underestimate temperature for these geothermal systems as expected a relatively small difference was observed between the silica quartz and nak geothermometer estimates for the sr2 eq 1 93 c and eq 5 108 c and the sr3 eq 1 109 c and eq 5 106 c because the chemical characteristics of geothermal groundwater have similar contents mao et al 2022 li et al 2020 remarkably the nak geothermometer was controlled by the dissolution equilibrium between albite and k feldspar minerals mao et al 2022 nitschke et al 2018 li et al 2020 therefore for geothermal groundwater with high so4 2 and ca2 concentrations the nak geothermometer is not suitable giggenbach 1988 swanberg 1974 the na k ca geothermometer eq 7 indicates higher exit temperatures in most saline geothermal springs except the sr7 site grouped in the slightly saline geothermal spring which represents a negative subsurface temperature the subsurface temperatures of the na k mg geothermometer eq 3 range also in negative territory interestingly for the moderately to very saline groundwater with relatively low ca2 contents their subsurface temperatures computed by the na k ca geothermometer also exhibited apparent deviations from the quartz silica temperatures therefore it is difficult to consider a constant subsurface temperature with the na k ca geothermometer in the event of relatively high na contents in groundwater therefore the subsurface temperatures of the saline geothermal groundwater systems estimated by the na k ca geothermometer could infer a poor performance in which the geothermal fluids cannot reach the nak equilibrium stage significantly the na k ca mg geothermometer eq 4 results deviate from those of the silica quartz geothermometer eq 1 due to relatively high na and ca2 concentrations which may include the influence of the mixing process between geothermal groundwater and local groundwater it seems difficult to reach a fully equilibrated water status for this reason the na k ca mg geothermometer is suitable for estimating the subsurface temperatures for saline geothermal springs in southern thailand 4 1 4 subsurface temperature based on the subsurface temperatures estimated by the chemical geothermometers of the six saline geothermal springs in southern thailand it is suggested that the geothermal systems were inferred to be low temperature reservoirs of approximately 86 to 169 c for the na k ca mg geothermometer table 4 and fig 9 ordinarily the geothermal groundwater ascends along pathways with different geological structures it has mixed with infiltrating local groundwater and the scale of dilution is speculated to be the exit temperature of geothermal springs blasco et al 2017 chenaker et al 2018 li et al 2020 a reliable estimation of subsurface temperatures calculated by geothermometers must be higher than the measured exit temperatures of geothermal sites baioumy et al 2015 blasco et al 2017 li et al 2020 it could possibly represent a geothermal subsurface temperature of the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand although geothermal fluids of the saline geothermal groundwater have originated from unknown sources a typical characteristic of local hot groundwater is represented by a relatively shallow catchment dürrast and ngansom 2022 ngansom and dürrast 2021 ngansom et al 2020 significantly the na k ion exchange reaction between albite and k feldspar failed to reach equilibrium fig 7 because the local groundwater sample points deviated from the na k mg equilibrium line to varying degrees giggenbach 1988 kolesar and degraff 1977 nitschke et al 2018 moreover the geochemical properties of the saline geothermal springs could be confirmed to have infiltrated local groundwater e g seawater and brackish water during the ascending process resulting in the varying geochemical compositions of the saline geothermal groundwater table 1 and fig 4 especially for the very saline geothermal springs tds content 11 000 mg l it is still difficult to achieve an accurate estimation of subsurface temperature as shown in figs 8 and 9 hence the inability to select a suitable application for geothermometers resulted in the prediction of subsurface temperatures deviating considerably from a suitable temperature according to the slightly saline geothermal spring of the sr7 site both silica chalcedony and some cation geothermometers e g na k mg nak and na k ca did not provide a valid subsurface temperature except the silica quartz 115 c and the na k ca mg 86 c geothermometers may suitable for this geothermal system fig 9 in contrast for the moderately saline geothermal springs sr2 and kb3 only the na k ca mg geothermometers can reflect subsurface temperatures while other geothermometers e g silica chalcedony kmg and na k ca geothermometers are unable to represent a suitable subsurface temperature fig 9 remarkably the subsurface temperature deviations observed when the nak geothermometer is applied to saline geothermal groundwater are attributed to the non attendance of equilibrium between albite and potassium feldspar minerals in the saline geothermal reservoir this observation suggests that higher na concentrations in the geothermal groundwater of the moderately saline geothermal springs may have originated from infiltrating local groundwater through geological pathways blasco et al 2017 chenaker et al 2018 li et al 2020 for this reason the nak geothermometer might seem like a subsurface temperature that was controlled by saltwater rather than mineral groundwater chemical equilibrium hence the nak geothermometer estimated subsurface temperatures are unsuitable for the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand as shown in fig 9 although the heat sources for the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand are unknown all of them are related to non volcanic geological settings ngansom and duerrast 2019 ngansom et al 2020 the only possible heat source is emphasized on radioactive decay of long lived isotopes e g u 238 u 235 and th 232 radon under ambient conditions of the high pressure and temperature in porous reservoir rocks is higher groundwater solubility davidson et al 2016 ngansom et al 2022 tsunomori et al 2017 its behavior is basically determined by the physical processes and not by the geochemical interactions therefore reservoir temperature levels could be related to the radon concentration in geothermal groundwater as shown in fig 9 the reservoir temperatures of the very saline geothermal springs computed by the na k ca mg geothermometer represent an average reservoir temperature of approximately 163 c which is appropriate to geological characterizations in these geothermal systems in contrast the radon concentrations in the geothermal groundwater are widely different comprising of the highest level in sr3 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 kb4 123 60 0 22 kbq m3 and kb2 101 06 0 29 kbq m3 as shown in fig 9 and table 5 exceptionally the highest radon level of the sr3 apart from radiogenic sources at the deep structure of reservoir rocks is also dependent on available natural radionuclides in depositional environments along the coastland of the gulf of thailand hence the reservoir temperature differences of any saline geothermal spring system in southern thailand seem to depend on the properties of reservoir rocks rather than radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater fig 9 because a fractures and fault structure related to geothermal springs provide an easy pathway for to release of radioactive gas to the atmosphere duque et al 2019 ngansom et al 2022 tsunomori et al 2018 although a direct relationship between reservoir temperatures and radon concentrations in the saline geothermal groundwater was not clear the radon spreads are mostly controlled by convection flow in high temperature zone of geothermal fields 4 2 natural radioactivity in saline geothermal groundwater system 4 2 1 naturally occurring background radiation a field observed background radiation level of the saline geothermal spring fields along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea from direct measurement of the radiation in the environment was reported in table 5 high levels of natural background radiation can be considered as an indicator radon concentrations with fast upward flow through rock discontinuities davidson et al 2016 tsunomori et al 2018 notably the process of transporting the natural radioactive gas may be linked to high natural background radiation of the saline geothermal field according to direct measurements of the background radiation in the saline geothermal spring fields the highest dose at the sr3 site surat thani province southern thailand s east coast and the lowest dose at the kb3 site krabi province southern thailand s west coast followed by the outlet hot spring ranged from 0 08 0 01 μsv h to 27 84 1 06 μsv h at 1 m from the outlet between 0 07 0 01 μsv h and 25 53 1 38 μsv h and at 3 m from the outlet hot spring approximately 0 05 0 02 μsv h and 5 70 0 98 μsv h respectively as shown in table 5 the background radiation level has increased considerably in the sr3 site related to granitic mountains that are found in the west releasing weathered minerals containing radioactive elements via river systems into the ban don bay in this case the high natural background radiation might be associate with natural radioactive gases that might be related to reservoir rocks and unconsolidated marine sediments the kmf fault zone might encourage vertical natural radioactive gas diffuses to interact with deeper geological formations these results might imply that the high natural background radiation is a yield of decay of uranium present in geothermal reservoir rocks as granite based sediments form part of the geothermal aquifers in addition the kb4 site which is located along the shoreline of the andaman sea and has slightly higher radiation in the environment than other saline geothermal springs in this zone approximately 1 52 0 18 μsv h the natural radioactive gas emanation increase correlates with increased tds content uranium is more soluble in carbonate groundwater furthermore the integration of several geological factors particularly minor faults and small fractures the detection of natural background radiations the kb4 site filled with marine sediments of weathered sandstone outcrops and geochemical reactions occurring in the geothermal aquifers contribute to the high concentrations of radon on the other hand the presence of a high natural background radiation might in the saline geothermal spring areas confirm to existence of local faults in the study sites the contributions from terrestrial radiation that appeared may be ascribed mainly to the contribution of radon activity as the daughter radionuclide of the uranium series which are not constant and depend on the local geological setting chao et al 2020 ghaffari et al 2020 interestingly heat sources of geothermal springs in southern thailand may associate with radioactive decay of certain minerals exhibit in reservoir rocks for instance granite intrusions may contain uranium minerals 4 2 2 radon concentration radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater measured in the six saline geothermal spring areas along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and the andaman sea are comprising of the very saline geothermal springs sr3 kb2 and kb4 the moderately saline geothermal springs sr2 and kb3 the slightly saline geothermal spring sr7 and one brackish water from the chaiya estuary canals as reported in table 5 the very saline springs represent radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater which range from 101 06 0 29 kbq m3 at the kb2 site to 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 at the sr3 site with an overall average value of 2910 71 0 52 kbq m3 for this group as shown in table 5 both the moderately and slightly saline geothermal springs display radon activity in geothermal groundwater which ranges from 18 64 0 96 kbq m3 at the kb3 site to 40 65 2 11 kbq m3 at the sr2 site with an overall average of 31 37 0 89 kbq m3 table 5 in contrast for brackish water at a distance from the sr3 site 15 km indicates radon in saline water of approximately 0 71 0 02 kbq m3 the highest radon concentration in the saline geothermal groundwater were found at the sr3 site at approximately 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 at a distance from the shoreline of the chaiya estuary of approximately 2 km tds content 11 856 mg l the very saline geothermal spring the lowest radon concentration in geothermal groundwater was found at the kb3 site at approximately 18 64 0 96 kbq m3 at a distance from the krabi estuary of approximately 10 km tds content 3448 mg l the moderately saline geothermal spring notably the rad7 device displayed a large gap between the lowest kb3 18 64 0 96 kbq m3 and highest sr3 8507 48 1 06 kbq m3 radon activity in geothermal groundwater for each saline geothermal spring in southern thailand based on geochemical studies of saline geothermal springs the results showed that the salinity tds contents table 1 and fig 4 decreases with the distance from the estuary and ranges between 18 070 mg l at kb4 0 5 km from the krabi estuary and 1828 mg l at sr7 25 km from the surat thani estuary the relationship between the radon concentrations in the saline geothermal groundwater and the major ions of na mg2 k ca2 and cl contents displays no significant correlation as shown in fig 10 this suggests that the activities of measured radon concentrations do not depend on their geochemical properties but on the geological environment and material of their coastal sediments abadi et al 2016 duque et al 2019 krishan et al 2015 telahigue et al 2018 another analysis of the saline geothermal springs in surat thani province sr2 sr3 and sr7 has showed high radon levels however it is not yet clear whether the geochemical properties and the distances between the seashore and geothermal field table 1 are relevant to the levels of radon in these saline geothermal springs fig 10 the sr7 site is located approximately 25 km from the coastlines of the gulf of thailand and is also known for its low tds content 1828 mg l however most of the saline geothermal areas especially the sr3 site are highly influenced by tide dominated coasts that are covered with muddy sediments transported by tidal currents therefore the local geological setting is considered the most significant variable for explaining the high radon concentration in the saline geothermal groundwater in southern thailand because geothermal fluid passes through many layered rocks sediments e g igneous rock limestone and clay sediment that are highly concentrated with radon activity radon can be detected in geothermal groundwater reddy et al 2006 telahigue et al 2018 this can be explained by the fact that in geological environments such as coastal sediments where brackish water comes in contact with local groundwater it can absorb radon from clayey coastal sediments exhibit in geothermal aquifers and mix with freshwater making them more radioactive duque et al 2019 krishan et al 2015 stieglitz et al 2013 telahigue et al 2018 in particular saltwater intrusion into geothermal systems confirmed by geochemical analyses may cause the enhancement of radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater by contamination with radioactive materials introduced in the geological environment e g sandy sediments and muddy intertidal flats it is also considered that the impacts of shallow geothermal reservoirs might cause uranium contamination for instance the kb4 and sr3 sites have controlled groundwater quality by saltmarsh and intertidal flats that are filled with sandy and muddy sediments deposited hence levels of radon concentration in geothermal aquifers may depend on contamination from clayey sediment that represents atmospheric radon and makes groundwater more radioactive duque et al 2019 stieglitz et al 2013 telahigue et al 2018 furthermore it is also possible that radon concentrations in geothermal groundwater might have received discharges from weathering of silicic igneous rocks uranium deposits at depth abadi et al 2016 telahigue et al 2018 tsunomori et al 2017 ordinarily natural hot springs associated with granitic rocks usually have much higher radon activity in geothermal groundwater than sedimentary metamorphic rocks because granites may contain veins of naturally occurring radioactive elements and can generally be detected in geothermal groundwater abadi et al 2016 krishan et al 2015 shu aibu et al 2021 stieglitz et al 2013 hence the concentration of radon in the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand may also be associated with uranium derived from the weathering process of granitic rocks in geothermal reservoirs at depth high radon concentrations are also found near the faults especially along the klong marui fault of the surat thani geothermal province e g sr2 and sr3 table 5 hence the radon concentrations in the geothermal groundwater of saline geothermal fields in southern thailand are found to be highly variable in accordance with the geological environment and rock type of the regional geological setting 5 conclusions the hydrogeochemical analysis and natural radioactivity in the six saline geothermal springs surat thani geothermal spring sr2 sr3 and sr7 and krabi geothermal spring kb2 kb3 and kb4 along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea in southern thailand were investigated the physical and chemical properties of saline geothermal waters were different depending on their geological environment and location based on the tds values of the saline geothermal springs they can be classified into three categories a slightly saline geothermal spring in sr7 b moderately saline geothermal spring in sr2 and kb3 and c very saline geothermal spring in sr3 kb2 and kb4 the quantitative analysis of anions and cations represents decreasing trends with distance from coastlines the stable isotopes δ18o and δ2h indicate that the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand are mixed between saltwater and freshwater and originate from precipitation derived waters significantly the sr3 kb2 and kb4 which are grouped in the very saline geothermal springs are the most enriched with the highest values of approximately 3 0 for δ18o and reach 20 18 for δ2h in kb2 except for the sr7 of the slightly saline geothermal spring located on southern thailand s east coast which is still unconfirmed to be contaminated by saltwater intrusion it was probably mixed with saltwater before being heated and not affected by saline water intrusion again afterwards the other geothermal spring waters e g sr3 and kb4 are most likely to be mixed with saltwater both before and after being heated in the geothermal reservoir according to the geothermometers silica and cation the sr3 and sr7 sites along the seashore of the gulf of thailand have the highest reservoir temperatures refer to the na k ca mg geothermometer ranging from 86 to 169 c on the other hand the silica chalcedony and some cation geothermometers e g na k mg nak and kmg were unreliable due to saltwater intrusion representing the lack of a water mineral equilibrium state of geothermal fluids the spatial variation in radon concentrations in the saline geothermal groundwater along the coastlands of the gulf of thailand and andaman sea is controlled by the local geological environments radon enrichment in the geothermal groundwater systems along southern thailand s east coast e g sr2 and sr3 is mainly controlled by quaternary sediments originated from weathered granitic rocks inland and adjacent coastal areas in addition the brackish water inflow may transport weathering products of granitic rocks from the northeast and southeast of the sr3 site and the koh samui and koh phangan islands were deposited on the coastlands of the gulf of thailand intruded seawater brackish water has desorbed natural radionuclides e g ra 226 and u 238 from clayey sediments and hence the emanation of radon and the enhancement of its concentration in geothermal groundwater for instance the observed radon concentration in the kb4 site southern thailand s west coast may be associated with muddy coastal sediments derived from the mangrove forest moreover it might also be noted that the high radon concentration in southern thailand may be related to major fault zones of the kmf and rf since the hot spring waters are flowing through rocks sediments highly concentrated with natural radionuclides the local faults provided support in the distribution of the radon from the geothermal aquifer in a vertical direction regarding natural radionuclides in the saline geothermal springs in southern thailand it was suggested that the radon concentrations in the geothermal groundwater were highly influenced by the local geological environment and coastal sediments results of this study will extend the understanding of the hydrogeological processes and radon concentrations in the saline

1233,to investigate the effect of ph on bioclogging process during managed aquifer recharge three laboratory scale column experiments were conducted and the relative hydraulic conductivity bacterial cell number and the concentrations of polysaccharide protein and eps were measured under ph 5 7 and 9 respectively high throughput sequencing was also used to determine the characteristics of bacterial community under different ph conditions the development of bioclogging was rather different for the case of ph 5 7 and 9 i e the growth process and number of bacteria differed with ph the shortest growth period and lowest number of bacteria were observed at ph 5 in addition the difference in bacterial eps concentration was mainly associated with the polysaccharides the variation in ph led to different bacterial community composition and diversity the acid resistant elizabethkingia and bacillus were abundant at ph 5 while chryseobacterium and klebsiella had relatively high abundances at ph 7 in contrast the basophilic exiguobacterium accounted for 80 of the total bacterial abundance at ph 9 this work is of great significance to explore bioclogging mechanism during mar process and provides insights and guidances for field based managed aquifer recharge keywords mar bioclogging ph eps hydraulic conductivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive groundwater extraction leads to serious environmental problems such as saltwater intrusion surface collapse and soil salinization to address these problems managed aquifer recharge mar is applied worldwide to improve the quality of contaminated groundwater resources however well or aquifer clogging is one of the major difficulties restricting the application of mar practices to date a large number of studies have found that physical chemical and biological factors contribute to aquifer clogging eom et al 2020 perujo et al 2019 xia et al 2014 2018 under proper nutritional conditions algae fungi bacteria and other microorganisms present in recharge waters could multiply in large numbers these microorganisms along with their metabolites can easily occupy in the pore channels and pore throats of the porous media thereby significantly reducing aquifer permeability through bioclogging cui et al 2021 jeong et al 2018 kirk et al 2012 vandevivere and baveye 1992 a series of researches have been proposed regarding the mechanisms of aquifer bioclogging initially some researchers believe that the accumulation of bacterial cells can reduce the permeability of porous media and a relationship has been established between the permeability of a porous medium and the number of bacteria vandevivere and baveye 1992 suleiman and swartzendruber 2003 reported that when the volume of bacterial cells was 3 of the total volume of porous media the aquifer permeability decreased sharply they also found that extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by bacteria played an important role during the bioclogging process in addition it was proved that high viscous porous and colloidal structures flemming and wingender 2010 in bacterial eps could increase the viscosity of recharge water and the motion resistance of the fluid thus reducing the permeability of porous media maugeri et al 2003 donlan 2002 also found that the substances inducing bioclogging were mainly bacteria and bacterial eps with eps accounting for 90 of the dry mass xia et al 2016 further confirmed that bacterial eps could be divided into two types tightly bound eps tb eps and loosely bound eps lb eps they found that lb eps led to a larger reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of sand columns in comparison to tb eps scholars also focused on the influence of environmental factors such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen and the carbon concentration xia et al 2016 on aquifer clogging the recharge system in most regions is strongly relevant to the local water source conditions and the ph of the recharge water in different regions always vary furthermore walshe et al 2010 found that ph is an important factor controlling the biochemical environment and affecting biological activities of recharge water different microbial species normally thrive under different ph ranges respectively reflecting their ability to adapt to a given environment dupin and mccarty 2000 constructed a micro network model of bioclogging in porous media and delineated that the morphology of the microbial community in porous media was directly related to ph they reported that at ph 3 the microbial community structure was filamentous while it was presented as a polymer substance and biofilm under neutral conditions li et al 2017 discovered that compared with acidic conditions ph 7 bacteria had a stronger migration ability in a porous medium of quartz sand under neutral condition ph 7 they also found that the electrostatic repulsion forces between the cells and porous medium increased at ph 7 thus promoting the migration of bacteria in the sand column however this work did not consider the effects of alkaline conditions ph 7 kim et al 2009 found that a decrease in ph reduced the zeta potential of quartz sand resulting in a decrease of the energy barrier and an increase of the depth of the secondary minima thereby promoting the deposition of bacteria overall ph has an critical effect on the retention and transport of bacteria in porous media and consequently bioclogging however comprehensive and quantitatively studies are currently lacking although researchers have explored the changes of the dominant populations of microbes in porous medium under different ph conditions the evolution characteristics of the microbial community structure at different ph conditions remain unclear as a dynamic process of bioclogging the quantitative relationship between eps content and aquifer clogging at different percolation stages has not yet been clarified therefore the objectives of this work are to 1 investigate the influence of ph on bioclogging process 2 determine the variations in bacterial cell number eps secretion i e polysaccharides and protein and the bacterial community features and 3 establish the quantitative relationships between bacteria cell number polysaccharides proteins and hydraulic conductivity of porous medium during managed aquifer recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media used in sandpack experiments standard quartz sand d60 0 5 mm guangzhou vigor health equipment inc guangzhou china was used to represent porous media and pretreated before being packed in the column kögler et al 2021 the sand was soaked in hcl solution 0 25 m for 12 h to remove metal impurities and then naoh solution 0 25 m for 12 h the sand was subsequently washed using milli q water until the ph reached 7 and then incinerated in a muffle furnace sx2 5 12 supo instrument co ltd shaoxing china at 550 c for 2 h to remove organic matter the pretreated sand was wet packed in the columns in equal increment approximately 2 cm 2 2 bacterial inoculum and artificial recharge water in this study sampled river water was taken from dagu river 36 38024 n 120 12089 e qingdao city china and used as bacterial inoculum to simulate field mar process the ph of the river water changed seasonally and the maximum ph was measure to be 8 45 chen 2014 therefore we set the upper limit of the ph to be 9 meanwhile tu et al 2022 clarified that the recharge process in the mekong delta is critical for the delta s groundwater resources in the seven groundwater sites the ph even falls below 5 50 thus we take the ph range of 5 to 9 in this work immediately after collection water sample was transported on ice to laboratory and then pre cultured in lb liquid medium peptone 1 g l beef extract 0 5 g l and nacl 0 5 g l the ph of the lb liquid medium was adjusted to 7 with naoh solution 5 mol l for the inoculation eight pore volumes of the lb liquid medium was pumped falling down the sand packed columns then the inlet and outlet valves were closed and the columns were completely saturated for 12 h to ensure bacteria attachment a synthetic nutrient solution was used as artificial recharge water to stimulate bacterial growth during the percolation experiments the solution included glucose 50 mg l nh4cl 5 73 mg l and k2hpo4 2 81 mg l as sole bio available carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources it also contained nacl 5000 mg l mgso4 7h2o 45 mg l cacl2 2h2o 20 mg l and trace elements 1 ml the trace elements consisted feso4 7h2o 2 mg l cuso4 5h2o 0 4 mg l mnso4 6h2o 0 04 mg l na2moo4 2h2o 0 04 mg l and h3b 2 mg l xia et al 2014 the ph of nutrient solution were adjusted to 5 7 and 9 with 1 mol l of naoh and hcl solution respectively before used the nutrient solution was sterilized at 121 c for 15 min and then oxygenated by stirring 2 3 experimental setup the percolation experimental device included recharge water tank peristaltic pump percolation column water head control device and manometer board the column was made of plexiglass with a height of 26 cm and an internal diameter of 5 cm on one side six pressure measuring pipes were connected to the manometer board and on the other side six sampling ports were installed at the same heights for water sampling fig 1 during the percolation experiments artificial recharge water was pumped via the peristaltic pump and flowed vertically from the top to the bottom of the percolation column 2 4 hydraulic conductivity during the percolation experiments the artificial recharge water with different ph was infiltrated vertically from top to bottom of the inoculated columns and then discharged via the outlet valves the hydraulic conductivity k was calculated using darcy s law 1 k 4 q x π d 2 h in this equation k represents the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s q refers to the effluent flow rate ml s δx is the distance between two manometric tubes along the column cm δh is the difference in water head at the distance δx cm and d is the inner diameter of the sand column cm the influence of bioclogging process on the fluid viscosity is neglected thus hydraulic conductivity was considered to be sufficient to represent the variation of properties of porous medium xia et al 2014 wang et al 2020 to normalize clogging degree of the percolation columns relative hydraulic conductivity k was used 2 k k k 0 where k 0 is the initial hydraulic conductivity cm s and k is the hydraulic conductivity at certain time cm s 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 bacterial cell

with 2 ml of naoh 1 mol l to further stir for 3 h after that the mixture was centrifuged at 12000g for 15 min and then filtered with 0 45 and 0 22 μm pes membranes merck millipore ltd germany respectively the filtrate was dialysis at 4 c for 24 h and treated as eps extraction after the above steps protein and polysaccharide were measured using the bradford assay method sharma and babitch 1980 and the phenol sulfuric acid method bo et al 1996 respectively the sum of protein and polysaccharide were considered as eps content and expressed as μg per gram of sand 2 5 3 sampling and extraction of bacterial total dna after the percolation experiments bacterial samples were collected from the sand in the first layers of the columns in brief 0 5 g of sand was sampled with a

3 4 1 the figures were plotted using origin 9 0 origin lab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of bioclogging during managed aquifer recharge bioclogging often occurs in surface layer of porous media during mar process therefore in this study the relative hydraulic conductivity k in the surface layer of the sand columns i e 0 3 cm was used to measure temporal variations in the hydraulic conductivity of the sand columns during the percolation experiments fig 2 shows that k values of the sand columns decreased under different ph conditions implying that clogging occurred during the percolation experiments at the early stage k values changed slightly under ph 5 7 and 9 respectively at the second stage rapid clogging happens with large reductions in k values at the second stage in the end k values leveled out indicating that complete clogging happened although completely clogged significant differences could be observed in the clogging processes under ph 5 7 and 9 as shown in fig 2 at ph 5 the k value of the sand column slowly decreased from 1 to 0 919 within the first 6 h subsequently the k value rapidly decreased from 0 919 to 0 235 with a large reduction of 68 4 at ph 7 the k value exhibited a gradually decreasing trend from 1 to 0 911 within the first 8 h which was very similar with that of the sand column at ph 5 later the k value further reduced from 0 911 to 0 227 during the next 8 h with a reduction of 68 4 compared to the cases of ph 5 and 7 the k value leveled out in the first 14 h under the ph of 9 and then the k value decreased sharply from 0 973 to 0 240 with a large reduction of 73 3 the results showed that during the percolation experiments rapid bioclogging occurred under the acid environment i e ph 5 while relatively longer time was required for clogging under the alkaline condition i e ph 9 that is the ph of recharge water has vital effect on the bioclogging process during mar 3 2 bacterial growth and eps secretion during managed aquifer recharge 3 2 1 variations in bacterial cell number temporal variations in bacterial cell number in the first layer i e the inlet to 3 cm of the sand columns were presented in fig 3 during the percolation experiments bacterial cell number presented a similar trend under different ph i e slow sharp steady growth at ph 5 bacteria began to grow rapidly from 8 h and entered a stable growth period after 16 h until the cell number peaking at 1 86 107 cells g of sand at ph 7 bacteria began to grow rapidly after 10 h and reached a stable growth period after 16 h with a peak cell number of 2 11 107 cells g of sand compared to ph 5 and 7 for the case of ph 9 bacteria increased rapidly from 16 to 25 h before coming to a stable growth period when the peak cell number increased to 1 97 107 cells g the slow growth period of bacteria was the shortest at ph 5 which also corresponded to the lowest final cell number compared with the percolation experiments under ph 7 and 9 the result suggested that the acidic condition i e ph 5 affected enzyme activity and prevented bacterial growth and metabolism the reason was that some types of bacteria could not grow regularly and even died thereby reducing the internal competition of the population this result was consistent with previous researches nan et al 2013 wu et al 2011 neutral condition i e ph 7 provided the most suitable environment for the majority of bacteria in recharge water under the neutral environment most bacteria have a relatively high biological activity and can grow and reproduce normally hence bacterial cell number was the highest at ph 7 in this study 3 2 2 eps secretion the changes in bacterial eps content i e polysaccharides and proteins under different ph conditions were shown in fig 4 as the percolation experiments processed the concentration of bacterial eps first increased and then gradually decreased under ph 5 7 and 9 respectively the concentration of eps underwent three stages i e slow rapid steady stages in the first stage of percolation experiments bacteria adapted to the new environment gradually and their low metabolic activity resulted in slow secretion of eps however during the second stage bacterial growth and reproduction rates accelerated and their enhanced metabolic capacity caused large production of eps after that the bacteria entered endogenous respiration stage which indicated that bacteria began to degrade the secreted eps to resist adverse external conditions this was the reason that the concentration of eps decreased in the third stage of percolation experiments some obvious differences of the eps concentration could be found under different ph conditions fig 4a the highest eps was produced under ph 5 and it was 1 46 and 2 39 times higher than those under ph 7 and 9 respectively this implied that the acidic environment might hinder bacterial growth and metabolism in order to resist harsh condition bacteria tended to secrete more eps to protect themselves neutral condition i e ph 7 was optimal for most of bacteria during the percolation experiments leading to higher biological and metabolic activities compared to alkaline environment i e ph 9 these findings were consistent with wang et al 2011 who demonstrated that the apparent weight average molar mass of eps under acidic conditions was substantially higher than that under neutral and alkaline solutions freitas et al 2009 also found that the viscosity of eps produced by pseudomonas oleovorans was higher for acidic conditions than that of alkaline conditions fig 4b showed that the protein concentration under ph 5 was 1 18 and 1 41 times higher than those at ph 7 and 9 respectively however compared to the cases of ph 7 and 9 the concentration of polysaccharide was 1 49 and 2 44 times higher under ph 5 fig 4c this implied that the ph of recharge water had a significant influence on the concentration of bacterial polysaccharide combined with fig 4a the difference in bacterial eps concentration due to different ph was mainly induced by the change in polysaccharide this was consistent with the results of li et al 2013 who found a large number of glycan bacteria under acidic condition during long term operation of biological phosphorus removal systems 3 3 bioclogging mechanism during managed aquifer recharge figure 5 presents the relationships between the k value of each sand column under different ph i e ph 5 7 and 9 the bacterial cell number and the polysaccharide and protein concentrations in this work bioclogging process could be divided into three stages in the first stage the k values decreased from 1 0 to 0 8 under different ph meanwhile the bacterial cell number the polysaccharide and protein concentrations were negatively correlated with the k value in this stage for this stage the bacterial cell number changed considerably while the protein concentration hardly increased the concentration of polysaccharide varied significantly at ph 5 but changed slightly at ph 7 and 9 respectively therefore in the early stage of the percolation experiments the decreasing k of the sand columns at ph 5 mainly depended on the increased bacterial cell number and polysaccharide at ph 7 the decrease of k was mainly caused by the increment of bacterial cell number while the polysaccharide content had little influence at ph 9 the decrease of k only related to the increased bacterial cell number meanwhile under the condition of ph 5 and ph 7 the zeta potation of bacteria has a minor difference which made the difference of electrostatic repulsion between cell and quartz sand was minor therefore the reduction of k is more or less similar with ph of 5 and 7 at ph 9 the negative charge of cell surface increased obviously which made electrostatic repulsion between cell and quartz sand significant thus the microorganisms need to overcome greater energy barriers to reach quartz sand at ph 9 bacterial cell was easy to migrate out of the sand than getting adsorbed onto the sand surface which led to a less reduction of k compared with ph of 5 and ph of 7 the second stage included the logarithmic phase of bacterial growth and during this stage the k value of the sand columns rapidly decreased from 0 8 to 0 2 as the bacterial growth rate accelerated metabolism was also vigorous hence the bacterial cell number the protein and polysaccharide concentrations under different ph conditions rapidly increased while the decreased hydraulic conductivity of the porous media was the result of the interaction between bacteria and eps in the third stage the k value of the sand columns decreased from 0 2 to 0 1 under different ph conditions the bacterial cell number still increased slowly but the protein and polysaccharide concentrations exhibited a declining trend therefore the increase regarding the number of bacteria in this period was proved to be the key factor inducing the decreased permeability of the porous medium in this work bacterial growth and the secreted eps i e proteins and polysaccharides had different effects on bioclogging considering the ph differences of recharge water during the percolation experiments although serious bioclogging occurred in all sand columns under different ph conditions some distinction could be found in the bioclogging process at ph 5 and 7 bacterial growth and polysaccharide secretion induced bioclogging whereas bacteria were the only contributors to the clogging process at ph 9 3 4 bacterial community composition and structure during managed aquifer recharge during the percolation experiments high throughput sequencing technology was used to study the characteristics of the bacterial community composition and structure under different ph conditions as shown in fig 6a on the phylum level firmicutes was the most predominant phylum with a relative abundance 51 24 for all the samples followed by proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria the percentage of other phyla were all 1 although present in all samples some clear distinctions in the bacterial community composition occurred under different ph conditions at ph 5 the top four dominant phyla in the bacteria community i e sample 5 8 were bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria with relative abundances of 44 45 35 55 19 08 and 0 88 respectively at ph 7 firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria dominated the bacterial community i e sample 7 8 with relative abundances of 64 28 5 and 1 respectively at ph 9 the dominant phyla were firmicutes 89 48 proteobacteria 9 27 bacteroidetes 0 95 and actinobacteria 0 23 in the bacteria community i e sample 9 8 variations of the bacterial community composition also occurred during the same bioclogging process taking samples 5 8 and 5 2 as examples at the beginning of the percolation experiments bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria were the top four phyla dominated in the bacteria community i e sample 5 8 as the percolation experiments processed obvious clogging occurred and the bacteria community shifted with the relative abundances of proteobacteria and actinobacteria increasing to 45 22 and 6 05 and the relative abundance of firmicutes decreasing to 3 01 figure 6b displays the bacterial community composition at the genus level exiguobacterium elizabethkingia bacillus chryseobacterium and klebsiella were predominated in all the samples exiguobacterium is a gram positive bacterium that is basophilic acidophilic and inactive and can decompose complex organic compounds abid et al 2021 elizabethkingia belongs to the family flavobacteriaceae which is a gram negative bacterium widely present in seawater fresh water and soil lin et al 2019 elizabethkingia has poor motility and can secrete large amounts of viscous extracellular polymers bacillus is a relatively large gram positive bacterium which is highly mobile and acid resistant relman et al 1992 chryseobacterium also belongs to the family flavobacteriaceae bernardet et al 2015 it is an obligate aerobic nonmobile gram negative bacterium with no flagella and has an optimal ph of 7 klebsiella is an inactive facultative anaerobic non flagellar gram negative bacterium with an optimal ph of 7 2 tzouvelekis et al 2012 the venn analysis diagram of the species composition fig 7 reveals that the number of species varied significantly under different ph conditions there were 273 species at ph 5 indicating high abundance of the bacterial community however there were only 140 species at ph 9 this came from fierce competition among microorganisms which evidenced the dominant bacteria hence the species diversity decreased accordingly from the bacterial community composition on the genus level it can be concluded that the abundances of elizabethkingia and bacillus at ph 5 were significantly higher than those at ph 7 while these two strains did not appear at ph 9 in addition elizabethkingia could secrete a large amount of eps both the basophilic exiguobacterium and the acid tolerant elizabethkingia were able to survive under neutral conditions however the abundance of elizabethkingia was very low while the abundance of exiguobacterium was relatively high and the compositions of these bacterial species at ph 7 and 9 were rather similar in addition the abundances of chryseobacterium and klebsiella were relatively high at ph 7 therefore this is the optimal ph of both strains at ph 9 the basophilic exiguobacterium accounted for 80 of the total bacterial abundance while few species of other bacteria were present in this work ph played a critical role on bioclogging process during managed aquifer recharge under different ph conditions the k values of sand columns varied significantly and the direct process leading to bioclogging was the accumulation of cells and the adhesion of eps although bacteria occupy a relatively small volume in porous media a large number of bacteria and viscous eps can adhere together and form biofilms which can easily occupy the pore channels and pore throat positions of porous media thus reducing the hydraulic conductivity in the early stage of the percolation experiments elizabethkingia grew in large quantities at ph 5 resulting in a higher secretion of polysaccharides compared with the experiments at ph 7 and 9 at ph 5 bacteria were more likely to form bacterial micelles to stem medium pores thus bioclogging occurred relatively quickly the decreased permeability coefficient at ph 9 only depends on the increment of the number of bacteria consequently the degree of clogging developed at the slowest rate of all the experiments in the middle stage of the percolation experiments further bacterial growth and metabolism occurred resulting in increased cell numbers and eps contents the polysaccharide content was no longer the key factor restricting the development of bioclogging and the permeability of the porous medium declined sharply under all the three ph conditions the weakly acidic conditions of ph 5 were much more unfavorable to the growth and metabolism of bacteria than the neutral and weakly alkaline conditions of ph 7 and 9 respectively therefore the average declining rate of the relative hydraulic conductivity at ph 9 was also the lowest at this point the development process of bioclogging was basically identical of those at ph 5 and 7 while it was slowest at ph 9 at the end of the percolation experiments the growth of bacteria entered a stable period or even a decay period considering the number of bacteria increased relatively slowly and the eps content decreased in this stage the relative hydraulic conductivity of the sand columns declined slowly and the development process of bioclogging did not change significantly these findings indicated that ph mainly affected the beginning stage of bioclogging process during managed aquifer recharge 4 conclusions in this work three identical laboratory scale sand column experiments were carried out to investigate the variations concerning the relative hydraulic conductivity of the sand columns as well as the bacterial growth and metabolism in the porous medium under different ph conditions during the simulated mar process the relative hydraulic conductivity of the sand columns presented an inverted s type downward trend and non uniform change rules over time the ph of recharge water strongly influenced the process of bioclogging and especially played an decisive role in the early percolation stage during managed aquifer recharge the bacterial cell number of the sand columns showed a slow growth sharp growth steady growth trend under different ph conditions which corresponded to the four periods of bacterial growth however due to the influence of ph the growth process and bacterial cell number differed at ph 5 7 and 9 the slow growth period of bacteria was the shortest at ph 5 which also related to the lowest final number of bacteria as the percolation experiments processed bacterial eps secretion varied with different ph conditions the highest eps concentration was obtained at ph 5 and was 1 46 and 2 39 times higher than that at ph 7 and 9 respectively particularly ph had a considerable influence on polysaccharide the dominant bacteria in the percolation experiments were mainly exiguobacterium elizabethkingia bacillus chryseobacterium and klebsiella at ph 5 and 7 the abundance of klebsiella increased significantly at ph 9 the species and abundance of the dominant bacteria did not change significantly with the change in ph the number of species for the three ph experiments varied significantly and the microbial diversity was higher at ph 5 however at suitable ph values of 7 and 9 intense microbial competition evidenced the dominant bacterial species and led to a low species diversity acid resistant elizabethkingia and bacillus were abundant at ph 5 while chryseobacterium and klebsiella had relatively high abundances at ph 7 in contrast the basophilic exiguobacterium occupied 80 of the total bacterial abundance at ph 9 in the process of bioclogging the ph of water hardly affected the overall declining trend in hydraulic conductivity under various ph conditions the key factors inducing aquifer clogging at different stages are diverse the difference occurred mainly in the first phase of the percolation experiment the variation of the hydraulic conductivity depended on the number of bacteria and polysaccharide content under acidic and neutral conditions while it only depended on the number of bacteria under alkaline conditions credit

1233,to investigate the effect of ph on bioclogging process during managed aquifer recharge three laboratory scale column experiments were conducted and the relative hydraulic conductivity bacterial cell number and the concentrations of polysaccharide protein and eps were measured under ph 5 7 and 9 respectively high throughput sequencing was also used to determine the characteristics of bacterial community under different ph conditions the development of bioclogging was rather different for the case of ph 5 7 and 9 i e the growth process and number of bacteria differed with ph the shortest growth period and lowest number of bacteria were observed at ph 5 in addition the difference in bacterial eps concentration was mainly associated with the polysaccharides the variation in ph led to different bacterial community composition and diversity the acid resistant elizabethkingia and bacillus were abundant at ph 5 while chryseobacterium and klebsiella had relatively high abundances at ph 7 in contrast the basophilic exiguobacterium accounted for 80 of the total bacterial abundance at ph 9 this work is of great significance to explore bioclogging mechanism during mar process and provides insights and guidances for field based managed aquifer recharge keywords mar bioclogging ph eps hydraulic conductivity data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction excessive groundwater extraction leads to serious environmental problems such as saltwater intrusion surface collapse and soil salinization to address these problems managed aquifer recharge mar is applied worldwide to improve the quality of contaminated groundwater resources however well or aquifer clogging is one of the major difficulties restricting the application of mar practices to date a large number of studies have found that physical chemical and biological factors contribute to aquifer clogging eom et al 2020 perujo et al 2019 xia et al 2014 2018 under proper nutritional conditions algae fungi bacteria and other microorganisms present in recharge waters could multiply in large numbers these microorganisms along with their metabolites can easily occupy in the pore channels and pore throats of the porous media thereby significantly reducing aquifer permeability through bioclogging cui et al 2021 jeong et al 2018 kirk et al 2012 vandevivere and baveye 1992 a series of researches have been proposed regarding the mechanisms of aquifer bioclogging initially some researchers believe that the accumulation of bacterial cells can reduce the permeability of porous media and a relationship has been established between the permeability of a porous medium and the number of bacteria vandevivere and baveye 1992 suleiman and swartzendruber 2003 reported that when the volume of bacterial cells was 3 of the total volume of porous media the aquifer permeability decreased sharply they also found that extracellular polymeric substances eps produced by bacteria played an important role during the bioclogging process in addition it was proved that high viscous porous and colloidal structures flemming and wingender 2010 in bacterial eps could increase the viscosity of recharge water and the motion resistance of the fluid thus reducing the permeability of porous media maugeri et al 2003 donlan 2002 also found that the substances inducing bioclogging were mainly bacteria and bacterial eps with eps accounting for 90 of the dry mass xia et al 2016 further confirmed that bacterial eps could be divided into two types tightly bound eps tb eps and loosely bound eps lb eps they found that lb eps led to a larger reduction in the hydraulic conductivity of sand columns in comparison to tb eps scholars also focused on the influence of environmental factors such as ph temperature dissolved oxygen and the carbon concentration xia et al 2016 on aquifer clogging the recharge system in most regions is strongly relevant to the local water source conditions and the ph of the recharge water in different regions always vary furthermore walshe et al 2010 found that ph is an important factor controlling the biochemical environment and affecting biological activities of recharge water different microbial species normally thrive under different ph ranges respectively reflecting their ability to adapt to a given environment dupin and mccarty 2000 constructed a micro network model of bioclogging in porous media and delineated that the morphology of the microbial community in porous media was directly related to ph they reported that at ph 3 the microbial community structure was filamentous while it was presented as a polymer substance and biofilm under neutral conditions li et al 2017 discovered that compared with acidic conditions ph 7 bacteria had a stronger migration ability in a porous medium of quartz sand under neutral condition ph 7 they also found that the electrostatic repulsion forces between the cells and porous medium increased at ph 7 thus promoting the migration of bacteria in the sand column however this work did not consider the effects of alkaline conditions ph 7 kim et al 2009 found that a decrease in ph reduced the zeta potential of quartz sand resulting in a decrease of the energy barrier and an increase of the depth of the secondary minima thereby promoting the deposition of bacteria overall ph has an critical effect on the retention and transport of bacteria in porous media and consequently bioclogging however comprehensive and quantitatively studies are currently lacking although researchers have explored the changes of the dominant populations of microbes in porous medium under different ph conditions the evolution characteristics of the microbial community structure at different ph conditions remain unclear as a dynamic process of bioclogging the quantitative relationship between eps content and aquifer clogging at different percolation stages has not yet been clarified therefore the objectives of this work are to 1 investigate the influence of ph on bioclogging process 2 determine the variations in bacterial cell number eps secretion i e polysaccharides and protein and the bacterial community features and 3 establish the quantitative relationships between bacteria cell number polysaccharides proteins and hydraulic conductivity of porous medium during managed aquifer recharge 2 materials and methods 2 1 porous media used in sandpack experiments standard quartz sand d60 0 5 mm guangzhou vigor health equipment inc guangzhou china was used to represent porous media and pretreated before being packed in the column kögler et al 2021 the sand was soaked in hcl solution 0 25 m for 12 h to remove metal impurities and then naoh solution 0 25 m for 12 h the sand was subsequently washed using milli q water until the ph reached 7 and then incinerated in a muffle furnace sx2 5 12 supo instrument co ltd shaoxing china at 550 c for 2 h to remove organic matter the pretreated sand was wet packed in the columns in equal increment approximately 2 cm 2 2 bacterial inoculum and artificial recharge water in this study sampled river water was taken from dagu river 36 38024 n 120 12089 e qingdao city china and used as bacterial inoculum to simulate field mar process the ph of the river water changed seasonally and the maximum ph was measure to be 8 45 chen 2014 therefore we set the upper limit of the ph to be 9 meanwhile tu et al 2022 clarified that the recharge process in the mekong delta is critical for the delta s groundwater resources in the seven groundwater sites the ph even falls below 5 50 thus we take the ph range of 5 to 9 in this work immediately after collection water sample was transported on ice to laboratory and then pre cultured in lb liquid medium peptone 1 g l beef extract 0 5 g l and nacl 0 5 g l the ph of the lb liquid medium was adjusted to 7 with naoh solution 5 mol l for the inoculation eight pore volumes of the lb liquid medium was pumped falling down the sand packed columns then the inlet and outlet valves were closed and the columns were completely saturated for 12 h to ensure bacteria attachment a synthetic nutrient solution was used as artificial recharge water to stimulate bacterial growth during the percolation experiments the solution included glucose 50 mg l nh4cl 5 73 mg l and k2hpo4 2 81 mg l as sole bio available carbon nitrogen and phosphorus sources it also contained nacl 5000 mg l mgso4 7h2o 45 mg l cacl2 2h2o 20 mg l and trace elements 1 ml the trace elements consisted feso4 7h2o 2 mg l

before used the nutrient solution was sterilized at 121 c for 15 min and then oxygenated by stirring 2 3 experimental setup the percolation experimental device included recharge water tank peristaltic pump percolation column water head control device and manometer board the column was made of plexiglass with a height of 26 cm and an internal diameter of 5 cm on one side six pressure measuring pipes were connected to the manometer board and on the other side six sampling ports were installed at the same heights for water sampling fig 1 during the percolation experiments artificial recharge water was pumped via the peristaltic pump and flowed vertically from the top to the bottom of the percolation column 2 4 hydraulic conductivity during the percolation experiments the artificial recharge water with different ph was infiltrated vertically from top to bottom of the inoculated columns and then discharged via the outlet valves the hydraulic conductivity k was calculated using darcy s law 1 k 4 q x π d 2 h in this equation k represents the saturated hydraulic conductivity cm s q refers to the effluent flow rate ml s δx is the distance between two manometric tubes along the column cm δh is the difference in water head at the distance δx cm and d is the inner diameter of the sand column cm the influence of bioclogging process on the fluid viscosity is neglected thus hydraulic conductivity was considered to be sufficient to represent the variation of properties of porous medium xia et al 2014 wang et al 2020 to normalize clogging degree of the percolation columns relative hydraulic conductivity k was used 2 k k k 0 where k 0 is the initial hydraulic conductivity cm s and k is the hydraulic conductivity at certain time cm s 2 5 analytical methods 2 5 1 bacterial cell

respectively the filtrate was dialysis at 4 c for 24 h and treated as eps extraction after the above steps protein and polysaccharide were measured using the bradford assay method sharma and babitch 1980 and the phenol sulfuric acid method bo et al 1996 respectively the sum of protein and polysaccharide were considered as eps content and expressed as μg per gram of sand 2 5 3 sampling and

3 4 1 the figures were plotted using origin 9 0 origin lab corporation northampton ma usa 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulation of bioclogging during managed aquifer recharge bioclogging often occurs in surface layer of porous media during mar process therefore in this study the relative hydraulic conductivity k in the surface layer of the sand columns i e 0 3 cm was used to measure temporal variations in the hydraulic conductivity of the sand columns during the percolation experiments fig 2 shows that k values of the sand columns decreased under different ph conditions implying that clogging occurred during the percolation experiments at the early stage k values changed slightly under ph 5 7 and 9 respectively at the second stage rapid clogging happens with large reductions in k values at the second stage in the end k values leveled out indicating that complete clogging happened although completely clogged significant differences could be observed in the clogging processes under ph 5 7 and 9 as shown in fig 2 at ph 5 the k value of the sand column slowly decreased from 1 to 0 919 within the first 6 h subsequently the k value rapidly decreased from 0 919 to 0 235 with a large reduction of 68 4 at ph 7 the k value exhibited a gradually decreasing trend from 1 to 0 911 within the first 8 h which was very similar with that of the sand column at ph 5 later the k value further reduced from 0 911 to 0 227 during the next 8 h with a reduction of 68 4 compared to the cases of ph 5 and 7 the k value leveled out in the first 14 h under the ph of 9 and then the k value decreased sharply from 0 973 to 0 240 with a large reduction of 73 3 the results showed that during the percolation experiments rapid bioclogging occurred under the acid environment i e ph 5 while relatively longer time was required for clogging under the alkaline condition i e ph 9 that is the ph of recharge water has vital effect on the bioclogging process during mar 3 2 bacterial growth and eps secretion during managed aquifer recharge 3 2 1 variations in bacterial cell number temporal variations in bacterial cell number in the first layer i e the inlet to 3 cm of the sand columns were presented in fig 3 during the percolation experiments bacterial cell number presented a similar trend under different ph i e slow sharp steady growth at ph 5 bacteria began to grow rapidly from 8 h and entered a stable growth period after 16 h until the cell number peaking at 1 86 107 cells g of sand at ph 7 bacteria began to grow rapidly after 10 h and reached a stable growth period after 16 h with a peak cell number of 2 11 107 cells g of sand compared to ph 5 and 7 for the case of ph 9 bacteria increased rapidly from 16 to 25 h before coming to a stable growth period when the peak cell number increased to 1 97 107 cells g the slow growth period of bacteria was the shortest at ph 5 which also corresponded to the lowest final cell number compared with the percolation experiments under ph 7 and 9 the result suggested that the acidic condition i e ph 5 affected enzyme activity and prevented bacterial growth and metabolism the reason was that some types of bacteria could not grow regularly and even died thereby reducing the internal competition of the population this result was consistent with previous researches nan et al 2013 wu et al 2011 neutral condition i e ph 7 provided the most suitable environment for the majority of bacteria in recharge water under the neutral environment most bacteria have a relatively high biological activity and can grow and reproduce normally hence bacterial cell number was the highest at ph 7 in this study 3 2 2 eps secretion the changes in bacterial eps content i e polysaccharides and proteins under different ph conditions were shown in fig 4 as the percolation experiments processed the concentration of bacterial eps first increased and then gradually decreased under ph 5 7 and 9 respectively the concentration of eps underwent three stages i e slow rapid steady stages in the first stage of percolation experiments bacteria adapted to the new environment gradually and their low metabolic activity resulted in slow secretion of eps however during the second stage bacterial growth and reproduction rates accelerated and their enhanced metabolic capacity caused large production of eps after that the bacteria entered endogenous respiration stage which indicated that bacteria began to degrade the secreted eps to resist adverse external conditions this was the reason that the concentration of eps decreased in the third stage of percolation experiments some obvious differences of the eps concentration could be found under different ph conditions fig 4a the highest eps was produced under ph 5 and it was 1 46 and 2 39 times higher than those under ph 7 and 9 respectively this implied that the acidic environment might hinder bacterial growth and metabolism in order to resist harsh condition bacteria tended to secrete more eps to protect themselves neutral condition i e ph 7 was optimal for most of bacteria during the percolation experiments leading to higher biological and metabolic activities compared to alkaline environment i e ph 9 these findings were consistent with wang et al 2011 who demonstrated that the apparent weight average molar mass of eps under acidic conditions was substantially higher than that under neutral and alkaline solutions freitas et al 2009 also found that the viscosity of eps produced by pseudomonas oleovorans was higher for acidic conditions than that of alkaline conditions fig 4b showed that the protein concentration under ph 5 was 1 18 and 1 41 times higher than those at ph 7 and 9 respectively however compared to the cases of ph 7 and 9 the concentration of polysaccharide was 1 49 and 2 44 times higher under ph 5 fig 4c this implied that the ph of recharge water had a significant influence on the concentration of bacterial polysaccharide combined with fig 4a the difference in bacterial eps concentration due to different ph was mainly induced by the change in polysaccharide this was consistent with the results of li et al 2013 who found a large number of glycan bacteria under acidic condition during long term operation of biological phosphorus removal systems 3 3 bioclogging mechanism during managed aquifer recharge figure 5 presents the relationships between the k value of each sand column under different ph i e ph 5 7 and 9 the bacterial cell number and the polysaccharide and protein concentrations in this work bioclogging process could be divided into three stages in the first stage the k values decreased from 1 0 to 0 8 under different ph meanwhile the bacterial cell number the polysaccharide and protein concentrations were negatively correlated with the k value in this stage for this stage the bacterial cell number changed considerably while the protein concentration hardly increased the concentration of polysaccharide varied significantly at ph 5 but changed slightly at ph 7 and 9 respectively therefore in the early stage of the percolation experiments the decreasing k of the sand columns at ph 5 mainly depended on the increased bacterial cell number and polysaccharide at ph 7 the decrease of k was mainly caused by the increment of bacterial cell number while the polysaccharide content had little influence at ph 9 the decrease of k only related to the increased bacterial cell number meanwhile under the condition of ph 5 and ph 7 the zeta potation of bacteria has a minor difference which made the difference of electrostatic repulsion between cell and quartz sand was minor therefore the reduction of k is more or less similar with ph of 5 and 7 at ph 9 the negative charge of cell surface increased obviously which made electrostatic repulsion between cell and quartz sand significant thus the microorganisms need to overcome greater energy barriers to reach quartz sand at ph 9 bacterial cell was easy to migrate out of the sand than getting adsorbed onto the sand surface which led to a less reduction of k compared with ph of 5 and ph of 7 the second stage included the logarithmic phase of bacterial growth and during this stage the k value of the sand columns rapidly decreased from 0 8 to 0 2 as the bacterial growth rate accelerated metabolism was also vigorous hence the bacterial cell number the protein and polysaccharide concentrations under different ph conditions rapidly increased while the decreased hydraulic conductivity of the porous media was the result of the interaction between bacteria and eps in the third stage the k value of the sand columns decreased from 0 2 to 0 1 under different ph conditions the bacterial cell number still increased slowly but the protein and polysaccharide concentrations exhibited a declining trend therefore the increase regarding the number of bacteria in this period was proved to be the key factor inducing the decreased permeability of the porous medium in this work bacterial growth and the secreted eps i e proteins and polysaccharides had different effects on bioclogging considering the ph differences of recharge water during the percolation experiments although serious bioclogging occurred in all sand columns under different ph conditions some distinction could be found in the bioclogging process at ph 5 and 7 bacterial growth and polysaccharide secretion induced bioclogging whereas bacteria were the only contributors to the clogging process at ph 9 3 4 bacterial community composition and structure during managed aquifer recharge during the percolation experiments high throughput sequencing technology was used to study the characteristics of the bacterial community composition and structure under different ph conditions as shown in fig 6a on the phylum level firmicutes was the most predominant phylum with a relative abundance 51 24 for all the samples followed by proteobacteria bacteroidetes and actinobacteria the percentage of other phyla were all 1 although present in all samples some clear distinctions in the bacterial community composition occurred under different ph conditions at ph 5 the top four dominant phyla in the bacteria community i e sample 5 8 were bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria with relative abundances of 44 45 35 55 19 08 and 0 88 respectively at ph 7 firmicutes bacteroidetes proteobacteria and actinobacteria dominated the bacterial community i e sample 7 8 with relative abundances of 64 28 5 and 1 respectively at ph 9 the dominant phyla were firmicutes 89 48 proteobacteria 9 27 bacteroidetes 0 95 and actinobacteria 0 23 in the bacteria community i e sample 9 8 variations of the bacterial community composition also occurred during the same bioclogging process taking samples 5 8 and 5 2 as examples at the beginning of the percolation experiments bacteroidetes firmicutes proteobacteria and actinobacteria were the top four phyla dominated in the bacteria community i e sample 5 8 as the percolation experiments processed obvious clogging occurred and the bacteria community shifted with the relative abundances of proteobacteria and actinobacteria increasing to 45 22 and 6 05 and the relative abundance of firmicutes decreasing to 3 01 figure 6b displays the bacterial community composition at the genus level exiguobacterium elizabethkingia bacillus chryseobacterium and klebsiella were predominated in all the samples exiguobacterium is a gram positive bacterium that is basophilic acidophilic and inactive and can decompose complex organic compounds abid et al 2021 elizabethkingia belongs to the family flavobacteriaceae which is a gram negative bacterium widely present in seawater fresh water and soil lin et al 2019 elizabethkingia has poor motility and can secrete large amounts of viscous extracellular polymers bacillus is a relatively large gram positive bacterium which is highly mobile and acid resistant relman et al 1992 chryseobacterium also belongs to the family flavobacteriaceae bernardet et al 2015 it is an obligate aerobic nonmobile gram negative bacterium with no flagella and has an optimal ph of 7 klebsiella is an inactive facultative anaerobic non flagellar gram negative bacterium with an optimal ph of 7 2 tzouvelekis et al 2012 the venn analysis diagram of the species composition fig 7 reveals that the number of species varied significantly under different ph conditions there were 273 species at ph 5 indicating high abundance of the bacterial community however there were only 140 species at ph 9 this came from fierce competition among microorganisms which evidenced the dominant bacteria hence the species diversity decreased accordingly from the bacterial community composition on the genus level it can be concluded that the abundances of elizabethkingia and bacillus at ph 5 were significantly higher than those at ph 7 while these two strains did not appear at ph 9 in addition elizabethkingia could secrete a large amount of eps both the basophilic exiguobacterium and the acid tolerant elizabethkingia were able to survive under neutral conditions however the abundance of elizabethkingia was very low while the abundance of exiguobacterium was relatively high and the compositions of these bacterial species at ph 7 and 9 were rather similar in addition the abundances of chryseobacterium and klebsiella were relatively high at ph 7 therefore this is the optimal ph of both strains at ph 9 the basophilic exiguobacterium accounted for 80 of the total bacterial abundance while few species of other bacteria were present in this work ph played a critical role on bioclogging process during managed aquifer recharge under different ph conditions the k values of sand columns varied significantly and the direct process leading to bioclogging was the accumulation of cells and the adhesion of eps although bacteria occupy a relatively small volume in porous media a large number of bacteria and viscous eps can adhere together and form biofilms which can easily occupy the pore channels and pore throat positions of porous media thus reducing the hydraulic conductivity in the early stage of the percolation experiments elizabethkingia grew in large quantities at ph 5 resulting in a higher secretion of polysaccharides compared with the experiments at ph 7 and 9 at ph 5 bacteria were more likely to form bacterial micelles to stem medium pores thus bioclogging occurred relatively quickly the decreased permeability coefficient at ph 9 only depends on the increment of the number of bacteria consequently the degree of clogging developed at the slowest rate of all the experiments in the middle stage of the percolation experiments further bacterial growth and metabolism occurred resulting in increased cell numbers and eps contents the polysaccharide content was no longer the key factor restricting the development of bioclogging and the permeability of the porous medium declined sharply under all the three ph conditions the weakly acidic conditions of ph 5 were much more unfavorable to the growth and metabolism of bacteria than the neutral and weakly alkaline conditions of ph 7 and 9 respectively therefore the average declining rate of the relative hydraulic conductivity at ph 9 was also the lowest at this point the development process of bioclogging was basically identical of those at ph 5 and 7 while it was slowest at ph 9 at the end of the percolation experiments the growth of bacteria entered a stable period or even a decay period considering the number of bacteria increased relatively slowly and the eps content decreased in this stage the relative hydraulic conductivity of the sand columns declined slowly and the development process of bioclogging did not change significantly these findings indicated that ph mainly affected the beginning stage of bioclogging process during managed aquifer recharge 4 conclusions in this work three identical laboratory scale sand column experiments were carried out to investigate the variations concerning the relative hydraulic conductivity of the sand columns as well as the bacterial growth and metabolism in the porous medium under different ph conditions during the simulated mar process the relative hydraulic conductivity of the sand columns presented an inverted s type downward trend and non uniform change rules over time the ph of recharge water strongly influenced the process of bioclogging and especially played an decisive role in the early percolation stage during managed aquifer recharge the bacterial cell number of the sand columns showed a slow growth sharp growth steady growth trend under different ph conditions which corresponded to the four periods of bacterial growth however due to the influence of ph the growth process and bacterial cell number differed at ph 5 7 and 9 the slow growth period of bacteria was the shortest at ph 5 which also related to the lowest final number of bacteria as the percolation experiments processed bacterial eps secretion varied with different ph conditions the highest eps concentration was obtained at ph 5 and was 1 46 and 2 39 times higher than that at ph 7 and 9 respectively particularly ph had a considerable influence on polysaccharide the dominant bacteria in the percolation experiments were mainly exiguobacterium elizabethkingia bacillus chryseobacterium and klebsiella at ph 5 and 7 the abundance of klebsiella increased significantly at ph 9 the species and abundance of the dominant bacteria did not change significantly with the change in ph the number of species for the three ph experiments varied significantly and the microbial diversity was higher at ph 5 however at suitable ph values of 7 and 9 intense microbial competition evidenced the dominant bacterial species and led to a low species diversity acid resistant elizabethkingia and bacillus were abundant at ph 5 while chryseobacterium and klebsiella had relatively high abundances at ph 7 in contrast the basophilic exiguobacterium occupied 80 of the total bacterial abundance at ph 9 in the process of bioclogging the ph of water hardly affected the overall declining trend in hydraulic conductivity under various ph conditions the key factors inducing aquifer clogging at different stages are diverse the difference occurred mainly in the first phase of the percolation experiment the variation of the hydraulic conductivity depended on the number of bacteria and polysaccharide content under acidic and neutral conditions while it only depended on the number of bacteria under alkaline conditions credit

biodiversity increased disease and mortality among humans and animals disruption of natural habitats and damage to the quality of water soil and air all this can become negative consequences of pollution of water bodies since if this process is not controlled and timely measures are not taken to reduce the volume of harmful wastewater which lead to an increase in the concentration of harmful impurities in the water body above the maximum permissible norm which poses a threat to both the ecosystem and for the health of people using water for drinking and household needs today water pollution accidents are frequent and severe in many countries such as the united states pulido velazquez and ward 2017 canada forest 2012 and china tang et al 2016 qu et al 2016 there are several types and causes of water pollution thermal chemical biological and mechanical issakhov and zhandaulet 2019 issakhov et al 2020a 2020b issakhov et al 2021a 2021b excess anthropogenic heat released as cooling water by power plants has been recognized as a form of pollution of lakes reservoirs and rivers since the mid 20th century davidson and bradshaw 1967 dracup and fogabty 1974 scherer 1975 thermal pollution is determined as any variation in ambient temperature due to industrial cooling cycles or natural discharges of fluid into water bodies dodds and whiles 2010 kirillin et al 2013 kirillin et al 2013 studied the effect of the design and height of heat storage and discharge structures near inlet outlet on thermal emission characteristics including the distribution of temperature rise and temperature rise at the inlet by comparing scenarios as a rule the average temperature of a reservoir may not be significantly affected by thermal discharges due to its high heat capacity but ultimately a sharp increase in local temperature disrupts the aquatic flora and fauna in it changing the ecological balance in the affected areas peng et al 2013 rui et al 2015 belayutham et al 2016 exposure limits for thermal emissions in an environmental context are difficult to define laws 2000 rosen et al 2015 however it is now generally accepted that the initial temperature rises of the receiving water river or lake at the outlet of the thermal release should be 5 c to avoid impact on aquatic ecosystems goel 2006 langford 1990 hanafiah 2013 kinzelbach 1981 to better understand and address this problem reliable information is needed on the temperature variation of industrial discharged water since high temperatures reduce the concentration of oxygen in the water and have an adverse effect on the ecology of the aquatic environment rosen et al 2015 råman vinnå et al 2017 lin et al 2018 jung et al 2018 huang et al 2019 muthulakshmi et al 2019 today there is an urgent need to develop wastewater treatment technologies crittenden et al 2012 wei et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 thus modeling of spatio temporal changes in water bodies during pollution accidents has become a subject of great interest in the field of water environment protection and attracted the attention of the whole world tang et al 2016 yang et al 2015 fu et al 2020 for example ani et al 2012 presented a mathematical model for predicting the transport of pollutants in rivers that were calibrated in matlab shah et al 2017 used a physical model and numerical simulation to analyze the effect of flow rate and wind speed on the thermal plume shawky et al 2013 tested two alternatives to the vent configuration a surface open duct and a multiport diffuser to study the effect of thermal effect using a scaled physical model they pointed out that venting diffusers can improve mixing and reduce thermal pollution to acceptable levels shawky et al 2015 studied the effect of key parameters such as inlet length inlet outlet distance water depth under the water inlet wall and water depth just before the water inlet on thermal performance using a physical model and numerical calculations two mathematical formulas were derived and tested showing the relationship between these parameters and the concentration of hot water at the inlet currently most of such research focuses on the layout of the intake and exhaust to reduce the effects of thermal discharge salehi 2017 zhang et al 2019 ti lai et al 2017 the second type of pollution is the chemical pollution of water which is a vivid example of such a destructive process when active substances and their compounds which pose a serious threat get into the water body from artificial sources it should be noted that after the discharge of wastewater into the water body some of the released substances may enter into a chemical reaction with other existing substances in the river chemical reactions lead to the dilution of reagents and the formation of secondary pollutants which depend on the concentration of the pollutant temperature and chemical kinetics fiorina et al 2015 wu and liu 2018 burns and ramshaw 2001 shao et al 2012 experimentally investigated the intensification of chemical reactions and mass transfer processes using a liquid liquid system dong et al 2017 simulated the transport of chemicals in coastal rivers and coastal seas using one dimensional convection diffusion models mike 21 based on the simulation results a cawpra coastal accidental water pollution risk analysis method is proposed today cfd modeling is the most accurate and affordable way to conduct research in many areas of science and technology kashid et al 2007 kashid et al 2010 investigated unreacted mass transfer of fluids using cfd harries et al 2003 developed a cfd numerical model of segmented fluid flow and transport of dissolved chemicals in a microreactor using ansys cfx thus a numerical model was developed using cfd and a close agreement was found between the predicted and experimental results zhang et al 2015 studied the enhancement of mass transfer due to the alkaline hydrolysis reaction in the slug liquid liquid flow mode they identified an amplification using mass transfer coefficient increase as a result of consumption of the solute issakhov et al 2021a 2021b using cfds modeled the river pollution by products of chemical reactions from industrial activities the results showed that pollutants move downstream with an increase in the area of pollution but with a lower concentration it was also revealed that despite the fact that the emitted substance does not exceed the mpc the resulting products of the chemical reaction exceed the mpc value several times and cause great harm to the fauna and flora of the aquatic environment biological pollution pollution of waters by pathogenic microorganisms bacteria viruses protozoa fungi small algae etc the consequences of biological pollution unlike other types of anthropogenic impact are usually irreversible in addition unlike most pollutants that are usually transformed in ecosystems during self purification processes and are amenable to human control the unpredictability and practical unavoidability of biological pollution make it a specific and very powerful form of anthropogenic impact this phenomenon has acquired a global character and invasions of alien organisms are recognized as one of the leading factors in the transformation of natural ecosystems oberholster et al 2008 aydın önen and öztürk 2017 for example phytoplankton blooms are caused by an imbalance of n and p nutrients in the water zhang et al 2015 mechanical pollution is characterized by the ingress of various mechanical impurities sand sludge silt etc into the water as well as solid waste garbage plastic reisser et al 2013 weikard 2018 ubomba jaswa and kalebaila 2020 alda vidal et al 2020 timber rafting residues which can significantly impair the organoleptic characteristics of waters they enter the water circulation system during melting snow and rainfall through wells with destroyed masonry and located in non concreted areas as well as together with river water the most dangerous at present is the chemical pollution of water due to the global scale of the manifestation of this process an increase in the number of pollutants in the aquatic and near aquatic ecosystem the reaction occurs only as a result of effective collisions of particles with excess energy the activation energy as the temperature rises the proportion of active molecules increases the number of effective collisions increases thus the rate of the chemical reaction increases an increase in the rate is obviously associated with an increase in the concentration of reagents which as a result of a chemical reaction with water impurities form more harmful substances than the original ones therefore today the study of a chemical reaction in an aqueous medium at different temperatures is relevant although some recent attention has focused on chemical reaction enhanced mass transfer in microchannels systematic studies in this area using ansys fluent are still rare and there are some truly unknown aspects to be explored for example details of mass transfer and concentration distribution in the presence of certain chemical reactions have rarely been reported in previously published literature in addition the effect of circulation on the processes of mass transfer has not been studied since the temperature of the reservoir changes during the day this requires a detailed numerical simulation of the process the analysis of the 2d mixing of pollutants is essential for the effective management of water quality in natural streams since the surface temperature of the river is considered one of the most important parameters when monitoring the state of the ecosystem of the marine coastal environment brando et al 2015 azmi et al 2015 as a rule the average temperature of a reservoir may not be significantly affected by thermal discharges due to its high heat capacity but ultimately a sharp increase in local temperature disrupts the aquatic flora and fauna in it changing the ecological balance in the affected areas to solve the problem of the impact of thermal shocks on the aquatic environment as a rule it is required to analyze the mechanism of heat flow dissipation in the reservoir near the field of its release and to establish the impact zone in which a certain temperature increase is permissible in the present work on the basis of cfd the behavior of mass transfer in the presence of a chemical reaction was studied using ansys fluent taking into account the variable temperature during the day in the ilek river the distribution of chemical concentrations was discussed in detail and areas of concentration and temperature distribution over the entire area were calculated to analyze various runoff scenarios in the ilek river finally the simulation results were compared with previously published numerical data without taking into account the variable temperature that changes during the day issakhov et al 2021a 2021b in order to compare the effect of temperature distribution on chemical concentration 2 field of study ilek is a river in the aktobe region of the republic of kazakhstan and the orenburg region of russian federation the largest left bank tributary of the ural it is used for water supply to industrial enterprises and irrigation of agricultural land the average water discharge is 21 m3 s the annual surface runoff is 1569 m3 the total length of the river is 623 km the basin area is 41 300 km2 the length of the district is 74 km the headwater flows in the western direction then in the north western direction through the territory of kazakhstan skirting the poduralskoe plateau in the middle course in the general direction in the south of the orenburg region of the russian federation in the lower reaches of the river there is the state border between russia and the west kazakhstan and aktobe regions in spring the water level rises to 2 6 m the channel is wide ilek has 75 small and large tributaries the length of which reaches 10 km or more the climate in the aquatic basin is sharply continental the average temperature in january is 15 16 c in june 22 26 c ilek is considered the most polluted body of water in the ural caspian basin it is clogged along its entire length boron hexavalent chromium phenols zinc lead and other chemicals the pollution of the river began in the 1940s by chemical plants the situation is aggravated by industrial enterprises that continue to pour waste into the reservoir the enterprise has no other choice but to pour waste into the already contaminated ilek otherwise city drives will overflow and emergencies cannot be avoided additionally there are requirements for indemnification to the environment for the excess discharge these penalties are not able to restore the purity of water and air 3 mathematical model to predict the spread of heat taking into account the chemical reaction in the area ansys fluent was used which numerically solves the transport equation cfd modeling of such processes is based on the navier stokes equations consisting of the equation of continuity and momentum chung 2002 ferziger

produced by the production point of the ilek river in the suburb of aktobe were modeled using a 2d computational model this scheme was chosen because vertical changes in water flows almost do not affect the obtained numerical solutions for 2d and 3d models lyubimova et al 2018 lyubimova et al 2019 such a simplification can be made as the depth of the ilek river is only 2 6 m while the width and length of the river is calculated in kilometers the use of a 2d model allows a qualitative assessment of the speed temperature distribution of pollutants and the field of chemical reactions in various directions the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations numerical algorithm was applied this algorithm can be written in the following sequence of steps patankar 1980 issakhov and omarova 2021 issakhov and omarova 2020 issakhov and borsikbayeva 2021 issakhov et al 2021a 2021b issakhov et al 2020a 2020b issakhov 2014 1 representations of the initial pressure field p 0 and

if t tmax then we have a return to stage 3 6 model verification a two dimensional reactor model was developed for a temperature controlled test problem based on data provided by chang and chen 1995 the reactor contained two channels fig 2 the origin is at the center of the vertical channel along the x axis at a distance of 20 5d horizontal duct length 101d horizontal duct height 24d the pipe height is 24d the pipe diameter was d 5 mm in fig 2 the laminar jet enters from the pipe normal to the main flow in the channel velocity value in the main channel u 2 005 m s and in the vertical channel v j 11 969 m s the initial water temperature is set 25 c and heated water is set 81 c for the numerical simulation of the problem the following parameters are set the dynamic viscosity of water is μ 0 001003 kg m2 s the density is ρ 998 2 kg m3 the initial and boundary conditions for the turbulent kinetic energy profile tke and dissipation dissipation were set as k 3 2 u i 2 and ε c μ 3 4 k 3 2 l m where l m a reference length scale and i turbulence intensity the measurements were carried out in various x planes in the range from 2 x d 10 the values for the temperature and velocity profiles are presented in the form of dimensionless some ratios according to 10 q t t t j t 11 u velocityu u velocityu max u where t and tj are the temperature of the medium and the jet velocityu and velocityumax are the velocity component and the maximum value of the u velocity to check the computational grid for sensitivity various computational grids were evaluated the first mesh consists of 505 120 nodes the second mesh is 189 45 and the third mesh is 126 30 as can be observed in fig 3 the results of the temperature profiles for various mesh sizes do not differ much from each other so in further calculations a computational grid with a size of 126 30 will be used fig 3 displays the numerical values using various mesh sizes and the results of various turbulent models as can be seen in the results the k ω sst turned out to be the optimal turbulent model since it is in better agreement with the experimental values chen and hwang 1991 for this reason the k ω sst model will be used in further problems in real dimensions a more complete analysis of the choice of turbulent model was described in the paper issakhov and zhandaulet 2019 fig 4 shows the temperature distribution in the computational domain to determine the accuracy of the test item the computational results were compared with experimental data chen and hwang 1991 and the numerical results of other authors chang and chen 1995 the results were obtained with vertical lines x d 2 4 6 8 10 fig 5 as can be observed from the graphs the obtained numerical values show satisfactory results in comparison with the experimental data 7 numerical results of pollution of the ilek river next a real model of the distribution of the pollutant was considered taking into account the chemical reaction at different temperature regimes in the ilek river which is located in aktobe kazakhstan fig 1 to carry out numerical modeling of the process of thermal and chemical transfer in the ilek river a computational area was built the geometry of the study area is displayed in fig 6a the calculated computational area for the x axis 6 km for the y axis 4 km the area of the approximate region respectively 3100 m by 2100 m the study area is 1 081 200 m2 the computational grid is a two dimensional area with the number of elements of about 269 929 the size of the inlet of the injected substance is 1 m fig 6b shows the temperature profile for a river over time the process of thermal and chemical pollution was simulated for 24 h and the data were applied to assess the pollution of the aquatic environment with chemical substances and an excess concentration of the substances from the surface water quality standard was revealed nitrous acid hno2 was selected as a waste product from the industrial plant for modeling 3 scenarios table a 1 were chosen for the release of industrial waste with an hno2 concentration of 0 01 taking into account different river flow rates for numerical simulation similar boundary conditions were used as for the test problem for example wall boundary conditions were used for the coastline while for different scenarios were used for river velocity and discharge velocity which is described in table a 1 the initial and boundary conditions for the turbulent kinetic energy profile and dissipation were set as k 3 2 u i 2 and ε c μ 3 4 k 3 2 l m where l m a reference length scale and i turbulence intensity as shown in fig 6a six control lines were indicated in the study region to compare the received computational values for all cases it is assumed that the chemical element hno2 will enter the ilek river at some rates table a 1 after which this substance reacts with the chlorine cl2 which is in the composition of the river water the chemical reaction of nitrous acid hno2 with water h2o and chlorine cl2 produces nitric acid hno3 and hydrochloric acid hcl the molecular formula of the reaction is hno 2 h 2 o cl 2 hno 3 2 hcl nitrous acid hno2 is a weak monobasic acid that exists only in dilute aqueous solutions colored in a weak blue color and in the gas phase nitric acid hno3 is a strong monobasic acid miscible with water in any ratio and in aqueous solutions it almost completely dissociates into ions the maximum permissible concentration of nitric acid is 2 65 10 7 it is volatile and its evaporation is defined already at 20 c hydrochloric acid hcl is an acid that in its pure form is a colorless and odorless liquid technical acid usually contains impurities that give it a slightly yellowish tint it dissolves very well in water the substance is very corrosive corrodes the skin organic materials metals and their oxides in the air it releases hydrogen chloride vapors which cause suffocation burns to the skin mucous membranes of the eyes and nose damage the respiratory system and destroy teeth hydrochloric acid belongs to substances of the 2nd degree of danger highly hazardous the mpc of hydrochloric acid in an aqueous medium is 1 68 10 7 such a solution has a density of 1 19 g cm3 figs 7 9 show the results of thermal and chemical pollution in the ilek river as can be observed from the obtained results heated water and ejected chemical elements spread downstream along the river border on the loops for the three scenarios the concentration values at variable temperatures are higher compared to the results at a constant temperature figs 7a b 8a b 9a b show the results of thermal pollution of the ilek river where it can be seen that heated water is spreading along the river border downstream the results of the contamination of the emitted hno2 are presented in figs 7c d 8c d 9c d it should be noted that the range of contamination with this substance is very similar to that of thermal contamination the direction of movement is the same as the river flow which is directed to the northwest the products of the chemical reaction hno3 figs 7e f 8e f 9e f and hcl figs 7g h 8g h 9g h also spread downstream along the boundaries expanding the contamination area to assess the pollution by chemical elements from the release as well as from chemical elements that are formed during a chemical reaction it was considered at constant and variable temperatures which change depending on the time of day table a 2 shows the maximum concentration values of the chemical reaction products hno3 hcl in scenario 1 the concentration of products is higher since the discharge rate is 5 times higher than that of the river in addition it should be noted that at a variable temperature for the same velocity modes the concentration values are higher than at a constant water temperature according to the obtained data it can be seen that for scenario 1 after 24 h the values of the peak concentration of the chemical product hno3 show an excess of the mpc in the aquatic environment by 3 3 5 times and for hcl the excess of the mpc is 5 5 6 5 times such facts can cause serious environmental damage to the surrounding regions which will lead to an imbalance in the local ecological system it should be noticed that thermal pollution also plays a very important role so according to standards the water temperature value should not rise by 3 c in the summer time and 5 c in winter time but as can be observed from the received results for all scenarios the area of thermal pollution which exceeds by 3 c occupies a large area tables a 3 a 4 show the numerical data of the areas of thermal water pollution for three scenarios the results show that at a variable temperature which varies depending on the time of day the values of the areas of thermal contamination are greater than at a constant temperature this effect can be explained by the fact that when the temperature of the water which depends on time is exceeded the rate of the chemical reaction begins to increase which leads to an increase in the rater of the chemical reaction tables a 5 a 6 present the values on the area of contamination with the hno2 where one can notice large regions of contamination with this acid which is also very dangerous for living organisms in the water environment as can be observed from tables a 7 a 8 the mpc value for the product of the chemical reaction hno3 is exceeded for scenario 1 with an area of 230 757 77 m2 at a constant temperature and the excess of the mpc value for hno3 is 269 853 1 m2 at a variable water temperature it should be noted that the second product from the chemical reaction hcl exceeds the mpc values in the second case and reaches a contaminated area of 520 260 06 m2 at a constant temperature and in the third case the contamination area is 634 221 76 m2 at variable temperature tables a 9 a 10 fig b 1a shows the hcl concentration profiles for three scenarios which are located on different control lines 1 6 at constant and variable temperatures at time t 1 h the value of the variable temperature at this time is 298 48 k and for a constant temperature of 295 k as can be seen from the obtained results on control lines 5 and 6 the concentration has very low values since the ejected substance has not yet had time to spread to these lines in an hour as it can be seen the mass fraction of concentration at a variable temperature is greater than at a constant temperature this is due to the fact that with an increase in the ambient temperature the rate of the chemical reaction increases which leads to an increase in the course of the chemical reaction and an increase in the formation of a chemical product the same changes are shown for times 2 and 3 h figs b 1b c so at t 2 h the variable temperature value is 296 k however at the time t 6 h the hcl concentration at variable and constant temperatures for some control lines show almost the same values this can be explained by the fact that the temperature value in both cases is 295 k and the rates of the chemical reaction for the two regimes become the same at the same time for a time t 12 h despite the distinctive values of the water temperature for all control lines at a variable temperature value in contrast to a constant water temperature almost the same concentration values are visible this can be explained by the fact that at the time t 12 h the temperature of the aquatic environment does not have time to warm up completely and some heterogeneity of the temperature field is seen towards the middle of the river water fig b 1f shows a significant difference in the hcl concentration value due to the fact that at time t 18 h the variable temperature value reaches a maximum of 299 k it should be noted that for time t 18 h there is a large difference in the hcl concentration products for the variable mode temperature of the environment than at a constant temperature since for a given hour the temperature of the environment reaches its maximum difference in temperature values despite the decrease in the temperature value for the time t 24 h the same picture is visible this can be explained by the fact that the temperature value is less important the rate of the chemical reaction still shows a higher value since the change in the temperature of the middle does not have enough time to change during this period of time fig b 2 shows the change in the concentration of hno2 emissions on lines 1 6 for three scenarios at different points in time as can be seen from the figures up to 6 h the value of the emission concentration at a variable temperature is higher than at a constant one since the river temperature is 295 k at t 6 h and at t 12 h the mass fractions do not differ much due to the small difference temperatures so from the obtained results it can be noticed that the emitted chemical substance hno2 for all time layers of most of the control lines has the same value with the exception of some lines which are mainly found downstream this can be explained by the fact that the ejected substance does not have time to enter into a chemical reaction in a short time and the main active chemical reaction occurs downstream fig b 3 shows the change in the concentration of the hno3 product on lines 1 6 for three scenarios at different points in time as can be observed from the figures the concentration of hno3 as well as the concentration of hcl at variable temperatures show the maximum value for the time t 12 and 18 h since at high temperatures of the medium the chemical reaction proceeds faster from the obtained computational values it should be noticed that in addition to the pollution of the river with various harmful substances chemical elements and chemical reaction products entering them with wastewater there is thermal pollution of the river caused by the discharge of heated water into them as a result of the activities of objects due to the discharge of heated water in many rivers the water temperature will increase by an average of 4 5 c which will significantly change the living conditions of fish and other aquatic organisms thus it can be noticed that regardless of the flow rate and river speed the distribution of thermal pollution at a constant temperature of the river basically occurs along the coastline of the ilek river as can be observed from the values with an increase in the river flow rate the area of temperature pollution decreases but it should be noticed that the maximum temperature value increases for this option however with a variable river temperature an absolutely different picture is visible as changes in the temperature value in rivers in all scenarios except for scenario 1 occur in almost the entire region while for scenario 1 the temperature spread is not so large the spread data is explained by the fact that for scenario 1 the river speed is not significant in comparison with other scenarios it should also be noted that the distribution of the polluting hno2 along the river happens in almost the same way as for thermal pollution along the river banks at a constant temperature basically both for thermal pollution and for the hno2 distribution takes place in the direction of the river flow this is directed to the northwest however a completely another picture is observed for the chemical reaction products hno3 hcl so from the obtained data it can be noted that the speed of the river and the temperature of the river depending on time will play a very important role in the formation and distribution of the products of a chemical reaction it should be noted that mainly the pollutant concentration and products from the chemical reaction spread downstream and with an increase in the river speed these concentrations spread faster however in general it should be noted that the effect of variable water temperature plays a very large role in the spread of pollution since with an increase in the temperature value the rate of chemical reaction increases which entails that the pollutant quickly enters into a chemical reaction and forms chemical products so from the obtained data it can be seen that at a variable water temperature the maximum value of the substance product increases for all scenarios and depends on the river flow rate table a 2 thus for scenario 1 the products of matter hno3 hcl at a variable water temperature are almost 1 16 times higher than at a constant temperature however with an increase in the river speed scenario 2 the ratio of the products of matter almost becomes 1 42 however it should be noted that in scenario 3 the opposite process is observed and the ratio becomes almost 1 15 this effect can be explained by the fact that with an increase in the river speed the ejected matter quickly goes downstream and an active diffusion process takes place however it should be noted that the area is almost directly proportional to the increase depending on the flow rate of the river and as the river speed increases the pollution region increases however it should be noted that for the product of the substance hno3 both for a variable temperature and for a constant temperature only for the first scenario pollution areas exceeding the mpc values were observed while with an increase in the river velocity scenarios 2 and 3 areas of pollution that exceed the mpc value were not observed however this trend was not detected for the hcl product so regardless of the river flow rate regime there are areas of pollution for almost all options but it should be noted that for scenarios 2 and 3 these areas do not exceed 312 m2 which in general for such an area is a relatively very small value so from the obtained data it can be concluded that the most dangerous regime for the discharge of pollutants is scenario 1 since regardless of the temperature regime the pollution area exceeding the mpc value is very large so for an enterprise of this type in the first scenario it is recommended to reduce emissions of pollutants and increase emissions while the river flow rate will increase since these speed limits will lead to the least environmental impact at the same time it is also necessary to monitor the change in the ambient temperature since for the product from the chemical reaction in scenario 1 the excess of the area reaches up to 1 2 times which can subsequently affect the environmental situation of this region very badly so from the obtained results it can be concluded that the modes of emission of the pollutant will need to be regulated depending on the flow rate of the river and the ambient temperature and the best option is if the river flow velocity is 0 4 m s since these regimes will also depend little on changes in the ambient temperature whereas at a river flow velocity of 0 4 m s it can be seen that there is a very strong dependence on the temperature regime and in order to maintain a safe ecological situation it will be necessary to reduce the rate of emission of pollutants 8 conclusion the potential consequences of industrial waste dumping in coastal regions can lead to catastrophic pollution the study shows the applicability of numerical simulations for assessing pollution risk on a large scale the proposed method was successfully used for the main problem of assessing the risk of pollution with complex interactions of chemicals at variable and constant ambient temperatures this setting has rarely been mentioned in previously published works the simulation data provided information on the concentrations of the reaction products and on the contamination regions for the three scenarios the chemical reaction products hno3 and hcl are highly hazardous the data of water quality modeling display that for scenario 1 after 24 h the peak concentrations of chemical products hno3 are 3 3 5 times higher than the mpc values and for hcl they are 5 5 6 5 times higher than the mpc of the aquatic environment in this case the emitted hno2 does not exceed the mpc standard modeling data not only provide a scientific basis for the assessment of pollution but also contribute to early warning and emergency response as can be observed from the obtained numerical data the rate of formation of pollution products is highly dependent on the ambient temperature and on the rate of water flow so it is desirable to regulate the modes of emission of pollutants depending on the flow rate of the river and the ambient temperature thus the recommended river flow rate is 0 4 m s since these regimes will depend little on the ambient temperature whereas at a river flow velocity of 0 4 m s it can be seen that there is a very strong dependence on the temperature regime and in order to maintain a safe ecological situation it will be necessary to reduce the rate of emission of pollutants it should also be noticed that it is very significant to control the quality of the water environment downstream of the river not only for those chemical elements that are ejected by industrial enterprises but also for those potentially possible chemical elements that are received as a result of a chemical reaction since the ejected concentration itself may not exceed the mpc value however the final products from chemical reactions can exceed the mpc by several times which can conduct to cause significant environmental damage and catastrophic consequences to the surrounding regions which will lead to an imbalance in the local ecological system funding this work is supported by the grant from the ministry of education and science of the republic of kazakhstan

1234,the work focuses on the behavior of heated effluents discharged at elevated temperatures into the ilek river which is located in the city of aktobe kazakhstan as a result of industrial activities this study is aimed at studying the dispersion characteristics of heated effluents in the near and far fields at different flow rates and dynamic conditions of the river the chemical reaction which is formed as a result of the combination of the ejected substance and the substance in water is numerically investigated the work took into account the variable temperature of the river which changes during the day and the values were compared with the results of modeling at a constant river temperature it was found that although the emitted element hno2 does not exceed the maximum permissible value mpc but the resulting products hno3 hcl exceed the mpc several times and cause significant damage to the aquatic environment keywords reynolds averaged navier stokes rans chemical reaction pollutant dispersion variable temperature of medium chemical products data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction water is the basis of all life on our planet the health of people animals and plants depends on the quality of the water consumed with the development of science and the application of its achievements in various industries mankind does not always control the degree of its harmful effects on the environment the world health organization estimates that 80 of all diseases in the world are associated with unsatisfactory water quality destruction of biodiversity increased disease and mortality among humans and animals disruption of natural habitats and damage to the quality of water soil and air all this can become negative consequences of pollution of water bodies since if this process is not controlled and timely measures are not taken to reduce the volume of harmful wastewater which lead to an increase in the concentration of harmful impurities in the water body above the maximum permissible norm which poses a threat to both the ecosystem and for the health of people using water for drinking and household needs today water pollution accidents are frequent and severe in many countries such as the united states pulido velazquez and ward 2017 canada forest 2012 and china tang et al 2016 qu et al 2016 there are several types and causes of water pollution thermal chemical biological and mechanical issakhov and zhandaulet 2019 issakhov et al 2020a 2020b issakhov et al 2021a 2021b excess anthropogenic heat released as cooling water by power plants has been recognized as a form of pollution of lakes reservoirs and rivers since the mid 20th century davidson and bradshaw 1967 dracup and fogabty 1974 scherer 1975 thermal pollution is determined as any variation in ambient temperature due to industrial cooling cycles or natural discharges of fluid into water bodies dodds and whiles 2010 kirillin et al 2013 kirillin et al 2013 studied the effect of the design and height of heat storage and discharge structures near inlet outlet on thermal emission characteristics including the distribution of temperature rise and temperature rise at the inlet by comparing scenarios as a rule the average temperature of a reservoir may not be significantly affected by thermal discharges due to its high heat capacity but ultimately a sharp increase in local temperature disrupts the aquatic flora and fauna in it changing the ecological balance in the affected areas peng et al 2013 rui et al 2015 belayutham et al 2016 exposure limits for thermal emissions in an environmental context are difficult to define laws 2000 rosen et al 2015 however it is now generally accepted that the initial temperature rises of the receiving water river or lake at the outlet of the thermal release should be 5 c to avoid impact on aquatic ecosystems goel 2006 langford 1990 hanafiah 2013 kinzelbach 1981 to better understand and address this problem reliable information is needed on the temperature variation of industrial discharged water since high temperatures reduce the concentration of oxygen in the water and have an adverse effect on the ecology of the aquatic environment rosen et al 2015 råman vinnå et al 2017 lin et al 2018 jung et al 2018 huang et al 2019 muthulakshmi et al 2019 today there is an urgent need to develop wastewater treatment technologies crittenden et al 2012 wei et al 2019 xiao et al 2020 thus modeling of spatio temporal changes in water bodies during pollution accidents has become a subject of great interest in the field of water environment protection and attracted the attention of the whole world tang et al 2016 yang et al 2015 fu et al 2020 for example ani et al 2012 presented a mathematical model for predicting the transport of pollutants in rivers that were calibrated in matlab shah et al 2017 used a physical model and numerical simulation to analyze the effect of flow rate and wind speed on the thermal plume shawky et al 2013 tested two alternatives to the vent configuration a surface open duct and a multiport diffuser to study the effect of thermal effect using a scaled physical model they pointed out that venting diffusers can improve mixing and reduce thermal pollution to acceptable levels shawky et al 2015 studied the effect of key parameters such as inlet length inlet outlet distance water depth under the water inlet wall and water depth just before the water inlet on thermal performance using a physical model and numerical calculations two mathematical formulas were derived and tested showing the relationship between these parameters and the concentration of hot water at the inlet currently most of such research focuses on the layout of the intake and exhaust to reduce the effects of thermal discharge salehi 2017 zhang et al 2019 ti lai et al 2017 the second type of pollution is the chemical pollution of water which is a vivid example of such a destructive process when active substances and their compounds which pose a serious threat get into the water body from artificial sources it should be noted that after the discharge of wastewater into the water body some of the released substances may enter into a chemical reaction with other existing substances in the river chemical reactions lead to the dilution of reagents and the formation of secondary pollutants which depend on the concentration of the pollutant temperature and chemical kinetics fiorina et al 2015 wu and liu 2018 burns and ramshaw 2001 shao et al 2012 experimentally investigated the intensification of chemical reactions and mass transfer processes using a liquid liquid system dong et al 2017 simulated the transport of chemicals in coastal rivers and coastal seas using one dimensional convection diffusion models mike 21 based on the simulation results a cawpra coastal accidental water pollution risk analysis method is proposed today cfd modeling is the most accurate and affordable way to conduct research in many areas of science and technology kashid et al 2007 kashid et al 2010 investigated unreacted mass transfer of fluids using cfd harries et al 2003 developed a cfd numerical model of segmented fluid flow and transport of dissolved chemicals in a microreactor using ansys cfx thus a numerical model was developed using cfd and a close agreement was found between the predicted and experimental results zhang et al 2015 studied the enhancement of mass transfer due to the alkaline hydrolysis reaction in the slug liquid liquid flow mode they identified an amplification using mass transfer coefficient increase as a result of consumption of the solute issakhov et al 2021a 2021b using cfds modeled the river pollution by products of chemical reactions from industrial activities the results showed that pollutants move downstream with an increase in the area of pollution but with a lower concentration it was also revealed that despite the fact that the emitted substance does not exceed the mpc the resulting products of the chemical reaction exceed the mpc value several times and cause great harm to the fauna and flora of the aquatic environment biological pollution pollution of waters by pathogenic microorganisms bacteria viruses protozoa fungi small algae etc the consequences of biological pollution unlike other types of anthropogenic impact are usually irreversible in addition unlike most pollutants that are usually transformed in ecosystems during self purification processes and are amenable to human control the unpredictability and practical unavoidability of biological pollution make it a specific and very powerful form of anthropogenic impact this phenomenon has acquired a global character and invasions of alien organisms are recognized as one of the leading factors in the transformation of natural ecosystems oberholster et al 2008 aydın önen and öztürk 2017 for example phytoplankton blooms are caused by an imbalance of n and p nutrients in the water zhang et al 2015 mechanical pollution is characterized by the ingress of various mechanical impurities sand sludge silt etc into the water as well as solid waste garbage plastic reisser et al 2013 weikard 2018 ubomba jaswa and kalebaila 2020 alda vidal et al 2020 timber rafting residues which can significantly impair the organoleptic characteristics of waters they enter the water circulation system during melting snow and rainfall through wells with destroyed masonry and located in non concreted areas as well as together with river water the most dangerous at present is the chemical pollution of water due to the global scale of the manifestation of this process an increase in the number of pollutants in the aquatic and near aquatic ecosystem the reaction occurs only as a result of effective collisions of particles with excess energy the activation energy as the temperature rises the proportion of active molecules increases the number of effective collisions increases thus the rate of the chemical reaction increases an increase in the rate is obviously associated with an increase in the concentration of reagents which as a result of a chemical reaction with water impurities form more harmful substances than the original ones therefore today the study of a chemical reaction in an aqueous medium at different temperatures is relevant although some recent attention has focused on chemical reaction enhanced mass transfer in microchannels systematic studies in this area using ansys fluent are still rare and there are some truly unknown aspects to be explored for example details of mass transfer and concentration distribution in the presence of certain chemical reactions have rarely been reported in previously published literature in addition the effect of circulation on the processes of mass transfer has not been studied since the temperature of the reservoir changes during the day this requires a detailed numerical simulation of the process the analysis of the 2d mixing of pollutants is essential for the effective management of water quality in natural streams since the surface temperature of the river is considered one of the most important parameters when monitoring the state of the ecosystem of the marine coastal environment brando et al 2015 azmi et al 2015 as a rule the average temperature of a reservoir may not be significantly affected by thermal discharges due to its high heat capacity but ultimately a sharp increase in local temperature disrupts the aquatic flora and fauna in it changing the ecological balance in the affected areas to solve the problem of the impact of thermal shocks on the aquatic environment as a rule it is required to analyze the mechanism of heat flow dissipation in the reservoir near the field of its release and to establish the impact zone in which a certain temperature increase is permissible in the present work on the basis of cfd the behavior of mass transfer in the presence of a chemical reaction was studied using ansys fluent taking into account the variable temperature during the day in the ilek river the distribution of chemical concentrations was discussed in detail and areas of concentration and temperature distribution over the entire area were calculated to analyze various runoff scenarios in the ilek river finally the simulation results were compared with previously published numerical data without taking into account the variable temperature that changes during the day issakhov et al 2021a 2021b in order to compare the effect of temperature distribution on chemical concentration 2 field of study ilek is a river in the aktobe region of the republic of kazakhstan and the orenburg region of russian federation the largest left bank tributary of the ural it is used for water supply to industrial enterprises and irrigation of agricultural land the average water discharge is 21 m3 s the annual surface runoff is 1569 m3 the total length of the river is 623 km the basin area is 41 300 km2 the length of the district is 74 km the headwater flows in the western direction then in the north western direction through the territory of kazakhstan skirting the poduralskoe plateau in the middle course in the general direction in the south of the orenburg region of the russian federation in the lower reaches of the river there is the state border between russia and the west kazakhstan and aktobe regions in spring the water level rises to 2 6 m the channel is wide ilek has 75 small and large tributaries the length of which reaches 10 km or more the climate in the aquatic basin is sharply continental the average temperature in january is 15 16 c in june 22 26 c ilek is considered the most polluted body of water in the ural caspian basin it is clogged along its entire length boron hexavalent chromium phenols zinc lead and other chemicals the pollution of the river began in the 1940s by chemical plants the situation is aggravated by industrial enterprises that continue to pour waste into the reservoir the enterprise has no other choice but to pour waste into the already contaminated ilek otherwise city drives will overflow and emergencies cannot be avoided additionally there are requirements for indemnification to the environment for the excess discharge these penalties are not able to restore the purity of water and air 3 mathematical model to predict the spread of heat taking into account the chemical reaction in the area ansys fluent was used which numerically solves the transport equation cfd modeling of such processes is based on the navier stokes equations consisting of the equation of continuity and momentum chung 2002 ferziger

produced by the production point of the ilek river in the suburb of aktobe were modeled using a 2d computational model this scheme was chosen because vertical changes in water flows almost do not affect the obtained numerical solutions for 2d and 3d models lyubimova et al 2018 lyubimova et al 2019 such a simplification can be made as the depth of the ilek river is only 2 6 m while the width and length of the river is calculated in kilometers the use of a 2d model allows a qualitative assessment of the speed temperature distribution of pollutants and the field of chemical reactions in various directions the simple semi implicit method for pressure linked equations numerical algorithm was applied this algorithm can be written in the following sequence of steps patankar 1980 issakhov and omarova 2021 issakhov and omarova 2020 issakhov and borsikbayeva 2021 issakhov et al 2021a 2021b issakhov et al 2020a 2020b issakhov 2014 1 representations of the initial pressure field p 0 and

if t tmax then we have a return to stage 3 6 model verification a two dimensional reactor model was developed for a temperature controlled test problem based on data provided by chang and chen 1995 the reactor contained two channels fig 2 the origin is at the center of the vertical channel along the x axis at a distance of 20 5d horizontal duct length 101d horizontal duct height 24d the pipe height is 24d the pipe diameter was d 5 mm in fig 2 the laminar jet enters from the pipe normal to the main flow in the channel velocity value in the main channel u 2 005 m s and in the vertical channel v j 11 969 m s the initial water temperature is set 25 c and heated water is set 81 c for the numerical simulation of the problem the following parameters are set the dynamic viscosity of water is μ 0 001003 kg m2 s the density is ρ 998 2 kg m3 the initial and boundary conditions for the turbulent kinetic energy profile tke and dissipation dissipation were set as k 3 2 u i 2 and ε c μ 3 4 k 3 2 l m where l m a reference length scale and i turbulence intensity the measurements were carried out in various x planes in the range from 2 x d 10 the values for the temperature and velocity profiles are presented in the form of dimensionless some ratios according to 10 q t t t j t 11 u velocityu u velocityu max u where t and tj are the temperature of the medium and the jet velocityu and velocityumax are the velocity component and the maximum value of the u velocity to check the computational grid for sensitivity various computational grids were evaluated the first mesh consists of 505 120 nodes the second mesh is 189 45 and the third mesh is 126 30 as can be observed in fig 3 the results of the temperature profiles for various mesh sizes do not differ much from each other so in further calculations a computational grid with a size of 126 30 will be used fig 3 displays the numerical values using various mesh sizes and the results of various turbulent models as can be seen in the results the k ω sst turned out to be the optimal turbulent model since it is in better agreement with the experimental values chen and hwang 1991 for this reason the k ω sst model will be used in further problems in real dimensions a more complete analysis of the choice of turbulent model was described in the paper issakhov and zhandaulet 2019 fig 4 shows the temperature distribution in the computational domain to determine the accuracy of the test item the computational results were compared with experimental data chen and hwang 1991 and the numerical results of other authors chang and chen 1995 the results were obtained with vertical lines x d 2 4 6 8 10 fig 5 as can be observed from the graphs the obtained numerical values show satisfactory results in comparison with the experimental data 7 numerical results of pollution of the ilek river next a real model of the distribution of the pollutant was considered taking into account the chemical reaction at different temperature regimes in the ilek river which is located in aktobe kazakhstan fig 1 to carry out numerical modeling of the process of thermal and chemical transfer in the ilek river a computational area was built the geometry of the study area is displayed in fig 6a the calculated computational area for the x axis 6 km for the y axis 4 km the area of the approximate region respectively 3100 m by 2100 m the study area is 1 081 200 m2 the computational grid is a two dimensional area with the number of elements of about 269 929 the size of the inlet of the injected substance is 1 m fig 6b shows the temperature profile for a river over time the process of thermal and chemical pollution was simulated for 24 h and the data were applied to assess the pollution of the aquatic environment with chemical substances and an excess concentration of the substances from the surface water quality standard was revealed nitrous acid hno2 was selected as a waste product from the industrial plant for modeling 3 scenarios table a 1 were chosen for the release of industrial waste with an hno2 concentration of 0 01 taking into account different river flow rates for numerical simulation similar boundary conditions were used as for the test problem for example wall boundary conditions were used for the coastline while for different scenarios were used for river velocity and discharge velocity which is described in table a 1 the initial and boundary conditions for the turbulent kinetic energy profile and dissipation were set as k 3 2 u i 2 and ε c μ 3 4 k 3 2 l m where l m a reference length scale and i turbulence intensity as shown in fig 6a six control lines were indicated in the study region to compare the received computational values for all cases it is assumed that the chemical element hno2 will enter the ilek river at some rates table a 1 after which this substance reacts with the chlorine cl2 which is in the composition of the river water the chemical reaction of nitrous acid hno2 with water h2o and chlorine cl2 produces nitric acid hno3 and hydrochloric acid hcl the molecular formula of the reaction is hno 2 h 2 o cl 2 hno 3 2 hcl nitrous acid hno2 is a weak monobasic acid that exists only in dilute aqueous solutions colored in a weak blue color and in the gas phase nitric acid hno3 is a strong monobasic acid miscible with water in any ratio and in aqueous solutions it almost completely dissociates into ions the maximum permissible concentration of nitric acid is 2 65 10 7 it is volatile and its evaporation is defined already at 20 c hydrochloric acid hcl is an acid that in its pure form is a colorless and odorless liquid technical acid usually contains impurities that give it a slightly yellowish tint it dissolves very well in water the substance is very corrosive corrodes the skin organic materials metals and their oxides in the air it releases hydrogen chloride vapors which cause suffocation burns to the skin mucous membranes of the eyes and nose damage the respiratory system and destroy teeth hydrochloric acid belongs to substances of the 2nd degree of danger highly hazardous the mpc of hydrochloric acid in an aqueous medium is 1 68 10 7 such a solution has a density of 1 19 g cm3 figs 7 9 show the results of thermal and chemical pollution in the ilek river as can be observed from the obtained results heated water and ejected chemical elements spread downstream along the river border on the loops for the three scenarios the concentration values at variable temperatures are higher compared to the results at a constant temperature figs 7a b 8a b 9a b show the results of thermal pollution of the ilek river where it can be seen that heated water is spreading along the river border downstream the results of the contamination of the emitted hno2 are presented in figs 7c d 8c d 9c d it should be noted that the range of contamination with this substance is very similar to that of thermal contamination the direction of movement is the same as the river flow which is directed to the northwest the products of the chemical reaction hno3 figs 7e f 8e f 9e f and hcl figs 7g h 8g h 9g h also spread downstream along the boundaries expanding the contamination area to assess the pollution by chemical elements from the release as well as from chemical elements that are formed during a chemical reaction it was considered at constant and variable temperatures which change depending on the time of day table a 2 shows the maximum concentration values of the chemical reaction products hno3 hcl in scenario 1 the concentration of products is higher since the discharge rate is 5 times higher than that of the river in addition it should be noted that at a variable temperature for the same velocity modes the concentration values are higher than at a constant water temperature according to the obtained data it can be seen that for scenario 1 after 24 h the values of the peak concentration of the chemical product hno3 show an excess of the mpc in the aquatic environment by 3 3 5 times and for hcl the excess of the mpc is 5 5 6 5 times such facts can cause serious environmental damage to the surrounding regions which will lead to an imbalance in the local ecological system it should be noticed that thermal pollution also plays a very important role so according to standards the water temperature value should not rise by 3 c in the summer time and 5 c in winter time but as can be observed from the received results for all scenarios the area of thermal pollution which exceeds by 3 c occupies a large area tables a 3 a 4 show the numerical data of the areas of thermal water pollution for three scenarios the results show that at a variable temperature which varies depending on the time of day the values of the areas of thermal contamination are greater than at a constant temperature this effect can be explained by the fact that when the temperature of the water which depends on time is exceeded the rate of the chemical reaction begins to increase which leads to an increase in the rater of the chemical reaction tables a 5 a 6 present the values on the area of contamination with the hno2 where one can notice large regions of contamination with this acid which is also very dangerous for living organisms in the water environment as can be observed from tables a 7 a 8 the mpc value for the product of the chemical reaction hno3 is exceeded for scenario 1 with an area of 230 757 77 m2 at a constant temperature and the excess of the mpc value for hno3 is 269 853 1 m2 at a variable water temperature it should be noted that the second product from the chemical reaction hcl exceeds the mpc values in the second case and reaches a contaminated area of 520 260 06 m2 at a constant temperature and in the third case the contamination area is 634 221 76 m2 at variable temperature tables a 9 a 10 fig b 1a shows the hcl concentration profiles for three scenarios which are located on different control lines 1 6 at constant and variable temperatures at time t 1 h the value of the variable temperature at this time is 298 48 k and for a constant temperature of 295 k as can be seen from the obtained results on control lines 5 and 6 the concentration has very low values since the ejected substance has not yet had time to spread to these lines in an hour as it can be seen the mass fraction of concentration at a variable temperature is greater than at a constant temperature this is due to the fact that with an increase in the ambient temperature the rate of the chemical reaction increases which leads to an increase in the course of the chemical reaction and an increase in the formation of a chemical product the same changes are shown for times 2 and 3 h figs b 1b c so at t 2 h the variable temperature value is 296 k however at the time t 6 h the hcl concentration at variable and constant temperatures for some control lines show almost the same values this can be explained by the fact that the temperature value in both cases is 295 k and the rates of the chemical reaction for the two regimes become the same at the same time for a time t 12 h despite the distinctive values of the water temperature for all control lines at a variable temperature value in contrast to a constant water temperature almost the same concentration values are visible this can be explained by the fact that at the time t 12 h the temperature of the aquatic environment does not have time to warm up completely and some heterogeneity of the temperature field is seen towards the middle of the river water fig b 1f shows a significant difference in the hcl concentration value due to the fact that at time t 18 h the variable temperature value reaches a maximum of 299 k it should be noted that for time t 18 h there is a large difference in the hcl concentration products for the variable mode temperature of the environment than at a constant temperature since for a given hour the temperature of the environment reaches its maximum difference in temperature values despite the decrease in the temperature value for the time t 24 h the same picture is visible this can be explained by the fact that the temperature value is less important the rate of the chemical reaction still shows a higher value since the change in the temperature of the middle does not have enough time to change during this period of time fig b 2 shows the change in the concentration of hno2 emissions on lines 1 6 for three scenarios at different points in time as can be seen from the figures up to 6 h the value of the emission concentration at a variable temperature is higher than at a constant one since the river temperature is 295 k at t 6 h and at t 12 h the mass fractions do not differ much due to the small difference temperatures so from the obtained results it can be noticed that the emitted chemical substance hno2 for all time layers of most of the control lines has the same value with the exception of some lines which are mainly found downstream this can be explained by the fact that the ejected substance does not have time to enter into a chemical reaction in a short time and the main active chemical reaction occurs downstream fig b 3 shows the change in the concentration of the hno3 product on lines 1 6 for three scenarios at different points in time as can be observed from the figures the concentration of hno3 as well as the concentration of hcl at variable temperatures show the maximum value for the time t 12 and 18 h since at high temperatures of the medium the chemical reaction proceeds faster from the obtained computational values it should be noticed that in addition to the pollution of the river with various harmful substances chemical elements and chemical reaction products entering them with wastewater there is thermal pollution of the river caused by the discharge of heated water into them as a result of the activities of objects due to the discharge of heated water in many rivers the water temperature will increase by an average of 4 5 c which will significantly change the living conditions of fish and other aquatic organisms thus it can be noticed that regardless of the flow rate and river speed the distribution of thermal pollution at a constant temperature of the river basically occurs along the coastline of the ilek river as can be observed from the values with an increase in the river flow rate the area of temperature pollution decreases but it should be noticed that the maximum temperature value increases for this option however with a variable river temperature an absolutely different picture is visible as changes in the temperature value in rivers in all scenarios except for scenario 1 occur in almost the entire region while for scenario 1 the temperature spread is not so large the spread data is explained by the fact that for scenario 1 the river speed is not significant in comparison with other scenarios it should also be noted that the distribution of the polluting hno2 along the river happens in almost the same way as for thermal pollution along the river banks at a constant temperature basically both for thermal pollution and for the hno2 distribution takes place in the direction of the river flow this is directed to the northwest however a completely another picture is observed for the chemical reaction products hno3 hcl so from the obtained data it can be noted that the speed of the river and the temperature of the river depending on time will play a very important role in the formation and distribution of the products of a chemical reaction it should be noted that mainly the pollutant concentration and products from the chemical reaction spread downstream and with an increase in the river speed these concentrations spread faster however in general it should be noted that the effect of variable water temperature plays a very large role in the spread of pollution since with an increase in the temperature value the rate of chemical reaction increases which entails that the pollutant quickly enters into a chemical reaction and forms chemical products so from the obtained data it can be seen that at a variable water temperature the maximum value of the substance product increases for all scenarios and depends on the river flow rate table a 2 thus for scenario 1 the products of matter hno3 hcl at a variable water temperature are almost 1 16 times higher than at a constant temperature however with an increase in the river speed scenario 2 the ratio of the products of matter almost becomes 1 42 however it should be noted that in scenario 3 the opposite process is observed and the ratio becomes almost 1 15 this effect can be explained by the fact that with an increase in the river speed the ejected matter quickly goes downstream and an active diffusion process takes place however it should be noted that the area is almost directly proportional to the increase depending on the flow rate of the river and as the river speed increases the pollution region increases however it should be noted that for the product of the substance hno3 both for a variable temperature and for a constant temperature only for the first scenario pollution areas exceeding the mpc values were observed while with an increase in the river velocity scenarios 2 and 3 areas of pollution that exceed the mpc value were not observed however this trend was not detected for the hcl product so regardless of the river flow rate regime there are areas of pollution for almost all options but it should be noted that for scenarios 2 and 3 these areas do not exceed 312 m2 which in general for such an area is a relatively very small value so from the obtained data it can be concluded that the most dangerous regime for the discharge of pollutants is scenario 1 since regardless of the temperature regime the pollution area exceeding the mpc value is very large so for an enterprise of this type in the first scenario it is recommended to reduce emissions of pollutants and increase emissions while the river flow rate will increase since these speed limits will lead to the least environmental impact at the same time it is also necessary to monitor the change in the ambient temperature since for the product from the chemical reaction in scenario 1 the excess of the area reaches up to 1 2 times which can subsequently affect the environmental situation of this region very badly so from the obtained results it can be concluded that the modes of emission of the pollutant will need to be regulated depending on the flow rate of the river and the ambient temperature and the best option is if the river flow velocity is 0 4 m s since these regimes will also depend little on changes in the ambient temperature whereas at a river flow velocity of 0 4 m s it can be seen that there is a very strong dependence on the temperature regime and in order to maintain a safe ecological situation it will be necessary to reduce the rate of emission of pollutants 8 conclusion the potential consequences of industrial waste dumping in coastal regions can lead to catastrophic pollution the study shows the applicability of numerical simulations for assessing pollution risk on a large scale the proposed method was successfully used for the main problem of assessing the risk of pollution with complex interactions of chemicals at variable and constant ambient temperatures this setting has rarely been mentioned in previously published works the simulation data provided information on the concentrations of the reaction products and on the contamination regions for the three scenarios the chemical reaction products hno3 and hcl are highly hazardous the data of water quality modeling display that for scenario 1 after 24 h the peak concentrations of chemical products hno3 are 3 3 5 times higher than the mpc values and for hcl they are 5 5 6 5 times higher than the mpc of the aquatic environment in this case the emitted hno2 does not exceed the mpc standard modeling data not only provide a scientific basis for the assessment of pollution but also contribute to early warning and emergency response as can be observed from the obtained numerical data the rate of formation of pollution products is highly dependent on the ambient temperature and on the rate of water flow so it is desirable to regulate the modes of emission of pollutants depending on the flow rate of the river and the ambient temperature thus the recommended river flow rate is 0 4 m s since these regimes will depend little on the ambient temperature whereas at a river flow velocity of 0 4 m s it can be seen that there is a very strong dependence on the temperature regime and in order to maintain a safe ecological situation it will be necessary to reduce the rate of emission of pollutants it should also be noticed that it is very significant to control the quality of the water environment downstream of the river not only for those chemical elements that are ejected by industrial enterprises but also for those potentially possible chemical elements that are received as a result of a chemical reaction since the ejected concentration itself may not exceed the mpc value however the final products from chemical reactions can exceed the mpc by several times which can conduct to cause significant environmental damage and catastrophic consequences to the surrounding regions which will lead to an imbalance in the local ecological system funding this work is supported by the grant from the ministry of education and science of the republic of kazakhstan
