properties groundwater remediation review 1 introduction air sparging is a groundwater remediation technique where a gas usually air is pumped into an area beneath the water table through a network of injection wells the injected air forces deep groundwater to circulate and aerates the water to removes volatiles furthermore the air sparging process enhances groundwater remediation as it provides increased amounts of oxygen for biodegradation interstate technology and regulatory council 2005 that relies on the process of mass transfer between the gas and liquid phase in combination with the phenomena of diffusion and mixing in the water droste 1996 elserwy 2019 in general air sparging targets sites where groundwater and or saturated soils are contaminated with volatile semi volatile and or non volatile aerobically biodegradable organic contaminants miller 1996 conventionally air bubbles with diameters in the range of 2 5 mm macrobubbles are employed however recent studies of water treatment with mnbs in the lab have shown that mnbs can increase the efficiency of mass transfer and produce higher dissolved oxygen concentrations chen et al 2008 eamrat et al 2020 jiang and wu 2011 suwartha et al 2020 advanced oxidation and ozonation technology is gaining more attention in water pollution control particularly the mnbs technology it has broad applications and prospects for water treatment in terms of enhancing gas liquid mass transfer improving the utilization of oxidizing free radicals and oxidizing capacity due to its characteristics fan et al 2020 li et al 2014 ma et al 2015 shi et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 yujing 2018 zhang et al 2020a most of the available review papers focus on a single kind of bubbles and very specific aspects such as mass transport stability theories ozonation etc table 1 much effort has been made on collecting and summarizing mnbs generation methods properties or applications using ozone air or oxygen in water and wastewater treatment agarwal et al 2011 alheshibri et al 2016 azevedo et al 2019 khuntia et al 2012 parmar and majumder 2013 shangguan et al 2018 sun et al 2016 tekile et al 2017 temesgen et al 2017 there is limited content on the upscaling of mnb applications to the industrial level mathematical modeling of contaminant removal and up to date analyses of the current challenges and future perspectives in this paper we provide a comprehensive review of fundamental topics including updates of the most recent research outcomes and guidelines for mnb characterization that are expected to be particularly helpful at the introductory level i e to researchers from related fields who started to gain interest in this fast growing field 2 what are the mnbs 2 1 definition of mnbs mnbs are minute gas bubbles with diameters on the order of micrometers and nanometers alheshibri et al 2016 li et al 2013a microbubbles mbs and nanobubbles nbs are tiny bubbles with a respective diameter of 1 μm and 1 μm approximately different researches will have different size ranges agarwal et al 2011 alheshibri et al 2016 atkinson et al 2019 fan et al 2020 hu and xia 2018 before 21st century due to the thermodynamic stability problem the existence of nbs was not widely accepted and caused a long term debate but in the recent years with the merging of new technologies such as dynamic light scattering acoustic spectroscopy electron microscopy etc more and more evidence accumulates to prove the existence and possible stability of nbs alheshibri and craig 2019 jadhav and barigou 2020 ushikubo et al 2010b yasui et al 2018 overall there are two kinds of nbs surface nbs at aqueous surface and bulk nbs in aqueous solution alheshibri et al 2016 the application of mnbs in environmental remediation and bioremediation has garnered recent attention owing to their special characteristics including large specific surface area negatively charged surface long residence time in water high mass transfer efficiency and the generation of highly reactive free radicals koshoridze and levin 2019 li et al 2014 qian et al 2019 rosa and rubio 2018 wang et al 2018 these studies showed that mnbs greatly augment remediation by accelerating the oxygen transfer process li et al 2013b 2 2 comparison with macrobubbles a critical factor in enhancing the efficiency of remediation of contaminated water is the transfer of a treatment substance e g oxygen into the water mass transfer coefficient the aerobic biodegradation capacity is related to the growth of site specific microorganisms which is significantly affected by the oxygen content in water song and katayama 2010 tanaka et al 2020 conventional air sparging techniques employ macrobubbles with diameters of millimeters or centimeters which have short residence times in groundwater and are inefficient for the oxygen transfer process leading to a small zone of influence zoi around bubbles and low activity of aerobic microorganism mass transfer coefficients for macrobubbles were found to be approximately constant whereas for mnbs less than 40 μm they increase with decreasing diameter hu et al 2010 skouteris et al 2020 thus making them a more effective technique li et al 2014 liu and tang 2019 mbs with a 30 μm radius were first identified in water by turner 1961 and they were found to exist for long periods of time similarly nbs also exist in water for longer periods and this stability can be attributed to an electrically charged liquid gas interface creating repulsion forces that prevent bubble coalescence nnb surfaces are negatively charged with an electric double layer and the external electrostatic pressure balances the internal laplace pressure nirmalkar et al 2018a 2018b ushikubo et al 2010b 2 3 the structure of mnbs mbs are enclosed by two concentric gas spheres fig 1 which are separated by a layer of water in between guo et al 2019 khuntia et al 2012 the gas phase may comprise a single gas or a combination of gases gas combinations generally create differentials in partial pressure and gas osmotic pressures which stabilize the bubbles the gas phase is enclosed by a liquid shell diffusion of gas out of mbs and the mechanical properties of mbs depend on the shell material the liquid phase is the external liquid surrounding the shell in which the bubble resides it can be the same as the shell material or it can be a surfactant or foaming agent depending upon the operations parmar and majumder 2013 for nbs fig 2 the system of gas and liquid can be assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at a certain fixed temperature and pressure the presence of ions in the bulk liquid constitutes an electric double layer and the adsorbed ions at the interface are expected to exert an external inward radial force due to coulomb interactions nirmalkar et al 2018b 3 methods for characterization of mnbs 3 1 size measurement for particle size there are many commercially available techniques dynamic light scattering same as photon correlation spectroscopy static light scattering electron microscopy scanning electron microscope atomic force microscopy laser scanners acoustic spectroscopy optical microscopy geisse 2009 hain et al 2019 image analysis etc among them the most common ones are dynamic light scattering atomic force microscopy and image analysis table 2 although atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy can provide the information about the material in nanometer scale electron microscopy is good at determining the composition of a material but for the operating environment atomic force microscopy can be used in a vacuum ambient gas or liquid environment whereas the electron microscopy is only suitable in a vacuum environment smith 2015 so the atomic force microscopy is more widely used for mnbs focusing on the nb characterization nb surface properties such as the shell thickness huang et al 2020c shafi et al 2019 even though the image analysis is widely employed to characterize mnb size it has some restrictions in usage such as a transparent barrier required to take an image high resolution and speed of cameras and a low concentration of bubble juwana et al 2019 li et al 2019a swart et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b in some studies the image analysis is combined with other techniques to increase the effectiveness of measurement bae et al 2020 juwana et al 2018 in more recent applications optical microscopy resolution is on the order of 200 500 nm which allows measurements on mbs but not nbs geisse 2009 huszka and gijs 2019 static and dynamic light scattering techniques study the structure and dynamics of scattering objects in solution static light scattering measures the angular distribution of the scattering intensity to infer structural information from objects in contrast dynamic light scattering is the extension of elastic light scattering to study inhomogeneous dynamic systems by measuring the fluctuations in scattered light intensities caused by brownian motion ahrer et al 2003 klemeshev et al 2016 park et al 2010 therefore dynamic light scattering is more common for mnb applications however this technique is an ensemble average approach which only provides the average particle size and associated distribution in addition it requires strong light scattering to calculate the scattered light intensities and does not inform bubble concentration the accuracy is only high for solid particles measurement not for mnbs to tackle these problems nanoparticle tracking analysis is utilized to analyze particle size and count midtvedt et al 2020 nanoparticle tracking analysis separately tracks the movement trajectory of each particle in the field of view to obtain the particle size information of each particle it has obvious advantage for small particles and weakly scattered sample particles especially for bulk nbs griffiths et al 2020 hu and xia 2018 thonglek et al 2019 3 2 zeta potential measurement the zeta potential is the electro kinetic potential in colloidal systems and it is an important bubble surface characteristic related to the stability of mnbs from a theoretical viewpoint zeta potential is the electric potential in the interfacial double layer of a dispersed particle or droplet versus a point in the continuous phase away from the interface clogston and patri 2011 wei lu and ping 2010 lower absolute zeta potential values will lead to aggregation coagulation or flocculation due to van der waals interparticle attraction jabra shnoudeh et al 2019 there are three methods for zeta potential determination of suspended particles single particle observation acoustical methods and electrophoretic light scattering single particle observation has the problem of interfering electro osmotic velocity due to the cell walls and a lower limit of particle size acoustical methods depend on the complex and not yet fully understood relations among acoustic and electroacoustic properties particle size distribution charge density and concentration because of their sensitivity accuracy and versatility electrophoretic light scattering is the best choice weiner and zhang 2013 xu 2008 electrophoretic light scattering applies an external electric field to the sample the charged particles in solution will move accordingly the velocity of the particles is measured by the interference of the scattered light with the help of laser doppler velocimetry using some appropriate theoretical models such as the henry function the zeta potential is determined from the electrophoretic mobility which can be calculated by the measured velocity and the amplitude of the electric field clogston and patri 2011 huang et al 2020a 3 3 other measurements except size and zeta potential there are many other properties of mnbs that may be of interest and which may be investigated by modifications and or combinations of different methods li et al 2019a b used a high speed camera at 125 fps equipped with a high magnification lens for bubble counting while bae et al 2020 employed a sony b01einfc5w model and a magnification lens sony fe 28 70 mm to observe bubble rising velocity in addition custom designed image analysis software can be used to quantify mb oscillation beekers et al 2020 the coalescence and movement of nbs on a graphene surface in water were investigated in detail by using the molecular dynamics simulation method li et al 2018 when cavitation occurs in bubble generation a characteristic high frequency noise is emitted such that cavitation inception could be measured using a microphone li et al 2019a a tensiometer and a raman spectrometer can be employed individually to find out surface tension and functional groups respectively zhang et al 2019 gas holdup fraction of micro bubbles is studied using dynamic gas disengagement analysis and image analysis bae et al 2020 combined atomic force microscopy afm and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy flim were conducted to localize the various interfaces and identify gas filled surface nbs rapidly hain et al 2019 a recent method known as nanoparticle tracking analysis nta employs infrared absorption spectroscopy in the multiple internal reflection geometry and afm to confirm the formation of nbs ma et al 2020 4 mnbs generation 4 1 selection of mnb generator when choosing a mnbs generator a number of factors have to be considered carefully first it is the working environment where the generator is used that is in a laboratory or outside e g in situ field application or in treatment plant if outside light weight portable generators are of interest while assuring that the capacity of bubbles production meets the projected needs for the expected volume of water to be treated when dealing with water containing pollutants sand screenings mud erosive chemical etc there are more challenges to overcome involving problems such as clogging cleaning and or erosion the second factor is the application research purpose and requirement diverse mnbs generators generate bubbles of various size and concentration ranges some studies focus on the characterization of a single bubble therefore they need to produce bubbles in a very low concentration and facilitate isolation of individual bubbles when investigating the features of bubbles with different sizes a key issue is the capability of being able to easily change the bubble size through the generator set up if the work requires high clean conditions the major consideration is on the prevention and removal of pollution from the bubble generator last but not least there is cost for batch experiment in most cases the set up of bubble generators is self made or assembled by the researchers the core parts would be purchased according to the principle of bubble generation in the market it is difficult to find a standardized generator for a specific application since most of the work is still at the research level and hence novel in the sense that they are meant to fill a knowledge gap in general bubble generators are currently expensive and hard to modify if the generator choice is related to mnbs application at a large scale the costs of electricity and maintenance should be considered 4 2 mnb generation techniques extensive research has been carried out on the ways in which mbs can be generated which is documented by a comprehensive review parmar and majumder 2013 although this paper reviewed the techniques or generators of mbs most of the techniques or generators if different working parameters are set can produce the nbs as well nowadays in their review the bubble generators are categorized by the characteristics of the applied technique which we summarize in table 3 here for convenience however in what follows we also provide a simpler classification depending on the main working principles of the techniques which can be hydrodynamic acoustic sonication electrochemical or mechanical agitation huang et al 2020b 4 2 1 hydrodynamic method the hydrodynamic method is based on the principle of cavitation which causes the formation of small vapor filled cavities i e bubbles where pressure in the liquid is sufficiently low agarwal et al 2011 an orifice plate or a venturi tube are the most common tools to create hydrodynamic cavitation the orifice type mb generator the multi fluid mixture device has an orifice in a flowing water tube in which the water is pressurized to introduce into the generator the difference in water velocity between the orifice and generator exit leads to the negative pressure at a small distance downstream of the orifice that negative pressure sucks the air through a stainless steel perforated pipe embedded in the flowing water tube which breaks the air into many mb by strong shear action sadatomi et al 2012 benny et al replaced the perforated steel pipe with a porous ceramic pipe which was made of a custom made plastic scaffold and nylon fibers rolled around the scaffold it enhanced the durability while also decreasing the production cost in addition it overcome the problems of other microbubble generators such as the difficulties to mix the spherical body in smaller generator and drill small holes pambudiarto et al 2020 sadatomi et al 2005 the venturi type of generator has three main components being a converging part a throat and a diverging part simple structure high reliability excellent efficiency and a wide range of potential applications are the benefits of venturi type generators huang et al 2020b stride and edirisinghe 2009 the venturi tube geometry has dominant impact on the local pressure and cavitation thereby controlling the bubble size and energy efficiency from the results of simulation and experiment the throat pressure and power consumption are significantly influenced by the outlet angle and the diameter ratio li et al 2019a venturi porous pipe mb generator combined venturi tube and porous pipe such that it may also be seen as a modification of the orifice type recent literature reviews considered ease of the manufacturing process and recommended certain inlet angle 20 and outlet angle 12 for the venturi porous pipe mb generator huang et al 2020b majid et al 2018 4 2 2 acoustic method most of the generators using the hydrodynamic method such as static mixer swirl liquid flow method etc involve a liquid pump for gas liquid two phase fluid such generators would require circulation between the generator and the water tank for many times therefore a longer operation time is needed to generate the mnbs due to complicated components hydrodynamic generators are relatively large acoustic bubble generators can overcome some drawbacks related to hydrodynamic methods morito and makuta 2018 numakura et al 2014 yasuda et al 2019 they are compact and simple in operation furthermore the acoustic techniques can make bubble generation free of contamination since the set up does not need a liquid pump compared with mechanical agitation see section 4 2 3 below the sonication presents better performance in surfactant systems having higher gas hold up smaller bubble size and larger interfacial area xu et al 2008 nbs of mode diameter between 90 and 100 nm were made by the ultrasonic irradiation experiments to water yasuda et al 2019 the results demonstrated that the ultrasonic irradiation not only generated nbs but also reduced nbs thereby approaching a certain bubble concentration in two kinds of water ultrapure water without nbs and water with a high nb concentration the concentration of nbs exponentially changed with time and converged to an equilibrium value yasuda et al 2019 the acoustic technique has great potential to control bubble size and bubble concentration with high accuracy however acoustic systems are more complicated than other techniques even if it is highly automatic and compact 4 2 3 mechanical agitation method mechanical agitation typically consists in stirring the liquid and bubble generation depends on the mixer s or homogenizer s speed it is less complex than other technologies but the bubble sizes are relatively large and inhomogeneous the acoustic method can create more homogenous and smaller mbs while the hydrodynamic method performs best for the generation of a large number of mbs at once yamaguchi et al 2018 consequently due to larger sizes and lower concentrations smaller gas hold up of bubbles generators using mechanical agitation are less efficient in terms of solvent extraction and mass transfer therefore it has increasingly lost its role as traditional method for bubble generation in the past daryabor et al 2017 shams et al 2016 xu et al 2008 zimmerman et al 2007 4 2 4 electrochemical method the electrochemical method is based on electrolysis where mnbs are generated on electrodes submerged in a surfactant solution during water electrolysis the flow of electric current through the water between the electrodes triggers redox reactions generating oxygen and hydrogen at the cathode and anode respectively surfactant is added into the solution to enhance mnb stability otherwise on a timescale 1 ms hong et al 2020 lucero et al 2017 maxwell 2020 svetovoy et al 2020 on a short time scale of 10 μs accompanying with a high relative super saturation high current causes homogenous nucleation of nbs these nbs aggregate to mbs with time which may be intensified by higher temperatures svetovoy et al 2013 the nacl concentration ph and electrode distance showed obvious influence on the mnbs generation by electrolysis while current density also exerted a great impact and was positively related to the bubble generation rate higher nacl content and shorter distance between electrodes significantly reduced the power requirement compared with other types of anodes iron stainless steel dimensionally sable anode aluminum anode is more efficient lucero et al 2017 results in situ study using a special designed single channel electrolyzer indicated that all the bubbles were produced at the interface between the proton exchange membrane and the electrode wire li et al 2019b an increasing flow velocity reduced the detachment diameter whereas a higher current density lead to stronger bubble coalescence li et al 2019b alternating polarity ap voltage pulses in water electrolysis generates a high concentration of bulk nbs 150 nm filled with h2 and o2 for larger ap pulse magnitudes mb 40 μm are generated the size grows to 300 μm and disappears completely in very short time this phenomenon can be explained by the spontaneous combustion of h2 and o2 postnikov et al 2018 2016 svetovoy et al 2020 2013 2011 tunable mb generators using electrolysis and ultrasound can produce stable mono dispersed mbs in pure water in this technology the inertial constraints of microfluidics are overcome and additional surfactants are avoided experimental results show that a feed back loop enables the generator to manipulate the bubble diameter easily over a wide range achaoui et al 2017 however the mnb collapse harmfully affects and erodes the surfaces of the electrodes causing pollutant from the electrodes into the solution moreover owing to the water electrolysis the generated mnb are filled with oxygen and hydrogen thus the explosion of hydrogen is a major threat to the operator and safety is a key issue if these gases accumulate in the working environment 4 2 5 other emerging methods recent developments in bubble generation is based on the combination or modification of different existing techniques they have the advantages of simple construction easy maintenance less energy consumption and smaller manufacture cost such methods include repeated compression of mbs jin et al 2019 layer by layer assembled slips aghdam et al 2019 nanosecond laser pulses fales et al 2019 sonic electrochemical method komaba and goto 2019 5 properties of mnbs and their controlling factors 5 1 bubble size the most studied property of air bubbles is bubble size based on the differences in their sizes bubbles are categorized as macrobubbles mbs and sub micron bubbles or nbs corresponding to conventional or big bubbles fine bubbles and ultrafine bubbles respectively bubble size ranges and their associated properties are summarized in table 4 agarwal et al 2011 pérez garibay et al 2012 tanaka et al 2020 temesgen et al 2017 xiao and xu 2020 bubble size is the most basic property of the mnbs because other properties derive from it a certain relationship was observed between the zeta potential of the nbs and their size zhang et al 2020b macrobubbles are strongly affected by buoyancy and rising velocity with a consequent lack of stability during measurements however for mnbs the longer residence time in the liquid makes measurements more feasible ushikubo et al 2010a bubble size is generally dynamic that is nbs can form after mbs shrinkage while nbs can coalesce to become mbs jin et al 2020 sangbeom kim et al 2018 there are many factors impacting bubble size including pressure fluid flow rate air flow rate the surface active agents surfactants frothers etc or electrolytes the size distributions of mbs and nbs are also affected by the design and operational conditions such as the pressure differences across the nozzle system of a generator kim et al 2012 higher pressure produces smaller bubbles because of an increase in air density and at pressures above approximately 3 5 atm the sizes of mbs are almost constant the mnb size is also affected by the injection rates of water and gas hu and xia 2018 moreover bubble size decreases when surfactant concentration or liquid flow rate are raised while it increases with increasing air pressure and flow rate the higher air pressure leads to larger inlet pressure at a cavitation tube therefore contributes to a larger energy dissipation and stronger turbulence it intensifies cavity collapse and results in bigger bubbles juwana et al 2018 majid et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a the addition of frothers chemical additives used in the flotation processes to facilitate generation of fine bubbles and reduce bubble coalescence and electrolyte solutions containing nacl and other salt ions also have a significant effect on reducing bubble size pérez garibay et al 2012 bubble size can further be reduced by retarding coalescence due to surface active agents azgomi et al 2007 the effect and trend of frother concentration on bubble size is similar at the low concentrations below the critical coalescence concentration the bubble size decreases significantly with increasing frother concentration while this dependence of bubble size disappears at the higher concentrations finch et al 2008 gupta et al 2007 zhang 2016 increasing the liquid flow rate causes higher jet velocity and more impact strength between the jet fluid and tube wall as a consequence it is easier to break the bubbles into smaller ones zhang et al 2020b the ph of solutions glucose edta dodab al3 fe3 or na has variable impact on the bubble size in some solution ph has relatively small impacts bui et al 2019 however there is a consistent decreasing tendency for nb size with increasing ph value in solution 50 mg l mibc surfactant using sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid to change the ph zhang et al 2020b with all other conditions equal the size of nbs using air oxygen ozone and nitrogen is also a function of gas solubility nitrogen with the lowest solubility generates the smallest bubbles whereas ozone with highest solubility created the largest ones meegoda et al 2018 there are other operational conditions affecting bubble size such as the length diameter and type of hose temesgen et al 2017 5 2 mass transfer efficiency mass transfer is the net movement of mass from one location to another caused by the existence of a certain driving force e g uneven substance concentration in the system ghassemi and shahidian 2017 the mass transfer process mainly includes the phenomenon of free diffusion of molecules in a laminar fluid and a stationary medium vortex mixing and diffusion in a turbulent fluid and mass transfer between gas and liquid phases based on fick s law and two film theory the mass transfer efficiency is proportional to the overall mass transfer coefficient including liquid and gas film coefficients the specific area surface area to volume ratio and concentration gradient the difference between the gas concentration in the liquid bulk phase and the gas saturation concentration in the liquid at the surface of the interface droste 1996 parmar and majumder 2013 it is challenging to calculate the specific area therefore the volumetric mass transfer coefficient is mostly applied as an effective parameter representing the product of the overall mass transfer coefficient and specific area to be more precise the bubble size bubble rising velocity specific area mixing pattern the reagents the chemicals or solutes physical properties all have essential impacts on the mass transfer efficiency using mbs with an average diameter of 110 μm the volumetric mass transfer coefficient was raised by a factor of 100 with respect to other common bubbles made by open tube needle aquatic sparger or industrial sparger baker et al 2016 equation 1 was proposed to estimate the specific area a as a function of gas holdup ε g and bubble diameter d b chisti 1989 1 a 6 ε g d b it assumed that bubbles have a simple spherical shape with one representative diameter and the gas holdup is dependent on the size of the bubble gas holdup ε g is defined as the volume fraction occupied by the bubble or gas in the entire gas liquid dispersion agarwal et al 2011 equation 1 states that the specific area tends to increase when bubble size decreases or gas holdup increases the surface area of mnbs is a significant factor determining the effectiveness of mnb technology in degrading contaminants as surface area relates to contaminant adsorption on the bubble surface yoshida et al 2008 gas holdup grows with frother concentration fig 3 and has a close relationship with bubble size and velocity azgomi et al 2007 moyo et al 2007 in the air kerosene and air water systems gas holdup was found to depend on pressure and can be predicted by the dynamic gas disengagement method bae et al 2020 owing to the decrease in surface tension and bubble coalescence reduction the rising velocity of bubbles and liquid mass transfer coefficient decrease with an increasing salt concentration the void fraction and volumetric mass transfer coefficient increase with superficial air velocity and salt concentration thus the orders of magnitude increase in interfacial area at high salt concentrations is the main cause of the high volumetric mass transfer coefficient values kawahara et al 2009 a theoretical model based on epstein and plesset theory expresses the mass transfer processes of oxygen and ozone mnbs in the contaminant treatment describing the fate of mnbs and proving the benefits of mnbs over the traditional bubbles the results showed that the increasing half life of dissolved gas raises mnbs lifetime but diminishes the mnb treatment impact for gas with a long half life and a slow consumption rate the influence of half life on the mnb life can be ignored epstein and plesset 1950 xia and hu 2019a an analytical model was applied to investigate the mass transfer and size change of a single bubble rising in stagnant water it showed good prediction accuracy considering the influence of changing dissolved gas concentration in the water and mass transfer across the water surface the mass transfer efficiency is proportional to the bubble release depth because of the longer bubble residence time and higher gas concentration gradient this model can be applied to continuously injected bubble swarms li et al 2020 compared with coarse bubbles aeration with nbs supplies more oxygen to aerobic biofilm systems presenting a 1 5 times higher oxygen transfer efficiency at lower cost xiao and xu 2020 in order to further increase the mass transfer efficiency gas agitation and or ultrasound can be applied to mnb solutions to cause bubble oscillation zhao et al 2018 5 3 bubble rising velocity the behavior of the bubbles in water or other liquid solution is strongly influenced by a parameter known as rising velocity the rising velocity of a mb through a liquid is determined by the balance of the buoyancy and drag forces acting on it in water the reynolds number of mbs is well below unity and the rising velocity u can be expressed by stokes law in terms of diameter of the bubble db density ρ l and viscosity of the water μ as expressed in equation 2 stokes 2009 tanaka et al 2020 hadamard and rybczynski developed stokes theory to express the case of a bubble or fluid drop clift et al 2005 2 u g d b 2 ρ l 18 μ a bubbles swarm with a diameter of 2 mm had 10 higher rising velocity than a single bubble nock 2015 with mbs generated by the pressurized dissolution method experiments showed that liquid and gas properties have crucial impact on the terminal rising velocity of mbs parmar and majumder 2015 theoretical also suggest important effects of gas molecular weight i e co2 air he and n2 on rising velocity parkinson et al 2008 azgomi et al 2007 reported that a decrease in bubble rising velocity is strongly associated with a decrease in bubble size resulting in a continuous increase in gas holdup in contaminated water dispersed particles and fibers would adhere to mbs and decrease their rising velocity haapala et al 2010 compared with the vertical velocity the bubble horizontal velocity has a small impact on mass transfer li et al 2020 surfactants are known to affect the rising velocity of bubbles their presence affects the surface tension on bubbles which causes a tangential shear stress on the bubble surface and decreases the rising velocity in the experiment of rising mbs in aqueous solutions of surfactant sds pluronic f68 or salt nacl the mbs followed rectilinear trajectories in both contaminated and uncontaminated liquids while the velocity of bubbles and drops were reduced by surfactants haapala et al 2010 tanaka et al 2020 due to the brownian motion and low buoyancy forces the mnbs rising velocity is small and consequently contributes to the stability of bubbles meegoda et al 2018 the rising velocity of nbs has similar or lower magnitudes than brownian motion li et al 2014 the mb 50 μm 150 μm rising velocity is not obviously different between saline water 0 44 mm s and freshwater 0 64 mm s fanaie and khiadani 2020 the terminal rising velocities of nbs using a no slip boundary condition are 6 12 nm s for a nb of radius equal to 50 nm and 612 nm s for radius 500 nm whereas the brownian velocities are 3131 nm s and 990 nm s respectively that means the brownian motion dominates the nbs behavior and against the impact of buoyancy alheshibri 2019 5 4 zeta potential zeta potential is the electric potential difference between the mobile dispersion medium and the stationary layer of the dispersion medium adhered to the dispersed particle its value has a close relationship with short and long term stability of emulsions or colloids wei lu and ping 2010 zeta potential of mnbs describes the charge characteristics of mnbs which affects their dispersion behavior high absolute values of zeta potential were found to prevent mnbs from coalescence thus improving their stability hu and xia 2018 the electrophoretic light scattering technique is widely used to find the mnbs zeta potential huang et al 2020a weiner and zhang 2013 xu 2008 there are many factors exerting influences on the zeta potential of bubbles such as ph of the solution gas ionic strength concentration of additives temperature etc wei lu and ping 2010 zeta potential of nbs emerges from the capacity of the gas to create hydroxyl ions at the bubble surface solutions with high ph low temperature and low salt concentrations facilitate high negative zeta potentials of bubbles with time the zeta potential of bubbles reduces in long term tests when the bubble size increase meegoda et al 2018 a series of studies table 5 showed that it is difficult to compare exact value of zeta potentials for mnbs with a certain gas as they use different methodologies however there are some overall tendencies kim et al 2019 the zeta potential of mnbs are negative in the water without additives or reagents for equal water conditions the zeta potentials of mbs are similar and independent of their size however in the process of shrinkage of mbs the gas water interface traps some excess ions which may increase the zeta potential hence during mbs collapse the zeta potential is negatively related to the bubble size takahashi et al 2007a the magnitude of negative surface charge of mnbs is proportional to the ph value mnb zeta potential is always negative in wide ph range at neutral ph zeta potentials are negative below 20 mv for most gases in an experiment using nonionic frother mibc when the ph value rose from 3 to 12 the nb s size reduced from 652 nm to 251 nm and its zeta potential reduced from a positive value to 9 mv that is due to the electrostatic repulsion ulatowski et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b negatively charged mbs can be generated by adding anionic surfactants like sodium dodecyl sulfate whereas cationic surfactants like dodecyl amine hydrochloride generate positively charged mbs a similar trend was observed when mbs were coated with polymer flocculants negative charge was enhanced when the mb was coated with anionic polyacrylamide solution while the charge changed from negative to positive when coated with cationic polyacrylamide solution parmar and majumder 2013 the absolute value of zeta potential shows an increasing trend when electrolyte such as nacl mgcl2 concentration increased due to its impact on the diffuse double layer of nbs temperature has an inversely proportional effect on zeta potential because higher temperatures enhance the mobility of ions and consequently reduce the hydroxyl ions attached on the bubble surface meegoda et al 2018 takahashi 2005 5 5 transport of mnbs in porous media the transport mechanism of mnbs in porous media has become a popular scientific topic since it has dominant impact on the performance of soil and groundwater treatment more insight of behavior of mnbs in soils can improve the remediation technologies based on mnbs hamamoto et al 2017 according to the geogas theory and darcy s law the velocity of mbs through dry porous media is proportional to the pressure gradient and permeability etiope and lombardi 1996 when the mbs move in water there is always bubble coalescence the nature of hydrodynamic boundary conditions at the gas liquid interface the hydrodynamic forces attractive van der waals lifshitz forces and bubble deformation exert an influence on bubble coalescence vakarelski et al 2010 the flow rate gas species particle size and ph value can influence the mnb transport in porous media lower flow rate in porous media increases the possibility of mnbs attachment in porous media this phenomenon may be attributed to the smaller drag force and larger stagnant regions at higher flow rates the particle size of a porous medium has negligible impact on mnb transport hamamoto et al 2016 compared with larger sized mnbs the smaller ones are more likely to retarded during transport hamamoto et al 2017 lower ph values increase the entrapment of nbs because of the chemical heterogeneity on the solid surface and physical straining of bubbles besides the reduced repulsive force between the solid and bubbles contributes to bubble attachment hamamoto et al 2018 for the flow of discrete mbs through a water saturated porous medium the characteristic width and breakthrough time of bubble plumes were proportional to the gas release rate with power exponents of 0 2 and 0 4 while the cross sectional averaged velocity of ambient pore water was related to the gas release rate with a power exponent of 0 6 ma et al 2015 5 6 hydroxyl radical in general with continuous shrinkage of bubbles below 10 μm the electric charge density of the double layer increases rapidly when the bubble bursts in aqueous solutions the positive and negative charges that have reached a very high concentration will instantly release the accumulated energy producing many free radical ions such as oxygen ions hydrogen ions hydroxide ions etc among them the hydroxyl radical has a strong oxidation effect which can oxidize and decompose some difficult to degrade organic pollutants such as phenol and has a good effect in purifying water liu et al 2012 takahashi et al 2007a mnbs can generate free radicals without any dynamic stimulus or additives but the free radicals are short lived many studies explore the role of the free radicals in the water treatment experimental results show that the hydroxyl radical can be the major 82 reactive oxidant species to degrade butylated hydroxytoluene bht by ozone mnbs achar et al 2020 klammler et al 2020 kwon et al 2020 takahashi et al 2007a xiong et al 2016 the ph value and gas type have essential influence on the production of hydroxyl radicals by mnbs it is well known that the elevated presence of hydroxide anions at high ph value is beneficial to the generation of hydroxyl radical however without accepted explanation today experiments have also shown the opposite effect that strongly acidic conditions due to the addition of hcl h2so4 and hno3 accelerate the production of hydroxyl radicals furthermore the gas type of mnbs also affects the quantity of free radicals created when mnbs burst li et al 2009 takahashi et al 2007b xiong et al 2016 hydroxyl radical scavenger such as sodium carbonate in the solution have negative effects on contaminant removal due to its large consumption of hydroxyl radicals in a laboratory batch experiment after 80 s with 15 25 and 30 mm of carbonate ions the removal of bht was decreased by 30 50 and 65 with respect to the same experiments conducted in the absence of carbonate ions achar et al 2020 jabesa and ghosh 2016 on the contrary there are some kinds of catalysts such as olive stone activated carbon copper mno2 coated fe3o4 etc which improve the generation of hydroxyl radicals for example adding olive stone activated carbon can accelerate the decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals kang et al 2019 li et al 2009 rajah et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 6 applications of mnbs in groundwater treatment mnbs have caught a lot of attention recently in groundwater pollution control this is due to their critical properties discussed above such as huge surface area to volume ratio high zeta potential good mass transfer etc particular methods involve air sparging to expel the volatile gases wang and zhang 2017 dissolved air floatation calgaroto et al 2016 2015 ebrahimi et al 2020 etchepare et al 2017 oliveira et al 2017 oxidation achar et al 2020 xia et al 2019 xia and hu 2019b and disinfection cruz and flores 2017 jhunkeaw et al 2020 saijai et al 2019 within these studies table 6 mnb with ozone are employed most frequently and possess a variety of existing or potential applications in groundwater remediation there is a wide variety of contaminants found in groundwater including synthetic organic chemicals hydrocarbons inorganic cations inorganic anions pathogens and radionuclides these pollutants come from anthropogenic and natural pollution sources the most common contamination sources are due to human activities such as municipal solid waste disposal use of fertilizer pesticides and insecticides industrial wastewater discharge petroleum production mining waste disposal nuclear waste disposal etc fetter et al 2017 talabi and kayode 2019 all these activities may cause contaminants to infiltrate the subsurface hereby not only the groundwater absorbs theses pollutants but also the geologic formation retains residual contaminants the latter usually lasts for a long time and becomes a persistent source for groundwater pollution 6 1 degradation of organic pollutants in groundwater with the economic development related to oil extraction agriculture wastewater discharge waste disposal and respective leakage events organic substances such as petroleum hydrocarbons organic chlorides and organic nitrogen have become major groundwater pollutants mnb technique can enhance the bioremediation and oxidation in groundwater to degrade the pollutants to non harmful or less toxic materials al raoush et al 2018 el alfy et al 2017 pérez lucas et al 2019 talabi and kayode 2019 pump and treat is one of the traditional groundwater remediation technologies and can be applied with the mnb technique li et al 2015 ammonia widely exists in the aqueous environment due to domestic and industrial wastewater and consumes dissolved oxygen in the water oxidation is one of the most common ways to remove ammonia compared with other methods such as biological denitrification air stripping or chlorination oxidation does not imply a complex series of denitrification reactions avoids air pollution and chlorine residuals and does not depend on the cultivation of bacteria in a pilot plant ozonation of ammonia using mb was very effective and superior to that of oxygen mbs ammonia is oxidized faster in higher ph or with catalyst bromide ions khuntia et al 2013 in pilot scale tests ozone mbs were applied to the continuous flow one synthetic and one real mine effluent to remove the ammonia the ammonia removal rate was up to 99 1 at a flow rate of 1 1 l min over 570 min that demonstrated the feasibility of larger scale treatment with ozone mbs ryskie et al 2020 wang and zhang studied the nitrogen removal efficiency and mechanism of deep subsurface wastewater infiltration systems by mnbs a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 4 was achieved by circulating mnb solution in the soil column saturated with simulated livestock wastewater wang and zhang 2017 synthetic phenolic antioxidants spas are the predominant plastic additives in our daily life and impose an environmental risk on surface water and groundwater due to their high industrial production large scale applications and toxicity butylated hydroxytoluene bht is one of the spas family and ubiquitous in nature from experiments conducted in a batch type reactor ozone mbs were found to degrade bht and reduce its toxicity it was shown that the oh created from ozone in water was the key 82 reactive oxidant species for the complete degradation of bht using zone mbs achar et al 2020 hahladakis et al 2018 in the oil production areas exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons tph is well known to deteriorate the quality of groundwater in laboratory experiments mb ozonation was used to enhance the efficiency of tph removal in sludge sample from a shanghai oil refinery the research indicated that 70 9 of tph could be degraded into more readily biodegradable intermediate products from oily sludge in 120 min with ph of 3 ozone dosage of 0 27 g o3 g ts and total solid of 2 being a green technology ozone mbs converted more heavy hydrocarbons to light fractions compared with macrobubble ozonation sun et al 2020 physical adsorption is not suitable for wastewater containing multiple pollutants and biological techniques are time consuming and greatly affected by the ambient conditions studies found that ozone mnbs were able to remediate contaminated groundwater with complex organic components even in the presence of high salinity concentration to which physical adsorption and biological methods are inefficient ozone mnbs had a remarkable performance for degradation of persistent organic contaminants such as benzene and chlorobenzene after 30 min of treatment xia and hu 2019b numerous applications using the mnbs with ozone to remove other organic pollutants methyl orange cod etc were conducted and showed that ozone mnbs have great prospect in groundwater treatment hu and xia 2018 2018 ikeura et al 2011 kwon et al 2020 nam et al 2019 takahashi et al 2012 zheng et al 2015 in reality there are many kinds of impurities or contaminants in polluted groundwater at the same time mine effluents for example contain cyanides cyanate thiocyanate and metals the mixture of which has adverse impact on treatment efficiency except for organic pollutants groundwater quality may be impacted by inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals or nitrate for example for these conditions mnbs with hydrogen may facilitate partial remediation eamrat et al 2020 kim and han 2020 6 2 pollutant removal in porous media thanks to large specific surface area long retention time and high oxygen transfer efficiency mnbs filled with air or oxygen improve the availability of dissolved oxygen in groundwater and as a result have a positive effect on the growth of aerobic microorganism one kind of the enhanced bioremediation uses a specific microorganism to absorb transform or degrade contaminations in porous media with the improved environmental conditions the growth and metabolism of microorganisms accelerate the degradation of harmful substances to reduce or eliminate groundwater pollution fetter et al 2017 kim et al 2016 li et al 2015 2013b as a carrier of oxygen mb suspension which consisted of saponin not only delivered oxygen but also transported microorganisms and micronutrients to the target area where environmental factors are limited in the batch scale study the saponin mbs in the retarded gas front helped bacteria to degrade about 30 of phenanthrene in 21 days park et al 2009 saponin based mbs successfully improved the aerobic biodegradation potential of organic pollutants in sand under an oxygen limiting environment choi et al 2009 the effect of surfactant solution and surfactant mb on bacteria transport in sand columns were also studied results show that bacterial hydrophobicity was changed due to the different surfactant but sand particles hydrophobicity did not alter for different surfactant a continuous supply of mbs can transport bacteria into the soil using a smaller quantity of surfactant higher porosity facilitates bacterial movement significantly in porous media tao 2018 oil spill contaminated sands can be treated by the self collapsing mbs based method related research demonstrated that mbs created in tap water removed almost all oils from the polluted sands in 40 min while in saline water it decreased to 90 because of the susceptibility of mbs to shrink in size when they finally collapse a high pressure spot develops and causes pressure waves these pressure waves remove the oil form the sand grain surface air mbs smaller than 50 μm showed more advantages compared with the other biological chemical and physical methods in terms of remediation efficiency and environmental protection agarwal et al 2016 sun et al 2019 in order to enhance the cleaning efficacy of mbs low intensity pulsed ultrasound high salinity and high temperature can be applied to diesel contaminated fine and medium sands agarwal and liu 2017 besides bioremediation and physical removal oxidation is another important method to remediate groundwater pollution as mentioned above ozone mnbs are a powerful oxidation technology and has received growing attention in recent years in most studies methyl orange was chosen as representative organic pollutants in the experiments due to its high visibility low cost and similarity to real organic contaminants in experiments different sizes of sandy soil are used including 35 50 70 100 150 200 and 200 300 meshes in the sandy soil column contaminated by 10 mg l methyl orange ozone mnbs achieved a removel rate of 99 showing an excellent cleaning performance liu et al 2018 hu and xia 2018 also conducted a column test made of glass beads and use ozone mnbs to decompose methyl orange as opposed to oxygen mnbs ozone mnbs can oxidize methyl orange this means that free radicals created from the mnb collapse have little effect on the removal of methyl orange furthermore in field tests at a tce contaminate site using ozone mnbs the tce concentration in the monitoring wells diminished significantly and the final removal rate reached 99 after 6 days compared with ozone mnbs and h2o2 the ozone mnbs plus h2o2 achieved the remediation target more quickly although h2o2 alone had low treatment efficacy for tce it enhanced the ozone mnb efficiency by a factor of 3 hu and xia 2018 kwon et al 2020 deployed decane as the representative napl and oil soluble fluorescence as tracer in bench scale experiments different combinations of treatments such as ozone sparging air mnb solution flushing ozone mnb solution flushing and ozone mnb solution flushing plus h2o2 are conducted and compared regarding the effect of hydroxyl free radicals on napl removal the results indicate that h2o2 helped the ozone mnbs increase the napl removal by 22 and oxidative degradation of napl only happened on the napl water interface owing to the reactivity of hydroxyl free radical when ozone mnb plus h2o2 are applied according to the end products of different treatment types the removal mechanisms depends on the oxidation agent and the state of oxidizing fluid kwon et al 2020 in addition mnbs are able to remediate the heavy metal contaminated soil due to the large surface area and high zeta potential nbs water has better removal rates than distilled water regardless of soil type jeong et al 2017 7 challenges and limitations of mnbs growing knowledge over the past decades gradually contributes to unveiling the mystery of mnbs thus preparing the stage for use of mnb techniques to solve various engineering problems including groundwater treatment however after this review of recent scientific contributions on mnbs properties and applications there are still significant challenges and limitations on the path to routine field industrial implementations 1 even though many laboratory studies showed great potential of mnb in water treatment there is little knowledge regarding the upscaling of methods and application of mnb at the industrial level therefore more field size experiments should be conducted for longer periods to evaluate efficiency and get the operational experience 2 a variety of techniques exist for mnb generation but bubble size and concentration are typically unstable and heterogeneous this hinders a deeper exploration of bulk mnb properties since it is hard to discern what portion of the bubbles contribute more to water treatment efficacy 3 many other characteristics of mnb liquid are unknown and explored such as heat transfer viscosity and hydraulic conductivity the high mass transfer efficiency is usually highlighted in a great number of studies while very few reveal other properties heat transfer of mnb is as important as the mass transfer since all bubble generators inevitably generate heat and temperature is a key factor for physical biological and chemical processes the hydraulic conductivity of porous media with respect to groundwater flow is highly affected by the presence of mnbs and plays a vital role in pollution control 4 modeling approaches of mnbs generation stability and reaction with pollutants are rare klammler et al 2020 modeling can help people to simulate and get better understanding about the mnb induced processes without experiments it can greatly reduce the design and operation cost when used for optimizing the process in addition theoretical mnb studies barely take the porous media into consideration improved models for transport chemical transformation and mass transfer coupled with porous media are needed 5 the synergistic and antagonistic interaction with microbial activities during application of mnb techniques are unknown many studies in the laboratory and some in the field have been conducted and confirmed the good effect on groundwater remediation due to the bioremediation and oxidation however there are many other kinds of microorganism which do not contribute the remediation but are important to local ecosystem mnb influence imposed on them is uncovered during treatment the groundwater containing mnbs filled with oxygen or ozone definitely affect the original organism underground which is the key player in local ecosystem because the polluted groundwater always needs a long treatment period the long term effect of mnb should be studied as well how the mnbs change the water environment how far the mnb transport and how the other microorganism interact with mnb are essential for the mnb application 6 a comprehensive cost benefit analysis approach is required even if mnb technologies are highly effective and environmentally friendly the development and practical application will be restricted if the cost benefit is high some investigations indicated mnb has lower cost than other methods rizaldi et al 2019 vion 2007 but there is not sufficient data for reliable quantification a comprehensive cost benefit analysis should cover the whole life of the mnb treatment system including the design construction training maintenance operation disposal etc moreover economic social and environmental analyses should be involved 8 conclusions mnbs are a promising technology that can be applied to enhance treatment effects in groundwater remediation this technology does not require complex treatment facilities and hence it has low design and operational cost compared to other physical and chemical remediation techniques shorter treatment period is required as mnbs increase the metabolism and enhance the bioremediation this technology consumes fewer chemicals and has a smaller adverse impact on ecosystems in this regard mnb technology is sustainable and its application has significant importance for future groundwater treatment because of mnbs excellent mass transfer efficiency high zeta potential relatively low rising velocity and stronger free radical generation ability however there are numerous challenges and limitations remaining for future research declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper acknowledgements this work was supported

12100,micro nano bubbles mnbs are minute bubbles with diameters on the micrometer and nanometer scale along with small size mnbs have a large specific surface area high zeta potential long residence times in water and high oxygen transfer efficiency these attributes make mnbs more effective than conventional macro bubbles in air sparging for groundwater remediation purposes this paper aims to review recent research on the generation and properties of mnbs and its implementation as a groundwater remediation technology the mnb generation techniques are categorized while the factors to choose bubble generators are analyzed methods for characterization of mnb properties including size and zeta potential are also summarized we further discuss properties and controlling factors of mnbs size mass transfer rising velocity zeta potential transport and generation of hydroxyl radicals in water we summarize recent findings related to the use of mnbs technologies for remediation of contaminated groundwater bodies finally the current challenges and limitations of mnbs application for groundwater remediation are discussed graphical abstract image 1 keywords micro nano bubbles generation properties groundwater remediation review 1 introduction air sparging is a groundwater remediation technique where a gas usually air is pumped into an area beneath the water table through a network of injection wells the injected air forces deep groundwater to circulate and aerates the water to removes volatiles furthermore the air sparging process enhances groundwater remediation as it provides increased amounts of oxygen for biodegradation interstate technology and regulatory council 2005 that relies on the process of mass transfer between the gas and liquid phase in combination with the phenomena of diffusion and mixing in the water droste 1996 elserwy 2019 in general air sparging targets sites where groundwater and or saturated soils are contaminated with volatile semi volatile and or non volatile aerobically biodegradable organic contaminants miller 1996 conventionally air bubbles with diameters in the range of 2 5 mm macrobubbles are employed however recent studies of water treatment with mnbs in the lab have shown that mnbs can increase the efficiency of mass transfer and produce higher dissolved oxygen concentrations chen et al 2008 eamrat et al 2020 jiang and wu 2011 suwartha et al 2020 advanced oxidation and ozonation technology is gaining more attention in water pollution control particularly the mnbs technology it has broad applications and prospects for water treatment in terms of enhancing gas liquid mass transfer improving the utilization of oxidizing free radicals and oxidizing capacity due to its characteristics fan et al 2020 li et al 2014 ma et al 2015 shi et al 2018 xiao et al 2018 yujing 2018 zhang et al 2020a most of the available review papers focus on a single kind of bubbles and very specific aspects such as mass transport stability theories ozonation etc table 1 much effort has been made on collecting and summarizing mnbs generation methods properties or applications using ozone air or oxygen in water and wastewater treatment agarwal et al 2011 alheshibri et al 2016 azevedo et al 2019 khuntia et al 2012 parmar and majumder 2013 shangguan et al 2018 sun et al 2016 tekile et al 2017 temesgen et al 2017 there is limited content on the upscaling of mnb applications to the industrial level mathematical modeling of contaminant removal and up to date analyses of the current challenges and future perspectives in this paper we provide a comprehensive review of fundamental topics including updates of the most recent research outcomes and guidelines for mnb characterization that are expected to be particularly helpful at the introductory level i e to researchers from related fields who started to gain interest in this fast growing field 2 what are the mnbs 2 1 definition of mnbs mnbs are minute gas bubbles with diameters on the order of micrometers and nanometers alheshibri et al 2016 li et al 2013a microbubbles mbs and nanobubbles nbs are tiny bubbles with a respective diameter of 1 μm and 1 μm approximately different researches will have different size ranges agarwal et al 2011 alheshibri et al 2016 atkinson et al 2019 fan et al 2020 hu and xia 2018 before 21st century due to the thermodynamic stability problem the existence of nbs was not widely accepted and caused a long term debate but in the recent years with the merging of new technologies such as dynamic light scattering acoustic spectroscopy electron microscopy etc more and more evidence accumulates to prove the existence and possible stability of nbs alheshibri and craig 2019 jadhav and barigou 2020 ushikubo et al 2010b yasui et al 2018 overall there are two kinds of nbs surface nbs at aqueous surface and bulk nbs in aqueous solution alheshibri et al 2016 the application of mnbs in environmental remediation and bioremediation has garnered recent attention owing to their special characteristics including large specific surface area negatively charged surface long residence time in water high mass transfer efficiency and the generation of highly reactive free radicals koshoridze and levin 2019 li et al 2014 qian et al 2019 rosa and rubio 2018 wang et al 2018 these studies showed that mnbs greatly augment remediation by accelerating the oxygen transfer process li et al 2013b 2 2 comparison with macrobubbles a critical factor in enhancing the efficiency of remediation of contaminated water is the transfer of a treatment substance e g oxygen into the water mass transfer coefficient the aerobic biodegradation capacity is related to the growth of site specific microorganisms which is significantly affected by the oxygen content in water song and katayama 2010 tanaka et al 2020 conventional air sparging techniques employ macrobubbles with diameters of millimeters or centimeters which have short residence times in groundwater and are inefficient for the oxygen transfer process leading to a small zone of influence zoi around bubbles and low activity of aerobic microorganism mass transfer coefficients for macrobubbles were found to be approximately constant whereas for mnbs less than 40 μm they increase with decreasing diameter hu et al 2010 skouteris et al 2020 thus making them a more effective technique li et al 2014 liu and tang 2019 mbs with a 30 μm radius were first identified in water by turner 1961 and they were found to exist for long periods of time similarly nbs also exist in water for longer periods and this stability can be attributed to an electrically charged liquid gas interface creating repulsion forces that prevent bubble coalescence nnb surfaces are negatively charged with an electric double layer and the external electrostatic pressure balances the internal laplace pressure nirmalkar et al 2018a 2018b ushikubo et al 2010b 2 3 the structure of mnbs mbs are enclosed by two concentric gas spheres fig 1 which are separated by a layer of water in between guo et al 2019 khuntia et al 2012 the gas phase may comprise a single gas or a combination of gases gas combinations generally create differentials in partial pressure and gas osmotic pressures which stabilize the bubbles the gas phase is enclosed by a liquid shell diffusion of gas out of mbs and the mechanical properties of mbs depend on the shell material the liquid phase is the external liquid surrounding the shell in which the bubble resides it can be the same as the shell material or it can be a surfactant or foaming agent depending upon the operations parmar and majumder 2013 for nbs fig 2 the system of gas and liquid can be assumed to be in thermodynamic equilibrium at a certain fixed temperature and pressure the presence of ions in the bulk liquid constitutes an electric double layer and the adsorbed ions at the interface are expected to exert an external inward radial force due to coulomb interactions nirmalkar et al 2018b 3 methods for characterization of mnbs 3 1 size measurement for particle size there are many commercially available techniques dynamic light scattering same as photon correlation spectroscopy static light scattering electron microscopy scanning electron microscope atomic force microscopy laser scanners acoustic spectroscopy optical microscopy geisse 2009 hain et al 2019 image analysis etc among them the most common ones are dynamic light scattering atomic force microscopy and image analysis table 2 although atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy can provide the information about the material in nanometer scale electron microscopy is good at determining the composition of a material but for the operating environment atomic force microscopy can be used in a vacuum ambient gas or liquid environment whereas the electron microscopy is only suitable in a vacuum environment smith 2015 so the atomic force microscopy is more widely used for mnbs focusing on the nb characterization nb surface properties such as the shell thickness huang et al 2020c shafi et al 2019 even though the image analysis is widely employed to characterize mnb size it has some restrictions in usage such as a transparent barrier required to take an image high resolution and speed of cameras and a low concentration of bubble juwana et al 2019 li et al 2019a swart et al 2020 zhang et al 2020b in some studies the image analysis is combined with other techniques to increase the effectiveness of measurement bae et al 2020 juwana et al 2018 in more recent applications optical microscopy resolution is on the order of 200 500 nm which allows measurements on mbs but not nbs geisse 2009 huszka and gijs 2019 static and dynamic light scattering techniques study the structure and dynamics of scattering objects in solution static light scattering measures the angular distribution of the scattering intensity to infer structural information from objects in contrast dynamic light scattering is the extension of elastic light scattering to study inhomogeneous dynamic systems by measuring the fluctuations in scattered light intensities caused by brownian motion ahrer et al 2003 klemeshev et al 2016 park et al 2010 therefore dynamic light scattering is more common for mnb applications however this technique is an ensemble average approach which only provides the average particle size and associated distribution in addition it requires strong light scattering to calculate the scattered light intensities and does not inform bubble concentration the accuracy is only high for solid particles measurement not for mnbs to tackle these problems nanoparticle tracking analysis is utilized to analyze particle size and count midtvedt et al 2020 nanoparticle tracking analysis separately tracks the movement trajectory of each particle in the field of view to obtain the particle size information of each particle it has obvious advantage for small particles and weakly scattered sample particles especially for bulk nbs griffiths et al 2020 hu and xia 2018 thonglek et al 2019 3 2 zeta potential measurement the zeta potential is the electro kinetic potential in colloidal systems and it is an important bubble surface characteristic related to the stability of mnbs from a theoretical viewpoint zeta potential is the electric potential in the interfacial double layer of a dispersed particle or droplet versus a point in the continuous phase away from the interface clogston and patri 2011 wei lu and ping 2010 lower absolute zeta potential values will lead to aggregation coagulation or flocculation due to van der waals interparticle attraction jabra shnoudeh et al 2019 there are three methods for zeta potential determination of suspended particles single particle observation acoustical methods and electrophoretic light scattering single particle observation has the problem of interfering electro osmotic velocity due to the cell walls and a lower limit of particle size acoustical methods depend on the complex and not yet fully understood relations among acoustic and electroacoustic properties particle size distribution charge density and concentration because of their sensitivity accuracy and versatility electrophoretic light scattering is the best choice weiner and zhang 2013 xu 2008 electrophoretic light scattering applies an external electric field to the sample the charged particles in solution will move accordingly the velocity of the particles is measured by the interference of the scattered light with the help of laser doppler velocimetry using some appropriate theoretical models such as the henry function the zeta potential is determined from the electrophoretic mobility which can be calculated by the measured velocity and the amplitude of the electric field clogston and patri 2011 huang et al 2020a 3 3 other measurements except size and zeta potential there are many other properties of mnbs that may be of interest and which may be investigated by modifications and or combinations of different methods li et al 2019a b used a high speed camera at 125 fps equipped with a high magnification lens for bubble counting while bae et al 2020 employed a sony b01einfc5w model and a magnification lens sony fe 28 70 mm to observe bubble rising velocity in addition custom designed image analysis software can be used to quantify mb oscillation beekers et al 2020 the coalescence and movement of nbs on a graphene surface in water were investigated in detail by using the molecular dynamics simulation method li et al 2018 when cavitation occurs in bubble generation a characteristic high frequency noise is emitted such that cavitation inception could be measured using a microphone li et al 2019a a tensiometer and a raman spectrometer can be employed individually to find out surface tension and functional groups respectively zhang et al 2019 gas holdup fraction of micro bubbles is studied using dynamic gas disengagement analysis and image analysis bae et al 2020 combined atomic force microscopy afm and fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy flim were conducted to localize the various interfaces and identify gas filled surface nbs rapidly hain et al 2019 a recent method known as nanoparticle tracking analysis nta employs infrared absorption spectroscopy in the multiple internal reflection geometry and afm to confirm the formation of nbs ma et al 2020 4 mnbs generation 4 1 selection of mnb generator when choosing a mnbs generator a number of factors have to be considered carefully first it is the working environment where the generator is used that is in a laboratory or outside e g in situ field application or in treatment plant if outside light weight portable generators are of interest while assuring that the capacity of bubbles production meets the projected needs for the expected volume of water to be treated when dealing with water containing pollutants sand screenings mud erosive chemical etc there are more challenges to overcome involving problems such as clogging cleaning and or erosion the second factor is the application research purpose and requirement diverse mnbs generators generate bubbles of various size and concentration ranges some studies focus on the characterization of a single bubble therefore they need to produce bubbles in a very low concentration and facilitate isolation of individual bubbles when investigating the features of bubbles with different sizes a key issue is the capability of being able to easily change the bubble size through the generator set up if the work requires high clean conditions the major consideration is on the prevention and removal of pollution from the bubble generator last but not least there is cost for batch experiment in most cases the set up of bubble generators is self made or assembled by the researchers the core parts would be purchased according to the principle of bubble generation in the market it is difficult to find a standardized generator for a specific application since most of the work is still at the research level and hence novel in the sense that they are meant to fill a knowledge gap in general bubble generators are currently expensive and hard to modify if the generator choice is related to mnbs application at a large scale the costs of electricity and maintenance should be considered 4 2 mnb generation techniques extensive research has been carried out on the ways in which mbs can be generated which is documented by a comprehensive review parmar and majumder 2013 although this paper reviewed the techniques or generators of mbs most of the techniques or generators if different working parameters are set can produce the nbs as well nowadays in their review the bubble generators are categorized by the characteristics of the applied technique which we summarize in table 3 here for convenience however in what follows we also provide a simpler classification depending on the main working principles of the techniques which can be hydrodynamic acoustic sonication electrochemical or mechanical agitation huang et al 2020b 4 2 1 hydrodynamic method the hydrodynamic method is based on the principle of cavitation which causes the formation of small vapor filled cavities i e bubbles where pressure in the liquid is sufficiently low agarwal et al 2011 an orifice plate or a venturi tube are the most common tools to create hydrodynamic cavitation the orifice type mb generator the multi fluid mixture device has an orifice in a flowing water tube in which the water is pressurized to introduce into the generator the difference in water velocity between the orifice and generator exit leads to the negative pressure at a small distance downstream of the orifice that negative pressure sucks the air through a stainless steel perforated pipe embedded in the flowing water tube which breaks the air into many mb by strong shear action sadatomi et al 2012 benny et al replaced the perforated steel pipe with a porous ceramic pipe which was made of a custom made plastic scaffold and nylon fibers rolled around the scaffold it enhanced the durability while also decreasing the production cost in addition it overcome the problems of other microbubble generators such as the difficulties to mix the spherical body in smaller generator and drill small holes pambudiarto et al 2020 sadatomi et al 2005 the venturi type of generator has three main components being a converging part a throat and a diverging part simple structure high reliability excellent efficiency and a wide range of potential applications are the benefits of venturi type generators huang et al 2020b stride and edirisinghe 2009 the venturi tube geometry has dominant impact on the local pressure and cavitation thereby controlling the bubble size and energy efficiency from the results of simulation and experiment the throat pressure and power consumption are significantly influenced by the outlet angle and the diameter ratio li et al 2019a venturi porous pipe mb generator combined venturi tube and porous pipe such that it may also be seen as a modification of the orifice type recent literature reviews considered ease of the manufacturing process and recommended certain inlet angle 20 and outlet angle 12 for the venturi porous pipe mb generator huang et al 2020b majid et al 2018 4 2 2 acoustic method most of the generators using the hydrodynamic method such as static mixer swirl liquid flow method etc involve a liquid pump for gas liquid two phase fluid such generators would require circulation between the generator and the water tank for many times therefore a longer operation time is needed to generate the mnbs due to complicated components hydrodynamic generators are relatively large acoustic bubble generators can overcome some drawbacks related to hydrodynamic methods morito and makuta 2018 numakura et al 2014 yasuda et al 2019 they are compact and simple in operation furthermore the acoustic techniques can make bubble generation free of contamination since the set up does not need a liquid pump compared with mechanical agitation see section 4 2 3 below the sonication presents better performance in surfactant systems having higher gas hold up smaller bubble size and larger interfacial area xu et al 2008 nbs of mode diameter between 90 and 100 nm were made by the ultrasonic irradiation experiments to water yasuda et al 2019 the results demonstrated that the ultrasonic irradiation not only generated nbs but also reduced nbs thereby approaching a certain bubble concentration in two kinds of water ultrapure water without nbs and water with a high nb concentration the concentration of nbs exponentially changed with time and converged to an equilibrium value yasuda et al 2019 the acoustic technique has great potential to control bubble size and bubble concentration with high accuracy however acoustic systems are more complicated than other techniques even if it is highly automatic and compact 4 2 3 mechanical agitation method mechanical agitation typically consists in stirring the liquid and bubble generation depends on the mixer s or homogenizer s speed it is less complex than other technologies but the bubble sizes are relatively large and inhomogeneous the acoustic method can create more homogenous and smaller mbs while the hydrodynamic method performs best for the generation of a large number of mbs at once yamaguchi et al 2018 consequently due to larger sizes and lower concentrations smaller gas hold up of bubbles generators using mechanical agitation are less efficient in terms of solvent extraction and mass transfer therefore it has increasingly lost its role as traditional method for bubble generation in the past daryabor et al 2017 shams et al 2016 xu et al 2008 zimmerman et al 2007 4 2 4 electrochemical method the electrochemical method is based on electrolysis where mnbs are generated on electrodes submerged in a surfactant solution during water electrolysis the flow of electric current through the water between the electrodes triggers redox reactions generating oxygen and hydrogen at the cathode and anode respectively surfactant is added into the solution to enhance mnb stability otherwise on a timescale 1 ms hong et al 2020 lucero et al 2017 maxwell 2020 svetovoy et al 2020 on a short time scale of 10 μs accompanying with a high relative super saturation high current causes homogenous nucleation of nbs these nbs aggregate to mbs with time which may be intensified by higher temperatures svetovoy et al 2013 the nacl concentration ph and electrode distance showed obvious influence on the mnbs generation by electrolysis while current density also exerted a great impact and was positively related to the bubble generation rate higher nacl content and shorter distance between electrodes significantly reduced the power requirement compared with other types of anodes iron stainless steel dimensionally sable anode aluminum anode is more efficient lucero et al 2017 results in situ study using a special designed single channel electrolyzer indicated that all the bubbles were produced at the interface between the proton exchange membrane and the electrode wire li et al 2019b an increasing flow velocity reduced the detachment diameter whereas a higher current density lead to stronger bubble coalescence li et al 2019b alternating polarity ap voltage pulses in water electrolysis generates a high concentration of bulk nbs 150 nm filled with h2 and o2 for larger ap pulse magnitudes mb 40 μm are generated the size grows to 300 μm and disappears completely in very short time this phenomenon can be explained by the spontaneous combustion of h2 and o2 postnikov et al 2018 2016 svetovoy et al 2020 2013 2011 tunable mb generators using electrolysis and ultrasound can produce stable mono dispersed mbs in pure water in this technology the inertial constraints of microfluidics are overcome and additional surfactants are avoided experimental results show that a feed back loop enables the generator to manipulate the bubble diameter easily over a wide range achaoui et al 2017 however the mnb collapse harmfully affects and erodes the surfaces of the electrodes causing pollutant from the electrodes into the solution moreover owing to the water electrolysis the generated mnb are filled with oxygen and hydrogen thus the explosion of hydrogen is a major threat to the operator and safety is a key issue if these gases accumulate in the working environment 4 2 5 other emerging methods recent developments in bubble generation is based on the combination or modification of different existing techniques they have the advantages of simple construction easy maintenance less energy consumption and smaller manufacture cost such methods include repeated compression of mbs jin et al 2019 layer by layer assembled slips aghdam et al 2019 nanosecond laser pulses fales et al 2019 sonic electrochemical method komaba and goto 2019 5 properties of mnbs and their controlling factors 5 1 bubble size the most studied property of air bubbles is bubble size based on the differences in their sizes bubbles are categorized as macrobubbles mbs and sub micron bubbles or nbs corresponding to conventional or big bubbles fine bubbles and ultrafine bubbles respectively bubble size ranges and their associated properties are summarized in table 4 agarwal et al 2011 pérez garibay et al 2012 tanaka et al 2020 temesgen et al 2017 xiao and xu 2020 bubble size is the most basic property of the mnbs because other properties derive from it a certain relationship was observed between the zeta potential of the nbs and their size zhang et al 2020b macrobubbles are strongly affected by buoyancy and rising velocity with a consequent lack of stability during measurements however for mnbs the longer residence time in the liquid makes measurements more feasible ushikubo et al 2010a bubble size is generally dynamic that is nbs can form after mbs shrinkage while nbs can coalesce to become mbs jin et al 2020 sangbeom kim et al 2018 there are many factors impacting bubble size including pressure fluid flow rate air flow rate the surface active agents surfactants frothers etc or electrolytes the size distributions of mbs and nbs are also affected by the design and operational conditions such as the pressure differences across the nozzle system of a generator kim et al 2012 higher pressure produces smaller bubbles because of an increase in air density and at pressures above approximately 3 5 atm the sizes of mbs are almost constant the mnb size is also affected by the injection rates of water and gas hu and xia 2018 moreover bubble size decreases when surfactant concentration or liquid flow rate are raised while it increases with increasing air pressure and flow rate the higher air pressure leads to larger inlet pressure at a cavitation tube therefore contributes to a larger energy dissipation and stronger turbulence it intensifies cavity collapse and results in bigger bubbles juwana et al 2018 majid et al 2018 zhang et al 2020a the addition of frothers chemical additives used in the flotation processes to facilitate generation of fine bubbles and reduce bubble coalescence and electrolyte solutions containing nacl and other salt ions also have a significant effect on reducing bubble size pérez garibay et al 2012 bubble size can further be reduced by retarding coalescence due to surface active agents azgomi et al 2007 the effect and trend of frother concentration on bubble size is similar at the low concentrations below the critical coalescence concentration the bubble size decreases significantly with increasing frother concentration while this dependence of bubble size disappears at the higher concentrations finch et al 2008 gupta et al 2007 zhang 2016 increasing the liquid flow rate causes higher jet velocity and more impact strength between the jet fluid and tube wall as a consequence it is easier to break the bubbles into smaller ones zhang et al 2020b the ph of solutions glucose edta dodab al3 fe3 or na has variable impact on the bubble size in some solution ph has relatively small impacts bui et al 2019 however there is a consistent decreasing tendency for nb size with increasing ph value in solution 50 mg l mibc surfactant using sodium hydroxide and hydrochloric acid to change the ph zhang et al 2020b with all other conditions equal the size of nbs using air oxygen ozone and nitrogen is also a function of gas solubility nitrogen with the lowest solubility generates the smallest bubbles whereas ozone with highest solubility created the largest ones meegoda et al 2018 there are other operational conditions affecting bubble size such as the length diameter and type of hose temesgen et al 2017 5 2 mass transfer efficiency mass transfer is the net movement of mass from one location to another caused by the existence of a certain driving force e g uneven substance concentration in the system ghassemi and shahidian 2017 the mass transfer process mainly includes the phenomenon of free diffusion of molecules in a laminar fluid and a stationary medium vortex mixing and diffusion in a turbulent fluid and mass transfer between gas and liquid phases based on fick s law and two film theory the mass transfer efficiency is proportional to the overall mass transfer coefficient including liquid and gas film coefficients the specific area surface area to volume ratio and concentration gradient the difference between the gas concentration in the liquid bulk phase and the gas saturation concentration in the liquid at the surface of the interface droste 1996 parmar and majumder 2013 it is challenging to calculate the specific area therefore the volumetric mass transfer coefficient is mostly applied as an effective parameter representing the product of the overall mass transfer coefficient and specific area to be more precise the bubble size bubble rising velocity specific area mixing pattern the reagents the chemicals or solutes physical properties all have essential impacts on the mass transfer efficiency using mbs with an average diameter of 110 μm the volumetric mass transfer coefficient was raised by a factor of 100 with respect to other common bubbles made by open tube needle aquatic sparger or industrial sparger baker et al 2016 equation 1 was proposed to estimate the specific area a as a function of gas holdup ε g and bubble diameter d b chisti 1989 1 a 6 ε g d b it assumed that bubbles have a simple spherical shape with one representative diameter and the gas holdup is dependent on the size of the bubble gas holdup ε g is defined as the volume fraction occupied by the bubble or gas in the entire gas liquid dispersion agarwal et al 2011 equation 1 states that the specific area tends to increase when bubble size decreases or gas holdup increases the surface area of mnbs is a significant factor determining the effectiveness of mnb technology in degrading contaminants as surface area relates to contaminant adsorption on the bubble surface yoshida et al 2008 gas holdup grows with frother concentration fig 3 and has a close relationship with bubble size and velocity azgomi et al 2007 moyo et al 2007 in the air kerosene and air water systems gas holdup was found to depend on pressure and can be predicted by the dynamic gas disengagement method bae et al 2020 owing to the decrease in surface tension and bubble coalescence reduction the rising velocity of bubbles and liquid mass transfer coefficient decrease with an increasing salt concentration the void fraction and volumetric mass transfer coefficient increase with superficial air velocity and salt concentration thus the orders of magnitude increase in interfacial area at high salt concentrations is the main cause of the high volumetric mass transfer coefficient values kawahara et al 2009 a theoretical model based on epstein and plesset theory expresses the mass transfer processes of oxygen and ozone mnbs in the contaminant treatment describing the fate of mnbs and proving the benefits of mnbs over the traditional bubbles the results showed that the increasing half life of dissolved gas raises mnbs lifetime but diminishes the mnb treatment impact for gas with a long half life and a slow consumption rate the influence of half life on the mnb life can be ignored epstein and plesset 1950 xia and hu 2019a an analytical model was applied to investigate the mass transfer and size change of a single bubble rising in stagnant water it showed good prediction accuracy considering the influence of changing dissolved gas concentration in the water and mass transfer across the water surface the mass transfer efficiency is proportional to the bubble release depth because of the longer bubble residence time and higher gas concentration gradient this model can be applied to continuously injected bubble swarms li et al 2020 compared with coarse bubbles aeration with nbs supplies more oxygen to aerobic biofilm systems presenting a 1 5 times higher oxygen transfer efficiency at lower cost xiao and xu 2020 in order to further increase the mass transfer efficiency gas agitation and or ultrasound can be applied to mnb solutions to cause bubble oscillation zhao et al 2018 5 3 bubble rising velocity the behavior of the bubbles in water or other liquid solution is strongly influenced by a parameter known as rising velocity the rising velocity of a mb through a liquid is determined by the balance of the buoyancy and drag forces acting on it in water the reynolds number of mbs is well below unity and the rising velocity u can be expressed by stokes law in terms of diameter of the bubble db density ρ l and viscosity of the water μ as expressed in equation 2 stokes 2009 tanaka et al 2020 hadamard and rybczynski developed stokes theory to express the case of a bubble or fluid drop clift et al 2005 2 u g d b 2 ρ l 18 μ a bubbles swarm with a diameter of 2 mm had 10 higher rising velocity than a single bubble nock 2015 with mbs generated by the pressurized dissolution method experiments showed that liquid and gas properties have crucial impact on the terminal rising velocity of mbs parmar and majumder 2015 theoretical also suggest important effects of gas molecular weight i e co2 air he and n2 on rising velocity parkinson et al 2008 azgomi et al 2007 reported that a decrease in bubble rising velocity is strongly associated with a decrease in bubble size resulting in a continuous increase in gas holdup in contaminated water dispersed particles and fibers would adhere to mbs and decrease their rising velocity haapala et al 2010 compared with the vertical velocity the bubble horizontal velocity has a small impact on mass transfer li et al 2020 surfactants are known to affect the rising velocity of bubbles their presence affects the surface tension on bubbles which causes a tangential shear stress on the bubble surface and decreases the rising velocity in the experiment of rising mbs in aqueous solutions of surfactant sds pluronic f68 or salt nacl the mbs followed rectilinear trajectories in both contaminated and uncontaminated liquids while the velocity of bubbles and drops were reduced by surfactants haapala et al 2010 tanaka et al 2020 due to the brownian motion and low buoyancy forces the mnbs rising velocity is small and consequently contributes to the stability of bubbles meegoda et al 2018 the rising velocity of nbs has similar or lower magnitudes than brownian motion li et al 2014 the mb 50 μm 150 μm rising velocity is not obviously different between saline water 0 44 mm s and freshwater 0 64 mm s fanaie and khiadani 2020 the terminal rising velocities of nbs using a no slip boundary condition are 6 12 nm s for a nb of radius equal to 50 nm and 612 nm s for radius 500 nm whereas the brownian velocities are 3131 nm s and 990 nm s respectively that means the brownian motion dominates the nbs behavior and against the impact of buoyancy alheshibri 2019 5 4 zeta potential zeta potential is the electric potential difference between the mobile dispersion medium and the stationary layer of the dispersion medium adhered to the dispersed particle its value has a close relationship with short and long term stability of emulsions or colloids wei lu and ping 2010 zeta potential of mnbs describes the charge characteristics of mnbs which affects their dispersion behavior high absolute values of zeta potential were found to prevent mnbs from coalescence thus improving their stability hu and xia 2018 the electrophoretic light scattering technique is widely used to find the mnbs zeta potential huang et al 2020a weiner and zhang 2013 xu 2008 there are many factors exerting influences on the zeta potential of bubbles such as ph of the solution gas ionic strength concentration of additives temperature etc wei lu and ping 2010 zeta potential of nbs emerges from the capacity of the gas to create hydroxyl ions at the bubble surface solutions with high ph low temperature and low salt concentrations facilitate high negative zeta potentials of bubbles with time the zeta potential of bubbles reduces in long term tests when the bubble size increase meegoda et al 2018 a series of studies table 5 showed that it is difficult to compare exact value of zeta potentials for mnbs with a certain gas as they use different methodologies however there are some overall tendencies kim et al 2019 the zeta potential of mnbs are negative in the water without additives or reagents for equal water conditions the zeta potentials of mbs are similar and independent of their size however in the process of shrinkage of mbs the gas water interface traps some excess ions which may increase the zeta potential hence during mbs collapse the zeta potential is negatively related to the bubble size takahashi et al 2007a the magnitude of negative surface charge of mnbs is proportional to the ph value mnb zeta potential is always negative in wide ph range at neutral ph zeta potentials are negative below 20 mv for most gases in an experiment using nonionic frother mibc when the ph value rose from 3 to 12 the nb s size reduced from 652 nm to 251 nm and its zeta potential reduced from a positive value to 9 mv that is due to the electrostatic repulsion ulatowski et al 2019 zhang et al 2020b negatively charged mbs can be generated by adding anionic surfactants like sodium dodecyl sulfate whereas cationic surfactants like dodecyl amine hydrochloride generate positively charged mbs a similar trend was observed when mbs were coated with polymer flocculants negative charge was enhanced when the mb was coated with anionic polyacrylamide solution while the charge changed from negative to positive when coated with cationic polyacrylamide solution parmar and majumder 2013 the absolute value of zeta potential shows an increasing trend when electrolyte such as nacl mgcl2 concentration increased due to its impact on the diffuse double layer of nbs temperature has an inversely proportional effect on zeta potential because higher temperatures enhance the mobility of ions and consequently reduce the hydroxyl ions attached on the bubble surface meegoda et al 2018 takahashi 2005 5 5 transport of mnbs in porous media the transport mechanism of mnbs in porous media has become a popular scientific topic since it has dominant impact on the performance of soil and groundwater treatment more insight of behavior of mnbs in soils can improve the remediation technologies based on mnbs hamamoto et al 2017 according to the geogas theory and darcy s law the velocity of mbs through dry porous media is proportional to the pressure gradient and permeability etiope and lombardi 1996 when the mbs move in water there is always bubble coalescence the nature of hydrodynamic boundary conditions at the gas liquid interface the hydrodynamic forces attractive van der waals lifshitz forces and bubble deformation exert an influence on bubble coalescence vakarelski et al 2010 the flow rate gas species particle size and ph value can influence the mnb transport in porous media lower flow rate in porous media increases the possibility of mnbs attachment in porous media this phenomenon may be attributed to the smaller drag force and larger stagnant regions at higher flow rates the particle size of a porous medium has negligible impact on mnb transport hamamoto et al 2016 compared with larger sized mnbs the smaller ones are more likely to retarded during transport hamamoto et al 2017 lower ph values increase the entrapment of nbs because of the chemical heterogeneity on the solid surface and physical straining of bubbles besides the reduced repulsive force between the solid and bubbles contributes to bubble attachment hamamoto et al 2018 for the flow of discrete mbs through a water saturated porous medium the characteristic width and breakthrough time of bubble plumes were proportional to the gas release rate with power exponents of 0 2 and 0 4 while the cross sectional averaged velocity of ambient pore water was related to the gas release rate with a power exponent of 0 6 ma et al 2015 5 6 hydroxyl radical in general with continuous shrinkage of bubbles below 10 μm the electric charge density of the double layer increases rapidly when the bubble bursts in aqueous solutions the positive and negative charges that have reached a very high concentration will instantly release the accumulated energy producing many free radical ions such as oxygen ions hydrogen ions hydroxide ions etc among them the hydroxyl radical has a strong oxidation effect which can oxidize and decompose some difficult to degrade organic pollutants such as phenol and has a good effect in purifying water liu et al 2012 takahashi et al 2007a mnbs can generate free radicals without any dynamic stimulus or additives but the free radicals are short lived many studies explore the role of the free radicals in the water treatment experimental results show that the hydroxyl radical can be the major 82 reactive oxidant species to degrade butylated hydroxytoluene bht by ozone mnbs achar et al 2020 klammler et al 2020 kwon et al 2020 takahashi et al 2007a xiong et al 2016 the ph value and gas type have essential influence on the production of hydroxyl radicals by mnbs it is well known that the elevated presence of hydroxide anions at high ph value is beneficial to the generation of hydroxyl radical however without accepted explanation today experiments have also shown the opposite effect that strongly acidic conditions due to the addition of hcl h2so4 and hno3 accelerate the production of hydroxyl radicals furthermore the gas type of mnbs also affects the quantity of free radicals created when mnbs burst li et al 2009 takahashi et al 2007b xiong et al 2016 hydroxyl radical scavenger such as sodium carbonate in the solution have negative effects on contaminant removal due to its large consumption of hydroxyl radicals in a laboratory batch experiment after 80 s with 15 25 and 30 mm of carbonate ions the removal of bht was decreased by 30 50 and 65 with respect to the same experiments conducted in the absence of carbonate ions achar et al 2020 jabesa and ghosh 2016 on the contrary there are some kinds of catalysts such as olive stone activated carbon copper mno2 coated fe3o4 etc which improve the generation of hydroxyl radicals for example adding olive stone activated carbon can accelerate the decomposition of ozone into hydroxyl radicals kang et al 2019 li et al 2009 rajah et al 2019 xiong et al 2019 6 applications of mnbs in groundwater treatment mnbs have caught a lot of attention recently in groundwater pollution control this is due to their critical properties discussed above such as huge surface area to volume ratio high zeta potential good mass transfer etc particular methods involve air sparging to expel the volatile gases wang and zhang 2017 dissolved air floatation calgaroto et al 2016 2015 ebrahimi et al 2020 etchepare et al 2017 oliveira et al 2017 oxidation achar et al 2020 xia et al 2019 xia and hu 2019b and disinfection cruz and flores 2017 jhunkeaw et al 2020 saijai et al 2019 within these studies table 6 mnb with ozone are employed most frequently and possess a variety of existing or potential applications in groundwater remediation there is a wide variety of contaminants found in groundwater including synthetic organic chemicals hydrocarbons inorganic cations inorganic anions pathogens and radionuclides these pollutants come from anthropogenic and natural pollution sources the most common contamination sources are due to human activities such as municipal solid waste disposal use of fertilizer pesticides and insecticides industrial wastewater discharge petroleum production mining waste disposal nuclear waste disposal etc fetter et al 2017 talabi and kayode 2019 all these activities may cause contaminants to infiltrate the subsurface hereby not only the groundwater absorbs theses pollutants but also the geologic formation retains residual contaminants the latter usually lasts for a long time and becomes a persistent source for groundwater pollution 6 1 degradation of organic pollutants in groundwater with the economic development related to oil extraction agriculture wastewater discharge waste disposal and respective leakage events organic substances such as petroleum hydrocarbons organic chlorides and organic nitrogen have become major groundwater pollutants mnb technique can enhance the bioremediation and oxidation in groundwater to degrade the pollutants to non harmful or less toxic materials al raoush et al 2018 el alfy et al 2017 pérez lucas et al 2019 talabi and kayode 2019 pump and treat is one of the traditional groundwater remediation technologies and can be applied with the mnb technique li et al 2015 ammonia widely exists in the aqueous environment due to domestic and industrial wastewater and consumes dissolved oxygen in the water oxidation is one of the most common ways to remove ammonia compared with other methods such as biological denitrification air stripping or chlorination oxidation does not imply a complex series of denitrification reactions avoids air pollution and chlorine residuals and does not depend on the cultivation of bacteria in a pilot plant ozonation of ammonia using mb was very effective and superior to that of oxygen mbs ammonia is oxidized faster in higher ph or with catalyst bromide ions khuntia et al 2013 in pilot scale tests ozone mbs were applied to the continuous flow one synthetic and one real mine effluent to remove the ammonia the ammonia removal rate was up to 99 1 at a flow rate of 1 1 l min over 570 min that demonstrated the feasibility of larger scale treatment with ozone mbs ryskie et al 2020 wang and zhang studied the nitrogen removal efficiency and mechanism of deep subsurface wastewater infiltration systems by mnbs a total nitrogen removal efficiency of 85 4 was achieved by circulating mnb solution in the soil column saturated with simulated livestock wastewater wang and zhang 2017 synthetic phenolic antioxidants spas are the predominant plastic additives in our daily life and impose an environmental risk on surface water and groundwater due to their high industrial production large scale applications and toxicity butylated hydroxytoluene bht is one of the spas family and ubiquitous in nature from experiments conducted in a batch type reactor ozone mbs were found to degrade bht and reduce its toxicity it was shown that the oh created from ozone in water was the key 82 reactive oxidant species for the complete degradation of bht using zone mbs achar et al 2020 hahladakis et al 2018 in the oil production areas exposure to petroleum hydrocarbons tph is well known to deteriorate the quality of groundwater in laboratory experiments mb ozonation was used to enhance the efficiency of tph removal in sludge sample from a shanghai oil refinery the research indicated that 70 9 of tph could be degraded into more readily biodegradable intermediate products from oily sludge in 120 min with ph of 3 ozone dosage of 0 27 g o3 g ts and total solid of 2 being a green technology ozone mbs converted more heavy hydrocarbons to light fractions compared with macrobubble ozonation sun et al 2020 physical adsorption is not suitable for wastewater containing multiple pollutants and biological techniques are time consuming and greatly affected by the ambient conditions studies found that ozone mnbs were able to remediate contaminated groundwater with complex organic components even in the presence of high salinity concentration to which physical adsorption and biological methods are inefficient ozone mnbs had a remarkable performance for degradation of persistent organic contaminants such as benzene and chlorobenzene after 30 min of treatment xia and hu 2019b numerous applications using the mnbs with ozone to remove other organic pollutants methyl orange cod etc were conducted and showed that ozone mnbs have great prospect in groundwater treatment hu and xia 2018 2018 ikeura et al 2011 kwon et al 2020 nam et al 2019 takahashi et al 2012 zheng et al 2015 in reality there are many kinds of impurities or contaminants in polluted groundwater at the same time mine effluents for example contain cyanides cyanate thiocyanate and metals the mixture of which has adverse impact on treatment efficiency except for organic pollutants groundwater quality may be impacted by inorganic contaminants such as heavy metals or nitrate for example for these conditions mnbs with hydrogen may facilitate partial remediation eamrat et al 2020 kim and han 2020 6 2 pollutant removal in porous media thanks to large specific surface area long retention time and high oxygen transfer efficiency mnbs filled with air or oxygen improve the availability of dissolved oxygen in groundwater and as a result have a positive effect on the growth of aerobic microorganism one kind of the enhanced bioremediation uses a specific microorganism to absorb transform or degrade contaminations in porous media with the improved environmental conditions the growth and metabolism of microorganisms accelerate the degradation of harmful substances to reduce or eliminate groundwater pollution fetter et al 2017 kim et al 2016 li et al 2015 2013b as a carrier of oxygen mb suspension which consisted of saponin not only delivered oxygen but also transported microorganisms and micronutrients to the target area where environmental factors are limited in the batch scale study the saponin mbs in the retarded gas front helped bacteria to degrade about 30 of phenanthrene in 21 days park et al 2009 saponin based mbs successfully improved the aerobic biodegradation potential of organic pollutants in sand under an oxygen limiting environment choi et al 2009 the effect of surfactant solution and surfactant mb on bacteria transport in sand columns were also studied results show that bacterial hydrophobicity was changed due to the different surfactant but sand particles hydrophobicity did not alter for different surfactant a continuous supply of mbs can transport bacteria into the soil using a smaller quantity of surfactant higher porosity facilitates bacterial movement significantly in porous media tao 2018 oil spill contaminated sands can be treated by the self collapsing mbs based method related research demonstrated that mbs created in tap water removed almost all oils from the polluted sands in 40 min while in saline water it decreased to 90 because of the susceptibility of mbs to shrink in size when they finally collapse a high pressure spot develops and causes pressure waves these pressure waves remove the oil form the sand grain surface air mbs smaller than 50 μm showed more advantages compared with the other biological chemical and physical methods in terms of remediation efficiency and environmental protection agarwal et al 2016 sun et al 2019 in order to enhance the cleaning efficacy of mbs low intensity pulsed ultrasound high salinity and high temperature can be applied to diesel contaminated fine and medium sands agarwal and liu 2017 besides bioremediation and physical removal oxidation is another important method to remediate groundwater pollution as mentioned above ozone mnbs are a powerful oxidation technology and has received growing attention in recent years in most studies methyl orange was chosen as representative organic pollutants in the experiments due to its high visibility low cost and similarity to real organic contaminants in experiments different sizes of sandy soil are used including 35 50 70 100 150 200 and 200 300 meshes in the sandy soil column contaminated by 10 mg l methyl orange ozone mnbs achieved a removel rate of 99 showing an excellent cleaning performance liu et al 2018 hu and xia 2018 also conducted a column test made of glass beads and use ozone mnbs to decompose methyl orange as opposed to oxygen mnbs ozone mnbs can oxidize methyl orange this means that free radicals created from the mnb collapse have little effect on the removal of methyl orange furthermore in field tests at a tce contaminate site using ozone mnbs the tce concentration in the monitoring wells diminished significantly and the final removal rate reached 99 after 6 days compared with ozone mnbs and h2o2 the ozone mnbs plus h2o2 achieved the remediation target more quickly although h2o2 alone had low treatment efficacy for tce it enhanced the ozone mnb efficiency by a factor of 3 hu and xia 2018 kwon et al 2020 deployed decane as the representative napl and oil soluble fluorescence as tracer in bench scale experiments different combinations of treatments such as ozone sparging air mnb solution flushing ozone mnb solution flushing and ozone mnb solution flushing plus h2o2 are conducted and compared regarding the effect of hydroxyl free radicals on napl removal the results indicate that h2o2 helped the ozone mnbs increase the napl removal by 22 and oxidative degradation of napl only happened on the napl water interface owing to the reactivity of hydroxyl free radical when ozone mnb plus h2o2 are applied according to the end products of different treatment types the removal mechanisms depends on the oxidation agent and the state of oxidizing fluid kwon et al 2020 in addition mnbs are able to remediate the heavy metal contaminated soil due to the large surface area and high zeta potential nbs water has better removal rates than distilled water regardless of soil type jeong et al 2017 7 challenges and limitations of mnbs growing knowledge over the past decades gradually contributes to unveiling the mystery of mnbs thus preparing the stage for use of mnb techniques to solve various engineering problems including groundwater treatment however after this review of recent scientific contributions on mnbs properties and applications there are still significant challenges and limitations on the path to routine field industrial implementations 1 even though many laboratory studies showed great potential of mnb in water treatment there is little knowledge regarding the upscaling of methods and application of mnb at the industrial level therefore more field size experiments should be conducted for longer periods to evaluate efficiency and get the operational experience 2 a variety of techniques exist for mnb generation but bubble size and concentration are typically unstable and heterogeneous this hinders a deeper exploration of bulk mnb properties since it is hard to discern what portion of the bubbles contribute more to water treatment efficacy 3 many other characteristics of mnb liquid are unknown and explored such as heat transfer viscosity and hydraulic conductivity the high mass transfer efficiency is usually highlighted in a great number of studies while very few reveal other properties heat transfer of mnb is as important as the mass transfer since all bubble generators inevitably generate heat and temperature is a key factor for physical biological and chemical processes the hydraulic conductivity of porous media with respect to groundwater flow is highly affected by the presence of mnbs and plays a vital role in pollution control 4 modeling approaches of mnbs generation stability and reaction with pollutants are rare klammler et al 2020 modeling can help people to simulate and get better understanding about the mnb induced processes without experiments it can greatly reduce the design and operation cost when used for optimizing the process in addition theoretical mnb studies barely take the porous media into consideration improved models for transport chemical transformation and mass transfer coupled with porous media are needed 5 the synergistic and antagonistic interaction with microbial activities during application of mnb techniques are unknown many studies in the laboratory and some in the field have been conducted and confirmed the good effect on groundwater remediation due to the bioremediation and oxidation however there are many other kinds of microorganism which do not contribute the remediation but are important to local ecosystem mnb influence imposed on them is uncovered during treatment the groundwater containing mnbs filled with oxygen or ozone definitely affect the original organism underground which is the key player in local ecosystem because the polluted groundwater always needs a long treatment period the long term effect of mnb should be studied as well how the mnbs change the water environment how far the mnb transport and how the other microorganism interact with mnb are essential for the mnb application 6 a comprehensive cost benefit analysis approach is required even if mnb technologies are highly effective and environmentally friendly the development and practical application will be restricted if the cost benefit is high some investigations indicated mnb has lower cost than other methods rizaldi et al 2019 vion 2007 but there is not sufficient data for reliable quantification a comprehensive cost benefit analysis should cover the whole life of the mnb treatment system including the design construction training maintenance operation disposal etc moreover economic social and environmental analyses should be involved 8 conclusions mnbs are a promising technology that can be applied to enhance treatment effects in groundwater remediation this technology does not require complex treatment facilities and hence it has low design and operational cost compared to other physical and chemical remediation techniques shorter treatment period is required as mnbs increase the metabolism and enhance the bioremediation this technology consumes fewer chemicals and has a smaller adverse impact on ecosystems in this regard mnb technology is sustainable and its application has significant importance for future groundwater treatment because of mnbs excellent mass transfer efficiency high zeta potential relatively low rising velocity and stronger free radical generation ability however there are numerous challenges and limitations remaining for future research declaration of competing interest the authors

water quality has been of great concern as it is the most critical environmental issue worldwide the evaluation of water quality has become a priority for ensuring public health and safety many countries have begun to carry out water quality measurements and monitoring of imminent water shortages a large amount of collected data complicates interpretation immensely necessitating the development of a water quality index for the determination of the quality of the water body abbasi and abbasi 2012 there have been various definitions of water quality index however in a nutshell the water quality index is considered as a form of average derived by relating a set of variables to a standard scale and combining them into a single number darapu and chandra sekhar 2011 the water

of the environment ccme khan et al 2004 intending to create a means of communicating water quality issues to scientists decision makers and stakeholders ccme 2014 since the birth of the concept of the

must be regarded as good where ccme wqi classifies it as bad per its statistical factors therefore this research performs a modification of ccme wqi called the modified canadian water quality index mcwqi this new water quality index has mostly the same behavior as ccme wqi but is better in situations where the statistical factors misrepresent the reality 2 canadian water quality index ccme wqi as reported by rocchini and swain 1995 the british columbia ministry of environment lands and parks developed an index which has been adopted for use by some provinces including manitoba in 1997 the canadian council of ministers of the environment modified the british colombia wqi for creating a ccme wqi which could be applied by many water agencies in various countries with slight modification ccme wqi provides a straightforward mathematical framework for aggregating the final index value that helps users to evaluate the condition for the health of a water body tirkey et al 2013 there is no sub index generation weights establishing and conventional index aggregation involved according to ccme ccme 2014 the ccme wqi is based on three significant factors scope frequency and magnitude to produce a single unitless number that represents overall water quality relative to the benchmark chosen the result is represented as a single unitless number ranging between 0 and 100 where 100 indicates that the variables are similar or below the selected benchmarks tirkey et al 2013 in brief the equation is calculated using the three factors as follows f1 scope represents the number of variables whose objectives are not met failed variables relative to the total number of variables measured f 1 n u m b e r o f f a i l e d v a r i a b l e t o t a l n u m b e r o f v a r i a b l e 100 f2 frequency represents the frequency by which the objectives are not met failed tests f 2 n u m b e r o f f a i l e d t e s t t o t a l n u m b e r o f t e s t 100 f3 amplitude represents the amount by which the objectives are not met f 3 is calculated in three steps the relative deviation that an individual concentration is higher than or less than when the objective is a minimum the objective is termed an excursion and is expressed as follows in ccme 2001 when the test value must not exceed the objective e x c u r s i o n i f a i l e d t e s t v a l u e i o b j e c t i v e j 1 for the cases in which the test value must not fall below the objective e x c u r s i o n i o b j e c t i v e j f a i l e d t e s t v a l u e i 1 the index i enumerates the excursion respectively the corresponding failed test values quality parameters may have a lower and an upper objective for example ph therefore the objectives have their enumeration by j in the above definition the aggregate amount by which individual tests are out of compliance is calculated by summing the excursions of individual tests from their objectives and dividing by the total number of tests both those meeting objectives and those not meeting objectives this variable is referred to as the normalized sum of excursions or nse and is calculated as n s e i 1 n e x c u r s i o n i o f t e s t s f3 is then calculated by an asymptotic function that scales the normalized sum of the excursions from objectives nse to yield a number in the 0 100 range f 3 n s e 0 01 n s e 0 01 n s e n s e 1 100 f3 is monotonically increasing concerning nse once the factors are obtained the index itself can be calculated by c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 732 the constant 1 732 is a scaling factor 3 to ensure that the index varies between 0 and 100 the index can be used both for tracking changes at one site over time and for comparisons among sites khan et al 2004 the wqi values are between 0 and 100 and the range 0 100 is divided into five quality classes as shown in table 1 3 critical analysis of ccme wqi in general the ccme wqi is flexible concerning the type and number of water parameters to be tested in a period and the type of water body tested ccme wqi compares observations to a benchmark instead of normalizing observed values to subjective rating curves where the benchmark may be a water quality standard or site specific background concentration ccme 2011 khan et al 2004 lumb et al 2006 ccme wqi does not work with specific variables objectives and periods and indeed could vary from region to region depending on local conditions and issues khan et al 2004 the index users do not need an expert committee to define weights for averages or sub indices sub indices are not generated in ccme wqi the flexibility makes ccme wqi attractive and well applied by the water agencies in different countries with little modification however ccme wqi has also been pointed out by some researchers to exhibit sensitivities in statistical meaning the calculation of the ccme wqi requires at least four samples ccme 2011 however the maximum number of variables or samples is not specified the selection of appropriate water quality variables for a particular region is necessary for the index to yield meaningful results choosing a small number of variables for which the objectives are not met will provide a different picture than if a large number of variables are considered only some of which do not meet objectives it is up to the professional judgment of the user to determine which and how many variables should be included in the ccme wqi to most adequately summarize water quality in a particular region moreover the definition of ccme wqi leads to the impression that each parameter is treated in the same way ignoring interactive effects of different substances in the water resource e g the interaction of the effect of increased sodium or chloride and the effect of lead or mercury increase in drinking water however ccme wqi is based on a regulation e g a drinking water regulation a regulation is violated if any of the quality parameters are out of regulation in this way all parameters are treated equally by the regulation the equalizing of mutual reinforcement effects of individual parameters is a question of the design of the regulation and must be done by the regulation ccme wqi does not answer the question of whether water generally has good quality it measures more the degree of violation of the regulation in concern over a period using the three aspects scope frequency and amplitude the fact that ccme wqi treats all quality parameters in the same manner is justified by the use of a regulation that equalizes the effects of mutual reinforcement of individual parameters if a wqi generation is based on sub indices without reference to any regulation the effects of mutual interactions of quality parameters must be treated explicitly e g by the use of weights or other suitable features in wqi generation the author has researched wqi generation by sub indices in detail a surprising result is that the quality class of a water sample is known independently of the wqi in concern when the measured values mapped to the lower bound of a quality class are given by a regulation namely the quality class of the worst sub index value the wqi must then respect this a priori quality classification the discussion about ambiguity eclipsing insensitivity to individual parameters of a wqi shows that a board of experts gives a quality classification that often does not meet the feeling of water administrators for a wqi with a regulation based quality classification the author has introduced a simple mathematical adjustment procedure called balancing that will be published later 3 1 behaviors of ccme wqi the strange behavior of ccme wqi due to factor f1 in practical applications raised many discussions ccme has asked the consulting agency gartner and lee ccme 2006 to find the solution to this problem the study of gartner and lee produced results that assessed the sensitivities of ccme wqi quantitatively to the number of parameters parameter selection number of measurements objective selection procedure it proposed two alternative formulations of f1 which are more correlated with all three factors the reformulations of f1 proposed by gartner lee limited reflect the following scenarios 3 1 1 scenario 1 f 1 f 1 a f 1 b 2 where f1a number of failed variables total number of variables 100 same as the current formulation of f1 f1b number of samples showing values that exceed guidelines or objectives total number of samples 100 3 1 2 scenario 2 f 1 f 1 a i f f 2 10 f 1 0 5 f 1 a i f f 2 10 where f1a number of failed variables total number of variables 100 same as the current formulation of f1 f2 total number of failed tests total number of tests 100 the formulation of f1 proposed by them produced the index most evenly correlated with all factors while the second alternative formulation of f1 tended to provide the highest wqi values and rankings however the problem remains the same in both scenarios the effect of f1 has at least half of the responsibility relative to ccme wqi according to gartner and lee the second formulation of f1 discounts occasional exceedances of guidelines if the frequency of exceedance within the index calculation period is less than or equal to 10 the current f1 formulation is divided by 2 ccme wqi in its original form is used further the problems caused by f1 and f2 are presented in a new way in order to find a better solution 3 2 pathological memory effect of ccme wqi it can be seen from the ccme wqi formula that f1 can only lead to the worse while f2 f3 can improve the assessment when water quality gets better with time therefore the importance of f1 in the ccme wqi assessment becomes questionable this behavior of f1 gave rise to some apprehension towards the use of ccme wqi the ccme wqi supports the evaluation of wqi for a set of samples over more extended periods in the case of making an evaluation with ccme wqi over the years where in the first year each component had at any point in time a bad test and after this year from second year onwards there are no bad tests the ccme wqi value can be estimated as follows in the relative comparison to the factor f1 c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 3 100 f 1 2 3 if in the considered period or region all components have at least one bad test then f1 100 and c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 3 100 100 2 3 43 ccme wqi is expected to be good throughout the period however because f1 100 it follows that w q i 43 the badness of the components in the first year will never be forgotten it can be revealed from the example that the factor f1 is intended to determine the scope of guideline exceedances f1 increases with the number of measured parameters that exceed their water quality objectives during the index periods at least one time which in this research is called pathological memory effect 3 3 strange behaviour of ccme wqi due to f2 if all tests are bad we have f1 f2 100 even if the failures are minimal f3 0 we get c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 3 100 100 2 100 2 0 2 3 18 36 the two factors f1 and f2 show that whether the water quality is under control however in this case where the violations of regulation are negligible water quality itself is not bad f1 and f2 have overestimated the need for water quality control 4 modified canadian water quality index 4 1 definition of mcwqi the inherent mathematical problems of the ccme wqi method render it ill suited for a variety of situations namely those in which the pathological memory effect the above mentioned strange behaviors as well as the resulting overestimated need for water quality control even if the water quality is sufficient take place therefore it is pertinent that a modification of the ccme wqi that minimizes these issues be created the generation of a wqi function is a priority not a mathematical problem it depends highly on the perception of water quality based on this perception it makes sense to decide the particular choice of a common type the arithmetic average used to define the mean contribution of each part of an object the geometric mean used to obtain the consensus of the different views of an object regarding the discussion from the previous section ccme wqi has a pathological memory effect due to the factor f1 scope in ccme wqi each factor adds its contribution to the index value and does not compensate for the proportion of other factors the expression f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 3 is the euclidean length of a vector with the three coordinates 1 3 f 1 1 3 f 2 and 1 3 f 3 a cartesian coordinate system has orthogonal independent axes the use of f1 f2 and f3 as coordinates of vectors is not correct because the use of coordinates requires free variable coordinates however there are dependencies f1 0 implies f2 0 and f3 0 in the same manner f2 0 implies f1 0 and f3 0 f3 0 implies f1 0 and f2 0 this purely mathematical argument shows that the euclidean length is not the most suitable model water quality is defined by the collection of excursions in the considered period therefore it is obvious to consider this collection thoroughly and the factors f1 f2 f3 as different viewpoints to the entire group see fig 1 as a rule of thumb this suggests the use of geometric mean a more practical argument is that the effort of gartner and lee ccme 2006 to save the plus sign in the formula of ccme wqi did not change the situation radically following this idea a new wqi is proposed based on the modification of ccme wqi using multiplication and geometric mean from this point on the modified wqi will be called as modified canadian water quality index mcwqi the essential idea of mcwqi is considering the factors f1 f2 f3 as different viewpoints of water quality the equation of mcwqi is written below mcwqi 100 f 1 f 2 f 3 1 3 alternatively in another way of writing mcwqi 100 f 1 f 2 f 3 3 as can be seen from the equation of mcwqi the factors f2 and f3 smoothen the memory effect of ccme wqi in the same manner f3 when tending to 0 smoothens the effect of f1 and f2 in the pathological situations where ccme wqi underestimates water quality due to f1 and f2 mcwqi has a significantly higher value than ccme wqi because it has a smaller memory the mcwqi considers different viewpoints of water quality f1 f2 and f3 by finding a compromise among these perceptions different views of the same thing may have dependencies the mcwqi produces typically results that are different from those of the current ccme wqi therefore the value classification needs to be adjusted in order to be suitable for the new method of water quality indexing fortunately the quality ranking of the ccme is suitable for mcwqi the following properties justify this if f1 f2 f3 f then mcwqi f1 f2 f3 ccme wqi f1 f2 f3 100 f for all factors f continuity of both index functions mcwqi reflects the perception of water quality better than ccme wqi in the case of good water quality but inadequate water control for completeness sake it is stated that always ccme wqi mcwqi it is well known mathematically that the geometrical mean of three numbers is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean of these numbers f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 3 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 3 the square root on both sides leads to f 1 f 2 f 3 3 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 3 hence 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 3 100 f 1 f 2 f 3 3 4 2 mcwqi for a single parameter as mentioned above the usage of ccme wqi requires a set of at least four samples therefore it is impossible to calculate the most critical parameter by ccme wqi for the use of balancing the applicability of mcwqi must also extend to situations with a single parameter in the case when only one quality parameter has been measured for at least two samples in a body of water the index calculation includes only the two factors f2 and f3 and is performed in the same manner as that of three factors this is justified by the following reasons which show that f1 depends on f3 and f2 does not depend on f3 if f3 0 then no violation of the regulation hence f1 0 if f3 0 then at least one bad quality parameter exists because there is only one bad quality parameter this implies f1 100 f2 is needed because there is more than one sample it is not to say that whether there is only one sample with a failed test or whether there are multiple samples with failed tests applied to the mcwqi this means in the case where there is one quality variable in a sample series of at least two samples the alternative formula is s mcwqi 100 f 2 f 3 this formula is applicable for the cases of mcwqi with one quality parameter and more than one sample and by similar reasoning for one sample with more than one quality parameter a similar argumentation can be applied to ccme wqi s c c m e w q i 100 f 2 2 f 3 2 2 5 example the following example modified from the example in ccme wqi guidance illuminates the memory effect of f1 it uses a simplified data set from the north saskatchewan river at devon alberta ccme 2001 this example includes ten variables namely dissolved oxygen ph total phosphorus total nitrogen fecal coliform bacteria arsenic lead mercury 2 4 d and lindane see table 2 three factors are combined to calculate the ccme wqi and mcwqi f1 scope f2 frequency and f3 amplitude scope in this example there are ten variables do ph tp tn fc as pb hg 2 4 d and lindane during the index period all of them failed their respective objective at least once f 1 n u m b e r o f f a i l e d v a r i a b l e t o t a l n u m b e r o f

its objective or less than its objective or at different times possibly both in this example the failed test of do and ph are less than the objective the other failed tests are greater than the

wqi defines water quality as poor for the considered period due to the pathological memory effect 6 conclusions the ccme wqi was developed as a tool to assess and report water quality information to both management institutions and the public ccme 2014 this method allows flexibility to select parameters so that the index users can easily modify and adapt it according to local conditions and issues as first ccme wqi has been developed to evaluate surface water for the protection of aquatic life by specific guidelines later several studies have applied this for various purposes e g

produce a single unitless number that represents overall water quality relative to the benchmark chosen the result is represented as a single unitless number ranging between 0 and 100 where 100 indicates that the variables are similar or below the selected benchmarks tirkey et al 2013 in brief the equation is calculated using the three factors as follows f1 scope represents the number of variables whose objectives are not met failed variables relative to the total number of variables measured f 1 n u m b e r o f f a i l e d v a r i a b l e t o t a l n u m b e r o f v a r i a b l e 100 f2 frequency represents the frequency by which the objectives are not met failed tests f 2 n u m b e r o f f a i l e d t e s t t o t a l n u m b e r o f t e s t 100 f3 amplitude represents the amount by which the objectives are not met f 3 is calculated in three steps the relative deviation that an individual concentration is higher than or less than when the objective is a minimum the objective is termed an excursion and is expressed as follows in ccme 2001 when the test value must not exceed the objective e x c u r s i o n i f a i l e d t e s t v a l u e i o b j e c t i v e j 1 for the cases in which the test value must not fall below the objective e x c u r s i o n i o b j e c t i v e j f a i l e d t e s t v a l u e i 1 the index i enumerates the excursion respectively the corresponding failed test values quality parameters may have a lower and an upper objective for example ph therefore the objectives have their enumeration by j in the above definition the aggregate amount by which individual tests are out of compliance is calculated by summing the excursions of individual tests from their objectives and dividing by the total number of tests both those meeting objectives and those not meeting objectives this variable is referred to as the normalized sum of excursions or nse and is calculated as n s e i 1 n e x c u r s i o n i o f t e s t s f3 is then calculated by an asymptotic function that scales the normalized sum of the excursions from objectives nse to yield a number in the 0 100 range f 3 n s e 0 01 n s e 0 01 n s e n s e 1 100 f3 is monotonically increasing concerning nse once the factors are obtained the index itself can be calculated by c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 732 the constant 1 732 is a scaling factor 3 to ensure that the index varies between 0 and 100 the index can be used both for tracking changes at one site over time and for comparisons among sites khan et al 2004 the wqi values are between 0 and 100 and the range 0 100 is divided into five quality classes as shown in table 1 3 critical analysis of ccme wqi in general the ccme wqi is flexible concerning the type and number of water parameters to be tested in a period and the type of water body tested ccme wqi compares observations to a benchmark instead of normalizing observed values to subjective rating curves where the benchmark may be a water quality standard or site specific background concentration ccme 2011 khan et al 2004 lumb et al 2006 ccme wqi does not work with specific variables objectives and periods and indeed could vary from region to region depending on local conditions and issues khan et al 2004 the index users do not need an expert committee to define weights for averages or sub indices sub indices are not generated in ccme wqi the flexibility makes ccme wqi attractive and well applied by the water agencies in different countries with little modification however ccme wqi has also been pointed out by some researchers to exhibit sensitivities in statistical meaning the calculation of the ccme wqi requires at least four samples ccme 2011 however the maximum number of variables or samples is not specified the selection of appropriate water quality variables for a particular region is necessary for the index to yield meaningful results choosing a small number of variables for which the objectives are not met will provide a different picture than if a large number of variables are considered only some of which do not meet objectives it is up to the professional judgment of the user to determine which and how many variables should be included in the ccme wqi to most adequately summarize water quality in a particular region moreover the definition of ccme wqi leads to the impression that each parameter is treated in the same way ignoring interactive effects of different substances in the water resource e g the interaction of the effect of increased sodium or chloride and the effect of lead or mercury increase in drinking water however ccme wqi is based on a regulation e g a drinking water regulation a regulation is violated if any of the quality parameters are out of regulation in this way all parameters are treated equally by the regulation the equalizing of mutual reinforcement effects of individual parameters is a question of the design of the regulation and must be done by the regulation ccme wqi does not answer the question of whether water generally has good quality it measures more the degree of violation of the regulation in concern over a period using the three aspects scope frequency and amplitude the fact that ccme wqi treats all quality parameters in the same manner is justified by the use of a regulation that equalizes the effects of mutual reinforcement of individual parameters if a wqi generation is based on sub indices without reference to any regulation the effects of mutual interactions of quality parameters must be treated explicitly e g by the use of weights or other suitable features in wqi generation the author has researched wqi generation by sub indices in detail a surprising result is that the quality class of a water sample is known independently of the wqi in concern when the measured values mapped to the lower bound of a quality class are given by a regulation namely the quality class of the worst sub index value the wqi must then respect this a priori quality classification the discussion about ambiguity eclipsing insensitivity to individual parameters of a wqi shows that a board of experts gives a quality classification that often does not meet the feeling of water administrators for a wqi with a regulation based quality classification the author has introduced a simple mathematical adjustment procedure called balancing that will be published later 3 1 behaviors of ccme wqi the strange behavior of ccme wqi due to factor f1 in practical applications raised many discussions ccme has asked the consulting agency gartner and lee ccme 2006 to find the solution to this problem the study of gartner and lee produced results that assessed the sensitivities of ccme wqi quantitatively to the number of parameters parameter selection number of measurements objective selection procedure it proposed two alternative formulations of f1 which are more correlated with all three factors the reformulations of f1 proposed by gartner lee limited reflect the following scenarios 3 1 1 scenario 1 f 1 f 1 a f 1 b 2 where f1a number of failed variables total number of variables 100 same as the current formulation of f1 f1b number of samples showing values that exceed guidelines or objectives total number of samples 100 3 1 2 scenario 2 f 1 f 1 a i f f 2 10 f 1 0 5 f 1 a i f f 2 10 where f1a number of failed variables total number of variables 100 same as the current formulation of f1 f2 total number of failed tests total number of tests 100 the formulation of f1 proposed by them produced the index most evenly correlated with all factors while the second alternative formulation of f1 tended to provide the highest wqi values and rankings however the problem remains the same in both scenarios the effect of f1 has at least half of the responsibility relative to ccme wqi according to gartner and lee the second formulation of f1 discounts occasional exceedances of guidelines if the frequency of exceedance within the index calculation period is less than or equal to 10 the current f1 formulation is divided by 2 ccme wqi in its original form is used further the problems caused by f1 and f2 are presented in a new way in order to find a better solution 3 2 pathological memory effect of ccme wqi it can be seen from the ccme wqi formula that f1 can only lead to the worse while f2 f3 can improve the assessment when water quality gets better with time therefore the importance of f1 in the ccme wqi assessment becomes questionable this behavior of f1 gave rise to some apprehension towards the use of ccme wqi the ccme wqi supports the evaluation of wqi for a set of samples over more extended periods in the case of making an evaluation with ccme wqi over the years where in the first year each component had at any point in time a bad test and after this year from second year onwards there are no bad tests the ccme wqi value can be estimated as follows in the relative comparison to the factor f1 c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 3 100 f 1 2 3 if in the considered period or region all components have at least one bad test then f1 100 and c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 3 100 100 2 3 43 ccme wqi is expected to be good throughout the period however because f1 100 it follows that w q i 43 the badness of the components in the first year will never be forgotten it can be revealed from the example that the factor f1 is intended to determine the scope of guideline exceedances f1 increases with the number of measured parameters that exceed their water quality objectives during the index periods at least one time which in this research is called pathological memory effect 3 3 strange behaviour of ccme wqi due to f2 if all tests are bad we have f1 f2 100 even if the failures are minimal f3 0 we get c c m e w q i 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 3 100 100 2 100 2 0 2 3 18 36 the two factors f1 and f2 show that whether the water quality is under control however in this case where the violations of regulation are negligible water quality itself is not bad f1 and f2 have overestimated the need for water quality control 4 modified canadian water quality index 4 1 definition of mcwqi the inherent mathematical problems of the ccme wqi method render it ill suited for a variety of situations namely those in which the pathological memory effect the above mentioned strange behaviors as well as the resulting overestimated need for water quality control even if the water quality is sufficient take place therefore it is pertinent that a modification of the ccme wqi that minimizes these issues be created the generation of a wqi function is a priority not a mathematical problem it depends highly on the perception of water quality based on this perception it makes sense to decide the particular choice of a common type the arithmetic average used to define the mean contribution of each part of an object the geometric mean used to obtain the consensus of the different views of an object regarding the discussion from the previous section ccme wqi has a pathological memory effect due to the factor f1 scope in ccme wqi each factor adds its contribution to the index value and does not compensate for the proportion of other factors the expression f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 1 3 is the euclidean length of a vector with the three coordinates 1 3 f 1 1 3 f 2 and 1 3 f 3 a cartesian coordinate system has orthogonal independent axes the use of f1 f2 and f3 as coordinates of vectors is not correct because the use of coordinates requires free variable coordinates however there are dependencies f1 0 implies f2 0 and f3 0 in the same manner f2 0 implies f1 0 and f3 0 f3 0 implies f1 0 and f2 0 this purely mathematical argument shows that the euclidean length is not the most suitable model water quality is defined by the collection of excursions in the considered period therefore it is obvious to consider this collection thoroughly and the factors f1 f2 f3 as different viewpoints to the entire group see fig 1 as a rule of thumb this suggests the use of geometric mean a more practical argument is that the effort of gartner and lee ccme 2006 to save the plus sign in the formula of ccme wqi did not change the situation radically following this idea a new wqi is proposed based on the modification of ccme wqi using multiplication and geometric mean from this point on the modified wqi will be called as modified canadian water quality index mcwqi the essential idea of mcwqi is considering the factors f1 f2 f3 as different viewpoints of water quality the equation of mcwqi is written below mcwqi 100 f 1 f 2 f 3 1 3 alternatively in another way of writing mcwqi 100 f 1 f 2 f 3 3 as can be seen from the equation of mcwqi the factors f2 and f3 smoothen the memory effect of ccme wqi in the same manner f3 when tending to 0 smoothens the effect of f1 and f2 in the pathological situations where ccme wqi underestimates water quality due to f1 and f2 mcwqi has a significantly higher value than ccme wqi because it has a smaller memory the mcwqi considers different viewpoints of water quality f1 f2 and f3 by finding a compromise among these perceptions different views of the same thing may have dependencies the mcwqi produces typically results that are different from those of the current ccme wqi therefore the value classification needs to be adjusted in order to be suitable for the new method of water quality indexing fortunately the quality ranking of the ccme is suitable for mcwqi the following properties justify this if f1 f2 f3 f then mcwqi f1 f2 f3 ccme wqi f1 f2 f3 100 f for all factors f continuity of both index functions mcwqi reflects the perception of water quality better than ccme wqi in the case of good water quality but inadequate water control for completeness sake it is stated that always ccme wqi mcwqi it is well known mathematically that the geometrical mean of three numbers is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean of these numbers f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 3 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 3 the square root on both sides leads to f 1 f 2 f 3 3 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 3 hence 100 f 1 2 f 2 2 f 3 2 3 100 f 1 f 2 f 3 3 4 2 mcwqi for a single parameter as mentioned above the usage of ccme wqi requires a set of at least four samples therefore it is impossible to calculate the most critical parameter by ccme wqi for the use of balancing the applicability of mcwqi must also extend to situations with a single parameter in the case when only one quality parameter has been measured for at least two samples in a body of water the index calculation includes only the two factors f2 and f3 and is performed in the same manner as that of three factors this is justified by the following reasons which show that f1 depends on f3 and f2 does not depend on f3 if f3 0 then no violation of the regulation hence f1 0 if f3 0 then at least one bad quality parameter exists because there is only one bad quality parameter this implies f1 100 f2 is needed because there is more than one sample it is not to say that whether there is only one sample with a failed test or whether there are multiple samples with failed tests applied to the mcwqi this means in the case where there is one quality variable in a sample series of at least two samples the alternative formula is s mcwqi 100 f 2 f 3 this formula is applicable for the cases of mcwqi with one quality parameter and more than one sample and by similar reasoning for one sample with more than one quality parameter a similar argumentation can be applied to ccme wqi s c c m e w q i 100 f 2 2 f 3 2 2 5 example the following example modified from the example in ccme wqi guidance illuminates the memory effect of f1 it uses a simplified data set from the north saskatchewan river at devon alberta ccme 2001 this example includes ten variables namely dissolved oxygen ph total phosphorus total nitrogen fecal coliform bacteria arsenic lead mercury 2 4 d and lindane see table 2 three factors are combined to calculate the ccme wqi and mcwqi f1 scope f2 frequency and f3 amplitude scope in this example there are ten variables do ph tp tn fc as pb hg 2 4 d and lindane during the index period all of them failed their respective objective at least once f 1 n u m b e r o f f a i l e d v a r i a b l e t o t a l n u m b e r o f

its objective or less than its objective or at different times possibly both in this example the failed test of do and ph are less than the objective the other failed tests are greater than the

71 1 17 3 89 56 according to table 1 the water quality is good it can be seen that the quality status of each parameter improves by time mcwqi reflects water quality for 1 year as expected while ccme wqi defines water quality as poor for the considered period due to the pathological memory effect 6 conclusions the ccme wqi was developed as a tool to assess and report water quality information to both management institutions and the public ccme 2014 this method allows flexibility to select parameters so that the index users can easily modify and adapt it according to local conditions and issues as first ccme wqi has been developed to evaluate surface water for the protection of aquatic life by specific guidelines later several studies have applied this for various purposes e g

12102,the current river basin monitoring study investigates the standards of the quality of the river and well water in a biodiversity rich netravati river basin in karnataka state india water samples were collected from 16 major sampling sites during pre monsoon april monsoon august and post monsoon october seasons in 2017 to ascertain its physico chemical parameters the results of the tests were compared with maximum permissible limits proposed by the world health organisation drinking water guidelines the water quality index wqi and the irrigation water quality index iwqi using parameters such as sodium percentage na magnesium hazard mh permeability index pi sodium absorption ratio sar and residual sodium carbonate rsc have been determined to provide a better understanding of its drinking and irrigation water quality the interpreted wqi values of the water in netravati river vary from 33 21 to 298 66 which fall in the range of excellent to very poor drinking water quality in the case of well water 100 falls under the excellent category multiple statistical methods like principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation analysis were used and the results of pca were found to be in a correlation with the results of the pearson correlation analysis method the study as a whole highlights the importance of the application of pca wqi and iwqi as standard methods to evaluate the quality of water the results of the present study could be used to contemplate regulations to improve the water quality standard and help people living in and around the river basin to understand the current status of the water quality they use for various purposes graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality assessment netravati river drinking water quality index irrigation

increased ecological footprint by agriculture urbanization and human welfare have an adverse effect on biodiversity and availability of potable water shah et al 2019 tirkey et al 2017 udayakumar et al 2014 natural and anthropogenic activities usually propel the degradation of surface and ground water these include weathering population growth drought industrial activities soil erosion dissolution

pollutants in the water system makes it unsuitable for drinking li et al 2014 saha et al 2019 therefore it is crucial to assess the water quality by considering chemical biological and physical parameters using standard international limits simeonov et al 2003 mukate et al 2019 various models also have been used for prognosis water quality variables boye et al 2015 kim and seo 2015 among several distinct scientific methods available the wqi method is the most prominent one this method uses a mathematical calculation to integrate physical chemical and biological parameters into a numerical score which represents the overall status of the water quality under consideration saha et al 2018 it provides factual information regarding the degree of water pollution and facilitates a better system for water quality monitoring researchers had applied different modes of wqi calculations on surface and groundwater all over the world mahadevan et al 2020 ponsadailakshmi et al 2018 sener et al 2017 sun et al 2016 in india also wqi calculation was adopted to assess the water quality of rivers like the narmada in gujarat gupta et al 2017 the pamba in kerala david et al 2016 the ganga in uttarakhand bhutiani et al 2016 and groundwater sources in chennai tamil nadu kumar et al 2015 and punjab kaur et al 2017 this method is one of the simplest and effective techniques because of its apprehensibility thus raising public concern and aiding the government to take necessary steps to preserve the ecosystem in a developing country like india the necessity of water quality assessment originated from the fact that agriculture is considered as the most crucial sector of the indian economy it is regarded as the primary source of the livelihood of the majority of india s population however the extensive utility of fertilizers may result in a discharge of an enormous amount of effluents into the water bodies and this may lead to water pollution du et al 2019 asha et al 2016 kathri et al 2020 therefore several researchers have developed various techniques for treatment and reuse of effluents for agricultural activities methods like sequencing batch biofilter granular reactors and membrane bioreactor are some of the new methods used for treating effluents for industrial agrarian and domestic reuse activities sanctis et al 2017 an appropriate evaluation of the water quality before its use in irrigation will help in arresting any harmful effect on plant productivity and in surface and groundwater recharge so far many investigations and projects have been conducted to measure iwqi to identify water quality for irrigation and associated hazards affecting crop yield mussawi 2013 thus the evaluation of iwqi is very crucial for sustainable crop production and for maintaining food security chukwuma et al 2016 multivariate statistical approaches like pearson correlation analysis and pca were extensively employed for the evaluation of river water quality ouyang 2005 spatio temporal variations of heavy metal contamination shine et al 1995 identification of pollution sources kazi et al 2009 and evaluation of seasonal correlations of various hydrochemical parameters data interpretation assessment of characteristic changes in water quality and environmental quality indicator identification can be approached using pca these techniques can also be used for identifying relations between the variables causing seasonal as well as temporal variations in water quality of our study area and thereby we can reduce pollution by taking appropriate actions against it wang et al 2017 bilgin and konanç 2016 netravati river one of the principal rivers of mangalore india is considered as one among the sacred rivers of india under the world s biodiversity conservation projects the catchment area of netravati is selected as one of the 34 hotspots for biodiversity conservation gazetter of southern india the ecologically fragile netravati river not only serves as the primary source of drinking water to cities like mangalore and bantwal but also provides water for domestic agricultural and industrial development the people inhabiting the area near the banks of the river are mainly involved in agriculture and farming and the marine life of this river is also valuable for fishing cashew nut vegetables paddy coconut rubber and areca nut were the major crops in this region a large number of medium large and small scale industries are located in the downstream regions of netravati river extensive mining activities domestic sewage chemical discharge from fish mills and agricultural activities are some of the primary diffuse pollutant sources of this area recently some work has reported a piece of meagre information on water quality and changes in land use land cover in the river basin area avvannavar and shrihari 2008 sinha and eldho 2018 similarly other work had highlighted the importance of a freshwater reservoir in the arabian sea impounding the flood waters from netravati river kolathayar et al 2017 a detailed and systematic hydrogeological study of the entire basin is still lacking no attempt has been made so far to study the aquifer parameters of water qualities and to interpret their results using multivariate statistical techniques evaluation of the river and well water quality for irrigation purposes well water for drinking purposes and the effect of discharged water from paddy fields into the river has not been explored with this in view a qualitative and quantitative study of the well and river water of the netravati river has been undertaken therefore our study was aimed to determine the current water quality status of both netravati river and nearby well waters keeping using the following objectives i to evaluate and compare drinking water qualities of both river and well waters using the wqi method ii to detect water quality for irrigation by analysing various parameters based on iwqi method iii to reveal primary sources of pollutant variables using multivariate statistics method like pca the results can be applied to provide baseline information on current water quality status for both drinking and irrigation purposes and this will increase water management efficiency to protect the water resources of the netravati river basin 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area netravati river basin 12 50 13 11 n 74 46 75 44 e a typical agricultural region is located in karnataka south western part of india covering a drainage area of 4409 km2 across five districts fig 1 netravati a sacred west flowing river of this basin originates at an altitude of 1720 m in the western ghats from bangrabalige valley yelaneeru ghat in kudremukh in the chikkamangaluru district having a total length of approximately 145 km and flow downward towards the arabian sea the population and population density are 6 736 million and 263 inhabits km2 respectively it has an apparent breadth of about 182 88 m the river bed comprised of small garnets and sienites occurring in the form of fragments of a beautiful pegmatite and hornblende rock containing spangles of mica the altitude of the basin ranged between 1000 m and 0 m above sea level the upper reaches of the basin are mainly thick forest comprised of vegetation and forest plantation this basin receives a typical tropical monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 3639 5 mm and an average air temperature 16 c 42 c and wind speed 2 0 2 67 m s oppressive weather high humidity and heavy rainfall conditions were observed usually in the hot season march to may followed by the southwest monsoon june to september and further by northeast monsoon october to november the details of the land use land cover of this basin for the year 2012 is provided in the supplementary material table s1 sinha and eldho 2018 the basin is broadly divisible into hilly coastal and midland tracts of western ghats the coastal tract 0 100 m altitude in the west is a dissected landmass the mid land is a rolling terrain and consists of mounds and hillocks of granitoid this region forms the largest area of the basin the western ghats in the east constitute a precipitous hill range with several peaks in the range of 1600 1800 m which forms the eastern water divide of the basin another important river kumaradhara originating in the coorg district joins the netravati river in uppinangadi and then these two rivers flow westwards merging with the arabian sea near mangalore gundia river kapila river kumaradara river mrityunjaya river aniyoor river and various streams like kempu belthangadi shishla neria and charmudi are the main tributaries formed by netravati before joining kumaradara river wells are sparse in this area groundwater occurs mainly in the weathered and fractured zones of rocks within a depth of fewer than 70 m which is characterized by intensive agricultural production the total land allocated for paddy cultivation activity is around 35 000 ha of land 2 2 sample collection and analysis methodology sixteen sampling sites 9 from river water and 7 from well water were chosen to collect natural water from three different seasons namely pre monsoon april monsoon august and post monsoon october in 2018 the water samplings were made from the upstream stretch to the estuarine mouth of the mainstream and associated tributaries geographical locations of sampling sites were recorded using a portable gps gramin montana 650 u s a river water samples were collected from the centre at a bottom of 0 6 m below the water surface private open wells were used to collect well water samples the outlet water from paddy cultivation lands was collected to monitor its quality and effect on ground and surface runoff three sets of water samples from each station were collected for different analysis and samples were filtered using 0 45 μm whatman tmuniflopvdf sterile disposable syringe filters it is then collected in an acid

relationship among each other singh et al 2004 quino lima et al 2019 initially pca was executed using 14 parameters which were sampled seasonally from 7 river stations using statistical computing software three principal components with eigenvalues exceeding one were extracted if the absolute loading value are 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 the factor loadings were classified as strong moderate and weak liu et al 2003 pearson correlation analysis was used to determine a correlation between selected water quality parameters the results of pca have been compared and confirmed with the help of pearson correlation analysis the entire data process has been managed using microsoft office 2007 and the statistical computations were made using the software package spss 16 0 piper and wilcox diagram was made with the help of aqua chem 2014 2 2 5 outflow parametric analysis of paddy field water seven outlet water samples were collected from different paddy fields during september 2018 fig

total phosphorous and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 were analysed in the lab using cfa mentioned above 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemistry the statistical summary of the physico chemical results of the water samples collected altogether from 16 stations during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon from both river and wells are shown in table 2 the ph of water reflects alkalinity and hardness in the whole aquatic area in turn gives an idea of the existence of both living and non living systems panda et al 2018 oisbanjo and daso 2011 the ph of the river and well water were within the range 6 5 8 5 which is under the recommended values of who 2011 the slightly high ph value of about 8 12 at w6 located in dakshin kannada might be due to the presence of bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 ions in water amarasooriya and kawakami 2019 for drinking purpose the permissible limit for turbidity is 5 ntu who 2011 all sites except r8 and r9 located at bantwal and mangalore have turbidity values under allowable limits these sites lie within 25 km of the coastal region and this could contribute to having a turbidity value beyond permissible limits low do value 3 42 mg l for the r4 station was observed during the monsoon season and this could be due to lack of photosynthetic phytoplankton community in the river or might be due to delay in annual monsoon rainfall jampani et al 2018 these findings were contrary to the results obtained by islam et al 2015 they reported that do values were low in dry seasons due to the release of organic substances into the riverine systems meanwhile lower values 3 99 3 42 3 52 mg l at w1 w2 and w6 stations that were located in puttur taluk mani and patrame panjayat in the dakshin kannada district during the monsoon were due to the low rate of atmospheric oxygen dissolution into the water the ec values obtained for all the sites throughout seasons were less than 750 μs cm i e within standard regulatory limits who 2011 which indicated better water quality however for stations r8 and r9 ec values were above 2500 μs cm suggested high salt content tds for well water reached up to 171 79 mg l post monsoon for w6 but within permissible limits 500 mg l this might be due to the influence of rock water in well water compared to river water hco3 values were high for stations r8 and r9 for all well water samples values of hco3 were within the permissible limit 120 mg l obtained cl values except for r8 and r9 were very low and found to be within the permissible limit 250 mg l specified by who 2011 for the drinking standard the absence of high cl contents in both systems indicated low organic content in water bodies bharathi et al 2016 moreover the chloride concentrations were mainly present by weathering agricultural runoff and intrusion of seawater karanth 1987 the permissible limit of so4 2 is 250 mg l who 2011 for drinking standard and all the values for well water and river water stations except r8 and r9 fall within the limit the higher values for hco3 cl and so42 were measured at r8 and r9 locations might be due to anthropogenic activities or due to leaching of saline residues in the soil the primary source of sulphate presence in water was mainly by leaching from minerals by sedimentary rocks sulphur content fertilizers and by anthropogenic activities geurts et al 2009 the order of relative abundance of major cations in the river and groundwater were found to be in the order na ca2 mg2 k during the dry and wet period the highest na k ca2 mg2 concentration was measured in r8 and r9 sites and the most probable reason for this might be due to the seawater intrusion into these site areas alfarrah and walraevens 2018 the po4 3 no3 and no2 concentrations in both water bodies were found to be within the permissible limits as per who 2011 heavy metal analysis was also carried out for the river and well water samples because of their harmful effects on human beings which may cause diseases like haemosiderosis rajappa et al 2010 and plumbism fe2 and pb2 in the river water samples showed bdl the prescribed limit as per who 2011 for drinking water is 0 3 mg l iron and 0 01 mg l lead hence safe for consumption the proportions in equivalents of the major cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 of the river and well water are displayed in the piper 1944 diagram fig 2 3 2 evaluation of the suitability of water samples for different purposes 3 2 1 water quality index wqi method shows more precise drinking water quality status in our study wqi has been calculated based on 15 measured water quality parameters the results of season wise wqi calculations are depicted in table 3 and fig 3 in the case of river water samples the mean wqi values were found to be 92 4 79 5 and 100 2 in pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively in the pre monsoon season out of 9 sites 4 sites came under excellent and 3 came under the good drinking water quality category the rest of the sites were found to have very poor drinking water quality the water quality of sites r8 and r9 located in the amtady village bantwal taluk in the dakshin kannada district and bajal village in the mangalore district are having very poor drinking quality this might be due to the discharge of agricultural activities and input of industrial and municipal wastes at the downstream regions of the river in the monsoon season 5 out of 9 river sites were classified as excellent water quality status 2 were recorded as good 1 as poor and other as very poor water quality status the lowest 37 91 and highest 223 99 wqi values occurred in r3 and r9 sampling locations the r3 site located in the kalamaja village in belthangadi taluk showed an excellent water quality status wqi 50 in both pre monsoon and monsoon seasons in post monsoon 33 3 3 9 44 4 4 9 and 22 2 2 9 of sites were classified as excellent good and very poor water quality besides the water quality of sites r1 and r4 located in the kunthoor village puttur taluk around 62 km from coastal area and the yenekallu village in sulya taluk about 86 km from the coastal area showed an excellent status and sampling sites r8 and r9 exhibited very poor level in all the three seasons the results illustrated that wqi of well water indicated excellent drinking water quality eq 3 was used to calculate the effective weight values of the water quality parameters it was then compared with its relative weights and the results were compiled in table s2 based on calculations the highest mean effective weights value belongs to po4 3 with 44 8 and do with 15 4 but the relative weight of do 9 4 is found to be higher than the po4 3 parameter 5 7 the hco3 shows the effective weight 7 1 slightly exceeding the relative weight assigned by wqi 5 7 rest of the parameters has effective weights lower than their relative weights table s2 so4 2 0 8 and mg2 0 4 parameters possessed the lowest mean effective weights 3 2 2 irrigation water quality this method was entirely different from the wqi method employed for evaluating drinking water quality the overall irrigational water quality of the collected samples was assessed using irrigation parameters such as sar rsc na pi and mh table 4 in this study since sar values for the river and well waters are 10 indicated suitability and excellency of water for irrigation purposes in all the three seasons richards 1954 the classification of river water and groundwater according to the rsc value indicated that the values obtained were lower than 1 25 meq l and fall under the excellent category of water quality sample r5 located in uppinanagadi have 39 3 na pre monsoon indicated good quality and the sample w5 located in charmady belthangadi taluk has 36 1 na post monsoon reported permissible irrigation water quality the main reason for the relatively high sodium concentration in r5 and w5 might be due to use of agrochemicals or due to the disintegration of various minerals in water obtained from geomorphological sources khanoranga and khalid 2019 the rock water interaction completely controls the higher concentrations of chlorine and sodium in groundwater using feldspar weathering srinivas et al 2013 r8 and r9 sites revealed good irrigation quality since their pi values existed between 25 and 75 meq l in terms of mh criteria for water classification the water of the study area was found to be suitable for agricultural purposes the details of calculated values for assessing the suitability of irrigation in all the three seasons were provided in tables s3 s4 and s5 in terms of salinity the irrigation suitability for the river and well water were deducted from wilcox diagram fig 4 in general if a peculiar water sample falls to very high sodium or salinity hazard that specific sample is unsuitable for irrigation purposes based on irrigation water quality all water samples were found to be within permissible limits and are suitable for irrigation 3 3 principal component analysis pca is a dimension reduction technique enforced to identify the origin of pollutants by transforming a huge number of correlated variables into a small number of principal components wang et al 2013 the r8 and r9 sites were the only sites ruled out from other sites for pca and pearson correlation analysis as they have drastic variable characteristics due to the effect composed from seawater incursion the results of principal components eigenvalues and explained variance were summarized in table 5 three pcs explaining 82 1 of the total variance for pre monsoon 82 6 for monsoon and 84 9 for post monsoon were obtained the positive component loadings of the first three pcs for each characteristic season are presented in fig 5 in pre monsoon season pc1 explained 41 9 of the total variance with strong positive loadings of tds ec na and limited loading on cl this could be due to the influence of sewage urban runoff seawater intrusion and industrial waste into the river water pc2 explained 22 1 of the variance and had high positive loadings on hco3 ca2 and mg2 which had reflected carbonate weathering as the main source of these minerals pc3 accounts for 18 1 of the total variance with strong positive loadings on no3 po4 3 and k and this was probably due to the application of organic and inorganic fertilizers in the agricultural catchment area pc1 responsible for 46 5 of the total variance in monsoon season had strong positive loadings of ec tds no3 cl and na and negative loadings of so4 2 pc2 accounted for about 19 1 of the total variance and had a strong positive loading for po4 3 and ca2 whereas negative loading of k hco3 and mg2 had high positive loadings on pc3 represented 17 1 of the variance in post monsoon ec tds and hco3 had high positive loadings and no2 had moderate loading in pc1 and could explain 37 9 of the variance pc2 explained 31 8 of the variance with high positive loadings of no3 and ca2 moderate loading on cl and high negative loading on k pc3 accounts for 15 1 of the total variance and had positive loadings on so4 2 atmospheric deposition the presence of sulphuric acids in domestic wastewater and sulphate bearing fertilizers were the main sulphate sources of the study area wayland et al 2003 all the results of pca were in accordance with pearson correlation analysis and are presented in tables s6 s7 and s8 3 4 agriculture impacts paddy water management is pivotal to save water body resources in the context of water quality because nutrient loses from paddy production systems may subsidize to contamination and eutrophication of freshwater resources the physico chemical results obtained for the paddy out flow water are shown in table s9 observed concentrations of tn and tp in outflow water were found to be lower nitrogen might get denitrified by the anaerobic lower layer of the soil during the ponding process or might be taken up by the rice plants this might be the reason for the low concentration of tn similarly outflow water consisting of organic phosphorous in the form of particulate matter got easily absorbed by the paddy soil feng and yoshinaga 2004 leading to low tp the highest value for tds was recorded at the paddy field p6 and the range of tn and tp varied between 5 23 and 9 56 mg l and 0 91 2 79 mg l the results of physico chemical parameters were compared with standards of the environment protection rules 1986 and were found to be within the perspective limits of discharge of environmental pollutants into the inland surface water 4 conclusions this study was to analyse the hydrochemistry of selected physicochemical variables in the river and well waters of the netravati river basin turbidity ec tds cl hco3 k ca2 and na values of water in the downstream regions of the basin exceeds the permissible drinking limits of who 2011 wqi and iwqi methods were used to measure the status of drinking and irrigation water quality respectively to identify the prime source of pollutants in upper and middle streams of the river multivariate statistical methods like pca and pearson correlation analysis were applied the overall wqi values for drinking water from sampling sites adjoining the arabian sea were high salt deposits sewage industrial wastes and other anthropogenic inputs might be contributed for the high wqi values the river water quality showed distinct seasonal variations with the highest wqi values in post monsoon followed by pre monsoon and monsoon moreover the wqi results of well waters showed excellent results and were not influenced by seasonal variations iwqi results showed excellent irrigation water quality based on sar rsc na mh and pi na and pi in specific sites depicted minor deviations due to excessive use of agrochemicals in the field areas it is worth to mention that the outflow of paddy field water towards the river generates null effects to the entire riverine system wqi and iwqi methods were an inexpensive and compatible way to measure the quality of the water it is also clear that in the netravati river basin changes in water quality during the three seasons pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon the influence of sewage domestic discharge and industrial waste were major threats to water quality along the river basin by controlling the main pollutant sources

12102,the current river basin monitoring study investigates the standards of the quality of the river and well water in a biodiversity rich netravati river basin in karnataka state india water samples were collected from 16 major sampling sites during pre monsoon april monsoon august and post monsoon october seasons in 2017 to ascertain its physico chemical parameters the results of the tests were compared with maximum permissible limits proposed by the world health organisation drinking water guidelines the water quality index wqi and the irrigation water quality index iwqi using parameters such as sodium percentage na magnesium hazard mh permeability index pi sodium absorption ratio sar and residual sodium carbonate rsc have been determined to provide a better understanding of its drinking and irrigation water quality the interpreted wqi values of the water in netravati river vary from 33 21 to 298 66 which fall in the range of excellent to very poor drinking water quality in the case of well water 100 falls under the excellent category multiple statistical methods like principal component analysis pca and pearson correlation analysis were used and the results of pca were found to be in a correlation with the results of the pearson correlation analysis method the study as a whole highlights the importance of the application of pca wqi and iwqi as standard methods to evaluate the quality of water the results of the present study could be used to contemplate regulations to improve the water quality standard and help people living in and around the river basin to understand the current status of the water quality they use for various purposes graphical abstract image 1 keywords water quality assessment netravati river drinking water quality index irrigation water quality index pca 1 introduction river and groundwater chemistry is one of the most critical factors that govern the equilibrium between economic development and the natural capital of a country increased ecological footprint by agriculture urbanization and human welfare have an adverse effect on biodiversity and availability of potable water shah et al 2019 tirkey et al 2017 udayakumar et al 2014 natural and anthropogenic activities usually propel the degradation of surface and ground water these include weathering population growth drought industrial activities soil erosion dissolution of minerals precipitation and agricultural activities kumar and sangeetha 2020 misaghi et al 2017 gu et al 2019 mamun et al 2019 enrichment of dissolved trace elements heavy metal and semi metal pollutants in the water system makes it unsuitable for drinking li et al 2014 saha et al 2019 therefore it is crucial to assess the water quality by considering chemical biological and physical parameters using standard international limits simeonov et al 2003 mukate et al 2019 various models also have been used for prognosis water quality variables boye et al 2015 kim and seo 2015 among several distinct scientific methods available the wqi method is the most prominent one this method uses a mathematical calculation to integrate physical chemical and biological parameters into a numerical score which represents the overall status of the water quality under consideration saha et al 2018 it provides factual information regarding the degree of water pollution and facilitates a better system for water quality monitoring researchers had applied different modes of wqi calculations on surface and groundwater all over the world mahadevan et al 2020 ponsadailakshmi et al 2018 sener et al 2017 sun et al 2016 in india also wqi calculation was adopted to assess the water quality of rivers like the narmada in gujarat gupta et al 2017 the pamba in kerala david et al 2016 the ganga in uttarakhand bhutiani et al 2016 and groundwater sources in chennai tamil nadu kumar et al 2015 and punjab kaur et al 2017 this method is one of the simplest and effective techniques because of its apprehensibility thus raising public concern and aiding the government to take necessary steps to preserve the ecosystem in a developing country like india the necessity of water quality assessment originated from the fact that agriculture is considered as the most crucial sector of the indian economy it is regarded as the primary source of the livelihood of the majority of india s population however the extensive utility of fertilizers may result in a discharge of an enormous amount of effluents into the water bodies and this may lead to water pollution du et al 2019 asha et al 2016 kathri et al 2020 therefore several researchers have developed various techniques for treatment and reuse of effluents for agricultural activities methods like sequencing batch biofilter granular reactors and membrane bioreactor are some of the new methods used for treating effluents for industrial agrarian and domestic reuse activities sanctis et al 2017 an appropriate evaluation of the water quality before its use in irrigation will help in arresting any harmful effect on plant productivity and in surface and groundwater recharge so far many investigations and projects have been conducted to measure iwqi to identify water quality for irrigation and associated hazards affecting crop yield mussawi 2013 thus the evaluation of iwqi is very crucial for sustainable crop production and for maintaining food security chukwuma et al 2016 multivariate statistical approaches like pearson correlation analysis and pca were extensively employed for the evaluation of river water quality ouyang 2005 spatio temporal variations of heavy metal contamination shine et al 1995 identification of pollution sources kazi et al 2009 and evaluation of seasonal correlations of various hydrochemical parameters data interpretation assessment of characteristic changes in water quality and environmental quality indicator identification can be approached using pca these techniques can also be used for identifying relations between the variables causing seasonal as well as temporal variations in water quality of our study area and thereby we can reduce pollution by taking appropriate actions against it wang et al 2017 bilgin and konanç 2016 netravati river one of the principal rivers of mangalore india is considered as one among the sacred rivers of india under the world s biodiversity conservation projects the catchment area of netravati is selected as one of the 34 hotspots for biodiversity conservation gazetter of southern india the ecologically fragile netravati river not only serves as the primary source of drinking water to cities like mangalore and bantwal but also provides water for domestic agricultural and industrial development the people inhabiting the area near the banks of the river are mainly involved in agriculture and farming and the marine life of this river is also valuable for fishing cashew nut vegetables paddy coconut rubber and areca nut were the major crops in this region a large number of medium large and small scale industries are located in the downstream regions of netravati river extensive mining activities domestic sewage chemical discharge from fish mills and agricultural activities are some of the primary diffuse pollutant sources of this area recently some work has reported a piece of meagre information on water quality and changes in land use land cover in the river basin area avvannavar and shrihari 2008 sinha and eldho 2018 similarly other work had highlighted the importance of a freshwater reservoir in the arabian sea impounding the flood waters from netravati river kolathayar et al 2017 a detailed and systematic hydrogeological study of the entire basin is still lacking no attempt has been made so far to study the aquifer parameters of water qualities and to interpret their results using multivariate statistical techniques evaluation of the river and well water quality for irrigation purposes well water for drinking purposes and the effect of discharged water from paddy fields into the river has not been explored with this in view a qualitative and quantitative study of the well and river water of the netravati river has been undertaken therefore our study was aimed to determine the current water quality status of both netravati river and nearby well waters keeping using the following objectives i to evaluate and compare drinking water qualities of both river and well waters using the wqi method ii to detect water quality for irrigation by analysing various parameters based on iwqi method iii to reveal primary sources of pollutant variables using multivariate statistics method like pca the results can be applied to provide baseline information on current water quality status for both drinking and irrigation purposes and this will increase water management efficiency to protect the water resources of the netravati river basin 2 methods and materials 2 1 study area netravati river basin 12 50 13 11 n 74 46 75 44 e a typical agricultural region is located in karnataka south western part of india covering a drainage area of 4409 km2 across five districts fig 1 netravati a sacred west flowing river of this basin originates at an altitude of 1720 m in the western ghats from bangrabalige valley yelaneeru ghat in kudremukh in the chikkamangaluru district having a total length of approximately 145 km and flow downward towards the arabian sea the population and population density are 6 736 million and 263 inhabits km2 respectively it has an apparent breadth of about 182 88 m the river bed comprised of small garnets and sienites occurring in the form of fragments of a beautiful pegmatite and hornblende rock containing spangles of mica the altitude of the basin ranged between 1000 m and 0 m above sea level the upper reaches of the basin are mainly thick forest comprised of vegetation and forest plantation this basin receives a typical tropical monsoon climate with an annual average rainfall of 3639 5 mm and an average air temperature 16 c 42 c and wind speed 2 0 2 67 m s oppressive weather high humidity and heavy rainfall conditions were observed usually in the hot season march to may followed by the southwest monsoon june to september and further by northeast monsoon october to november the details of the land use land cover of this basin for the year 2012 is provided in the supplementary material table s1 sinha and eldho 2018 the basin is broadly divisible into hilly coastal and midland tracts of western ghats the coastal tract 0 100 m altitude in the west is a dissected landmass the mid land is a rolling terrain and consists of mounds and hillocks of granitoid this region forms the largest area of the basin the western ghats in the east constitute a precipitous hill range with several peaks in the range of 1600 1800 m which forms the eastern water divide of the basin another important river kumaradhara originating in the coorg district joins the netravati river in uppinangadi and then these two rivers flow westwards merging with the arabian sea near mangalore gundia river kapila river kumaradara river mrityunjaya river aniyoor river and various streams like kempu belthangadi shishla neria and charmudi are the main tributaries formed by netravati before joining kumaradara river wells are sparse in this area groundwater occurs mainly in the weathered and fractured zones of rocks within a depth of fewer than 70 m which is characterized by intensive agricultural production the total land allocated for paddy cultivation activity is around 35 000 ha of land 2 2 sample collection and analysis methodology sixteen sampling sites 9 from river water and 7 from well water were chosen to collect natural water from three different seasons namely pre monsoon april monsoon august and post monsoon october in 2018 the water samplings were made from the upstream stretch to the estuarine mouth of the mainstream and associated tributaries geographical locations of sampling sites were recorded using a portable gps gramin montana 650 u s a river water samples were collected from the centre at a bottom of 0 6 m below the water surface private open wells were used to collect well water samples the outlet water from paddy cultivation lands was collected to monitor its quality and effect on ground and surface runoff three sets

relationship among each other singh et al 2004 quino lima et al 2019 initially pca was executed using 14 parameters which were sampled seasonally from 7 river stations using statistical computing software three principal components with eigenvalues exceeding one were extracted if the absolute loading value are 0 75 0 75 0 50 and 0 50 0 30 the factor loadings were classified as strong moderate and weak liu et al 2003 pearson correlation analysis was used to determine a correlation between selected water quality parameters the results of pca have been compared and confirmed with the help of pearson correlation analysis the entire data process has been managed using microsoft office 2007 and the statistical computations were made using the software package spss 16 0 piper and wilcox diagram was made with the help of aqua chem 2014 2 2 5 outflow parametric analysis of paddy field water seven outlet water samples were collected from different paddy fields during september 2018 fig

total phosphorous and ammoniacal nitrogen nh3 were analysed in the lab using cfa mentioned above 3 results and discussion 3 1 hydrochemistry the statistical summary of the physico chemical results of the water samples collected altogether from 16 stations during pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon from both river and wells are shown in table 2 the ph of water reflects alkalinity and hardness in the whole aquatic area in turn gives an idea of the existence of both living and non living systems panda et al 2018 oisbanjo and daso 2011 the ph of the river and well water were within the range 6 5 8 5 which is under the recommended values of who 2011 the slightly high ph value of about 8 12 at w6 located in dakshin kannada might be due to the presence of bicarbonate hco3 and carbonate co3 2 ions in water amarasooriya and kawakami 2019 for drinking purpose the permissible limit for turbidity is 5 ntu who 2011 all sites except r8 and r9 located at bantwal and mangalore have turbidity values under allowable limits these sites lie within 25 km of the coastal region and this could contribute to having a turbidity value beyond permissible limits low do value 3 42 mg l for the r4 station was observed during the monsoon season and this could be due to lack of photosynthetic phytoplankton community in the river or might be due to delay in annual monsoon rainfall jampani et al 2018 these findings were contrary to the results obtained by islam et al 2015 they reported that do values were low in dry seasons due to the release of organic substances into the riverine systems meanwhile lower values 3 99 3 42 3 52 mg l at w1 w2 and w6 stations that were located in puttur taluk mani and patrame panjayat in the dakshin kannada district during the monsoon were due to the low rate of atmospheric oxygen dissolution into the water the ec values obtained for all the sites throughout seasons were less than 750 μs cm i e within standard regulatory limits who 2011 which indicated better water quality however for stations r8 and r9 ec values were above 2500 μs cm suggested high salt content tds for well water reached up to 171 79 mg l post monsoon for w6 but within permissible limits 500 mg l this might be due to the influence of rock water in well water compared to river water hco3 values were high for stations r8 and r9 for all well water samples values of hco3 were within the permissible limit 120 mg l obtained cl values except for r8 and r9 were very low and found to be within the permissible limit 250 mg l specified by who 2011 for the drinking standard the absence of high cl contents in both systems indicated low organic content in water bodies bharathi et al 2016 moreover the chloride concentrations were mainly present by weathering agricultural runoff and intrusion of seawater karanth 1987 the permissible limit of so4 2 is 250 mg l who 2011 for drinking standard and all the values for well water and river water stations except r8 and r9 fall within the limit the higher values for hco3 cl and so42 were measured at r8 and r9 locations might be due to anthropogenic activities or due to leaching of saline residues in the soil the primary source of sulphate presence in water was mainly by leaching from minerals by sedimentary rocks sulphur content fertilizers and by anthropogenic activities geurts et al 2009 the order of relative abundance of major cations in the river and groundwater were found to be in the order na ca2 mg2 k during the dry and wet period the highest na k ca2 mg2 concentration was measured in r8 and r9 sites and the most probable reason for this might be due to the seawater intrusion into these site areas alfarrah and walraevens 2018 the po4 3 no3 and no2 concentrations in both water bodies were found to be within the permissible limits as per who 2011 heavy metal analysis was also carried out for the river and well water samples because of their harmful effects on human beings which may cause diseases like haemosiderosis rajappa et al 2010 and plumbism fe2 and pb2 in the river water samples showed bdl the prescribed limit as per who 2011 for drinking water is 0 3 mg l iron and 0 01 mg l lead hence safe for consumption the proportions in equivalents of the major cations ca2 mg2 na k and anions hco3 cl so4 2 of the river and well water are displayed in the piper 1944 diagram fig 2 3 2 evaluation of the suitability of water samples for different purposes 3 2 1 water quality index wqi method shows more precise drinking water quality status in our study wqi has been calculated based on 15 measured water quality parameters the results of season wise wqi calculations are depicted in table 3 and fig 3 in the case of river water samples the mean wqi values were found to be 92 4 79 5 and 100 2 in pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon seasons respectively in the pre monsoon season out of 9 sites 4 sites came under excellent and 3 came under the good drinking water quality category the rest of the sites were found to have very poor drinking water quality the water quality of sites r8 and r9 located in the amtady village bantwal taluk in the dakshin kannada district and bajal village in the mangalore district are having very poor drinking quality this might be due to the discharge of agricultural activities and input of industrial and municipal wastes at the downstream regions of the river in the monsoon season 5 out of 9 river sites were classified as excellent water quality status 2 were recorded as good 1 as poor and other as very poor water quality status the lowest 37 91 and highest 223 99 wqi values occurred in r3 and r9 sampling locations the r3 site located in the kalamaja village in belthangadi taluk showed an excellent water quality status wqi 50 in both pre monsoon and monsoon seasons in post monsoon 33 3 3 9 44 4 4 9 and 22 2 2 9 of sites were classified as excellent good and very poor water quality besides the water quality of sites r1 and r4 located in the kunthoor village puttur taluk around 62 km from coastal area and the yenekallu village in sulya taluk about 86 km from the coastal area showed an excellent status and sampling sites r8 and r9 exhibited very poor level in all the three seasons the results illustrated that wqi of well water indicated excellent drinking water quality eq 3 was used to calculate the effective weight values of the water quality parameters it was then compared with its relative weights and the results were compiled in table s2 based on calculations the highest mean effective weights value belongs to po4 3 with 44 8 and do with 15 4 but the relative weight of do 9 4 is found to be higher than the po4 3 parameter 5 7 the hco3 shows the effective weight 7 1 slightly exceeding the relative weight assigned by wqi 5 7 rest of the parameters has effective weights lower than their relative weights table s2 so4 2 0 8 and mg2 0 4 parameters possessed the lowest mean effective weights 3 2 2 irrigation water quality this method was entirely different from the wqi method employed for evaluating drinking water quality the overall irrigational water quality of the collected samples was assessed using irrigation parameters such as sar rsc na pi and mh table 4 in this study since sar values for the river and well waters are 10 indicated suitability and excellency of water for irrigation purposes in all the three seasons richards 1954 the classification of river water and groundwater according to the rsc value indicated that the values obtained were lower than 1 25 meq l and fall under the excellent category of water quality sample r5 located in uppinanagadi have 39 3 na pre monsoon indicated good quality and the sample w5 located in charmady belthangadi taluk has 36 1 na post monsoon reported permissible irrigation water quality the main reason for the relatively high sodium concentration in r5 and w5 might be due to use of agrochemicals or due to the disintegration of various minerals in water obtained from geomorphological sources khanoranga and khalid 2019 the rock water interaction completely controls the higher concentrations of chlorine and sodium in groundwater using feldspar weathering srinivas et al 2013 r8 and r9 sites revealed good irrigation quality since their pi values existed between 25 and 75 meq l in terms of mh criteria for water classification the water of the study area was found to be suitable for agricultural purposes the details of calculated values for assessing the suitability of irrigation in all the three seasons were provided in tables s3 s4 and s5 in terms of salinity the irrigation suitability for the river and well water were deducted from wilcox diagram fig 4 in general if a peculiar water sample falls to very high sodium or salinity hazard that specific sample is unsuitable for irrigation purposes based on irrigation water quality all water samples were found to be within permissible limits and are suitable for irrigation 3 3 principal component analysis pca is a dimension reduction technique enforced to identify the origin of pollutants by transforming a huge number of correlated variables into a small number of principal components wang et al 2013 the r8 and r9 sites were the only sites ruled out from other sites for pca and pearson correlation analysis as they have drastic variable characteristics due to the effect composed from seawater incursion the results of principal components eigenvalues and explained variance were summarized in table 5 three pcs explaining 82 1 of the total variance for pre monsoon 82 6 for monsoon and 84 9 for post monsoon were obtained the positive component loadings of the first three pcs for each characteristic season are presented in fig 5 in pre monsoon season pc1 explained 41 9 of the total variance with strong positive loadings of tds ec na and limited loading on cl this could be due to the influence of sewage urban runoff seawater intrusion and industrial waste into the river water pc2 explained 22 1 of the variance and had high positive loadings on hco3 ca2 and mg2 which had reflected carbonate weathering as the main source of these minerals pc3 accounts for 18 1 of the total variance with strong positive loadings on no3 po4 3 and k and this was probably due to the application of organic and inorganic fertilizers in the agricultural catchment area pc1 responsible for 46 5 of the total variance in monsoon season had strong positive loadings of ec tds no3 cl and na and negative loadings of so4 2 pc2 accounted for about 19 1 of the total variance and had a strong positive loading for po4 3 and ca2 whereas negative loading of k hco3 and mg2 had high positive loadings on pc3 represented 17 1 of the variance in post monsoon ec tds and hco3 had high positive loadings and no2 had moderate loading in pc1 and could explain 37 9 of the variance pc2 explained 31 8 of the variance with high positive loadings of no3 and ca2 moderate loading on cl and high negative loading on k pc3 accounts for 15 1 of the total variance and had positive loadings on so4 2 atmospheric deposition the presence of sulphuric acids in domestic wastewater and sulphate bearing fertilizers were the main sulphate sources of the study area wayland et al 2003 all the results of pca were in accordance with pearson correlation analysis and are presented in tables s6 s7 and s8 3 4 agriculture impacts paddy water management is pivotal to save water body resources in the context of water quality because nutrient loses from paddy production systems may subsidize to contamination and eutrophication of freshwater resources the physico chemical results obtained for the paddy out flow water are shown in table s9 observed concentrations of tn and tp in outflow water were found to be lower nitrogen might get denitrified by the anaerobic lower layer of the soil during the ponding process or might be taken up by the rice plants this might be the reason for the low concentration of tn similarly outflow water consisting of organic phosphorous in the form of particulate matter got easily absorbed by the paddy soil feng and yoshinaga 2004 leading to low tp the highest value for tds was recorded at the paddy field p6 and the range of tn and tp varied between 5 23 and 9 56 mg l and 0 91 2 79 mg l the results of physico chemical parameters were compared with standards of the environment protection rules 1986 and were found to be within the perspective limits of discharge of environmental pollutants into the inland surface water 4 conclusions this study was to analyse the hydrochemistry of selected physicochemical variables in the river and well waters of the netravati river basin turbidity ec tds cl hco3 k ca2 and na values of water in the downstream regions of the basin exceeds the permissible drinking limits of who 2011 wqi and iwqi methods were used to measure the status of drinking and irrigation water quality respectively to identify the prime source of pollutants in upper and middle streams of the river multivariate statistical methods like pca and pearson correlation analysis were applied the overall wqi values for drinking water from sampling sites adjoining the arabian sea were high salt deposits sewage industrial wastes and other anthropogenic inputs might be contributed for the high wqi values the river water quality showed distinct seasonal variations with the highest wqi values in post monsoon followed by pre monsoon and monsoon moreover the wqi results of well waters showed excellent results and were not influenced by seasonal variations iwqi results showed excellent irrigation water quality based on sar rsc na mh and pi na and pi in specific sites depicted minor deviations due to excessive use of agrochemicals in the field areas it is worth to mention that the outflow of paddy field water towards the river generates null effects to the entire riverine system wqi and iwqi methods were an inexpensive and compatible way to measure the quality of the water it is also clear that in the netravati river basin changes in water quality during the three seasons pre monsoon monsoon and post monsoon the influence of sewage domestic discharge and industrial waste were major threats to water quality along the river basin by controlling the main pollutant sources identified we can improve the water quality status of the netravati river basin declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

12103,lodwar municipality is one of the fastest growing urban areas of sub saharan africa that depends mainly on groundwater for its municipal water supply most of the groundwater sources are located within the riparian zones of the turkwel river with limited understanding of its aquifers the groundwater of lodwar may be at risk of natural processes and anthropogenic activities statistical techniques and geochemical methods were applied to determine the aquifer hydrogeochemistry three distinct aquifers which we collectively refer to as the lodwar alluvial aquifer system underlie lodwar and its environs the shallow alluvial intermediate and deep aquifers which are the main source of fresh water a fourth the shallow aquifer of the turkana grit is highly saline and with fluoride contamination just as the turkwel river the shallow alluvial aquifer saa was dominated by ca hco3 water type while the tgsa was na cl water type and became na hco3 near the holocene sediments the intermediate aquifer ia was na hco3water type pockets of mg hco3 water occurred in the shallow alluvial and intermediate aquifers the natural processes in the saa include rock water interaction recharge by surface water and oxidation reactions while evaporation and dissolution are the major factors controlling the chemistry of the tgsa ion exchange dilution and dissolution are the major processes in the ia elevated levels of no3 and so4 2 during the wet season within the saa and the ia reflects their vulnerability to pollution saline intrusion into the shallow and intermediate aquifers from the turkana grit aquifers is likely to occur graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrogeochemistry urban groundwater water quality natural and anthropogenic factors groundwater

macdonald et al 2016 described four major hydrogeological environments in sub saharan africa ssa crystalline basement that occupies 40 of the land area with 220 million people volcanic rocks occupying 6 of the ssa with 45 million people in the horn of africa consolidated sedimentary aquifers covering 32 of the land area supporting a population of 110 million and unconsolidated sediments alluvial aquifers that cover 22 of the ssa and sustain a population of 60 million people recent advances in mineral and oil exploration in most arid areas have led to the rapid growth in urban populations and subsequent increase in water demand olago 2018 the average population growth rate in ssa is 2 7 and about 2 5 in kenya world bank 2018 this growth has partially led to the increased demand for water and subsequent expansion of irrigation projects lodwar municipality is particularly experiencing unforeseen demand for large supplies of water from increased urban growth and settlement due to oil development activities development of mega transport and infrastructure projects such as the lamu south sudan ethiopia lapsset corridor and expansion of commercial and industrial establishments olago

activities khatri and tyagi 2014 hamilton et al 2015 muhammad et al 2015 pérez villarreal et al 2019 peter 2001 and thus it is important to characterize each aquifer to better understand its potential for sustainable supply of potable and safe water for various uses under rapidly changing climatic environmental and developmental scenarios the natural influences which lead to water chemistry and hence quality changes in the aquifers include intensive evaporation li et al 2014 rock water interaction chenini et al 2010 earle 2013 okiongbo and akpofure 2015 sheikhy narany et al 2014 mixing of

render a safe groundwater source unusable for millennia once contaminated frind et al 2006 sharma and chhipa 2016 although lodwar municipality depends largely on groundwater for its municipal water supply olago 2018 hirpa et al 2018 no comprehensive hydrogeochemical studies have been carried out on the groundwater system the purpose of this paper is to characterize the hydrogeochemistry of the lodwar municipality s strategic alluvial aquifer system in north western kenya and to evaluate the natural and anthropogenic factors that influence its water chemistry and quality providing the evidence base for its sustainable and safe exploitation and management the research demonstrates for the first time the important role of pulsed hydrological recharge in maintaining potable water quality and quantities in the lodwar alluvial aquifer system a close link between groundwater chemistry and seasonal fluctuations in climate as well as to land uses in the expansive turkwel river and kawalase river catchments and lodwar municipality itself reflects the sensitivity of the system to climate variability and change and to human factors that go well beyond the remit of the current water management regime with the evidence presented it will be possible to monitor and plan for safe and sustainable water supplies under present and future demands and risks for towns in similar water insecure environments where groundwater may be the critical dimension for sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area longitude 35 32 0 to 35 48 0 and latitudes 3 0 0 to

2 2 water sampling and analysis 2 2 1 fieldwork groundwater and surface water samples were collected from the study area during two dry february 2018 and february 2019 seasons and one wet may 2018 season and the geographical coordinates of all the sampling sites were recorded the 12 groundwater samples and seven turkwel river samples that were collected within the study area and included in this paper during the 2018 dry season form a subset of a wider sample collection that extended to the western shoreline of lake turkana during the 2018 wet season 94 groundwater samples from 53 handpumps and 41 boreholes electric or solar pump operated were collected including re sampled february 2018 sites information on the drilled depth of each handpump and borehole was not fully available there was information on drilled depth for 28 handpumps depth range 5 45 m with one reported outlier at 75 m 17 of these were less than 30 m below the site specific ground level elevation above sea level and therefore fall in the shallow aquifer category cf olago 2018 likewise 22 boreholes had drilled depth information including all nine lowasco production boreholes their depths ranged from 17 to 110 m of these ten 10 were between 16 and 30 m depth and were categorized as a shallow aquifer similarly the other ten 10 boreholes were in the ia category and two 2 were in the deep aquifer category of the nine lowasco production boreholes seven were in the shallow aquifer category and two were in the da category cf olago 2018 during the 2019 dry season 58 of the 94 groundwater sites comprising 31 handpumps and 27 boreholes were re sampled including all the february 2018 sites of these 16 handpumps and 18 boreholes all also sampled in the 2018 wet season had drilled depth information the number of sampled sites without drilled depth information was 25 handpumps and 19 boreholes the field parameters that were measured with the exception of the february 2019 set of samples were electrical conductivity ph and temperature using a hand held combo tester hi98129 two sets of water samples were collected from each sampling site for cation and anion determinations respectively clean polythene bottles with air tight caps were used as sampling containers and each bottle was rinsed with distilled water before sampling three drops of analytical grade 1 nitric acid were used to preserve the cation samples the bottles were labeled and then stored in a cool box for transportation to nairobi and refrigerated at 4 c in the laboratory 2 2 2 laboratory the laboratory

range from 200 0 to 420 0 μs cm with a median value of 209 36 0 μs cm table 1 the ph for the turkwel river samples was slightly alkaline ranging from 7 5 to 8 0 slightly less alkaline waters are noted eastwards of the confluence of the turkwel and kawalase rivers fig 2 the river water was quite warm with temperatures ranging from 30 6 c to 36 1 c and was slightly cooler than the maximum daily temperature ca 38 c experienced in the area during the sampling period the minimum turbidity median 311 ntu was 96 00 ntu recorded in the westernmost upstream sample while the maximum value of 834 00 ntu was recorded in the town area table 1 no clearly discernible features are observed in the concentrations of the cations from upstream to downstream except for na which increases markedly east of the confluence of turkwel and kawalase rivers table 1 fig 2 and relatively high fe and mn content for the measured anions sulphate and nitrites were not detected while the concentrations of nitrate chloride and bicarbonate are generally low table 1 3 1 2 groundwater a shallow aquifer 1 alluvial aquifer the range of ec values varied markedly between the dry seasons and the wet season in the saa minimum ec values were more or less similar 195 207 μs cm for the dry seasons versus 210 μs cm for the wet season but the ec maximum in the wet season was three times higher than in either of the dry seasons 1857 μs cm versus 630 632 μs cm table 2 similarly while the range for the ph during the dry seasons was 7 60 8 22 it was higher during the wet season ranging from 7 65 to 8 91 besides a two and a five fold increase is also seen in maximum turbidity values in the wet season as compared to each of the two dry seasons no significant variations are observed for groundwater temperature which ranged from 28 1 to 35 7 c in terms of chemistry the groundwater can be categorized as non saline except for napuu 1 borehole which was slightly saline in the february 2018 dry season the only time that it was sampled with respect to the median concentrations of the cations ca is similar across the two dry and one wet season mg and k are depleted in the february 2019 dry season compared to the february 2018 dry season and the may 2018 wet season and na in the wet season is strongly depleted relative to the two dry seasons for the anions the february 2018 season has the highest concentrations for hco3 so4 and cl while the may 2018 wet season has the least the f concentrations are comparable across the three seasons nitrate levels are generally low relative to the entire dataset significant site specific anomalies are noted for ca very low kakemera primary handpump wet season may 2018 na high bh7 dry season february 2019 k high kfs handpump wet season may 2018 and so4 very high bh7 dry season february 2019 high napuu 1 dry season february 2018 2 turkana grit aquifer for this aquifer data are available for one dry season february 2019 and one wet season may 2018 table 3 few handpumps were targeting this aquifer probably as a consequence of its water which falls in the moderately saline category no marked differences are observed in the ec of some samples between the dry and wet seasons except for the bokotom handpump however the ec range for the shallow groundwater of the turkana grit was slightly lower in the wet 3410 6840 μs cm than in the dry 5170 8260 μs cm season as in the case of the saa while the minimum ph values were more or less the same 8 35 versus 8 40 the maximum ph for this aquifer was markedly higher in the wet 9 28 than in the dry 8 68 season and there was a three fold difference in maximum turbidity between the dry 7 64 ntu and wet 20 86 ntu seasons temperature which was only measured during the wet season ranged from 33 1 to 36 9 c indicating that overall the shallow turkana grit aquifer is warmer than the saa in comparison with the saa the na cl and hco3 concentrations are much higher and in most cases the concentrations of all three parameters each exceed 1000 mg l also of note is that i the ca concentrations are lower in the tgsa compared to the saa and ii the so4 f and no3 concentrations are much higher than in the saa contrasts between the dry and wet seasons in the tgsa relate to i higher median values for mg so4 f and no3 concentrations in the wet compared to the dry season except for the loyo primary handpump where the reverse is observed and ii lower median cl concentration values in the wet compared to the dry season though direct comparison of wells reveals that this is not necessarily so for some of them the relatively high sulphate concentration in this aquifer suggests the presence of sulphate reducing bacteria and the existence of a reducing environment handpumps with the highest so4 concentration bennett et al 2000 keesari and ramakumar 2015 bokotom hp 610 mg l and trumpet of hope 608 06 mg l had a strong hydrogen sulphide smell suggesting that so4 2 was being reduced to h2s in the aquifer b intermediate aquifer for this aquifer data was available for the two dry and one wet season but is limited for the first dry season of february 2018 2 samples only table 4 based on the ec the groundwater in the ia is mostly non saline but there are some slightly saline pockets similar to the saa while the minimum ec values were similar in both the dry and wet seasons the ec maximum was higher in the wet season but not markedly as in the saa the ph range during the wet season 7 61 9 76 was wider than in the dry season 8 10 8 67 also similar to the saa and tgsa the maximum turbidity during the wet season was much higher than in the dry season and in this aquifer a seven fold increase is observed for the maximum turbidity values recorded in the wet versus the dry season the temperature range of the groundwater is 31 3 36 0 c broadly comparable to that of the tgsa in this aquifer the median concentration values of ca mg k hco3 so4 and cl are higher during the wet season compared to the dry season and much more so for mg and so4 in particular more generally the ranges of the concentrations of the measured cations and anions are wider and more variable during the wet season than in the dry season c deep aquifer the results for the physico chemical parameters for the da during the dry seasons february 2018 and 2019 and during the wet season may 2018 are given in table 5 for each of the two deep borehole sites there are no marked wet dry season differences in the physico chemical parameters suggesting that recharge occurs over timescales longer than the seasonal cycles however the natir borehole is non saline while the napuu 1 borehole is slightly saline but they have relatively similar ph temperature and turbidity values as well as ca k and fe concentrations relative to the saa and ia the ca concentrations are comparable mg and na concentrations in napuu 1 are similar to those of the ia while in natir they are similar to the saa dry season values 3 1 3 spatial variations of physical parameters the spatial variations in the physical parameters ec ph and temperature indicate a number of features of the laas fig 3 the ec values are lowest in the groundwater along with the quasi perennial turkwel river profile in the holocene age alluvial sediments and also where there exist seasonal and ephemeral feeder streams and more generally increase in the directions perpendicular n and s to the streamflow trend e highest ec values are associated with where the turkana grits or the miocene nepheline phonolites outcrop or lie close to the surface masked by quaternary deposits similar trends are observed for the ph and temperature where the lowest ph and temperature are next to the turkwel river and its associated tributaries and the highest ph and temperatures are associated with the turkana grits and the nepheline phonolites 3 2 hydrochemical facies based on the piper diagram fig 4 a four water types were identified from the surface water and groundwater samples of the study area na hco3 ca hco3 na cl and mg hco3 all the surface water samples were ca hco3 type of water in the saa the facies are ca hco3 59 na hco3 29 mg hco3 12 in the tgsa the facies are na hco3 56 na cl 44 with the former characterizing the contact zone area of the grit and holocene sediments and the latter characterizing the grit proper the ia facies was na hco3 95 mg hco3 5 with only katapakori and narengelup handpumps belonging to the mg hco3 water type the two samples of the da had different facies napuu was na hco3 and natirnalulung was ca hco3 mg hco3 water type occurred in isolated areas such as akwanga nakadukui and naregai there is evidence of some seasonal variations in hydrochemical facies for example some samples 55 with dominant na hco3 water type during the dry season changed to dominant ca hco3water type during the wet season fig 4b bh 7 a municipal water supply borehole changed from ca hco3 in the wet season of may 2018 to na hco3 during the dry season of february 2019 also the kakemera church hp of the ia which was na hco3 type in the wet season became na cl water type during the dry season 3 3 rock water interactions 3 3 1 ion exchange and mineral saturation indices sodium in natural waters originates from the dissolution of feldspars or cation exchange reactions the source for cl is as an impurity in minerals e g biotite or rocks e g limestone thus natural concentrations are typically below about 15 mg l for each ion and are highly variable hem 1970 if the na cl ratios are generally greater than 1 it suggests the sodium sources other than halite albite and therefore from ion exchange reactions a ratios of na cl 1 i e 1 1 indicates sources from halite dissolution or sea aerosol spray and a na cl ratio 1 suggests sources from reverse ion exchange abid et al 2011 parnachev et al 1999 zhu et al 2008 higher na cl ratio in the wet season 3 09 compared to the dry season 2 74 suggests remobilisation of some na into solution during recharge the bokotom hp sample is unique in that it is the only sample that falls on the halite dissolution line fig 5 a and b the tgsa had the highest na concentrations followed by those of the ia then those with unknown depths and lastly those in the saa fig 5c and d these data suggest that most of the samples with unknown depth lie within saa and in the geological transition zone of the tgsa and the ia grits and the holocene sediments respectively the majority of the groundwater samples during the wet season 87 and in the dry season 54 had na cl ratios 1 0 suggesting dominant ion exchange while reverse ion exchange occurs in a few samples ion exchange is a major hydrochemical process in the aquifer system in both the wet and dry seasons fig 5c and d cf fisher and mullican 1997 in the entire aquifer system calcium and magnesium carbonates were generally at or near saturation during both the wet and dry seasons with fluorite being slightly undersaturated and anhydrite gypsum ca sulphates moderately so fig 6 siderite is slight to moderately undersaturated with the exception of the tgsa where it is near saturation in the wet season and saturated in the dry season sylvite is moderate to strongly undersaturated except in the saa where it is only slightly undersaturated while halite is moderate to strongly undersaturated in all cases mn carbonate is close to saturation in saa tgsa and ia saturated in the dry season but strongly undersaturated in the da the behaviour of the mn oxyhydroxides is quite interesting in the saa they are moderate to strongly undersaturated in the wet season and moderately to strongly saturated during the dry season while in the tgsa the reverse is the case in the ia they are saturated in both the wet and dry seasons and in the da they are moderate to strongly undersaturated in both seasons further the mn behaviour in the du is similar to the saa see fig 7 3 3 2 hierarchical cluster analysis the hierarchical cluster analysis very neatly differentiates the three main sub components of the aquifer system tgsa saa and ia particularly in the dry season it also indicates that of the two da samples one is closely affiliated with the saa and the other with the ia the wet season is more mixed probably as a consequence of spatial and temporal differentials in flow rates and amounts and or dilution across a heterogeneous aquifer system by pulsed dynamic recharge the groundwater of the saa belongs to cluster 1 c1 sub group 1 characterised by low mineral content during the wet and dry season fig 8 the highly mineralised groundwater in the tgsa belongs to cluster 3 c3 during the wet and dry season with the unique bokotom hp forming cluster 4 c4 in both seasons fig 8 the hca suggests that two factors influence the groundwater chemistry of the ia in the wet and dry seasons 1 the proximity to the turkwel river cluster c1 and 2 proximity to the turkana grits formation c1 sub group 2 and c2a for the da the hca revealed that the groundwater of natirnalulung bh belongs to cluster c1 during the wet and dry season while that of the napuu bh belongs to c1 sub group 2 during the wet season and c2a during the dry season an indication of enriched mineral concentrations the hca of the samples during the wet and dry seasons revealed that of the 44 boreholes and handpumps with unknown drilled depth 22 belonged to the saa cluster 1 13 in the ia seven 7 in the transition zone between the holocene sediments and the turkana grits and while only two 2 were in the turkana grit aquifer 3 3 3 principal components analysis the first two pc scores explain 58 5 and 57 7 of the variance in the dataset in the wet and dry seasons respectively similar to the hca there is a clear and matching differentiation of the different sub components of the aquifer system the tgsa exhibits the highest positive pc1 scores which decline progressively through the du the ia and finally the saa which exhibits the most negative pc1 scores this progression holds for both the wet and dry seasons during the wet season the parameters with high positive pc1 scores are ec na hco3 so4 cl and f while the one with a high negative pc1 score is only ca for wet season pc2 high positive scores are noted for ca mg and k and a high negative score for ph during the dry season high positive pc1 scores are exhibited by ph ec na hco3 so4 cl f and no3 similar to the wet season but with the addition of f and no3 and a high negative score by ca similar to the wet season while pc2 has a high positive score only for k as opposed to ca ma and k for the wet season and high negative scores for ph ca and mg as opposed to only ca in the wet season it is likely therefore that the positive pc1 for both wet and dry seasons reflects predominantly the mineralisation gradient of the aquifer system with older aquifer sub components such as the tgsa being the most mineralised ca with a negative pc1 in both seasons likely strongly participates in dissolution precipitation reactions this is supported by the mineral saturation indices fig 8 which show that it is saturated in all the aquifer systems the inclusion of f and no3 in the pc1 dry season could reflect preferential leaching and degradation of organic matter accumulated in the aquifer during recharge processes respectively pc2 during both seasons appears to be reflective of ion exchange processes involving ca mg and k primarily in the wet season and strongly ph modulated ca mg reactions inclusive of dissolution precipitation reactions during the dry season 4 discussion 4 1 natural factors influencing groundwater chemistry as is common for tropical rivers the ec values for the turkwel river are low but a downstream increase is observed coupled with an increase in ph which is likely related to high baseflow contribution to river flow and higher ion contributions relative to surface runoff contributions higher turbidity in the town area could reflect inputs of fine sediments from disturbances agricultural activities along the riverbanks subsidiary seasonal ephemeral streams such as the kawalase also contribute to higher dissolved ion species content as reflected by the marked increase in na concentrations east of its confluence with the turkwel river the ca hco3 water facies suggests that the water is derived from a primarily metamorphic volcanic terrain with plagioclase feldspars being the main source of the ca ion this study has determined that the shallow alluvial aquifer in recent alluvial deposits the intermediate aquifer in mid holocene alluvial deposits and the deep aquifer in early holocene alluvial deposits fig 2 are an interlinked system whose chemistry varies with geology the degree of interaction with the turkwel river and the age of the groundwater it confirms the earlier hypotheses that the turkwel river replenishes the shallow groundwater of the study area hirpa et al 2018 olago 2018 the turkana grit shallow aquifer however represents a separate and distinct sedimentary groundwater source that is found on either side of the river as is common for shallow alluvial aquifers in arid areas where the river and groundwater facies are similar ledesma ruiz et al 2015 varol and şekerci 2018 the ca hco3 water type was the dominant water facies in the saa which was similar to that of the turkwel river the geology at the source and along the reach of the turkwel river which comprises volcanics in the highlands metamorphics in the midlands and a mix of metamorphics and volcanics in the lowlands influence the chemistry of the turkwel river and consequently that of the groundwater in the saa ia and da east of the confluence of the turkwel and kawalase rivers the higher alkalinity na and fe concentrations in the river and the associated alluvial aquifer system are related to the dominantly metamorphic source and reach of the kawalase river generally electrical conductivity is lowest in the saa which has a ca hco3 water type intermediate in the ia and da and highest in the tgsa which has a na hco3 na cl water type these transitions reflect increasing mineral content of the groundwater seasonal recharge pulses from the turkwel river strongly influence the aquifer chemistry in the saa and ia while direct rainfall recharge has a similar effect on the tgsa in the da however there are no marked wet dry season differences in the physico chemical parameters suggesting that for this aquifer recharge occurs over timescales longer than the seasonal cycles although hca suggests that there is some interaction between the ia and the napuu bh higher turbidity in the saa ia and tgsa groundwater during the wet season as compared to the dry season relate to the river recharge pulses that convey colloids into the groundwater system the river itself is visibly loaded with mud and silt during the rainy season evaluation of the seasonal variation in the water facies showed that the na hco3 water type of the groundwater in the transition zone between the recent alluvial deposits and the holocene alluvial sediments switched to ca hco3 during the wet season indicating dilution processes related to turkwel river recharge the mg hco3 water facies occurred as pockets in the saa and the intermediate aquifer and is related to localised geological formations such as dolomite abid et al 2011 ansari and umar 2019 liu et al 2019 and in our case likely reflects the remobilisation of discrete micrite crystals that may have been precipitated in the matrices of the soil and upper layers of the unconfined groundwater cf johnson and graham 2000 and their dissolution and remobilisation during recharge rainfall events the hydrochemical characteristics of the tgsa is typical of a highly mineralised groundwater system suggesting a very long groundwater residence time pilla et al 2006 tay and kortatsi 2008 joshi et al 2018 and in addition to rock water interactions the relative mineral enrichment in the dry season as compared to the wet season could also be related to evaporation processes chowdhury et al 2018 rock water interactions are also key in evaluating the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater okiongbo and akpofure 2015 toran and saunders 1999 yazdizadeh et al 2019 the existence of na hco3 water type subsidiary to ca hco3 in the saa and dominant in the tgsa is an indication of dominant ion exchange processes in the aquifer the complex chemistry of the groundwater of the study was simplified using the hca where cluster 1 represents dilute groundwater saa and cluster 4 represents highly mineralised groundwater tgsa the hca revealed that two factors influence the groundwater chemistry of the ia in the wet and dry seasons 1 the proximity to the turkwel river cluster c1 and 2 proximity to the turkana grits formation c2 and c3 hca was also useful in identifying the categories in which the boreholes and handpumps with unknown drilled depth belonged within the saa ia and the tgsa of interest is the similarity in groundwater chemistry of the natir bh of the da and that of the saa while the napuu bh has typical characteristics of the ia the former could likely be related to a strong hydrological recharge pulse at the confluence of the turkwel and kawalase rivers during rainy seasons a unique feature in the tgsa is the bokotom hp where halite dissolution abid et al 2011 ansari and umar 2019 chenini et al 2010 zhu et al 2008 is prominent in both seasons the principal components analysis revealed that the pc1 in the dry and wet seasons reflects the mineralisation gradient in the aquifers with the tgsa being the most mineralised and mineral enrichment during the dry season was a common characteristic in all the aquifers pc2 during both seasons was reflective of ion exchange processes involving ca mg and k primarily in the wet season and strongly ph modulated ca mg reactions inclusive of dissolution precipitation reactions during the dry season 4 2 anthropogenic activities influencing groundwater chemistry shallow alluvial aquifers are considered highly vulnerable to pollution muhammad et al 2015 yidana et al 2010 the concentrations of nitrate and sulphate in the groundwater were used to evaluate the anthropogenic influence on the groundwater quality with the consideration that microbially mediated reactions within the aquifer can also be major contributors to their concentrations lapworth et al 2017 mcmahon 2001 and there is one handpump where the latter process is dominant the presence of sulphate in groundwater is due to leaching of dissolved salts and other sulphate rich minerals from domestic wastes jhariya et al 2018 on the other hand nitrate in groundwater is due to domestic sewage and agricultural chemicals guo et al 2019 lathamani et al 2015 morán ramírez et al 2016 natural nitrate concentration in groundwater is generally far below 10 mg n l who 2011 concentrations above this value reflect contributions from human activities miljević et al 2012 the tgsa has non potable groundwater and is not discussed further in this section although so4 2 and no3 concentrations were within the guideline values for drinking water in the shallow alluvial intermediate and deep aquifers the concentrations were observed to increase during the wet season except for the da napuu bh poor sanitation unregulated waste disposal and the lack of sewerage facilities olago 2018 hirpa et al 2018 pose critical human induced risks to the laas the geological characteristics and urban setting make the saa ia and da highly vulnerable to pollution but it is still generally uncontaminated with no networked sewerage infrastructure on site sanitation septic tanks or pit latrines are prevalent enhancing the threat of direct contamination of the aquifer system particularly through leakages and flooding increased so4 2 and no3 concentrations in the wet season may also be attributed to upstream farming activities on site animal watering contributed to higher no3 concentrations in natirnalulung bh the proposed large scale irrigation projects ndma 2016 oecd fao 2016 olago 2018 upstream of the lodwar municipality may lead to high levels of nitrates and sulphates in the saa ia and da it has been noted that the drivers of the groundwater problems such as overexploitation and contamination are often outside the water sector and thus the solutions must be based on interventions from several sectors baki et al 2017 shady et al 2005 shen 2015 4 3 aquifer exploitation and management the shallow alluvial and intermediate aquifers are the main sources of drinking water to an estimated population of 91 766 in 2019 and up to 140 914 people in 2030 living in lodwar municipality this trend in population increase will subsequently lead to an increase in water demand a study of the turkwel river basin that considered linked scenarios of climate change and water demand in the 2030s and 2080s indicates that increased water demand particularly due to expanded irrigation along with droughts and climate variability adversely affects depletes the river basin s water resource system including the groundwater resource hirpa et al 2018 the laas characterised in this study as being highly sensitive to natural and anthropogenic factors and pressures including those in the distant upstream areas of turkwel river is therefore a strategic resource that needs to be protected from both regional and local perspectives the findings of this study revealed that apart from fe and mn in some of the boreholes and handpumps in both seasons and turbidity during the wet season the chemical concentrations in the saa were within the drinking water guidelines who 2011 kebs 2014 these excesses can be managed with relatively inexpensive treatment systems this study has shown that the tgsa aquifer should be completely avoided as the ec na cl f and no3 concentrations in the tgsa exceed the recommended guideline values who 2011 kebs 2014 for drinking water during the wet and dry seasons some water sources of the intermediate aquifer during the wet and dry seasons had ph na hco3 and f above the recommended guidelines for drinking water who 2011 kebs 2014 in both seasons high turbidity in some wells of this aquifer may also indicate possible bacterial contamination bennett et al 2000 khatri and tyagi 2014 lapworth et al 2017 and microbial content should be investigated fluoride is in some cases only slightly more than the recommended limit for drinking water apart from slightly higher na concentration in the napuu bh in the wet and dry seasons not a major concern the groundwater of the deep aquifer meets the drinking water quality standards evaluation of the groundwater chemistry in these aquifers indicates high vulnerability to both natural and anthropogenic pollution the current groundwater management approaches depend majorly on the institutional strengths in the individual countries shen 2015 with no major considerations to the varied hydrogeological regimes domestic industrial and agricultural water demands based on the current knowledge of the lodwar aquifers and the related prevailing threats to the turkwel basin hirpa et al 2018 strengthening the institutions that oversee or manage the resource a multi sectoral approach towards the protection and sustainability of the turkwel watershed are required in addition effective and regulated aquifer exploitation foster and chilton 2003 sanz et al 2016 will ensure optimum pumping rates aimed at minimizing over abstraction managing the seasonal variability of water chemistry and avoiding mixing of saline and fluoride rich aquifer zones regular groundwater quality monitoring kumar et al 2009 sanz et al 2016 will also help to evaluate if pumping rates are affecting the water quality beyond the current established range of expected seasonal water quality variability of the aquifers in the area 5 conclusions the purpose of this investigation was to determine and characterize the hydrogeochemistry of lodwar municipality s strategic alluvial aquifer and evaluate the natural and anthropogenic factors influencing its chemistry and quality providing scientific evidence for sustainable safe exploitation and management integration of statistical approaches and geochemical methods were applied to investigate the groundwater system that is used by the lodwar municipality for water supplies the results revealed heterogeneous aquifer systems with significant temporal and spatial variations in groundwater chemistry generally two distinct shallow aquifers of depth 30 m underlies lodwar and its environs the saa along the turkwel river which is the main source of freshwater and the shallow aquifer of the turkana grit that is highly saline and with fluoride contamination localised human activities such as over pumping and localised rock water interactions resulted in alteration of the groundwater chemistry in the area the use of pca has enabled the determination of the aquifer processes during the wet season and in the dry season related to complex geological hydrological and climatic variations the application of hca to the groundwater samples led to the classification of the groundwater with unknown drilled depth within the saa ia and the tgsa where the majority were in the transition zone between the holocene sediments and the turkana grits formations the overall groundwater chemistry in the area is subject to seasonal variability and varied geological formations most shallow alluvial aquifers are dominated by ca hco3 water facies comprising freshwater in the region investigation of changes in hydrochemical facies indicated that increased pumping activities result in an alteration of na hco3 water type to na cl which is unsuitable for drinking thus regulation on abstraction activities in such aquifers in arid areas is key to keeping the groundwater chemistry stable within the bounds of natural variability fluoride contamination is a major problem in many aquifers in arid areas globally while irrigated agriculture and the use of fertilizers within the turkwel river basin as a whole has both quantity and quality implications for the laas and other groundwater systems in the region in the face of the water security challenges in arid and semi arid regions urban water suppliers should undertake more comprehensive hydrogeological and hydrochemical surveys to assess aquifer sustainability and current and future risks besides careful land management and multi stakeholder approaches in watershed management are required to ensure that water quality risks to turkwel river and the laas are identified and mitigated there is a need for further groundwater monitoring to establish short to long term trends in water quality and quantity to inform on adaptive management

12103,lodwar municipality is one of the fastest growing urban areas of sub saharan africa that depends mainly on groundwater for its municipal water supply most of the groundwater sources are located within the riparian zones of the turkwel river with limited understanding of its aquifers the groundwater of lodwar may be at risk of natural processes and anthropogenic activities statistical techniques and geochemical methods were applied to determine the aquifer hydrogeochemistry three distinct aquifers which we collectively refer to as the lodwar alluvial aquifer system underlie lodwar and its environs the shallow alluvial intermediate and deep aquifers which are the main source of fresh water a fourth the shallow aquifer of the turkana grit is highly saline and with fluoride contamination just as the turkwel river the shallow alluvial aquifer saa was dominated by ca hco3 water type while the tgsa was na cl water type and became na hco3 near the holocene sediments the intermediate aquifer ia was na hco3water type pockets of mg hco3 water occurred in the shallow alluvial and intermediate aquifers the natural processes in the saa include rock water interaction recharge by surface water and oxidation reactions while evaporation and dissolution are the major factors controlling the chemistry of the tgsa ion exchange dilution and dissolution are the major processes in the ia elevated levels of no3 and so4 2 during the wet season within the saa and the ia reflects their vulnerability to pollution saline intrusion into the shallow and intermediate

range from simple to highly complex systems bloomfield et al 2008 chilton and seiler 2006 alluvial aquifers are generally highly susceptible to contamination elangovan and dharmendirakumar 2013 and climate and hydrological variability andrés doménech et al 2015 kundzewicz et al 2008 and particularly so because they are strongly dependent on rivers whether perennial seasonal or ephemeral for recharge in order to achieve safe water and sanitation for urban and rural settlements in asals there is need for a sufficient evidence base to sustainably manage the groundwater resources xu et al 2019 guppy et al 2018 iwmi 2016 jac van der 2012 and to meet national and international commitments for sustainable development including the sdgs un 2018 iwmi 2016 generally in any area groundwater chemistry is unique due to several processes subramani et al 2009 more specifically the groundwater chemistry and quality of alluvial aquifers is a function of both natural processes and anthropogenic activities khatri and tyagi 2014 hamilton et al 2015 muhammad et al 2015 pérez villarreal et al 2019 peter 2001 and thus it is important to characterize each aquifer to better understand its potential for sustainable supply of potable and safe water for various uses under rapidly changing climatic environmental and developmental scenarios the natural influences which lead to water chemistry and hence quality changes in the aquifers include intensive evaporation li et al 2014 rock water interaction chenini et al 2010 earle 2013 okiongbo and akpofure 2015 sheikhy narany et al 2014 mixing of different recharge waters li et al 2014 subramani et al 2009 and large fluctuations in storage related to a linked river s hydrological regime earle 2013 yang et al 2018 anthropogenic factors contributing to groundwater quality changes include on site sanitation systems unregulated sewage and municipal waste disposal industrial effluents and fertilizer pesticide use in agriculture kumari et al 2014 garba abdullahi et al 2014 these anthropogenic influences can result for example in increased concentrations of heavy metals coliforms and nutrient loads khatri and tyagi 2014 and may render a safe groundwater source unusable for millennia once contaminated frind et al 2006 sharma and chhipa 2016 although lodwar municipality depends largely on groundwater for its municipal water supply olago 2018 hirpa et al 2018 no comprehensive hydrogeochemical studies have been carried out on the groundwater system the purpose of this paper is to characterize the hydrogeochemistry of the lodwar municipality s strategic alluvial aquifer system in north western kenya and to evaluate the natural and anthropogenic factors that influence its water chemistry and quality providing the evidence base for its sustainable and safe exploitation and management the research demonstrates for the first time the important role of pulsed hydrological recharge in maintaining potable water quality and quantities in the lodwar alluvial aquifer system a close link between groundwater chemistry and seasonal fluctuations in climate as well as to land uses in the expansive turkwel river and kawalase river catchments and lodwar municipality itself reflects the sensitivity of the system to climate variability and change and to human factors that go well beyond the remit of the current water management regime with the evidence presented it will be possible to monitor and plan for safe and sustainable water supplies under present and future demands and risks for towns in similar water insecure environments where groundwater may be the critical dimension for sustainability 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area longitude 35 32 0 to 35 48 0 and latitudes 3 0 0 to 3 15 0 covers 1040 km2 and envelopes lodwar municipality which is located in the downstream section of the turkwel river basin in the north western part of kenya fig 1 the turkwel river originates from the uganda side of the humid mount elgon hirpa et al 2018 and flows north eastwards to semi arid lodwar municipality where it bends to follow an easterly trend eventually draining into lake turkana the turkwel river basin has a catchment area of 23 740 km2 and rainfall within the basin ranges from 900 to 1749 mm year in the humid mount elgon region hirpa et al 2018 to only 217 mm in lodwar municipality opiyo et al 2014 lodwar municipality is the largest urban centre in north western kenya and is the headquarters of the turkana county the municipality depends entirely on groundwater supplies with supply boreholes located on the riparian zones of the turkwel river hirpa et al 2018 olago 2018 the study area received brief rainfalls that come with violent storms resulting in flash floods long rains are expected from march to may mam long rains season and october to november early december ond short rains season opiyo et al 2014 the surface runoff can be high opiyo et al 2014 and potential evaporation rates 1650 2800 mm year are extremely high ndma 2016 olago 2018 the two rainy seasons in the year are separated by two dry seasons the hot dry season from mid december to february djf and the relatively cooler dry season from june to september jjas the geology of the area fig 2 which we updated based on fieldwork analysis and ground truthing of remotely

widespread and blanket most of the older geological formations while holocene sediments and alluvium deposits are found along the turkwel river and the major streams in the area walsh and dodson 1969 2 2 water sampling and analysis 2 2 1 fieldwork groundwater and surface water samples were collected from the study area during two dry february 2018 and february 2019 seasons and one wet may 2018 season and the geographical coordinates of all the sampling sites were recorded the 12 groundwater samples and seven turkwel river samples that were collected within the study area and included in this paper during the 2018 dry season form a subset of a wider sample collection that extended to the western shoreline of lake turkana during the 2018 wet season 94 groundwater samples from 53 handpumps and 41 boreholes electric or solar pump operated were collected including re sampled february 2018 sites information on the drilled depth of each handpump and borehole was not fully available there was information on drilled depth for 28 handpumps depth range 5 45 m with one reported outlier at 75 m 17 of these were less than 30 m below the site specific ground level elevation above sea level and therefore fall in the shallow aquifer category cf olago 2018 likewise 22 boreholes had drilled depth information including all nine lowasco production boreholes their depths ranged from 17 to 110 m of these ten 10 were between 16 and 30 m depth and were categorized as a shallow aquifer similarly the other ten 10 boreholes were in the ia category and two 2 were in the deep aquifer category of the nine lowasco production boreholes seven were in the shallow aquifer category and two were in the da category cf olago 2018 during the 2019 dry season 58 of the 94 groundwater sites comprising 31 handpumps and 27 boreholes were re sampled including all the february 2018 sites of these 16 handpumps and 18 boreholes all also sampled in the 2018 wet season had drilled depth information the number of sampled sites without drilled depth information was 25 handpumps and 19 boreholes the field parameters that were measured with the exception of the february 2019 set of samples were electrical conductivity ph and temperature using a hand held combo tester hi98129 two sets of water samples were collected from each sampling site for cation and anion determinations respectively clean polythene bottles with air tight caps were used as sampling containers and each bottle was rinsed with distilled water before sampling three drops of analytical grade 1 nitric acid were used to preserve the cation samples the bottles were labeled and then stored in a cool box for transportation to nairobi and refrigerated at 4 c in the laboratory 2 2 2 laboratory the laboratory analyses included turbidity hardness total alkalinity major anions hco3 so4 f cl co3 no3 no2 and cations ca mg na k fe and mn at the central water testing laboratory nairobi all samples were first filtered through 0 45 μm membrane filters all the analytical procedures for anion and cation measurements were undertaken in accordance with the apha manual apha 1995 turbidity was measured for all the surface water and groundwater samples in the laboratory using the mrc turbidimeter model and reported in nephelometric turbidity units ntu total hardness alkalinity free carbon dioxide ca and mg were determined using titrimetric methods na and k were determined using flame photometric methods utilizing a jenway pfp7 flame photometer while the iron was measured using phenanthroline using a jenway calorimeter 6051 manganese was measured using the persulphate method the argentometric method was used for cl ion selective electrode method for f the spectrophotometric method using a uv vis spectrophotometer 1240 shimadzu for nitrate the calorimetric method for nitrite with jenway calorimeter 6051 and turbidimetric method for sulphate 2 2 3 analysis a total of 38 groundwater samples were classified as shallow aquifer along the turkwel river while ten were in the turkana grit further away from the river the intermediate aquifer ia had 44 samples and the deep aquifer had only two samples all the groundwater samples 164 had a charge balance error of 5 huh et al 1998 while for surface water 7 five samples had a charge balance error of 5 while two samples had a charge balance error less than 10 aquachem 2014 2 was used to generate piper diagrams and determine the hydrochemical facies of the surface water and groundwater seasonal variations in groundwater facies were evaluated using 58 samples that were collected during the may 2018 wet season and the february 2019 dry season additionally 11 groundwater samples that were collected in the 2018 and 2019 dry seasons were included in the evaluation golden software surfer 14 0 was used to plot the spatial maps of the physico chemical parameters while microsoft excel and xlstat 2019 add in were used for principal component analysis and hierarchical cluster analysis hca utilizing group average clustering and euclidean distance methods based on dissimilarities islam et al 2017 ravikumar and somashekar 2015 zhang et al 2011 of the groundwater samples the significance of seasonal variations in water chemistry was determined using discriminant function analysis the geochemical results were compared with the world health organization who and the kenya bureau of standards kebs guidelines for drinking water quality where applicable rock water interactions were examined for each aquifer system using the ionic relations and cation exchange principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses and mineral saturation indices mineral saturation indices in groundwater were determined using the phreqc interactive software ansari and umar 2019 coetsiers et al 2009 3 results 3 1 physico chemical characteristics 3 1 1 turkwel river the electrical conductivity ec in the turkwel river indicates a narrow range from 200 0 to 420 0 μs cm with a median value of 209 36 0 μs cm table 1 the ph for the turkwel river samples was slightly alkaline ranging from 7 5 to 8 0 slightly less alkaline waters are noted eastwards of the confluence of the turkwel and kawalase rivers fig 2 the river water was quite warm with temperatures ranging from 30 6 c to 36 1 c and was slightly cooler than the maximum daily temperature ca 38 c experienced in the area during the sampling period the minimum turbidity median 311 ntu was 96 00 ntu recorded in the westernmost upstream sample while the maximum value of 834 00 ntu was recorded in the town area table 1 no clearly discernible features are observed in the concentrations of the cations from upstream to downstream except for na which increases markedly east of the confluence of turkwel and kawalase rivers table 1 fig 2 and relatively high fe and mn content for the measured anions sulphate and nitrites were not detected while the concentrations of nitrate chloride and bicarbonate are generally low table 1 3 1 2 groundwater a shallow aquifer 1 alluvial aquifer the range of ec values varied markedly between the dry seasons and the wet season in the saa minimum ec values were more or less similar 195 207 μs cm for the dry seasons versus 210 μs cm for the wet season but the ec maximum in the wet season was three times higher than in either of the dry seasons 1857 μs cm versus 630 632 μs cm table 2 similarly while the range for the ph during the dry seasons was 7 60 8 22 it was higher during the wet season ranging from 7 65 to 8 91 besides a two and a five fold increase is also seen in maximum turbidity values in the wet season as compared to each of the two dry seasons no significant variations are observed for groundwater temperature which ranged from 28 1 to 35 7 c in terms of chemistry the groundwater can be categorized as non saline except for napuu 1 borehole which was slightly saline in the february 2018 dry season the only time that it was sampled with respect to the median concentrations of the cations ca is similar across the two dry and one wet season mg and k are depleted in the february 2019 dry season compared to the february 2018 dry season and the may 2018 wet season and na in the wet season is strongly depleted relative to the two dry seasons for the anions the february 2018 season has the highest concentrations for hco3 so4 and cl while the may 2018 wet season has the least the f concentrations are comparable across the three seasons nitrate levels are generally low relative to the entire dataset significant site specific anomalies are noted for ca very low kakemera primary handpump wet season may 2018 na high bh7 dry season february 2019 k high kfs handpump wet season may 2018 and so4 very high bh7 dry season february 2019 high napuu 1 dry season february 2018 2 turkana grit aquifer for this aquifer data are available for one dry season february 2019 and one wet season may 2018 table 3 few handpumps were targeting this aquifer probably as a consequence of its water which falls in the moderately saline category no marked differences are observed in the ec of some samples between the dry and wet seasons except for the bokotom handpump however the ec range for the shallow groundwater of the turkana grit was slightly lower in the wet 3410 6840 μs cm than in the dry 5170 8260 μs cm season as in the case of the saa while the minimum ph values were more or less the same 8 35 versus 8 40 the maximum ph for this aquifer was markedly higher in the wet 9 28 than in the dry 8 68 season and there was a three fold difference in maximum turbidity between the dry 7 64 ntu and wet 20 86 ntu seasons temperature which was only measured during the wet season ranged from 33 1 to 36 9 c indicating that overall the shallow turkana grit aquifer is warmer than the saa in comparison with the saa the na cl and hco3 concentrations are much higher and in most cases the concentrations of all three parameters each exceed 1000 mg l also of note is that i the ca concentrations are lower in the tgsa compared to the saa and ii the so4 f and no3 concentrations are much higher than in the saa contrasts between the dry and wet seasons in the tgsa relate to i higher median values for mg so4 f and no3 concentrations in the wet compared to the dry season except for the loyo primary handpump where the reverse is observed and ii lower median cl concentration values in the wet compared to the dry season though direct comparison of wells reveals that this is not necessarily so for some of them the relatively high sulphate concentration in this aquifer suggests the presence of sulphate reducing bacteria and the existence of a reducing environment handpumps with the highest so4 concentration bennett et al 2000 keesari and ramakumar 2015 bokotom hp 610 mg l and trumpet of hope 608 06 mg l had a strong hydrogen sulphide smell suggesting that so4 2 was being reduced to h2s in the aquifer b intermediate aquifer for this aquifer data was available for the two dry and one wet season but is limited for the first dry season of february 2018 2 samples only table 4 based on the ec the groundwater in the ia is mostly non saline but there are some slightly saline pockets similar to the saa while the minimum ec values were similar in both the dry and wet seasons the ec maximum was higher in the wet season but not markedly as in the saa the ph range during the wet season 7 61 9 76 was wider than in the dry season 8 10 8 67 also similar to the saa and tgsa the maximum turbidity during the wet season was much higher than in the dry season and in this aquifer a seven fold increase is observed for the maximum turbidity values recorded in the wet versus the dry season the temperature range of the groundwater is 31 3 36 0 c broadly comparable to that of the tgsa in this aquifer the median concentration values of ca mg k hco3 so4 and cl are higher during the wet season compared to the dry season and much more so for mg and so4 in particular more generally the ranges of the concentrations of the measured cations and anions are wider and more variable during the wet season than in the dry season c deep aquifer the results for the physico chemical parameters for the da during the dry seasons february 2018 and 2019 and during the wet season may 2018 are given in table 5 for each of the two deep borehole sites there are no marked wet dry season differences in the physico chemical parameters suggesting that recharge occurs over timescales longer than the seasonal cycles however the natir borehole is non saline while the napuu 1 borehole is slightly saline but they have relatively similar ph temperature and turbidity values as well as ca k and fe concentrations relative to the saa and ia the ca concentrations are comparable mg and na concentrations in napuu 1 are similar to those of the ia while in natir they are similar to the saa dry season values 3 1 3 spatial variations of physical parameters the spatial variations in the physical parameters ec ph and temperature indicate a number of features of the laas fig 3 the ec values are lowest in the groundwater along with the quasi perennial turkwel river profile in the holocene age alluvial sediments and also where there exist seasonal and ephemeral feeder streams and more generally increase in the directions perpendicular n and s to the streamflow trend e highest ec values are associated with where the turkana grits or the miocene nepheline phonolites outcrop or lie close to the surface masked by quaternary deposits similar trends are observed for the ph and temperature where the lowest ph and temperature are next to the turkwel river and its associated tributaries and the highest ph and temperatures are associated with the turkana grits and the nepheline phonolites 3 2 hydrochemical facies based on the piper diagram fig 4 a four water types were identified from the surface water and groundwater samples of the study area na hco3 ca hco3 na cl and mg hco3 all the surface water samples were ca hco3 type of water in the saa the facies are ca hco3 59 na hco3 29 mg hco3 12 in the tgsa the facies are na hco3 56 na cl 44 with the former characterizing the contact zone area of the grit and holocene sediments and the latter characterizing the grit proper the ia facies was na hco3 95 mg hco3 5 with only katapakori and narengelup handpumps belonging to the mg hco3 water type the two samples of the da had different facies napuu was na hco3 and natirnalulung was ca hco3 mg hco3 water type occurred in isolated areas such as akwanga nakadukui and naregai there is evidence of some seasonal variations in hydrochemical facies for example some samples 55 with dominant na hco3 water type during the dry season changed to dominant ca hco3water type during the wet season fig 4b bh 7 a municipal water supply borehole changed from ca hco3 in the wet season of may 2018 to na hco3 during the dry season of february 2019 also the kakemera church hp of the ia which was na hco3 type in the wet season became na cl water type during the dry season 3 3 rock water interactions 3 3 1 ion exchange and mineral saturation indices sodium in natural waters originates from the dissolution of feldspars or cation exchange reactions the source for cl is as an impurity in minerals e g biotite or rocks e g limestone thus natural concentrations are typically below about 15 mg l for each ion and are highly variable hem 1970 if the na cl ratios are generally greater than 1 it suggests the sodium sources other than halite albite and therefore from ion exchange reactions a ratios of na cl 1 i e 1 1 indicates sources from halite dissolution or sea aerosol spray and a na cl ratio 1 suggests sources from reverse ion exchange abid et al 2011 parnachev et al 1999 zhu et al 2008 higher na cl ratio in the wet season 3 09 compared to the dry season 2 74 suggests remobilisation of some na into solution during recharge the bokotom hp sample is unique in that it is the only sample that falls on the halite dissolution line fig 5 a and b the tgsa had the highest na concentrations followed by those of the ia then those with unknown depths and lastly those in the saa fig 5c and d these data suggest that most of the samples with unknown depth lie within saa and in the geological transition zone of the tgsa and the ia grits and the holocene sediments respectively the majority of the groundwater samples during the wet season 87 and in the dry season 54 had na cl ratios 1 0 suggesting dominant ion exchange while reverse ion exchange occurs in a few samples ion exchange is a major hydrochemical process in the aquifer system in both the wet and dry seasons fig 5c and d cf fisher and mullican 1997 in the entire aquifer system calcium and magnesium carbonates were generally at or near saturation during both the wet and dry seasons with fluorite being slightly undersaturated and anhydrite gypsum ca sulphates moderately so fig 6 siderite is slight to moderately undersaturated with the exception of the tgsa where it is near saturation in the wet season and saturated in the dry season sylvite is moderate to strongly undersaturated except in the saa where it is only slightly undersaturated while halite is moderate to strongly undersaturated in all cases mn carbonate is close to saturation in saa tgsa and ia saturated in the dry season but strongly undersaturated in the da the behaviour of the mn oxyhydroxides is quite interesting in the saa they are moderate to strongly undersaturated in the wet season and moderately to strongly saturated during the dry season while in the tgsa the reverse is the case in the ia they are saturated in both the wet and dry seasons and in the da they are moderate to strongly undersaturated in both seasons further the mn behaviour in the du is similar to the saa see fig 7 3 3 2 hierarchical cluster analysis the hierarchical cluster analysis very neatly differentiates the three main sub components of the aquifer system tgsa saa and ia particularly in the dry season it also indicates that of the two da samples one is closely affiliated with the saa and the other with the ia the wet season is more mixed probably as a consequence of spatial and temporal differentials in flow rates and amounts and or dilution across a heterogeneous aquifer system by pulsed dynamic recharge the groundwater of the saa belongs to cluster 1 c1 sub group 1 characterised by low mineral content during the wet and dry season fig 8 the highly mineralised groundwater in the tgsa belongs to cluster 3 c3 during the wet and dry season with the unique bokotom hp forming cluster 4 c4 in both seasons fig 8 the hca suggests that two factors influence the groundwater chemistry of the ia in the wet and dry seasons 1 the proximity to the turkwel river cluster c1 and 2 proximity to the turkana grits formation c1 sub group 2 and c2a for the da the hca revealed that the groundwater of natirnalulung bh belongs to cluster c1 during the wet and dry season while that of the napuu bh belongs to c1 sub group 2 during the wet season and c2a during the dry season an indication of enriched mineral concentrations the hca of the samples during the wet and dry seasons revealed that of the 44 boreholes and handpumps with unknown drilled depth 22 belonged to the saa cluster 1 13 in the ia seven 7 in the transition zone between the holocene sediments and the turkana grits and while only two 2 were in the turkana grit aquifer 3 3 3 principal components analysis the first two pc scores explain 58 5 and 57 7 of the variance in the dataset in the wet and dry seasons respectively similar to the hca there is a clear and matching differentiation of the different sub components of the aquifer system the tgsa exhibits the highest positive pc1 scores which decline progressively through the du the ia and finally the saa which exhibits the most negative pc1 scores this progression holds for both the wet and dry seasons during the wet season the parameters with high positive pc1 scores are ec na hco3 so4 cl and f while the one with a high negative pc1 score is only ca for wet season pc2 high positive scores are noted for ca mg and k and a high negative score for ph during the dry season high positive pc1 scores are exhibited by ph ec na hco3 so4 cl f and no3 similar to the wet season but with the addition of f and no3 and a high negative score by ca similar to the wet season while pc2 has a high positive score only for k as opposed to ca ma and k for the wet season and high negative scores for ph ca and mg as opposed to only ca in the wet season it is likely therefore that the positive pc1 for both wet and dry seasons reflects predominantly the mineralisation gradient of the aquifer system with older aquifer sub components such as the tgsa being the most mineralised ca with a negative pc1 in both seasons likely strongly participates in dissolution precipitation reactions this is supported by the mineral saturation indices fig 8 which show that it is saturated in all the aquifer systems the inclusion of f and no3 in the pc1 dry season could reflect preferential leaching and degradation of organic matter accumulated in the aquifer during recharge processes respectively pc2 during both seasons appears to be reflective of ion exchange processes involving ca mg and k primarily in the wet season and strongly ph modulated ca mg reactions inclusive of dissolution precipitation reactions during the dry season 4 discussion 4 1 natural factors influencing groundwater chemistry as is common for tropical rivers the ec values for the turkwel river are low but a downstream increase is observed coupled with an increase in ph which is likely related to high baseflow contribution to river flow and higher ion contributions relative to surface runoff contributions higher turbidity in the town area could reflect inputs of fine sediments from disturbances agricultural activities along the riverbanks subsidiary seasonal ephemeral streams such as the kawalase also contribute to higher dissolved ion species content as reflected by the marked increase in na concentrations east of its confluence with the turkwel river the ca hco3 water facies suggests that the water is derived from a primarily metamorphic volcanic terrain with plagioclase feldspars being the main source of the ca ion this study has determined that the shallow alluvial aquifer in recent alluvial deposits the intermediate aquifer in mid holocene alluvial deposits and the deep aquifer in early holocene alluvial deposits fig 2 are an interlinked system whose chemistry varies with geology the degree of interaction with the turkwel river and the age of the groundwater it confirms the earlier hypotheses that the turkwel river replenishes the shallow groundwater of the study area hirpa et al 2018 olago 2018 the turkana grit shallow aquifer however represents a separate and distinct sedimentary groundwater source that is found on either side of the river as is common for shallow alluvial aquifers in arid areas where the river and groundwater facies are similar ledesma ruiz et al 2015 varol and şekerci 2018 the ca hco3 water type was the dominant water facies in the saa which was similar to that of the turkwel river the geology at the source and along the reach of the turkwel river which comprises volcanics in the highlands metamorphics in the midlands and a mix of metamorphics and volcanics in the lowlands influence the chemistry of the turkwel river and consequently that of the groundwater in the saa ia and da east of the confluence of the turkwel and kawalase rivers the higher alkalinity na and fe concentrations in the river and the associated alluvial aquifer system are related to the dominantly metamorphic source and reach of the kawalase river generally electrical conductivity is lowest in the saa which has a ca hco3 water type intermediate in the ia and da and highest in the tgsa which has a na hco3 na cl water type these transitions reflect increasing mineral content of the groundwater seasonal recharge pulses from the turkwel river strongly influence the aquifer chemistry in the saa and ia while direct rainfall recharge has a similar effect on the tgsa in the da however there are no marked wet dry season differences in the physico chemical parameters suggesting that for this aquifer recharge occurs over timescales longer than the seasonal cycles although hca suggests that there is some interaction between the ia and the napuu bh higher turbidity in the saa ia and tgsa groundwater during the wet season as compared to the dry season relate to the river recharge pulses that convey colloids into the groundwater system the river itself is visibly loaded with mud and silt during the rainy season evaluation of the seasonal variation in the water facies showed that the na hco3 water type of the groundwater in the transition zone between the recent alluvial deposits and the holocene alluvial sediments switched to ca hco3 during the wet season indicating dilution processes related to turkwel river recharge the mg hco3 water facies occurred as pockets in the saa and the intermediate aquifer and is related to localised geological formations such as dolomite abid et al 2011 ansari and umar 2019 liu et al 2019 and in our case likely reflects the remobilisation of discrete micrite crystals that may have been precipitated in the matrices of the soil and upper layers of the unconfined groundwater cf johnson and graham 2000 and their dissolution and remobilisation during recharge rainfall events the hydrochemical characteristics of the tgsa is typical of a highly mineralised groundwater system suggesting a very long groundwater residence time pilla et al 2006 tay and kortatsi 2008 joshi et al 2018 and in addition to rock water interactions the relative mineral enrichment in the dry season as compared to the wet season could also be related to evaporation processes chowdhury et al 2018 rock water interactions are also key in evaluating the hydrochemical evolution of groundwater okiongbo and akpofure 2015 toran and saunders 1999 yazdizadeh et al 2019 the existence of na hco3 water type subsidiary to ca hco3 in the saa and dominant in the tgsa is an indication of dominant ion exchange processes in the aquifer the complex chemistry of the groundwater of the study was simplified using the hca where cluster 1 represents dilute groundwater saa and cluster 4 represents highly mineralised groundwater tgsa the hca revealed that two factors influence the groundwater chemistry of the ia in the wet and dry seasons 1 the proximity to the turkwel river cluster c1 and 2 proximity to the turkana grits formation c2 and c3 hca was also useful in identifying the categories in which the boreholes and handpumps with unknown drilled depth belonged within the saa ia and the tgsa of interest is the similarity in groundwater chemistry of the natir bh of the da and that of the saa while the napuu bh has typical characteristics of the ia the former could likely be related to a strong hydrological recharge pulse at the confluence of the turkwel and kawalase rivers during rainy seasons a unique feature in the tgsa is the bokotom hp where halite dissolution abid et al 2011 ansari and umar 2019 chenini et al 2010 zhu et al 2008 is prominent in both seasons the principal components analysis revealed that the pc1 in the dry and wet seasons reflects the mineralisation gradient in the aquifers with the tgsa being the most mineralised and mineral enrichment during the dry season was a common characteristic in all the aquifers pc2 during both seasons was reflective of ion exchange processes involving ca mg and k primarily in the wet season and strongly ph modulated ca mg reactions inclusive of dissolution precipitation reactions during the dry season 4 2 anthropogenic activities influencing groundwater chemistry shallow alluvial aquifers are considered highly vulnerable to pollution muhammad et al 2015 yidana et al 2010 the concentrations of nitrate and sulphate in the groundwater were used to evaluate the anthropogenic influence on the groundwater quality with the consideration that microbially mediated reactions within the aquifer can also be major contributors to their concentrations lapworth et al 2017 mcmahon 2001 and there is one handpump where the latter process is dominant the presence of sulphate in groundwater is due to leaching of dissolved salts and other sulphate rich minerals from domestic wastes jhariya et al 2018 on the other hand nitrate in groundwater is due to domestic sewage and agricultural chemicals guo et al 2019 lathamani et al 2015 morán ramírez et al 2016 natural nitrate concentration in groundwater is generally far below 10 mg n l who 2011 concentrations above this value reflect contributions from human activities miljević et al 2012 the tgsa has non potable groundwater and is not discussed further in this section although so4 2 and no3 concentrations were within the guideline values for drinking water in the shallow alluvial intermediate and deep aquifers the concentrations were observed to increase during the wet season except for the da napuu bh poor sanitation unregulated waste disposal and the lack of sewerage facilities olago 2018 hirpa et al 2018 pose critical human induced risks to the laas the geological characteristics and urban setting make the saa ia and da highly vulnerable to pollution but it is still generally uncontaminated with no networked sewerage infrastructure on site sanitation septic tanks or pit latrines are prevalent enhancing the threat of direct contamination of the aquifer system particularly through leakages and flooding increased so4 2 and no3 concentrations in the wet season may also be attributed to upstream farming activities on site animal watering contributed to higher no3 concentrations in natirnalulung bh the proposed large scale irrigation projects ndma 2016 oecd fao 2016 olago 2018 upstream of the lodwar municipality may lead to high levels of nitrates and sulphates in the saa ia and da it has been noted that the drivers of the groundwater problems such as overexploitation and contamination are often outside the water sector and thus the solutions must be based on interventions from several sectors baki et al 2017 shady et al 2005 shen 2015 4 3 aquifer exploitation and management the shallow alluvial and intermediate aquifers are the main sources of drinking water to an estimated population of 91 766 in 2019 and up to 140 914 people in 2030 living in lodwar municipality this trend in population increase will subsequently lead to an increase in water demand a study of the turkwel river basin that considered linked scenarios of climate change and water demand in the 2030s and 2080s indicates that increased water demand particularly due to expanded irrigation along with droughts and climate variability adversely affects depletes the river basin s water resource system including the groundwater resource hirpa et al 2018 the laas characterised in this study as being highly sensitive to natural and anthropogenic factors and pressures including those in the distant upstream areas of turkwel river is therefore a strategic resource that needs to be protected from both regional and local perspectives the findings of this study revealed that apart from fe and mn in some of the boreholes and handpumps in both seasons and turbidity during the wet season the chemical concentrations in the saa were within the drinking water guidelines who 2011 kebs 2014 these excesses can be managed with relatively inexpensive treatment systems this study has shown that the tgsa aquifer should be completely avoided as the ec na cl f and no3 concentrations in the tgsa exceed the recommended guideline values who 2011 kebs 2014 for drinking water during the wet and dry seasons some water sources of the intermediate aquifer during the wet and dry seasons had ph na hco3 and f above the recommended guidelines for drinking water who 2011 kebs 2014 in both seasons high turbidity in some wells of this aquifer may also indicate possible bacterial contamination bennett et al 2000 khatri and tyagi 2014 lapworth et al 2017 and microbial content should be investigated fluoride is in some cases only slightly more than the recommended limit for drinking water apart from slightly higher na concentration in the napuu bh in the wet and dry seasons not a major concern the groundwater of the deep aquifer meets the drinking water quality standards evaluation of the groundwater chemistry in these aquifers indicates high vulnerability to both natural and anthropogenic pollution the current groundwater management approaches depend majorly on the institutional strengths in the individual countries shen 2015 with no major considerations to the varied hydrogeological regimes domestic industrial and agricultural water demands based on the current knowledge of the lodwar aquifers and the related prevailing threats to the turkwel basin hirpa et al 2018 strengthening the institutions that oversee or manage the resource a multi sectoral approach towards the protection and sustainability of the turkwel watershed are required in addition effective and regulated aquifer exploitation foster and chilton 2003 sanz et al 2016 will ensure optimum pumping rates aimed at minimizing over abstraction managing the seasonal variability of water chemistry and avoiding mixing of saline and fluoride rich aquifer zones regular groundwater quality monitoring kumar et al 2009 sanz et al 2016 will also help to evaluate if pumping rates are affecting the water quality beyond the current established range of expected seasonal water quality variability of the aquifers in the area 5 conclusions the purpose of this investigation was to determine and characterize the hydrogeochemistry of lodwar municipality s strategic alluvial aquifer and evaluate the natural and anthropogenic factors influencing its chemistry and quality providing scientific evidence for sustainable safe exploitation and management integration of statistical approaches and geochemical methods were applied to investigate the groundwater system that is used by the lodwar municipality for water supplies the results revealed heterogeneous aquifer systems with significant temporal and spatial variations in groundwater chemistry generally two distinct shallow aquifers of depth 30 m underlies lodwar and its environs the saa along the turkwel river which is the main source of freshwater and the shallow aquifer of the turkana grit that is highly saline and with fluoride contamination localised human activities such as over pumping and localised rock water interactions resulted in alteration of the groundwater chemistry in the area the use of pca has enabled the determination of the aquifer processes during the wet season and in the dry season related to complex geological hydrological and climatic variations the application of hca to the groundwater samples led to the classification of the groundwater with unknown drilled depth within the saa ia and the tgsa where the majority were in the transition zone between the holocene sediments and the turkana grits formations the overall groundwater chemistry in the area is subject to seasonal variability and varied geological formations most shallow alluvial aquifers are dominated by ca hco3 water facies comprising freshwater in the region investigation of changes in hydrochemical facies indicated that increased pumping activities result in an alteration of na hco3 water type to na cl which is unsuitable for drinking thus regulation on abstraction activities in such aquifers in arid areas is key to keeping the groundwater chemistry stable within the bounds of natural variability fluoride contamination is a major problem in many aquifers in arid areas globally while irrigated agriculture and the use of fertilizers within the turkwel river basin as a whole has both quantity and quality implications for the laas and other groundwater systems in the region in the face of the water security challenges in arid and semi arid regions urban water suppliers should undertake more comprehensive hydrogeological and hydrochemical surveys to assess aquifer sustainability and current and future risks besides careful land management and multi stakeholder approaches in watershed management are required to ensure that water quality risks to turkwel river and the laas are identified and mitigated there is a need for further groundwater monitoring to establish short to long term trends in water quality and quantity to inform on adaptive management

water scarcity can be alleviated by decreasing the water footprint of sugarcane production using different soil mulching and irrigation systems in south africa the study also quantifies the economic benefits of reducing blue water footprints the mycanesim model and water footprint assessment methodologies were employed to estimate blue and green water footprints under the different systems in the malelane region of south africa the findings reveal that blue water consumption for sugarcane grown with a thick mulch cover was substantially lower than for that grown with a light mulch cover the difference was larger for centre pivot irrigated sugarcane than for subsurface drip irrigated sugarcane the blue and total blue plus green water footprint values for crops grown with a thick mulch cover were only marginally lower than for those grown with the light mulch cover the blue water footprint for subsurface drip irrigated sugarcane was 8 10 m3 t lower than for centre pivot irrigated sugarcane due to its higher application efficiency the economic productivity of blue water usage for subsurface drip irrigated sugarcane was higher than for centre pivot irrigated sugarcane crops in addition the economic water productivity of blue water usage for crops grown with a thick mulch cover was slightly higher 5 than that of those grown with a light mulch cover under subsurface drip irrigation the findings support the notion that water use efficiency in sugarcane production can be improved and the water footprints reduced by implementing more efficient irrigation systems by

olivier and singels 2012 examined how crop residue cover improves cane yield in south africa but the impact thereof on the water footprint of sugarcane has not been explored in south africa thus there

south africa this region is a major irrigated sugarcane production area in the country the study focused on the blue and green water footprint of sugarcane the mycanesim model and the water footprint concept of hoekstra et al 2011 were employed 2 methodology 2 1 description of the study area the study was conducted in the malelane area located in the mpumalanga province south africa the area has hot summers and mild winters jarmain et al 2014 with the long term mean daily average temperatures ranging from 23 5 c in june to 30 1 c in january the study area represents the second most producing

sugarcane production the mycanesim model uses soil and water carrying properties day to day weather information and farm management factors as inputs this model takes into account the canopy structure and soil water properties through soil profiles and layers the model combines the radiation use efficiency method and source sink precepts to quantify cane yield and sucrose simulations were conducted on 12 month ratoon crops starting in may and october of each year in the period 1970 to 1999 the model was used to simulate rainfall irrigation drainage and run off and cane yield the sugarcane cultivar considered in the study was nco376 with a row spacing of 1 4 m deep and shallow soils with water holding capacities of 100 and 50 mm respectively were considered in the model setup daily

scattered cane tops light 5 ton ha and a thick cover obtained from the dead crop residue thick 10 ton ha were used data on the irrigation systems gross irrigation amount mm and minimum irrigation cycles days the available water capacity of the soil mm and the available soil water content threshold for irrigation mm are presented in table 1 irrigations were automatically scheduled when the simulated soil water content reached the chosen threshold for data used to calculate the economic blue water productivity relevant data on cane prices and the cost of production were obtained from the south african sugar association sasa 2016 2 3 crop water use and water footprint calculations the simulated variables are used to calculate the water footprint wf green and wf blue of sugarcane in the following steps first the total outflow under irrigated o irr mm year and rain fed o rf mm year conditions are calculated using equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 o i r r d i r r r i r r 2 o r f d r f r

economic water productivity of blue water bluewater productivity represents the economic value of sugarcane output per unit of blue water consumed schyns and hoekstra 2014 and is calculated by multiplying the physical water productivity defined as tons of cane yield produced per cubic metre of blue water used by the value added va to sugar cane chouchane et al 2015 assuming that the blue

value content of 12 the price for fresh cane was r585 ton 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated water balance and yields for irrigated cane table 2 presents the mean simulated cane yield and water balance for different irrigation systems and mulch covers on two soil types keeping soil type constant the results showed that cane yield for both mulch covers was similar however thick mulch cover lowered evapotranspiration et by 40 mm and can reduce irrigation by 32 mm compared with light mulch cover this could be ascribed to a reduction in evaporation from the soil during the period of partial canopy cover the thick mulch cover also resulted in higher drainage and runoff than the light mulch cover for both soil types this is because the soil water content under the thick mulch cover is mostly higher than under a light mulch cover with lower evaporation leading to higher drainage and less runoff when rainfall occurs the decrease in evapotranspiration and irrigation water due to the application of a thick mulch cover is in line with the findings of zhao et al 2003 ogban et al 2008 zhou et al 2011 and mao et al 2012 in terms of irrigation systems the results indicated that the mean simulated cane yield and et were similar for both irrigation systems whereas irrigation by ssd was substantially lower with about 100 mm when compared with cp the low amount of irrigation water use under ssd may be due to its higher application efficiency with cp some of the water applied is intercepted by the crop canopy cover and mulch cover and as such it becomes unavailable to the crop singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 interestingly the shallow soil had a lower cane yield of about 16 ton ha a lower et of about 40 mm and lower irrigation of about 85 mm than the deep soil regardless of the type of irrigation system the crops growing in the shallow soil experienced more water stress because of the irrigation settings they also required less water to fill the soil profile at the start of the crop initial water content assumed as 50 capacity this finding corresponds well with that of raes et al 2013 who found that the irrigation system influences the way irrigation water is applied which in turn influences the percentage of soil wetting and plant water uptake the determinates of et in summary the results reported in table 2 showed that the highest management impact on water use was caused by the type of irrigation system used followed by the type of mulch cover 3 2 simulated water balance and yields for rain fed cane table 3 presents cane yield and water balance under rainfall conditions for the different mulch covers and soil types the results show that cane yields fared better in deep soils relative to shallow soils irrespective of the mulch cover thick mulch cover had lower et 8 mm and higher drainage 10 mm relative to light mulch a thick mulch cover reduces evaporation from the soil as well as transpiration during the period of the partial canopy due to the slower rate of canopy development this leads to higher soil water content and increased drainage and runoff when large rainfall events occur these dynamic processes are simulated by the canesim model 3 3 water footprint of irrigated sugarcane and reduction of water footprint through mulching and irrigation systems the results of the estimation of the crop water use components water footprint indicators and economic blue water productivity are shown in table 4 the thick mulch cover produced slightly lower cwugreen 86 and 126 m3 ha for the deep and shallow soil respectively irrespective of the irrigation system however cwublue for sugarcane grown with a thick mulch cover was substantially lower than that grown with a light mulch cover under both irrigation systems the difference was larger for cp irrigated sugarcane 457 and 404 m3 ha for the deep and shallow soil respectively than for ssd irrigated sugarcane 274 and 221 m3 ha for the deep and shallow soil respectively the lower cwublue of crops grown with the thick mulch cover can be ascribed to their lower irrigation demand as demonstrated in table 2 the blue and total water footprints of sugarcane grown with a thick mulch cover were slightly lower at about 2 and 1 m3 ha for the deep and shallow soil respectively than that grown with the light mulch cover although this difference was not very big every drop of water counts when considering the water scarcity of south africa comparing the irrigation systems the cwublue of ssd irrigated sugarcane was between 994 and 1260 m3 ha lower than for cp irrigated sugarcane the lower cwu for the ssd system can be ascribed to its higher application efficiency compared to that of the cp system the wfgreen for the two irrigation systems did not differ much while the wfblue for the ssd irrigated sugarcane was between 8 and 10 m3 ha lower than for the cp irrigated sugarcane the shallow soil had a substantially higher total water footprint for both irrigation systems the lower cwu observed for the shallow soil was ascribed to its lower water holding capacity which increased the extent of water deficit stress during crop growth as reflected by lower et and cane yields in table 2 the water footprint values for crops grown on the shallow soil were marginally higher than those growing on the deep soil regardless of irrigation system type or soil mulch cover the total water footprint values estimated in this study 86 98 m3 ha were lower than the 150 174 m3 ha reported in thailand by gheewala et al 2014 the 147 m3 ha in mpumalanga mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and the 209 m3 ha global average mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the low water footprint can be attributed to the simulated high cane yields ranging from 130 to 145 ton ha which are achievable in the case study area through excellent management singels et al 2016 the results show that there is scope to improve water use efficiencies by using efficient irrigation systems limiting wasteful evaporation through the use of mulch covers and scheduling irrigations accurately more importantly the blue water footprint exceeds the green water footprint and this is crucial given that blue water scarcity is a major issue in south africa the blue water footprint for the different soil types and mulch covers were lower under ssd compared with cp 3 4 bluewater productivities the last column of table 4 shows the economic water productivity of blue water usage the results indicate that zar 10 7 and zar 11 3 is obtained for every cubic metre of blue water used under the cp irrigation in deep soils with light and thick mulch covers respectively in shallow soils zar 10 2 and zar 10 7 is obtained for every cubic metre of blue water used under the same irrigation system with light and thick mulch cover respectively under ssd irrigation zar 12 9 and zar 13 4 is obtained for every cubic metre of blue water used in deep soils with light and thick mulch cover respectively in shallow soils zar 12 2 and zar 12 5 was obtained for every cubic metre of blue water used with a light and thick mulch cover respectively the results imply that blue water usage under ssd is more productive and efficient in economic terms relative to ssd in addition more value is obtained for every cubic metre of water used when thick mulching is adopted 4 conclusions and recommendations the paper has examined how different mulching and irrigation systems could be used to reduce the water footprint of sugarcane production to mitigate water scarcity in agricultural production in south africa we used the canesim model developed and accepted for use by the south african sugar association and the global water footprint standard the findings demonstrated that a thick mulch cover reduced evapotranspiration irrigation demand and blue water consumption for both irrigation systems and soils however the two mulch cover types had very similar water footprint indicators with the thick mulch cover having slightly lower values than the light mulch cover the small difference in blue water usage cannot be ignored since every drop of water counts in the case of blue water scarcity therefore crops irrigated with ssd irrigation consumed substantially less water than those irrigated with cp systems specifically the mean water footprint of sugarcane produced under ssd irrigation was about 9 lower than sugarcane produced with cp irrigation the blue water footprint was almost twice as large as the green water footprint suggesting that sugarcane production relied intensively on blue water resources in south africa bluewater usage in ssd farming was more productive and economically efficient relative to cp systems also more value was obtained for every cubic metre of water used when thick mulching was adopted the monetary value obtained for every cubic metre of water used under ssd system is about 5 higher than that obtained under the cp system the total and blue water footprint values estimated in this study were considerably lower than those reported in other studies practically the study provides vital information for sugarcane farmers as to which type of mulching and irrigation systems that increase water productivity and economic efficiency thus the study provides insights into how the water use efficiency of sugarcane production can be improved the study also contributes to the debate on how the sugarcane water footprint can be reduced by implementing more efficient farm management practices finally insights from the study can act as benchmarks for future research on water footprint and economic water productivity in the sugarcane industry the study is not without limitations firstly the assessment did not include the grey water footprint and as such we suggest that future research should account for this component secondly the scope of analysis was limited to the farm level hence we recommend future research to consider water use along the rest of the sugar value chain future studies should also consider the blue water sustainability assessment of the catchment area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no

brazilian sugarcane production scarpare et al 2016 studies have found that adopting straw to serve as mulch cover could improve the growth and yield of sugarcane crops aquino et al 2017 carvalho et al 2016 menandro et al 2017 although these studies established the impact of mulching on yield and productivity they did not account for how straw could reduce water use or increase the economic productivity of blue water to the best of our knowledge scant literature exists on the impact of different mulching practices irrigation systems and soil depths on sugarcane water use in south africa olivier and singels 2012 examined how crop residue cover improves cane yield in south africa but the impact thereof on the water footprint of sugarcane has not been explored in south africa thus there is an insufficient understanding of how to deal with water scarcity in sugarcane production in south africa using management practices therefore this study assessed the impact of mulching thick and light mulch irrigation centre pivot cp and subsurface drip ssd irrigation on the water footprint and economic water productivities of sugarcane production in the malelane region of mpumalanga province south africa this region is a major irrigated sugarcane production area in the country the study focused on the blue and green water footprint of sugarcane the mycanesim model and the water footprint concept of hoekstra et al 2011 were employed 2 methodology 2 1 description of the study area the study was conducted in the malelane area located in the mpumalanga province south africa the area has hot summers and mild winters jarmain et al 2014 with the long term mean daily average temperatures ranging from 23 5 c in june to 30 1 c in january the study area represents the second most producing irrigated sugarcane site in the northern region after komati with over 1 3 million tons of cane crushed annually sasa 2020 sugarcane crops produced at malelane are largely grown under irrigation conditions with rainfall mostly occurring during summer mean annual rainfall of 600 mm the sugarcane crops are usually harveste fig 1 between april and december dry periods and transported to the malalane mills operated by rcl foods singels et al 2018 water for irrigation in this region is taken from the crocodile river with an annual allocation of 13 000 m3 ha annum ten napel 2009 when supply is adequate water supply is often inadequate and the allocation then has to be reduced to such an extent that it cannot meet crop demands rossler 2014 2 2 mycanesim simulation model for water use in sugarcane production the mycanesim model uses soil and water carrying properties day to day weather information and farm management factors as inputs this model takes into account the canopy structure and soil water properties through soil profiles and layers the model combines the radiation use efficiency method and source sink precepts to quantify cane yield and sucrose simulations were conducted on 12 month ratoon crops starting in may and october of each year in the period 1970 to 1999 the model was used to simulate rainfall irrigation drainage and run off and cane yield the sugarcane cultivar considered in the study was nco376 with a row spacing of 1 4 m deep and shallow soils with water holding capacities of 100 and 50 mm respectively were considered in the model setup daily weather data from the mhlati station 25 28 0 s 31 31 0 e were used as input overhead irrigation with a cp and ssd system was considered two soil mulch covers namely a light cover obtained from the scattered cane tops light 5 ton ha and a thick cover obtained from the dead crop residue thick 10 ton ha were used data on the irrigation systems gross irrigation amount mm and minimum irrigation cycles days the available water capacity of the soil mm and the available soil water content threshold for irrigation mm are presented in table 1 irrigations were automatically scheduled when the simulated soil water content reached the chosen threshold for data used to calculate the economic blue water productivity relevant data on cane prices and the cost of production were obtained from the south african sugar association sasa 2016 2 3 crop water use and water footprint calculations the simulated variables are used to calculate the water footprint wf green and wf blue of sugarcane in the following steps first the total outflow under irrigated o irr mm year and rain fed o rf mm year conditions are calculated using equations 1 and 2 respectively 1 o i r r d i r r r i r r 2 o r f d r f r

economic water productivity of blue water bluewater productivity represents the economic value of sugarcane output per unit of blue water consumed schyns and hoekstra 2014 and is calculated by multiplying the physical water productivity defined as tons of cane yield produced per cubic metre of blue water used by the value added va to sugar cane chouchane et al 2015 assuming that the blue

value content of 12 the price for fresh cane was r585 ton 3 results and discussion 3 1 simulated water balance and yields for irrigated cane table 2 presents the mean simulated cane yield and water balance for different irrigation systems and mulch covers on two soil types keeping soil type constant the results showed that cane yield for both mulch covers was similar however thick mulch cover lowered evapotranspiration et by 40 mm and can reduce irrigation by 32 mm compared with light mulch cover this could be ascribed to a reduction in evaporation from the soil during the period of partial canopy cover the thick mulch cover also resulted in higher drainage and runoff than the light mulch cover for both soil types this is because the soil water content under the thick mulch cover is mostly higher than under a light mulch cover with lower evaporation leading to higher drainage and less runoff when rainfall occurs the decrease in evapotranspiration and irrigation water due to the application of a thick mulch cover is in line with the findings of zhao et al 2003 ogban et al 2008 zhou et al 2011 and mao et al 2012 in terms of irrigation systems the results indicated that the mean simulated cane yield and et were similar for both irrigation systems whereas irrigation by ssd was substantially lower with about 100 mm when compared with cp the low amount of irrigation water use under ssd may be due to its higher application efficiency with cp some of the water applied is intercepted by the crop canopy cover and mulch cover and as such it becomes unavailable to the crop singels and paraskevopoulos 2017 interestingly the shallow soil had a lower cane yield of about 16 ton ha a lower et of about 40 mm and lower irrigation of about 85 mm than the deep soil regardless of the type of irrigation system the crops growing in the shallow soil experienced more water stress because of the irrigation settings they also required less water to fill the soil profile at the start of the crop initial water content assumed as 50 capacity this finding corresponds well with that of raes et al 2013 who found that the irrigation system influences the way irrigation water is applied which in turn influences the percentage of soil wetting and plant water uptake the determinates of et in summary the results reported in table 2 showed that the highest management impact on water use was caused by the type of irrigation system used followed by the type of mulch cover 3 2 simulated water balance and yields for rain fed cane table 3 presents cane yield and water balance under rainfall conditions for the different mulch covers and soil types the results show that cane yields fared better in deep soils relative to shallow soils irrespective of the mulch cover thick mulch cover had lower et 8 mm and higher drainage 10 mm relative to light mulch a thick mulch cover reduces evaporation from the soil as well as transpiration during the period of the partial canopy due to the slower rate of canopy development this leads to higher soil water content and increased drainage and runoff when large rainfall events occur these dynamic processes are simulated by the canesim model 3 3 water footprint of irrigated sugarcane and reduction of water footprint through mulching and irrigation systems the results of the estimation of the crop water use components water footprint indicators and economic blue water productivity are shown in table 4 the thick mulch cover produced slightly lower cwugreen 86 and 126 m3 ha for the deep and shallow soil respectively irrespective of the irrigation system however cwublue for sugarcane grown with a thick mulch cover was substantially lower than that grown with a light mulch cover under both irrigation systems the difference was larger for cp irrigated sugarcane 457 and 404 m3 ha for the deep and shallow soil respectively than for ssd irrigated sugarcane 274 and 221 m3 ha for the deep and shallow soil respectively the lower cwublue of crops grown with the thick mulch cover can be ascribed to their lower irrigation demand as demonstrated in table 2 the blue and total water footprints of sugarcane grown with a thick mulch cover were slightly lower at about 2 and 1 m3 ha for the deep and shallow soil respectively than that grown with the light mulch cover although this difference was not very big every drop of water counts when considering the water scarcity of south africa comparing the irrigation systems the cwublue of ssd irrigated sugarcane was between 994 and 1260 m3 ha lower than for cp irrigated sugarcane the lower cwu for the ssd system can be ascribed to its higher application efficiency compared to that of the cp system the wfgreen for the two irrigation systems did not differ much while the wfblue for the ssd irrigated sugarcane was between 8 and 10 m3 ha lower than for the cp irrigated sugarcane the shallow soil had a substantially higher total water footprint for both irrigation systems the lower cwu observed for the shallow soil was ascribed to its lower water holding capacity which increased the extent of water deficit stress during crop growth as reflected by lower et and cane yields in table 2 the water footprint values for crops grown on the shallow soil were marginally higher than those growing on the deep soil regardless of irrigation system type or soil mulch cover the total water footprint values estimated in this study 86 98 m3 ha were lower than the 150 174 m3 ha reported in thailand by gheewala et al 2014 the 147 m3 ha in mpumalanga mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 and the 209 m3 ha global average mekonnen and hoekstra 2011 the low water footprint can be attributed to the simulated high cane yields ranging from 130 to 145 ton ha which are achievable in the case study area through excellent management singels et al 2016 the results show that there is scope to improve water use efficiencies by using efficient irrigation systems limiting wasteful evaporation through the use of mulch covers and scheduling irrigations accurately more importantly the blue water footprint exceeds the green water footprint and this is crucial given that blue water scarcity is a major issue in south africa the blue water footprint for the different soil types and mulch covers were lower under ssd compared with cp 3 4 bluewater productivities the last column of table 4 shows the economic water productivity of blue water usage the results indicate that zar 10 7 and zar 11 3 is obtained for every cubic metre of blue water used under the cp irrigation in deep soils with light and thick mulch covers respectively in shallow soils zar 10 2 and zar 10 7 is obtained for every cubic metre of blue water used under the same irrigation system with light and thick mulch cover respectively under ssd irrigation zar 12 9 and zar 13 4 is obtained for every cubic metre of blue water used in deep soils with light and thick mulch cover respectively in shallow soils zar 12 2 and zar 12 5 was obtained for every cubic metre of blue water used with a light and thick mulch cover respectively the results imply that blue water usage under ssd is more productive and efficient in economic terms relative to ssd in addition more value is obtained for every cubic metre of water used when thick mulching is adopted 4 conclusions and recommendations the paper has examined how different mulching and irrigation systems could be used to reduce the water footprint of sugarcane production to mitigate water scarcity in agricultural production in south africa we used the canesim model developed and accepted for use by the south african sugar association and the global water footprint standard the findings demonstrated that a thick mulch cover reduced evapotranspiration irrigation demand and blue water consumption for both irrigation systems and soils however the two mulch cover types had very similar water footprint indicators with the thick mulch cover having slightly lower values than the light mulch cover the small difference in blue water usage cannot be ignored since every drop of water counts in the case of blue water scarcity therefore crops irrigated with ssd irrigation consumed substantially less water than those irrigated with cp systems specifically the mean water footprint of sugarcane produced under ssd irrigation was about 9 lower than sugarcane produced with cp irrigation the blue water footprint was almost twice as large as the green water footprint suggesting that sugarcane production relied intensively on blue water resources in south africa bluewater usage in ssd farming was more productive and economically efficient relative to cp systems also more value was obtained for every cubic metre of water used when thick mulching was adopted the monetary value obtained for every cubic metre of water used under ssd system is about 5 higher than that obtained under the cp system the total and blue water footprint values estimated in this study were considerably lower than those reported in other studies practically the study provides vital information for sugarcane farmers as to which type of mulching and irrigation systems that increase water productivity and economic efficiency thus the study provides insights into how the water use efficiency of sugarcane production can be improved the study also contributes to the debate on how the sugarcane water footprint can be reduced by implementing more efficient farm management practices finally insights from the study can act as benchmarks for future research on water footprint and economic water productivity in the sugarcane industry the study is not without limitations firstly the assessment did not include the grey water footprint and as such we suggest that future research should account for this component secondly the scope of analysis was limited to the farm level hence we recommend future research to consider water use along the rest of the sugar value chain future studies should also consider the blue water sustainability assessment of the catchment area declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no
