8300,study region the present study focuses on emilia romagna northern italy a densely populated region affected in the last few years by several destructive flood events study focus a rich and detailed regional dataset of annual maximum series ams of sub daily rainfall is considered with a three fold aim to detect possible changes in 1 seasonality and 2 magnitude of sub daily rainfall extremes 3 to assess the current reliability and accuracy of a previously developed regional model for rainfall frequency estimation based on the local value of mean annual precipitation map new hydrological insights for the region the main findings of the study include 1 delay towards autumn in the mean timing of sub daily rainfall extremes more marked for higher elevations and longer durations 2 significant increase in the magnitude of sub daily extreme events for some areas especially in the apennine 3 high sensitivity of the regional predictions of the frequency regime of sub daily rainfall extremes to local changes in ams and map keywords climate change annual maximum series mean annual precipitation circular statistics design storm 1 introduction economic losses and social consequences caused by hydrological extreme events in italy as well as in many other european countries have been steadily increasing over the last three decades see e g guha sapir et al 2016 carisi et al 2017 the literature indicates several possible factors as responsible of such a situation climate change and the resulting intensification of extreme hydrological events see e g brunetti et al 2002 uboldi and lussana 2018 as well as the impact of anthropization on flood risk changes as a result of the increase in exposure to flooding due to land use and land cover modifications see e g bouwer et al 2010 di baldassarre et al 2013 domeneghetti et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 requena et al 2017 leal et al 2019 in particular the frequency of floods caused by extreme rainfall events has increased significantly in recent years see e g fischer et al 2019 and urban areas have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of these events triggering the development of fast processing algorithms for pluvial flood hazard assessment see e g safer rain by samela et al 2020 as a basis for identifying flood risk mitigation measures and plans under current and future climates in this context the detection of changes in flood behaviour is crucial yet limited by the knowledge of the processes that control magnitude frequency and timing of flood events see e g merz et al 2012 in this respect within the uph unsolved problems in hydrology initiative of the iahs international association of hydrological sciences blöschl et al 2019a call for a common effort by the scientific community to understand if the hydrological cycle is regionally accelerating or decelerating and to quantify seasonal alterations of flood drivers with respect to the intensification of extreme hydrological events a recent study conducted by blöschl et al 2017 on a pan european database from 4262 observational hydrometric stations for the past five decades finds clear patterns of change in flood timing earlier spring snowmelt floods in north eastern europe due to warmer temperatures later winter floods around the north sea and some sectors of the mediterranean coast due to delayed winter storms associated with polar warming and earlier winter floods in western europe due to earlier soil moisture maxima furthermore blöschl et al 2019b show the presence of significant changes in flood magnitudes over large areas in europe increasing trends in north western europe due to increasing autumn and winter rainfall and decreasing trends in southern europe due to decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation and in eastern europe associated with decreasing snow cover and snowmelt due to warmer temperatures a global analysis recently performed by papalexiou and montanari 2019 on a dataset of 8730 daily precipitation records in the period 1964 2013 i e characterized by an acceleration of global warming highlights that the signal of change is not as evident for rainfall extremes over large areas frequency not magnitude is affected for daily maxima worldwide also when it comes to the analysis of sequences of sub daily rainfall extremes the assessment of changes becomes even more troublesome due to data availability most time series are too short while the long ones are often non homogeneous i e they may contain variations due to non climatic factors such as sensors updates sensor relocation changes and anthropization of the surrounding environments etc see e g alexandersson 1984 1986 a recent study by libertino et al 2019 describes the presence of significant changes in amplitude of sub daily rainfall extremes i e annual maxima at specific locations across italy yet significant trends do not appear at the whole country scale distinct patterns of change emerge in smaller areas with homogeneous geographical characteristics therefore highlighting the need of developing more systematic and localized approaches for a consistent large scale trend detection at the same time libertino et al 2019 do not consider changes in seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes other recent studies show evidences of statistically significant changes in seasonal and annual rainfall totals across europe and in particular in northern italy e g antolini et al 2016 pavan et al 2019 literature shows several examples of regional models of daily and sub daily rainfall extremes frequency that use long term mean annual rainfall total hereafter also referred to as mean annual precipitation or map as a proxy for local climate conditions schaefer 1990 alila 1999 brath et al 2003 di baldassarre et al 2006 castellarin et al 2009 in particular di baldassarre et al 2006 based on data observed in the period 1935 1989 propose a regional frequency model for estimating the rainfall depth for a given duration and recurrence interval i e return period based on the dependence of the statistical properties i e l moments see hosking and wallis 1997 of rainfall extremes on the value of the map therefore changes in local map value could imply changes in frequency and magnitude of daily and sub daily rainfall extremes in this context the present study focuses on emilia romagna a densely populated region 200 inhabitants km2 in the po valley northern italy within an area which accounts for more than 40 of the italian gross national product gnp according to the italian institute of environmental protection and research ispra istituto superiore per la protezione e la ricerca ambientale 2018 63 6 of the population and 63 1 of the companies in emilia romagna can be potentially affected by floods with a medium probability likely return period greater than 100 years in the past few years emilia romagna was affected by several destructive flood events large fluvial flooding e g secchia and panaro rivers in january 2014 enza river in december 2017 reno river in february 2019 idice river in november 2019 flash flooding in mountainous areas e g alta val nure in september 2015 intense pluvial flooding in urban areas e g rimini in june 2013 the present study refers to a rich detailed complete and recently compiled regional dataset of sub daily rainfall annual maximum depth for emilia romagna with a three fold purpose 1 to perform a detailed analysis of possible changes in seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes 2 to detect changes in their magnitude and 3 in the light of regional changes of map found by antolini et al 2016 to assess the current reliability and accuracy of the regional model developed by di baldassarre et al 2006 that predicts the frequency regime of sub daily rainfall extremes based on the local value of map 2 study area and dataset the analyses performed in this study consider a dataset of annual maximum series ams of sub daily duration d equal to 1 3 6 12 and 24 h and sub hourly d 5 10 15 20 30 and 45 min rainfall depths collected at 500 stations in emilia romagna and its surroundings over the period 1931 2015 see fig 1 rainfall data are provided by the regional agency for prevention environment and energy arpae the present study benefits from the homogeneity analyses of precipitation time series performed for the region by antolini et al 2016 who applied the standard normal homogeneity test snht see alexandersson 1984 1986 to annual total precipitation time series here it is assumed that time series which resulted to be homogeneous in antolini et al 2016 in terms of annual total precipitation are homogeneous also in terms of annual maxima in this way the original dataset has been filtered to consider only statistically homogeneous time series with at least 80 of data availability over the considered period based on this preliminary investigation on homogeneity and consistence the sub hourly dataset shows an inadequacy of the available time series and is regarded as not suitable for assessing the possible presence of changes by means of the non parametric statistical tests therefore in the following only the sub daily dataset is considered for assessing changes in seasonality and magnitude for the analyses presented here the dataset of sub daily extreme rainfall events is rearranged in order to consider two different subsets in which only the time series covering at least the 80 of the period are considered 1931 2015 85 years and 1961 2015 55 years this latter characterized by greater data availability see first two rows in table 1 it is worth highlighting that based on the above mentioned filters the dataset considered for the analyses is characterized by a non uniform spatial distribution over the study area in particular data coverage decreases at lower elevations in the floodplain areas see e g figs 1 and 2 for the analyses focused on seasonality the subset 1961 2015 is further divided into two subsets having a climatic validity i e nearly 30 years of observation 1961 1989 29 years and 1990 2015 26 years the choice of 1989 as a reference year for the identification of these two subsets instead of the median year 1988 is done to be consistent with the analyses aimed at assessing the current reliability of the regional model developed by di baldassarre et al 2006 which was developed with data collected up to 1989 together with the above mentioned sub daily dataset this study also considers a detailed dataset of annual total i e cumulative yearly rainfall depths for 365 stations in the region provided by arpae this need is related to the outcomes of the recent study by antolini et al 2016 which shows local significant changes in map i e mean annual cumulated precipitation in emilia romagna over the period 1961 2010 a prevailing locally significant decrease attributed mostly to the decrease in winter and spring rainfall totals was identified over the region more pronounced in the western mountains whereas some areas close to the po river delta show significant increases mostly explained by the significant positive trends detected in spring and autumn rainfall in the same areas as the regional model by di baldassarre et al 2006 uses map as a proxy for predicting the frequency regime of sub daily rainfall extremes the availability of the dataset of annual totals is crucial for describing and understanding changes in the map and for assessing the reliability of the model itself in particular the analyses regarding the regional model by di baldassarre et al 2006 described in detail in section 3 3 require the application of selective filters to the available dataset in order to be consistent with the criteria adopted in the original study for this reason in order to include the highest number of stations and data for each type of application the available datasets of ams and annual totals are further rearranged in different subsets as summarised in table 1 see section 3 3 for more details about the analyses and the corresponding criteria 3 methods 3 1 seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes changes in timing of sub daily rainfall extremes over the period 1961 2015 are assessed for each station by means of a trend analysis of the date of occurrence expressed in terms of julian date for each duration this analysis is based on the combined application of the adjusted theil sen slope estimator i e theil 1950 sen 1968 see also blöschl et al 2017 and the mann kendall test i e mann 1945 kendall 1975 for assessing the statistical significance a 5 significance level is considered i e statistically significant changes are associated with p values lower than 0 05 moreover the seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes for each station is assessed by means of directional statistics i e mardia 1972 bayliss and jones 1993 see also castellarin et al 2001 which represent the date of occurrence of the i th extreme rainfall event at a specific station in terms of polar coordinates i e a vector with unit magnitude and direction θ i see eq 9 in castellarin et al 2001 based on this the average date of occurrence see eq 10 12 in castellarin et al 2001 is represented with a vector whose direction θ is a measure of the mean timing and whose length r can be seen as a measure of regularity i e seasonality of the phenomenon i e the closer to 1 the stronger the seasonality the closer to 0 the greater the dispersion of the dates of occurrence throughout the year in the present study the representation in polar coordinates of the dates of occurrence is reproduced by means of the r packages r core team 2019 graphics used for representing vectors and circular agostinelli and lund 2017 used as a basis for computing the relative frequency of occurrence over the year results are described and compared for the two periods 1961 1989 and 1990 2015 3 2 changes in magnitude of sub daily rainfall extremes the analysis of the possible presence of changes in the magnitude of sub daily rainfall extremes is carried out by means of commonly used non parametric statistical tests which do not require any assumption on the properties of the statistical distribution of the data for each considered ams the trend is estimated with the theil sen slope estimator i e theil 1950 sen 1968 and the statistical significance is evaluated with the mann kendall test i e mann 1945 kendall 1975 also the pettitt test i e pettitt 1979 is applied to identify the presence of a shift in the central tendency of the series i e possible abrupt changes and associated change point years in the mean of the ams note that the considered non parametric tests require the series to be temporally independent which is a valid assumption when dealing with ams in the present study the above mentioned tests are applied by means of the r packages r core team 2019 kendall mcleod 2011 and trend pohlert 2020 consistent with the trend analyses performed for the date of occurrence see section 3 1 a 5 significance level is considered the analyses are applied to two different subsets the overall period 1931 2015 and the period 1961 2015 3 3 assessment of the accuracy of the available regional frequency model in light of the local significant changes in map detected by antolini et al 2016 the present study aims at assessing the current reliability and accuracy of the regional model proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 for estimating the frequency regime of sub daily rainfall extremes in the study area based on the local value of map which is considered as a proxy for local climatic conditions in line with several studies e g schaefer 1990 alila 1999 brath et al 2003 castellarin et al 2009 the model proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 allows one to compute the expected rainfall depth h d t associated with given duration d and return period t i e probability of occurrence in ungauged sites in the regions emilia romagna and marche assumed to be climatically homogeneous based on an index storm approach dalrymple 1960 brath et al 2003 1 h d t m d h d t where m d is the index storm i e scale factor which is site dependent and h d t is the dimensionless growth factor valid for the entire homogeneous pooling group of stations di baldassarre et al 2006 compute the growth factor by means of a gev generalized extreme value distribution jenkinson 1955 whose parameters can be estimated through the regional procedure based on l moments hosking and wallis 1997 with the aim of performing predictions in ungauged locations where sample l moments are not available di baldassarre et al 2006 developed an empirical regional model for estimating the regional l moments l c v r and l c s r i e l coefficient of variation and l coefficient of skewness respectively for rainfall annual maxima with the storm duration d of interest as a function of the local map value which is mostly affected by altitude in the study area see di baldassarre et al 2006 in particular di baldassarre et al 2006 formalise the relationship between l statistics of rainfall extremes and map through the following horton type relationship horton 1939 2 l c x m a p a b a e c m a p where l c x represents a particular regional l moment i e l c s r and l c v r associated with the ams of rainfall depth with duration d and a b c where 0 a b and c 0 are the parameters of the empirical model which were properly estimated by di baldassarre et al 2006 through a weighted least squares optimisation procedure the regional frequency model hereinafter also referred to as gev map for the sake of brevity was developed based on a database of ams of sub hourly 15 and 30 min sub daily 1 3 6 12 and 24 h and daily rainfall depths observed in the period 1935 1989 in order to incorporate as much information as possible they considered all available series having at least 30 years of data for daily and sub daily durations and at least 5 years of data for sub hourly durations as the presence of statistically significant changes in the ams could affect the capability of the model to reliably predict the design storm the present study aims at testing the model adequacy in reproducing the observed data using as input ams and map data collected in the period 1990 2015 that follows the period for which the model was calibrated i e 1935 1989 based on the dataset of cumulative yearly rainfall depths provided by arpae the following preliminary analyses are done 1 the pettitt test pettitt 1979 see also section 3 2 is applied to investigate the presence of abrupt changes in the mean of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths for the period 1931 2015 this analysis considers the 121 stations having at least 80 of complete years of data i e 68 years in 1931 2015 2 check whether for the period 1990 2015 altitude is the factor that most affects map computed as the average of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths available for each station in the study region as shown by di baldassarre et al 2006 for 1935 1989 to this aim a linear model is fitted between map and altitude for the period 1990 2015 to analyse their relationship for the 92 stations having at least 20 years of cumulative yearly rainfall depths over the same period 3 the horton type relationships between l statistics of extreme rainfall events and map considered in di baldassarre et al 2006 see eq 2 are compared with sample l c s and l c v observed in 1990 2015 for this period the stations having at least 20 years of data in terms of both cumulative yearly rainfall and ams are considered see also table 1 the above mentioned l statistics are computed by means of the r package r core team 2019 lmom hosking 2019 then the following procedure is applied by considering the stations with at least 20 station years of data in terms of both ams and cumulative yearly rainfall depths used for computing the map in the period 1990 2015 and at the same time complying with the criteria required by di baldassarre et al 2006 for the calibration of the model itself over the period 1935 1989 i e at least 30 station years of data for sub daily series and at least 5 station years of data for sub hourly series for which data availability is lower 4 the gev map model is applied by considering the coefficients a b c of eq 2 provided by di baldassarre et al 2006 to estimate the regional gev distribution on the basis of ams observed in 1990 2015 in particular in order to assess the influence of changes in cumulative yearly rainfall and ams the capability of the gev map model is evaluated to reproduce the a dimensionless and b dimensional at site rainfall distribution observed at the different sites in the period 1990 2015 in both cases the growth factor h d t is estimated based on the l moments computed as a function of the map observed in 1935 1989 for the dimensional case the index storm for the given station is computed as the mean value of the ams observed in 1935 1989 5 the agreement i e goodness of fit between the gev map model and the dimensionless and dimensional at site sample distributions observed in 1990 2015 is assessed by means of the kolmogorov smirnov test kolmogorov 1933 smirnov 1939 1948 which compares the distribution resulting from the model with the at site sample distribution evaluated with the weibull plotting position for the period 1990 2015 6 finally for each station and duration the 100 year rainfall quantile is estimated with the gev map model based on ams and map observed in 1935 1989 then to quantify changes the return period t associated with such a quantile is retrieved by applying the gev map model based on ams and map for the period 1990 2015 the dataset considered for the above mentioned analyses is composed of 33 and 39 stations for the durations 15 and 30 min and of 26 stations for the durations 1 3 6 12 and 24 h in this order see also table 1 4 results 4 1 seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes the combined application of the adjusted theil sen slope estimator and mann kendall test see section 3 1 highlights the presence of statistically significant i e p value 5 trends in timing over the period 1961 2015 for a few stations whose number and location depend on the considered duration see table 2 see also black bordered arrows in fig 2 among the detected statistically significant trends delays in timing are predominant more evident for longer durations and in the central western part of the apennine a visual representation of changes in seasonality of sub daily d 1 3 6 12 24 h rainfall extremes between the two periods 1961 1989 29 years and 1990 2015 26 years is reported in fig 2 where each station is represented with an arrow according to the polar representation described in section 3 1 direction and colour see the circular colour scale in fig 2a of each arrow indicate the average timing and the length is an indicator of the regularity of the annual maxima within the year i e the longer the arrow the higher the regularity for each period i e 1961 1989 1990 2015 fig 2 shows that increasing durations from 1 to 24 h are associated with lower regularity of annual maxima and a generalized slight delay in the mean timing moreover for a given period and duration the mean timing presents a slight shift moving from the lower elevations i e flatland and floodplains where average dates of occurrence are mainly concentrated in summer i e july and august to the apennine where the average timing is in autumn and early winter i e from september to december depending on the considered duration in addition fig 2 highlights the presence of a generalized delay in the mean date of occurrence from 1961 1989 to 1990 2015 for all the considered durations i e 62 67 72 67 and 65 of the stations for d 1 3 6 12 24 h in this order see table 2 for the statistically significant trends especially in the apennine area for 1 h duration see panels a and b in fig 2 a general shift in the mean date of occurrence associated with statistically significant trends for two stations only see table 2 is observed from late summer to autumn in the central western part of the apennine whereas less relevant shifts are detected in the other parts of the region for durations 3 and 6 h an analogous shift in the central western apennine is observed yet more evident i e 7 stations with statistically significant delays in timing for both durations see table 2 and associated with an increase in regularity i e seasonality from 1961 1989 to 1990 2015 for higher altitudes a slight increase in variability i e lower seasonality is also observed in the central plain and in the south eastern part of the region concerning the seasonality for 12 h duration the above mentioned general shift is confirmed for the apennine and observed also along the coastline yet at higher altitudes some series show the opposite behaviour i e the mean date of occurrence shifts from autumn early winter to early autumn finally for 24 h the same considerations are valid yet the central apennine is characterized by stations with slightly anticipated mean timing from late winter to autumn it is worth highlighting here that the average date of occurrence gives a concise description of the mean timing and is not capable of providing a complete indication regarding the temporal distribution of extreme events throughout the year i e some time series could have a multi modal distribution with different periods characterized by a higher frequency of occurrence therefore for each station the present study carries out also an analysis in terms of polar coordinates diagrams i e mardia 1972 bayliss and jones 1993 see section 3 1 for more details reporting together with the mean timing the temporal distribution of the single extreme events and the corresponding relative frequency of occurrence over the year as an example fig 3 shows the circular statistics of extreme rainfall events for the station of ferriere located in the apennine in the south western part of the region within an area where the delay in mean timing and the increase in regularity have been shown to be more evident points represent the single extreme events in the observed ams and are placed according to their date of occurrence blue and green points refer to 1961 1989 and 1990 2015 respectively arrows represent the mean date of occurrence for the considered subsets 1961 2015 red 1961 1989 blue 1990 2015 green and their length varies consistent with regularity the corresponding curves indicate the relative frequency of occurrence the more the curve distances itself from the black circle the stronger the seasonality as shown also in fig 2 ferriere is characterized by a delay in extreme events and an increase in regularity in the last decades 1990 2015 see green arrow and relative curve in fig 3 the increased regularity around the month of october is more evident for durations 12 and 24 h see panels d and e in fig 3 for which statistically significant trends have been detected in timing over the period 1961 2015 and is associated with a relative frequency of occurrence with unimodal behaviour different from the bimodal behaviour observed for the previous period i e 1961 1989 when extreme events were frequently detected also in spring march and april 4 2 changes in magnitude of sub daily rainfall extremes concerning the identification of possible trends and abrupt changes in the magnitude of ams of sub daily rainfall events duration 1 3 6 12 24 h two different subsets are considered 1931 2015 and 1961 2015 where the latter has been selected in order to include more stations than the former see table 1 the results of the application of all the considered non parametric statistical tests i e mann kendall theil sen slope pettitt see section 3 2 are reported in fig 4 where stations are represented with full or empty circles to indicate statistically significant i e p value 5 or non significant changes respectively and with blue or red colours for increasing and decreasing changes respectively for stations associated with statistically significant abrupt changes i e pettitt test the change point year is reported within the circle note that yellow bordered circles identify stations where significant changes are detected by pettitt test only a summary of the statistically significant changes detected in the study is reported in table 3 fig 4 and table 3 show for all considered subsets the predominance of significant increasing changes compared to the decreasing ones significant decreasing changes are observed in a few cases two stations in the western apennine area of the region for 1 h duration and 1931 2015 subset one station in the central part of the apennine for 1 h duration and 1961 2015 subset and another one in the same area for 3 h duration and 1931 2015 subset finally one station in the south eastern part of the region for 12 h duration and 1931 2015 subset decreasing changes do not appear to follow a clear spatial pattern and in some cases are actually detected for stations located in areas characterised by nearby increasing significant changes on the other hand significant increasing changes exhibit a slightly clearer spatial distribution for both subsets they are mainly located in the north eastern plain nearby the city of ferrara and in the apennine area this behaviour is particularly evident for the 1961 2015 subset for which the stations located in the area of the ligurian apennines south western part of the region show significant positive trends and abrupt changes with change point year mainly located in the period between mid 1980s and mid 1990s from 1985 to 1997 at the same time the empty circles in fig 4 which indicate trends resulting from the application of the mann kendall test but associated with a p value 5 i e statistically non significant highlight that some areas characterized by significant changes show also time series for which changes are not statistically significant moreover in some cases nearby stations show opposite trends 4 3 assessment of the accuracy of the available regional frequency model the analyses reported in the previous sections highlight the presence of significant changes in both timing and magnitude of sub hourly rainfall extremes in the study region these changes could affect the reliability of previously proposed regional models of daily and sub daily rainfall extremes frequency which use long term rainfall depths and map as a proxy for local climate conditions schaefer 1990 alila 1999 brath et al 2003 di baldassarre et al 2006 castellarin et al 2009 among these the regional model proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 is based on the idea that map can be considered as a proxy of the geographical location and therefore of the climate conditions in this context the present study aims at 1 verifying the reliability of the model and 2 testing whether the model is capable of reproducing the observed data by considering ams and map data collected in the period 1990 2015 for the analyses 121 stations among the 365 available are selected having at least 80 years of data in terms of cumulative yearly rainfall depth in the period 1931 2015 and the map is computed for them it is worth noting here that as di baldassarre et al 2006 estimate the parameters of the regional distribution as a function of the map changes in map can affect the shape of the distribution itself for this reason the pettitt test is used here to investigate the presence of abrupt changes in the mean of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths in the period 1931 2015 fig 5 a shows the statistically significant changes i e blue and red dots for increasing and decreasing abrupt changes respectively detected in the study area an overall decline in the cumulative yearly rainfall is observed consistent with what detected in antolini et al 2016 for the period 1961 2010 the positive changes in the areas close to ferrara and piacenza were already observed by antolini et al 2016 whereas the ones detected in the apennines close to reggio emilia were not detected before and can be explained with the longer time period considered in the present analyses i e 1931 2015 change point years are all before 1989 another important aspect is that for the period 1935 1989 di baldassarre et al 2006 showed that altitude is the factor that most affects the map the analyses performed herein for the 92 stations with at least 20 years of data in the period 1990 2015 highlight that the above mentioned changes do not affect the increasing relationship between map and altitude see plot and map in fig 5b which is consistent with the one observed in di baldassarre et al 2006 with analogous coefficient of determination r2 i e 0 674 versus 0 696 observed in their study as a further preliminary analysis the horton type relationships between l statistics of extreme rainfall events and map provided by di baldassarre et al 2006 are compared with the sample l c s and l c v observed in the period 1990 2015 for the stations having at least 20 years of data in terms of both cumulative yearly rainfall and ams i e 65 stations for 15 min 68 stations for 30 min and 74 stations for sub daily durations see fig 6 for the sake of comparison for each considered duration the 10 stations window moving average of sample l statistics is plotted versus the corresponding empirical regional models proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 although the dataset considered in the present study is not identical to the one analysed in di baldassarre et al 2006 i e emilia romagna only is included here and the considered stations are not the same considered in their study the comparison suggests that the empirical relationships properly reproduce the observed l c v for all the considered durations but 15 min for which the sample moving average though approximately constant is shifted upward see panel b in fig 6 a less coherent behaviour is observed for l c s especially for lower durations based on these considerations to evaluate the influence of changes in cumulative yearly rainfall and ams on the gev map model the capability of the gev map model is assessed in reproducing the a dimensionless and b dimensional at site rainfall distribution observed at the different sites in the period 1990 2015 the agreement between the gev map model and the at site sample distributions i e plotted with the weibull plotting position is assessed by means of the kolmogorov smirnov test the analyses highlight that the gev map model properly reproduces the dimensionless at site sample distributions for the vast majority of stations only few stations show a poor match with the model in terms of dimensionless distribution of rainfall extremes see table 4 concerning the dimensional at site distribution of rainfall extremes table 4 also highlights that the gev map model applied to data observed in the period 1990 2015 is not capable of properly reproducing the dimensional at site distributions for a considerable number of stations stations with this behaviour are mostly located in the same areas where statistically significant changes in ams and map have been detected in the analyses reported in the previous sections see e g panel a in fig 7 for 6 h duration the outcomes of these analyses suggest that 1 the gev map model is capable of properly reproducing the shape of the distribution i e the estimate of the model parameters seems not to be significantly affected by changes in map 2 the mismatch between the gev map model and the observed dimensional distributions for the period 1990 2015 is mainly due to the observed changes in the mean of observed ams these considerations are strengthened by plotting the estimated and observed distributions for the considered stations as an example panels b and c in fig 7 provide the comparison between the distribution computed with the gev map model and the at site sample distributions dimensionless and dimensional respectively for the station of cabanne the shape of the estimated distribution remains the same but the dimensional one is shifted due to the fact that the index storm considered in the model refers to the ams collected in the period 1935 1989 whereas the observed dimensional at site distribution refers to 1990 2015 as a result the predicted return period obtained by applying the gev map model is severely altered the comparison between the rainfall quantile associated with 100 year return period according to the gev map model applied for 1935 1989 and the return period associated with the same quantile obtained by referring to rainfall data observed in 1990 2015 highlights the presence of remarkable differences concerning sub hourly durations for 15 min there is the general tendency to overestimate the return period i e the 100 year rainfall quantile evaluated for 1935 1989 becomes less frequent for 1990 2015 whereas for 30 min rainfall events both overestimation mostly located in the eastern part of the region and underestimation in the western part where significant trends in ams have been detected here for longer durations see section 4 2 are observed this behaviour could be also explained by the short record length for the sub hourly series available for the period 1935 1989 at the same time for sub daily durations i e d 1 3 6 12 24 h an overall overestimation of the return period is observed associated with the presence of an increased frequency of extreme events in the last decades see fig 6 a as an example for 6 h duration 5 discussion the analyses reported in the previous sections highlight the presence of changes in both timing and magnitude of sub daily extreme rainfall events in the last decades concerning seasonality a generalized shift in the mean date of occurrence is observed from 1961 1989 to 1990 2015 for all the considered durations a delay in the mean timing of extreme events from late summer to autumn is observed for durations up to 6 h more evident in the central western part of the apennine within the study region where statistically significant trends are detected in timing and where also regularity tends to increase with increasing altitudes this general tendency confirms the delay observed for the flooding season in the mediterranean areas by blöschl et al 2017 in the last five decades yet the finer resolution of the dataset considered herein enables to highlight a much richer and more complex figure in fact for higher durations i e 12 and 24 h the behaviour is confirmed yet some stations in the apennine area show slightly anticipated mean timing from autumn early winter to early autumn in general for each duration the mean timing presents a slight shift moving from the flatland and floodplains mean timing in summer to the apennine average timing in autumn early winter depending on the duration consistent with the different dynamical characteristics of the underlying atmospheric processes more linked to convective dynamics over the plains and to orographic amplification of large scale dynamics over the mountains moreover for all the considered durations the last decades i e 1990 2015 are characterized by a generalized decrease in regularity at lower elevations i e floodplains and an increase at higher elevations i e mountainous area especially in the central western part of the region the first result seems to suggest that convective processes are becoming more frequent over the plain in the extended winter season from october to march while the second is consistent with the significant changes in the amplitude of intense daily events observed over the northern apennines by other studies antolini et al 2016 pavan et al 2019 i e an increase in autumn and a corresponding decrease in summer and spring the higher sensitivity of the apennine area to changes in sub daily rainfall extremes is observed also in terms of magnitude i e trends and abrupt changes the western part of the region shows a statistically significant increase in the intensity of sub daily extreme events this is particularly clear for the 1961 2015 subset for which the stations located in the area of the ligurian apennines close to the tyrrhenian mountainside present significant positive trends and abrupt changes change point years from 1985 1997 this behaviour is in accordance with the already mentioned significant increase in the amplitude of intense daily precipitation events observed especially in autumn by pavan et al 2019 other significant increasing changes are observed for the apennines in the south eastern part of the region and in the area close to ferrara north eastern part of the study region consistent with the increase in cumulative yearly rainfall depths observed for the same area in the present study see fig 5 a and in other recent studies i e antolini et al 2016 pavan et al 2019 this said no clear spatial pattern is observed for the few decreasing changes detected in the study area which in some cases are actually detected for stations located in areas characterised by nearby increasing significant changes these results further highlight the variability and complexity of processes and seem to confirm what observed in libertino et al 2019 which showed the presence of distinct patterns of change in small domains statistically significant abrupt changes are detected also in the mean of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths over the period 1931 2015 which is characterized by an overall decline of the values consistent with what observed in antolini et al 2016 for 1961 2010 all the above mentioned changes are shown to affect the reliability of the previously proposed regional model developed by di baldassarre et al 2006 herein termed gev map which considers map as a proxy of the geographical location mostly altitude in the study domain and therefore of climate conditions the gev map model applied with data observed in 1935 1989 is shown to be not capable of properly reproducing the dimensional at site sample distribution for the period 1990 2015 this behaviour which is more evident for short durations especially for sub hourly ones i e 15 and 30 min see table 4 appears to be mainly associated with the changes in ams detected for the last decades indeed whereas the shape of the estimated distribution properly represents the dimensionless at site sample in several cases the dimensional gev map curve evaluated over the period 1935 1989 is shifted with respect to the ams collected in 1990 2015 due to the fact that the index storm considered in the model refers to the ams collected in 1935 1989 this results in an overall overestimation of the return period in 1990 2015 see fig 7 for 6 h duration and indicates an increased magnitude of extreme events in the last decades consistent with the increase observed in the mean of ams at the same time the observed generalized decreasing abrupt changes in map seem not to significantly affect the capability of the gev map model to properly reproduce the dimensionless rainfall distribution in this regard the relationships between map and l statistics proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 for 1935 1989 are mostly confirmed for the period 1990 2015 yet some differences are observed for lower durations especially sub hourly ones i e 15 and 30 min and for l c s in this regard it is worth highlighting here that estimating the parameters of the gev map model as a function of map only makes the model easy to apply but also represents a potential limit of the model itself developing a regional model based on indices which are still easy to measure but have stronger dynamical links with ams could help to improve the model on a physical basis this issue is suggested for future studies the proper understanding of the potential role and relationships among the above mentioned changes in rainfall extremes and recent flooding events occurred in emilia romagna requires additional analyses aimed at quantitatively assessing changes in flood hazard such analyses are suggested for future studies and must consider that the identification of the possible main drivers of the recent increases in flood damage should account for all the components of flood risk i e also vulnerability and exposure which are deeply related to the maintenance of territory and infrastructures as well as to changes in land use due to human activities and population dynamics for instance domeneghetti et al 2015 show for the floodplain system of the po river a stable population since the 1950s and yet a dramatic increase in the exposure to floods in residential settlements which has doubled in the last 7 decades there are therefore strong evidences of changes in vulnerability of the territory whose management is a central topic and cannot be neglected when evaluating changes in flood risk over the study region 6 conclusions the present study analyses a recently compiled regional dataset of sub daily and sub hourly rainfall annual maximum depths collected over the period 1931 2015 in emilia romagna northern italy affected by several destructive flood events in the last years the aim is to assess the presence of significant changes in the frequency regime of rainfall extremes in terms of both seasonality and magnitude in order to guarantee reliability and robustness of the analyses the dataset has been preliminary filtered to select the ams characterized by sufficient record length and statistical homogeneity the sub hourly dataset is regarded as not sufficiently robust for assessing changes concerning seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes in the period 1961 2015 a generalized delay in the mean timing of extreme events from late summer to autumn is observed during the last decades more pronounced in the central western part of the apennine while an opposite behaviour is locally observed for some stations in the same area for higher durations i e 12 and 24 h moreover for the apennine area a generalized increase is observed in the regularity of extreme events more pronounced with increasing altitudes and for the central western part of the region and mainly associated with the decreased frequency of annual maxima in spring and summer on the other hand regularity decreases in the plain area where annual maxima have become more dispersed throughout the year also statistically significant trends and abrupt changes are detected in terms of magnitude for both the periods 1931 2015 and 1961 2015 with a predominant increase in sub daily rainfall extremes more evident in the area of the ligurian apennines close to the tyrrhenian mountainside of the apennine change point years from 1985 1997 consistent with the statistically significant increase in intense daily rainfall events observed in other studies other significant increasing changes are observed in the south eastern apennine area within the region and the area of ferrara where previous studies i e antolini et al 2016 pavan et al 2019 detected analogous increases also in cumulative yearly rainfall depths few decreasing changes have been detected in the study area without a clear spatial pattern the results confirm the outcomes of libertino et al 2019 in terms of the presence of different patterns of change in small domains together with the statistically significant generalized decrease in the mean of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths observed over the period 1931 2015 consistent with the outcomes of antolini et al 2016 for 1961 2010 the above mentioned changes are shown to affect the reliability of the previously proposed regional model developed by di baldassarre et al 2006 for predicting the design storm in the study area based on mean annual precipitation map as a proxy of the geographical location and on data observed in the period 1935 1989 the regional model is shown to properly reproduce the shape of the at site distribution of ams observed in 1990 2015 yet to fail in representing its dimensional component especially for sub daily durations i e 15 and 30 min resulting in an overall overestimation of the return period in 1990 2015 this behaviour seems to be mainly associated with changes detected in ams which affect the estimation of the index storm whereas changes in map seem not to significantly affect the reliability of the model at the same time an update of the regional model is suggested for future studies accounting also for indices presenting a stronger link with ams and with atmospheric dynamics so as to improve the prediction ability of the model the proper understanding of the effects of the above mentioned changes in rainfall extremes on the recent flooding events occurred in emilia romagna requires future additional quantitative analyses which should consider all the components of flood risk including

8300,study region the present study focuses on emilia romagna northern italy a densely populated region affected in the last few years by several destructive flood events study focus a rich and detailed regional dataset of annual maximum series ams of sub daily rainfall is considered with a three fold aim to detect possible changes in 1 seasonality and 2 magnitude of sub daily rainfall extremes 3 to assess the current reliability and accuracy of a previously developed regional model for rainfall frequency estimation based on the local value of mean annual precipitation map new hydrological insights for the region the main findings of the study include 1 delay towards autumn in the mean timing of sub daily rainfall extremes more marked for higher elevations and longer durations 2 significant increase in the magnitude of sub daily extreme events for some areas especially in the apennine 3 high sensitivity of the regional predictions of the frequency regime of sub daily rainfall extremes to local changes in ams and map keywords climate change annual maximum series mean annual precipitation circular statistics design storm 1 introduction economic losses and social consequences caused by hydrological extreme events in italy as well as in many other european countries have been steadily increasing over the last three decades see e g guha sapir et al 2016 carisi et al 2017 the literature indicates several possible factors as responsible of such a situation climate change and the resulting intensification of extreme hydrological events see e g brunetti et al 2002 uboldi and lussana 2018 as well as the impact of anthropization on flood risk changes as a result of the increase in exposure to flooding due to land use and land cover modifications see e g bouwer et al 2010 di baldassarre et al 2013 domeneghetti et al 2015 prosdocimi et al 2015 requena et al 2017 leal et al 2019 in particular the frequency of floods caused by extreme rainfall events has increased significantly in recent years see e g fischer et al 2019 and urban areas have been shown to be particularly vulnerable to the impacts of these events triggering the development of fast processing algorithms for pluvial flood hazard assessment see e g safer rain by samela et al 2020 as a basis for identifying flood risk mitigation measures and plans under current and future climates in this context the detection of changes in flood behaviour is crucial yet limited by the knowledge of the processes that control magnitude frequency and timing of flood events see e g merz et al 2012 in this respect within the uph unsolved problems in hydrology initiative of the iahs international association of hydrological sciences blöschl et al 2019a call for a common effort by the scientific community to understand if the hydrological cycle is regionally accelerating or decelerating and to quantify seasonal alterations of flood drivers with respect to the intensification of extreme hydrological events a recent study conducted by blöschl et al 2017 on a pan european database from 4262 observational hydrometric stations for the past five decades finds clear patterns of change in flood timing earlier spring snowmelt floods in north eastern europe due to warmer temperatures later winter floods around the north sea and some sectors of the mediterranean coast due to delayed winter storms associated with polar warming and earlier winter floods in western europe due to earlier soil moisture maxima furthermore blöschl et al 2019b show the presence of significant changes in flood magnitudes over large areas in europe increasing trends in north western europe due to increasing autumn and winter rainfall and decreasing trends in southern europe due to decreasing precipitation and increasing evaporation and in eastern europe associated with decreasing snow cover and snowmelt due to warmer temperatures a global analysis recently performed by papalexiou and montanari 2019 on a dataset of 8730 daily precipitation records in the period 1964 2013 i e characterized by an acceleration of global warming highlights that the signal of change is not as evident for rainfall extremes over large areas frequency not magnitude is affected for daily maxima worldwide also when it comes to the analysis of sequences of sub daily rainfall extremes the assessment of changes becomes even more troublesome due to data availability most time series are too short while the long ones are often non homogeneous i e they may contain variations due to non climatic factors such as sensors updates sensor relocation changes and anthropization of the surrounding environments etc see e g alexandersson 1984 1986 a recent study by libertino et al 2019 describes the presence of significant changes in amplitude of sub daily rainfall extremes i e annual maxima at specific locations across italy yet significant trends do not appear at the whole country scale distinct patterns of change emerge in smaller areas with homogeneous geographical characteristics therefore highlighting the need of developing more systematic and localized approaches for a consistent large scale trend detection at the same time libertino et al 2019 do not consider changes in seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes other recent studies show evidences of statistically significant changes in seasonal and annual rainfall totals across europe and in particular in northern italy e g antolini et al 2016 pavan et al 2019 literature shows several examples of regional models of daily and sub daily rainfall extremes frequency that use long term mean annual rainfall total hereafter also referred to as mean annual precipitation or map as a proxy for local climate conditions schaefer 1990 alila 1999 brath et al 2003 di baldassarre et al 2006 castellarin et al 2009 in particular di baldassarre et al 2006 based on data observed in the period 1935 1989 propose a regional frequency model for estimating the rainfall depth for a given duration and recurrence interval i e return period based on the dependence of the statistical properties i e l moments see hosking and wallis 1997 of rainfall extremes on the value of the map therefore changes in local map value could imply changes in frequency and magnitude of daily and sub daily rainfall extremes in this context the present study focuses on emilia romagna a densely populated region 200 inhabitants km2 in the po valley northern italy within an area which accounts for more than 40 of the italian gross national product gnp according to the italian institute of environmental protection and research ispra istituto superiore per la protezione e la ricerca ambientale 2018 63 6 of the population and 63 1 of the companies in emilia romagna can be potentially affected by floods with a medium probability likely return period greater than 100 years in the past few years emilia romagna was affected by several destructive flood events large fluvial flooding e g secchia and panaro rivers in january 2014 enza river in december 2017 reno river in february 2019 idice river in november 2019 flash flooding in mountainous areas e g alta val nure in september 2015 intense pluvial flooding in urban areas e g rimini in june 2013 the present study refers to a rich detailed complete and recently compiled regional dataset of sub daily rainfall annual maximum depth for emilia romagna with a three fold purpose 1 to perform a detailed analysis of possible changes in seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes 2 to detect changes in their magnitude and 3 in the light of regional changes of map found by antolini et al 2016 to assess the current reliability and accuracy of the regional model developed by di baldassarre et al 2006 that predicts the frequency regime of sub daily rainfall extremes based on the local value of map 2 study area and dataset the analyses performed in this study consider a dataset of annual maximum series ams of sub daily duration d equal to 1 3 6 12 and 24 h and sub hourly d 5 10 15 20 30 and 45 min rainfall depths collected at 500 stations in emilia romagna and its surroundings over the period 1931 2015 see fig 1 rainfall data are provided by the regional agency for prevention environment and energy arpae the present study benefits from the homogeneity analyses of precipitation time series performed for the region by antolini et al 2016 who applied the standard normal homogeneity test snht see alexandersson 1984 1986 to annual total precipitation time series here it is assumed that time series which resulted to be homogeneous in antolini et al 2016 in terms of annual total precipitation are homogeneous also in terms of annual maxima in this way the original dataset has been filtered to consider only statistically homogeneous time series with at least 80 of data availability over the considered period based on this preliminary investigation on homogeneity and consistence the sub hourly dataset shows an inadequacy of the available time series and is regarded as not suitable for assessing the possible presence of changes by means of the non parametric statistical tests therefore in the following only the sub daily dataset is considered for assessing changes in seasonality and magnitude for the analyses presented here the dataset of sub daily extreme rainfall events is rearranged in order to consider two different subsets in which only the time series covering at least the 80 of the period are considered 1931 2015 85 years and 1961 2015 55 years this latter characterized by greater data availability see first two rows in table 1 it is worth highlighting that based on the above mentioned filters the dataset considered for the analyses is characterized by a non uniform spatial distribution over the study area in particular data coverage decreases at lower elevations in the floodplain areas see e g figs 1 and 2 for the analyses focused on seasonality the subset 1961 2015 is further divided into two subsets having a climatic validity i e nearly 30 years of observation 1961 1989 29 years and 1990 2015 26 years the choice of 1989 as a reference year for the identification of these two subsets instead of the median year 1988 is done to be consistent with the analyses aimed at assessing the current reliability of the regional model developed by di baldassarre et al 2006 which was developed with data collected up to 1989 together with the above mentioned sub daily dataset this study also considers a detailed dataset of annual total i e cumulative yearly rainfall depths for 365 stations in the region provided by arpae this need is related to the outcomes of the recent study by antolini et al 2016 which shows local significant changes in map i e mean annual cumulated precipitation in emilia romagna over the period 1961 2010 a prevailing locally significant decrease attributed mostly to the decrease in winter and spring rainfall totals was identified over the region more pronounced in the western mountains whereas some areas close to the po river delta show significant increases mostly explained by the significant positive trends detected in spring and autumn rainfall in the same areas as the regional model by di baldassarre et al 2006 uses map as a proxy for predicting the frequency regime of sub daily rainfall extremes the availability of the dataset of annual totals is crucial for describing and understanding changes in the map and for assessing the reliability of the model itself in particular the analyses regarding the regional model by di baldassarre et al 2006 described in detail in section 3 3 require the application of selective filters to the available dataset in order to be consistent with the criteria adopted in the original study for this reason in order to include the highest number of stations and data for each type of application the available datasets of ams and annual totals are further rearranged in different subsets as summarised in table 1 see section 3 3 for more details about the analyses and the corresponding criteria 3 methods 3 1 seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes changes in timing of sub daily rainfall extremes over the period 1961 2015 are assessed for each station by means of a trend analysis of the date of occurrence expressed in terms of julian date for each duration this analysis is based on the combined application of the adjusted theil sen slope estimator i e theil 1950 sen 1968 see also blöschl et al 2017 and the mann kendall test i e mann 1945 kendall 1975 for assessing the statistical significance a 5 significance level is considered i e statistically significant changes are associated with p values lower than 0 05 moreover the seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes for each station is assessed by means of directional statistics i e mardia 1972 bayliss and jones 1993 see also castellarin et al 2001 which represent the date of occurrence of the i th extreme rainfall event at a specific station in terms of polar coordinates i e a vector with unit magnitude and direction θ i see eq 9 in castellarin et al 2001 based on this the average date of occurrence see eq 10 12 in castellarin et al 2001 is represented with a vector whose direction θ is a measure of the mean timing and whose length r can be seen as a measure of regularity i e seasonality of the phenomenon i e the closer to 1 the stronger the seasonality the closer to 0 the greater the dispersion of the dates of occurrence throughout the year in the present study the representation in polar coordinates of the dates of occurrence is reproduced by means of the r packages r core team 2019 graphics used for representing vectors and circular agostinelli and lund 2017 used as a basis for computing the relative frequency of occurrence over the year results are described and compared for the two periods 1961 1989 and 1990 2015 3 2 changes in magnitude of sub daily rainfall extremes the analysis of the possible presence of changes in the magnitude of sub daily rainfall extremes is carried out by means of commonly used non parametric statistical tests which do not require any assumption on the properties of the statistical distribution of the data for each considered ams the trend is estimated with the theil sen slope estimator i e theil 1950 sen 1968 and the statistical significance is evaluated with the mann kendall test i e mann 1945 kendall 1975 also the pettitt test i e pettitt 1979 is applied to identify the presence of a shift in the central tendency of the series i e possible abrupt changes and associated change point years in the mean of the ams note that the considered non parametric tests require the series to be temporally independent which is a valid assumption when dealing with ams in the present study the above mentioned tests are applied by means of the r packages r core team 2019 kendall mcleod 2011 and trend pohlert 2020 consistent with the trend analyses performed for the date of occurrence see section 3 1 a 5 significance level is considered the analyses are applied to two different subsets the overall period 1931 2015 and the period 1961 2015 3 3 assessment of the accuracy of the available regional frequency model in light of the local significant changes in map detected by antolini et al 2016 the present study aims at assessing the current reliability and accuracy of the regional model proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 for estimating the frequency regime of sub daily rainfall extremes in the study area based on the local value of map which is considered as a proxy for local climatic conditions in line with several studies e g schaefer 1990 alila 1999 brath et al 2003 castellarin et al 2009 the model proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 allows one to compute the expected rainfall depth h d t associated with given duration d and return period t i e probability of occurrence in ungauged sites in the regions emilia romagna and marche assumed to be climatically homogeneous based on an index storm approach dalrymple 1960 brath et al 2003 1 h d t m d h d t where m d is the index storm i e scale factor which is site dependent and h d t is the dimensionless growth factor valid for the entire homogeneous pooling group of stations di baldassarre et al 2006 compute the growth factor by means of a gev generalized extreme value distribution jenkinson 1955 whose parameters can be estimated through the regional procedure based on l moments hosking and wallis 1997 with the aim of performing predictions in ungauged locations where sample l moments are not available di baldassarre et al 2006 developed an empirical regional model for estimating the regional l moments l c v r and l c s r i e l coefficient of variation and l coefficient of skewness respectively for rainfall annual maxima with the storm duration d of interest as a function of the local map value which is mostly affected by altitude in the study area see di baldassarre et al 2006 in particular di baldassarre et al 2006 formalise the relationship between l statistics of rainfall extremes and map through the following horton type relationship horton 1939 2 l c x m a p a b a e c m a p where l c x represents a particular regional l moment i e l c s r and l c v r associated with the ams of rainfall depth with duration d and a b c where 0 a b and c 0 are the parameters of the empirical model which were properly estimated by di baldassarre et al 2006 through a weighted least squares optimisation procedure the regional frequency model hereinafter also referred to as gev map for the sake of brevity was developed based on a database of ams of sub hourly 15 and 30 min sub daily 1 3 6 12 and 24 h and daily rainfall depths observed in the period 1935 1989 in order to incorporate as much information as possible they considered all available series having at least 30 years of data for daily and sub daily durations and at least 5 years of data for sub hourly durations as the presence of statistically significant changes in the ams could affect the capability of the model to reliably predict the design storm the present study aims at testing the model adequacy in reproducing the observed data using as input ams and map data collected in the period 1990 2015 that follows the period for which the model was calibrated i e 1935 1989 based on the dataset of cumulative yearly rainfall depths provided by arpae the following preliminary analyses are done 1 the pettitt test pettitt 1979 see also section 3 2 is applied to investigate the presence of abrupt changes in the mean of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths for the period 1931 2015 this analysis considers the 121 stations having at least 80 of complete years of data i e 68 years in 1931 2015 2 check whether for the period 1990 2015 altitude is the factor that most affects map computed as the average of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths available for each station in the study region as shown by di baldassarre et al 2006 for 1935 1989 to this aim a linear model is fitted between map and altitude for the period 1990 2015 to analyse their relationship for the 92 stations having at least 20 years of cumulative yearly rainfall depths over the same period 3 the horton type relationships between l statistics of extreme rainfall events and map considered in di baldassarre et al 2006 see eq 2 are compared with sample l c s and l c v observed in 1990 2015 for this period the stations having at least 20 years of data in terms of both cumulative yearly rainfall and ams are considered see also table 1 the above mentioned l statistics are computed by means of the r package r core team 2019 lmom hosking 2019 then the following procedure is applied by considering the stations with at least 20 station years of data in terms of both ams and cumulative yearly rainfall depths used for computing the map in the period 1990 2015 and at the same time complying with the criteria required by di baldassarre et al 2006 for the calibration of the model itself over the period 1935 1989 i e at least 30 station years of data for sub daily series and at least 5 station years of data for sub hourly series for which data availability is lower 4 the gev map model is applied by considering the coefficients a b c of eq 2 provided by di baldassarre et al 2006 to estimate the regional gev distribution on the basis of ams observed in 1990 2015 in particular in order to assess the influence of changes in cumulative yearly rainfall and ams the capability of the gev map model is evaluated to reproduce the a dimensionless and b dimensional at site rainfall distribution observed at the different sites in the period 1990 2015 in both cases the growth factor h d t is estimated based on the l moments computed as a function of the map observed in 1935 1989 for the dimensional case the index storm for the given station is computed as the mean value of the ams observed in 1935 1989 5 the agreement i e goodness of fit between the gev map model and the dimensionless and dimensional at site sample distributions observed in 1990 2015 is assessed by means of the kolmogorov smirnov test kolmogorov 1933 smirnov 1939 1948 which compares the distribution resulting from the model with the at site sample distribution evaluated with the weibull plotting position for the period 1990 2015 6 finally for each station and duration the 100 year rainfall quantile is estimated with the gev map model based on ams and map observed in 1935 1989 then to quantify changes the return period t associated with such a quantile is retrieved by applying the gev map model based on ams and map for the period 1990 2015 the dataset considered for the above mentioned analyses is composed of 33 and 39 stations for the durations 15 and 30 min and of 26 stations for the durations 1 3 6 12 and 24 h in this order see also table 1 4 results 4 1 seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes the combined application of the adjusted theil sen slope estimator and mann kendall test see section 3 1 highlights the presence of statistically significant i e p value 5 trends in timing over the period 1961 2015 for a few stations whose number and location depend on the considered duration see table 2 see also black bordered arrows in fig 2 among the detected statistically significant trends delays in timing are predominant more evident for longer durations and in the central western part of the apennine a visual representation of changes in seasonality of sub daily d 1 3 6 12 24 h rainfall extremes between the two periods 1961 1989 29 years and 1990 2015 26 years is reported in fig 2 where each station is represented with an arrow according to the polar representation described in section 3 1 direction and colour see the circular colour scale in fig 2a of each arrow indicate the average timing and the length is an indicator of the regularity of the annual maxima within the year i e the longer the arrow the higher the regularity for each period i e 1961 1989 1990 2015 fig 2 shows that increasing durations from 1 to 24 h are associated with lower regularity of annual maxima and a generalized slight delay in the mean timing moreover for a given period and duration the mean timing presents a slight shift moving from the lower elevations i e flatland and floodplains where average dates of occurrence are mainly concentrated in summer i e july and august to the apennine where the average timing is in autumn and early winter i e from september to december depending on the considered duration in addition fig 2 highlights the presence of a generalized delay in the mean date of occurrence from 1961 1989 to 1990 2015 for all the considered durations i e 62 67 72 67 and 65 of the stations for d 1 3 6 12 24 h in this order see table 2 for the statistically significant trends especially in the apennine area for 1 h duration see panels a and b in fig 2 a general shift in the mean date of occurrence associated with statistically significant trends for two stations only see table 2 is observed from late summer to autumn in the central western part of the apennine whereas less relevant shifts are detected in the other parts of the region for durations 3 and 6 h an analogous shift in the central western apennine is observed yet more evident i e 7 stations with statistically significant delays in timing for both durations see table 2 and associated with an increase in regularity i e seasonality from 1961 1989 to 1990 2015 for higher altitudes a slight increase in variability i e lower seasonality is also observed in the central plain and in the south eastern part of the region concerning the seasonality for 12 h duration the above mentioned general shift is confirmed for the apennine and observed also along the coastline yet at higher altitudes some series show the opposite behaviour i e the mean date of occurrence shifts from autumn early winter to early autumn finally for 24 h the same considerations are valid yet the central apennine is characterized by stations with slightly anticipated mean timing from late winter to autumn it is worth highlighting here that the average date of occurrence gives a concise description of the mean timing and is not capable of providing a complete indication regarding the temporal distribution of extreme events throughout the year i e some time series could have a multi modal distribution with different periods characterized by a higher frequency of occurrence therefore for each station the present study carries out also an analysis in terms of polar coordinates diagrams i e mardia 1972 bayliss and jones 1993 see section 3 1 for more details reporting together with the mean timing the temporal distribution of the single extreme events and the corresponding relative frequency of occurrence over the year as an example fig 3 shows the circular statistics of extreme rainfall events for the station of ferriere located in the apennine in the south western part of the region within an area where the delay in mean timing and the increase in regularity have been shown to be more evident points represent the single extreme events in the observed ams and are placed according to their date of occurrence blue and green points refer to 1961 1989 and 1990 2015 respectively arrows represent the mean date of occurrence for the considered subsets 1961 2015 red 1961 1989 blue 1990 2015 green and their length varies consistent with regularity the corresponding curves indicate the relative frequency of occurrence the more the curve distances itself from the black circle the stronger the seasonality as shown also in fig 2 ferriere is characterized by a delay in extreme events and an increase in regularity in the last decades 1990 2015 see green arrow and relative curve in fig 3 the increased regularity around the month of october is more evident for durations 12 and 24 h see panels d and e in fig 3 for which statistically significant trends have been detected in timing over the period 1961 2015 and is associated with a relative frequency of occurrence with unimodal behaviour different from the bimodal behaviour observed for the previous period i e 1961 1989 when extreme events were frequently detected also in spring march and april 4 2 changes in magnitude of sub daily rainfall extremes concerning the identification of possible trends and abrupt changes in the magnitude of ams of sub daily rainfall events duration 1 3 6 12 24 h two different subsets are considered 1931 2015 and 1961 2015 where the latter has been selected in order to include more stations than the former see table 1 the results of the application of all the considered non parametric statistical tests i e mann kendall theil sen slope pettitt see section 3 2 are reported in fig 4 where stations are represented with full or empty circles to indicate statistically significant i e p value 5 or non significant changes respectively and with blue or red colours for increasing and decreasing changes respectively for stations associated with statistically significant abrupt changes i e pettitt test the change point year is reported within the circle note that yellow bordered circles identify stations where significant changes are detected by pettitt test only a summary of the statistically significant changes detected in the study is reported in table 3 fig 4 and table 3 show for all considered subsets the predominance of significant increasing changes compared to the decreasing ones significant decreasing changes are observed in a few cases two stations in the western apennine area of the region for 1 h duration and 1931 2015 subset one station in the central part of the apennine for 1 h duration and 1961 2015 subset and another one in the same area for 3 h duration and 1931 2015 subset finally one station in the south eastern part of the region for 12 h duration and 1931 2015 subset decreasing changes do not appear to follow a clear spatial pattern and in some cases are actually detected for stations located in areas characterised by nearby increasing significant changes on the other hand significant increasing changes exhibit a slightly clearer spatial distribution for both subsets they are mainly located in the north eastern plain nearby the city of ferrara and in the apennine area this behaviour is particularly evident for the 1961 2015 subset for which the stations located in the area of the ligurian apennines south western part of the region show significant positive trends and abrupt changes with change point year mainly located in the period between mid 1980s and mid 1990s from 1985 to 1997 at the same time the empty circles in fig 4 which indicate trends resulting from the application of the mann kendall test but associated with a p value 5 i e statistically non significant highlight that some areas characterized by significant changes show also time series for which changes are not statistically significant moreover in some cases nearby stations show opposite trends 4 3 assessment of the accuracy of the available regional frequency model the analyses reported in the previous sections highlight the presence of significant changes in both timing and magnitude of sub hourly rainfall extremes in the study region these changes could affect the reliability of previously proposed regional models of daily and sub daily rainfall extremes frequency which use long term rainfall depths and map as a proxy for local climate conditions schaefer 1990 alila 1999 brath et al 2003 di baldassarre et al 2006 castellarin et al 2009 among these the regional model proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 is based on the idea that map can be considered as a proxy of the geographical location and therefore of the climate conditions in this context the present study aims at 1 verifying the reliability of the model and 2 testing whether the model is capable of reproducing the observed data by considering ams and map data collected in the period 1990 2015 for the analyses 121 stations among the 365 available are selected having at least 80 years of data in terms of cumulative yearly rainfall depth in the period 1931 2015 and the map is computed for them it is worth noting here that as di baldassarre et al 2006 estimate the parameters of the regional distribution as a function of the map changes in map can affect the shape of the distribution itself for this reason the pettitt test is used here to investigate the presence of abrupt changes in the mean of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths in the period 1931 2015 fig 5 a shows the statistically significant changes i e blue and red dots for increasing and decreasing abrupt changes respectively detected in the study area an overall decline in the cumulative yearly rainfall is observed consistent with what detected in antolini et al 2016 for the period 1961 2010 the positive changes in the areas close to ferrara and piacenza were already observed by antolini et al 2016 whereas the ones detected in the apennines close to reggio emilia were not detected before and can be explained with the longer time period considered in the present analyses i e 1931 2015 change point years are all before 1989 another important aspect is that for the period 1935 1989 di baldassarre et al 2006 showed that altitude is the factor that most affects the map the analyses performed herein for the 92 stations with at least 20 years of data in the period 1990 2015 highlight that the above mentioned changes do not affect the increasing relationship between map and altitude see plot and map in fig 5b which is consistent with the one observed in di baldassarre et al 2006 with analogous coefficient of determination r2 i e 0 674 versus 0 696 observed in their study as a further preliminary analysis the horton type relationships between l statistics of extreme rainfall events and map provided by di baldassarre et al 2006 are compared with the sample l c s and l c v observed in the period 1990 2015 for the stations having at least 20 years of data in terms of both cumulative yearly rainfall and ams i e 65 stations for 15 min 68 stations for 30 min and 74 stations for sub daily durations see fig 6 for the sake of comparison for each considered duration the 10 stations window moving average of sample l statistics is plotted versus the corresponding empirical regional models proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 although the dataset considered in the present study is not identical to the one analysed in di baldassarre et al 2006 i e emilia romagna only is included here and the considered stations are not the same considered in their study the comparison suggests that the empirical relationships properly reproduce the observed l c v for all the considered durations but 15 min for which the sample moving average though approximately constant is shifted upward see panel b in fig 6 a less coherent behaviour is observed for l c s especially for lower durations based on these considerations to evaluate the influence of changes in cumulative yearly rainfall and ams on the gev map model the capability of the gev map model is assessed in reproducing the a dimensionless and b dimensional at site rainfall distribution observed at the different sites in the period 1990 2015 the agreement between the gev map model and the at site sample distributions i e plotted with the weibull plotting position is assessed by means of the kolmogorov smirnov test the analyses highlight that the gev map model properly reproduces the dimensionless at site sample distributions for the vast majority of stations only few stations show a poor match with the model in terms of dimensionless distribution of rainfall extremes see table 4 concerning the dimensional at site distribution of rainfall extremes table 4 also highlights that the gev map model applied to data observed in the period 1990 2015 is not capable of properly reproducing the dimensional at site distributions for a considerable number of stations stations with this behaviour are mostly located in the same areas where statistically significant changes in ams and map have been detected in the analyses reported in the previous sections see e g panel a in fig 7 for 6 h duration the outcomes of these analyses suggest that 1 the gev map model is capable of properly reproducing the shape of the distribution i e the estimate of the model parameters seems not to be significantly affected by changes in map 2 the mismatch between the gev map model and the observed dimensional distributions for the period 1990 2015 is mainly due to the observed changes in the mean of observed ams these considerations are strengthened by plotting the estimated and observed distributions for the considered stations as an example panels b and c in fig 7 provide the comparison between the distribution computed with the gev map model and the at site sample distributions dimensionless and dimensional respectively for the station of cabanne the shape of the estimated distribution remains the same but the dimensional one is shifted due to the fact that the index storm considered in the model refers to the ams collected in the period 1935 1989 whereas the observed dimensional at site distribution refers to 1990 2015 as a result the predicted return period obtained by applying the gev map model is severely altered the comparison between the rainfall quantile associated with 100 year return period according to the gev map model applied for 1935 1989 and the return period associated with the same quantile obtained by referring to rainfall data observed in 1990 2015 highlights the presence of remarkable differences concerning sub hourly durations for 15 min there is the general tendency to overestimate the return period i e the 100 year rainfall quantile evaluated for 1935 1989 becomes less frequent for 1990 2015 whereas for 30 min rainfall events both overestimation mostly located in the eastern part of the region and underestimation in the western part where significant trends in ams have been detected here for longer durations see section 4 2 are observed this behaviour could be also explained by the short record length for the sub hourly series available for the period 1935 1989 at the same time for sub daily durations i e d 1 3 6 12 24 h an overall overestimation of the return period is observed associated with the presence of an increased frequency of extreme events in the last decades see fig 6 a as an example for 6 h duration 5 discussion the analyses reported in the previous sections highlight the presence of changes in both timing and magnitude of sub daily extreme rainfall events in the last decades concerning seasonality a generalized shift in the mean date of occurrence is observed from 1961 1989 to 1990 2015 for all the considered durations a delay in the mean timing of extreme events from late summer to autumn is observed for durations up to 6 h more evident in the central western part of the apennine within the study region where statistically significant trends are detected in timing and where also regularity tends to increase with increasing altitudes this general tendency confirms the delay observed for the flooding season in the mediterranean areas by blöschl et al 2017 in the last five decades yet the finer resolution of the dataset considered herein enables to highlight a much richer and more complex figure in fact for higher durations i e 12 and 24 h the behaviour is confirmed yet some stations in the apennine area show slightly anticipated mean timing from autumn early winter to early autumn in general for each duration the mean timing presents a slight shift moving from the flatland and floodplains mean timing in summer to the apennine average timing in autumn early winter depending on the duration consistent with the different dynamical characteristics of the underlying atmospheric processes more linked to convective dynamics over the plains and to orographic amplification of large scale dynamics over the mountains moreover for all the considered durations the last decades i e 1990 2015 are characterized by a generalized decrease in regularity at lower elevations i e floodplains and an increase at higher elevations i e mountainous area especially in the central western part of the region the first result seems to suggest that convective processes are becoming more frequent over the plain in the extended winter season from october to march while the second is consistent with the significant changes in the amplitude of intense daily events observed over the northern apennines by other studies antolini et al 2016 pavan et al 2019 i e an increase in autumn and a corresponding decrease in summer and spring the higher sensitivity of the apennine area to changes in sub daily rainfall extremes is observed also in terms of magnitude i e trends and abrupt changes the western part of the region shows a statistically significant increase in the intensity of sub daily extreme events this is particularly clear for the 1961 2015 subset for which the stations located in the area of the ligurian apennines close to the tyrrhenian mountainside present significant positive trends and abrupt changes change point years from 1985 1997 this behaviour is in accordance with the already mentioned significant increase in the amplitude of intense daily precipitation events observed especially in autumn by pavan et al 2019 other significant increasing changes are observed for the apennines in the south eastern part of the region and in the area close to ferrara north eastern part of the study region consistent with the increase in cumulative yearly rainfall depths observed for the same area in the present study see fig 5 a and in other recent studies i e antolini et al 2016 pavan et al 2019 this said no clear spatial pattern is observed for the few decreasing changes detected in the study area which in some cases are actually detected for stations located in areas characterised by nearby increasing significant changes these results further highlight the variability and complexity of processes and seem to confirm what observed in libertino et al 2019 which showed the presence of distinct patterns of change in small domains statistically significant abrupt changes are detected also in the mean of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths over the period 1931 2015 which is characterized by an overall decline of the values consistent with what observed in antolini et al 2016 for 1961 2010 all the above mentioned changes are shown to affect the reliability of the previously proposed regional model developed by di baldassarre et al 2006 herein termed gev map which considers map as a proxy of the geographical location mostly altitude in the study domain and therefore of climate conditions the gev map model applied with data observed in 1935 1989 is shown to be not capable of properly reproducing the dimensional at site sample distribution for the period 1990 2015 this behaviour which is more evident for short durations especially for sub hourly ones i e 15 and 30 min see table 4 appears to be mainly associated with the changes in ams detected for the last decades indeed whereas the shape of the estimated distribution properly represents the dimensionless at site sample in several cases the dimensional gev map curve evaluated over the period 1935 1989 is shifted with respect to the ams collected in 1990 2015 due to the fact that the index storm considered in the model refers to the ams collected in 1935 1989 this results in an overall overestimation of the return period in 1990 2015 see fig 7 for 6 h duration and indicates an increased magnitude of extreme events in the last decades consistent with the increase observed in the mean of ams at the same time the observed generalized decreasing abrupt changes in map seem not to significantly affect the capability of the gev map model to properly reproduce the dimensionless rainfall distribution in this regard the relationships between map and l statistics proposed by di baldassarre et al 2006 for 1935 1989 are mostly confirmed for the period 1990 2015 yet some differences are observed for lower durations especially sub hourly ones i e 15 and 30 min and for l c s in this regard it is worth highlighting here that estimating the parameters of the gev map model as a function of map only makes the model easy to apply but also represents a potential limit of the model itself developing a regional model based on indices which are still easy to measure but have stronger dynamical links with ams could help to improve the model on a physical basis this issue is suggested for future studies the proper understanding of the potential role and relationships among the above mentioned changes in rainfall extremes and recent flooding events occurred in emilia romagna requires additional analyses aimed at quantitatively assessing changes in flood hazard such analyses are suggested for future studies and must consider that the identification of the possible main drivers of the recent increases in flood damage should account for all the components of flood risk i e also vulnerability and exposure which are deeply related to the maintenance of territory and infrastructures as well as to changes in land use due to human activities and population dynamics for instance domeneghetti et al 2015 show for the floodplain system of the po river a stable population since the 1950s and yet a dramatic increase in the exposure to floods in residential settlements which has doubled in the last 7 decades there are therefore strong evidences of changes in vulnerability of the territory whose management is a central topic and cannot be neglected when evaluating changes in flood risk over the study region 6 conclusions the present study analyses a recently compiled regional dataset of sub daily and sub hourly rainfall annual maximum depths collected over the period 1931 2015 in emilia romagna northern italy affected by several destructive flood events in the last years the aim is to assess the presence of significant changes in the frequency regime of rainfall extremes in terms of both seasonality and magnitude in order to guarantee reliability and robustness of the analyses the dataset has been preliminary filtered to select the ams characterized by sufficient record length and statistical homogeneity the sub hourly dataset is regarded as not sufficiently robust for assessing changes concerning seasonality of sub daily rainfall extremes in the period 1961 2015 a generalized delay in the mean timing of extreme events from late summer to autumn is observed during the last decades more pronounced in the central western part of the apennine while an opposite behaviour is locally observed for some stations in the same area for higher durations i e 12 and 24 h moreover for the apennine area a generalized increase is observed in the regularity of extreme events more pronounced with increasing altitudes and for the central western part of the region and mainly associated with the decreased frequency of annual maxima in spring and summer on the other hand regularity decreases in the plain area where annual maxima have become more dispersed throughout the year also statistically significant trends and abrupt changes are detected in terms of magnitude for both the periods 1931 2015 and 1961 2015 with a predominant increase in sub daily rainfall extremes more evident in the area of the ligurian apennines close to the tyrrhenian mountainside of the apennine change point years from 1985 1997 consistent with the statistically significant increase in intense daily rainfall events observed in other studies other significant increasing changes are observed in the south eastern apennine area within the region and the area of ferrara where previous studies i e antolini et al 2016 pavan et al 2019 detected analogous increases also in cumulative yearly rainfall depths few decreasing changes have been detected in the study area without a clear spatial pattern the results confirm the outcomes of libertino et al 2019 in terms of the presence of different patterns of change in small domains together with the statistically significant generalized decrease in the mean of the cumulative yearly rainfall depths observed over the period 1931 2015 consistent with the outcomes of antolini et al 2016 for 1961 2010 the above mentioned changes are shown to affect the reliability of the previously proposed regional model developed by di baldassarre et al 2006 for predicting the design storm in the study area based on mean annual precipitation map as a proxy of the geographical location and on data observed in the period 1935 1989 the regional model is shown to properly reproduce the shape of the at site distribution of ams observed in 1990 2015 yet to fail in representing its dimensional component especially for sub daily durations i e 15 and 30 min resulting in an overall overestimation of the return period in 1990 2015 this behaviour seems to be mainly associated with changes detected in ams which affect the estimation of the index storm whereas changes in map seem not to significantly affect the reliability of the model at the same time an update of the regional model is suggested for future studies accounting also for indices presenting a stronger link with ams and with atmospheric dynamics so as to improve the prediction ability of the model the proper understanding of the effects of the above mentioned changes in rainfall extremes on the recent flooding events occurred in emilia romagna requires future additional quantitative analyses which should consider all the components of flood risk including

8301,study region the amazonas river and its tributaries peru where riparian farmers face hydrological events that put their lowland crops at high risk of production loss during the flood recession period study focus this paper analyzes the hydro meteorological mechanisms over the andes amazon basins that produce repiquetes which are sudden reversals of the river stage they are defined and characterized for the period 1996 2018 by using river stage data from three hydrological gauging stations for the amazonas marañón and ucayali rivers daily rainfall and low level winds depict the large scale atmospheric patterns associated with repiquetes new hydrological insights among 73 significant repiquetes reversal 20 cm observed in the amazonas river 64 were preceded by repiquetes only in the marañón river 5 by repiquetes only in the ucayali river 21 by repiquetes in both rivers and 10 was only registered in the amazonas river without upstream precursor these results show that repiquetes in the marañón river are the primary precursors of repiquetes in the amazonas river most repiquetes are associated with abundant rainfall over the peruvian and ecuadorian andes amazon transition region related to a remarkable change in the direction of the meridional wind from north to south and an easterly flow five to three days before the beginning of a repiquete in the amazonas river keywords repiquetes rainfall circulation patterns recessional agriculture western amazon 1 introduction most of the andean rivers within the amazon basin of peru and ecuador flow into the amazonas river which is formed by the confluence of the ucayali and marañón rivers at tamshiyacu station the first hydrological station in amazonas river fig 1 a a mean discharge of about 32 000 m3 s is estimated espinoza et al 2009a the andean amazon hydrological basin upstream of tamshiyacu station hereafter tamshiyacu basin covers 726 400 km2 downstream the confluence of the ucayali and marañón rivers and near to the city of iquitos riparian communities practice riverine agriculture they take advantage of the falling water level of the flooding cycle to cultivate in the exposed riverbed floodplains and point bars during annual recession hiraoka 1985 rios arevalo 2005 coomes et al 2016 list 2016 list and coomes 2017 ronchail et al 2018 since the soils are enriched by sediment transport from the andes mcclain and naiman 2008 riparian farmers grow crops with a shorter growing season like rice and cowpea on the active channel taking into account the elevation of the river and the date in order to choose reliable seed varieties and they grow plantain maize and manioc on the levees list and coomes 2017 however there are crucial factors that affect crop production such as poor soil early flooding and unpredictable stage reversals or interruptions of the recession limb of the annual hydrograph known as repiquetes list 2016 list and coomes 2017 coomes et al 2016 defined repiquetes as unexpected reversal or inversions in direction sign of water level equal or greater than 1 cm and studied their effect on crop loss on the floodplain communities near the city of iquitos the repiquetes affect farmers livelihoods and are associated with high crop loss due to either crop damage or seeds being washed away and often farmers have nothing more to plant i e they caused a reduction of the household potential outputs list and coomes 2017 later ronchail et al 2018 found evidence of a lengthening of the low water period since the eighties and linked repiquetes events to unusually high rainfall over the tamshiyacu basin during the week leading up to these events in tamshiyacu regarding the high impacts of repiquetes on riverine communities in the peruvian amazon the first objective of this study is to characterize the occurrence of repiquetes over the main tributaries of the amazonas river at tamshiyacu in terms of frequency duration magnitude and timing in addition repiquetes in the ucayali and marañón rivers are analyzed to define precursors of those in the amazonas river due to its meridional extension from the southern tropics to the equator and its complex topography the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon basin is characterized by a striking rainfall contrast the highest values occur towards the equator and on the eastern slopes of the andes especially under windward conditions between 1000 1500 masl while low rainfall values occur in the southern part of the basin and over the mountains generally above 2500 masl killeen et al 2007 espinoza et al 2009b 2015 chavez and takahashi 2017 in addition rainfall variability over this region is modulated by dynamic and thermodynamic atmospheric variability that occurs on a regional and local scale covering a multitude of timescales see section 2 these characteristics make short term flow forecasts challenging in the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin in this context our second objective is to identify rainfall and large scale atmospheric circulation patterns related to the occurrence of repiquetes events these objectives are oriented towards providing information for the mitigation risk of crop loss in the region as well as scientific bases to improve the accuracy of flow forecasts in the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and main climatic features over the western amazon two of the major andean amazonian rivers the ucayali and the marañón rivers flow into the amazonas river 80 km from the city of iquitos peru fig 1a the amazonas river is considered an anabranching river with high migration rates of meanders near its origin kalliola et al 1992 moreover abad et al 2013 classified the ucayali and marañón rivers as a meandering river and an anabranching river respectively the ucayali and the marañón rivers have a mean discharge of 13 500 m3 s and 14 900 m3 s and their basins have an areal extent of about 350 000 km2 and 362 000 km2 respectively espinoza et al 2009a lavado casimiro et al 2013 precipitation over this region is characterized by complex annual cycle regimes espinoza et al 2020 and references therein previous studies have shown a seasonal rainfall distribution over the northwest equatorial amazon region especially over peru ecuador and colombia with a somewhat marked bimodal regime a peak with slightly more rainfall is observed during february may in relation to enhanced convection due to the southward displacement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and another relative peak in october november is associated with westward moisture transport laraque et al 2007 espinoza et al 2009b segura et al 2019 conversely over the central and southern peruvian amazon basin the seasonal cycle of precipitation has a marked dry season may to september and a peak in december to march related to the mature phase of the south american monsoon system sams vera et al 2006 in addition the south american low level jet east of the andes llj enhances moisture transport from the tropical atlantic ocean and the tropical rainforest to the southern amazon and subtropical south america marengo et al 2004 likewise laraque et al 2007 have documented the complex relationship between rainfall regimes and streamflow regimes over the equatorial andes especially over the santiago pastaza and napo basins ecuadorian and peruvian upper amazon sub basin the above described rainfall seasonality over the basin explains the annual cycle of discharge in the ucayali marañón and amazonas rivers at requena san regis and tamshiyacu stations respectively fig 1 there are two seasons defined by their river stage i the high stage with high water levels of the river generally during march april related to the abundant rainfall during the austral summer december to march over the central and southern part of the peruvian amazon espinoza et al 2009a lavado casimiro et al 2013 and ii the low stage with low water levels between september october associated with low rainfall rates during the austral winter especially in the southern region espinoza et al 2011 coomes et al 2016 ronchail et al 2018 in addition it is important to note that the discharge of the marañón river is twice the discharge of the ucayali river from june to october armijos et al 2013 the mean difference between low and high water levels is approximately seven meters at tamshiyacu station ronchail et al 2018 this seasonal variation in water level is already taken into account by the riparian communities which practice riverine agriculture during the falling water season however unpredictable stage reversals during falling water levels are among the main risks that affect riparian farmers and their crops along the peruvian amazon river the day to day rainfall variability over the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin is modulated by a complex interaction between atmospheric circulation and the andean orography involving several dynamic and thermodynamic processes acting from the local to the large scale satyamurty et al 1998 wang and fu 2002 kiladis et al 2009 espinoza et al 2012 paccini et al 2017 mayta et al 2018 recalde coronel et al 2020 wang and fu 2002 described that the cross equatorial flow at low levels is more frequently from the south north when it rains over the equatorial regions southern amazon according to the above mentioned studies the mechanisms responsible for the cross equatorial regimes vary on different timescales on a sub monthly timescale the variability of the cross equatorial regime could be related to easterly waves equatorial waves madden julian oscillation among others on the other hand paccini et al 2017 defined nine large scale atmospheric circulation patterns cps from meridional and zonal winds to identify the main intra seasonal meteorological features over the amazon basin by using hierarchical ascendant classification and self organizing maps subsequently these nine cp s are classified in terms of types of dominant low level circulations over the amazon basin into northerly wind regimes cp2 cp8 and cp9 southerly wind regimes cp4 cp5 and cp6 and intermediate states cp1 cp3 cp7 but each one with different zonal wind characteristics finally the cp4 is the rainiest cp over the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon at tamshiyacu station and opposite conditions are observed during the cp5 such a difference between southerly regimes can be explained by a much greater westerly flow in cp5 related to rainfall over the eastern amazon basin however the relationship between large scale intraseasonal atmospheric circulation patterns and changes in the amazonas river stage has not been documented previously and this work is an attempt to look for proxies to improve streamflow forecasting 2 2 hydro climatic data 2 2 1 river stages and stream velocity daily river stages are analyzed in three hydrological stations requena on the ucayali river san regis on the marañón river and tamshiyacu on the amazonas river located upstream from the city of iquitos fig 1a similarly the downstream distance between san regis and tamshiyacu station is approximately 150 km and between requena and tamshiyacu station 220 km river stages are provided by the environmental observatory so hybam and the national service of meteorology and hydrology of peru senamhi this information is available at http www ore hybam org tamshiyacu and san regis river stages data cover the period 1985 2018 however requena station has a shorter time series from july 1996 to december 2018 stream velocity was computed in each hydrological station using the cross section velocity measured with the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp in the low water season of the 2002 2011 period http www ore hybam org stream velocity is the mean of the number n of field measurements in which the adcp measured at least four transects along a stretch of the river table 1 2 2 2 rainfall data in this study two rainfall datasets have been used i climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station v 2 chirps v 2 funk et al 2015 daily data with 0 05 and 0 25 spatial resolutions covering the 1996 2018 period this dataset is a combination of global rain gauge data containing a large number of observations from brazil colombia peru and others countries and satellite precipitation estimates using a regression method from global daily cold cloud duration values and calibration using the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm product 3b42 v 7 trmm 3b42 v 7 moreover chirps v 2 has been evaluated over this region by previous studies paccini et al 2017 wongchuig correa et al 2017 espinoza et al 2018 recalde coronel et al 2020 this dataset was used for the period 1996 2018 ii trmm 3b42 v 7 quasi global dataset which has a 0 25 spatial resolution has been widely used for hydro meteorological research in the peruvian amazon basin zulkafli et al 2014 zubieta et al 2015 paccini et al 2017 wongchuig correa et al 2017 this dataset was used considering the period 1998 2018 2 2 3 atmospheric circulation data atmospheric circulation was analyzed using both meridional and zonal winds at 850 hpa from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 over the region defined by 45 s 15 n 85 30 w this data set was used for the 1996 2018 period with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the horizontal wind components at 850 hpa have been used in studies related to the atmospheric patterns over the andes amazon basin espinoza et al 2012 paccini et al 2017 santos et al 2015 segura et al 2019 ampuero et al 2020 moreover the structure of the atmosphere in the eastern andes is

classification of repiquetes the study focuses on the annual recession and the low water period generally from may to october espinoza et al 2011 ronchail et al 2018 the repiquetes were calculated individually for each gauging station within each year as follows i the maximum value of daily river stage after may 1st and the minimum value during the low water stage before november 1st are identified to define the annual recession fig 1b the choice of these dates is based on a the mean annual cycle of the river stage at tamshiyacu station and b the impact of the repiquetes on downstream recessional agriculture considering that this period includes the mean planting dates that range from june 11th to june 25th and the growing season 75 150 days of most rice varieties coomes et al 2016 list and coomes 2017 examples of annual recession defined for the year 1997 are between the red lines beginning and final days in figs 1b d and s1 supplementary material ii the river stage on the first day of the repiquete must be higher than on the preceding day day zero d0 i e when there is a positive reversal of the stage in addition the last day of the repiquete is when the river stage returns to the same value or lower than the stage of d0 except the last annual repiquete considering the last repiquete of the year d0 corresponds to the lowest annual river stage and concludes when the river stage stops rising fig s1 note that this study focuses on repiquetes during the annual recession the rising period has not been analyzed after the identification of repiquetes in each river they are characterized according to their magnitude duration and timing ronchail et al 2018 the magnitude in cm corresponds to the maximum value of the reversal throughout the entire duration of the event the duration of the repiquete is the period in days between d0 and the last day defined above fig s1 shows a sketch that defines and illustrates the characteristics of repiquetes subsequently values greater than or equal to 10 cm for the ucayali and marañón rivers and 20 cm for the amazonas river were taken as thresholds for events with potential impacts on farming activities in the amazon plain as well as to look for a relationship with rainfall and circulation anomalies during the preceding days the 20 cm threshold used in the amazonas river has been documented by previous studies based on its impact on crops coomes et al 2016 ronchail et al 2018 a lower value 10 cm has been chosen for the san regis and requena stations in order to reduce failure in detecting events that may cause relevant changes in the water level at tamshiyacu station first the repiquetes of each station were arranged chronologically then to match events that occur upstream with those that occur downstream a delay in days was considered using the minimum stream velocity and the calculated distances between requena or san regis and tamshiyacu table 1 we consider these delays to represent the maximum time of wave propagation for each river hence the repiquetes that are supposed to trigger the beginning of an event at tamshiyacu occur the same day up to three days before in the marañón river and up to six days before in the ucayali river also we used a cross correlation method lee et al 2006 guevara díaz 2014 to compare results with the delay obtained above in the same way using the cross correlation method we obtained one day for the marañón and four days for the ucayali however as this method involves raw time series that includes the high level water period we decided to use a longer period of time between the two methods from zero to three six days prior in the marañón ucayali river this approach allows us to identify types of repiquetes in tamshiyacu as a function of their precursors on the marañón or ucayali rivers thus we identify four types of repiquetes type 1 repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu with a precursor in the marañón river at san regis type 2 repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu with a precursor in the ucayali river at requena type 3 repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu with precursors in both tributaries and type 4 repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu and not detected upstream 2 4 relationship between repiquetes rainfall anomalies and atmospheric circulation using a composite analysis rainfall anomalies from chirps and trmm datasets were generated for each repiquete type the same procedure was applied considering low level 850 hpa horizontal winds from era interim reanalysis data for each repiquete type daily rainfall anomalies and horizontal wind anomalies at 850 hpa were calculated from 10 days before d 10 to the first day after d 1 the repiquete event taking as day zero d0 the beginning day of the event at the tamshiyacu station the anomalies were computed considering monthly climatology the 1997 2017 period for chirps 1998 2017 for trmm and 1997 2017 for era interim datasets only significant anomalies higher than a standard deviation within the study period were analyzed for the annual recession on the other hand we used the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns cps defined by paccini et al 2017 to identify the main meteorological features involved in these events from d 10 to d 1 3 results 3 1 main hydrological features of repiquetes for the period 1985 2018 tamshiyacu gauging station recorded 193 repiquetes fig 2 a the distribution of repiquetes according to their magnitude shows a total of 83 repiquetes lower than 20 cm i e 43 of the total repiquetes in addition the remaining 57 are grouped into larger intervals 110 events are greater than 20 cm 71 greater than 50 cm 36 greater than 1 m and nine greater than 2 m within the common period analyzed for the three rivers and considering as significant only those repiquetes that exceed the thresholds of 20 cm in tamshiyacu and 10 cm in san regis and requena stations only 73 117 and 85 repiquetes are found in tamshiyacu san regis and requena stations respectively figs 2b d and circles in fig 3 a among these 73 events for tamshiyacu only seven repiquetes 10 occur without any previous upstream event type 4 repiquetes shown in black in figs 2b and 3b meanwhile 66 repiquetes 90 greater than 20 cm were previously observed upstream of which 64 are type 1 repiquetes with a precursor in the marañón river 5 type 2 repiquetes with a precursor in the ucayali river and 21 type 3 repiquetes with precursors in both tributaries the other colors in fig 2b characterize repiquete events in tamshiyacu greater than 20 cm and are chosen to compare the differences in magnitude between these events and relate them to the magnitude of events observed upstream in san regis or requena station figs 2c and d that means that a given color links upstream events with downstream events 15 repiquetes detected in both marañón and ucayali rivers impact tamshiyacu station in preceding days type 3 repiquetes intersection between three circles in fig 3a the main differences in figs 2b and c for this period in contrast with the 1985 1995 period are a higher occurrence of repiquetes with magnitudes higher than 100 cm 0 5 times more in amazonas river and more than double in marañón river and a higher occurrence of repiquetes only observed in a specific station tamshiyacu or san regis in the san regis gauging station 62 out of 117 repiquetes impact tamshiyacu intersection between the dark gray and gray circles in fig 3a where there are 47 type 1 repiquetes which happen first in san regis and some days later in the amazonas river at tamshiyacu no events between 10 and 20 cm in san regis are affecting tamshiyacu first column in fig 2c moreover by analyzing blue and green tones in figs 2b and c it appears that most events greater than 1 m and 1 75 m registered in san regis will systematically cause events that exceed 20 cm and 1 m in tamshiyacu respectively same colors for the related events in figs 2b and c regarding the repiquetes in requena 19 out of 85 events greater than 10 cm see colored events in fig 2d or intersection between dark gray and light gray circles in fig 3a are identified as precursors to the repiquetes in tamshiyacu of which four are type 2 repiquetes the distribution is very similar to that of the other stations figs 3a and b summarize information about the precursor of repiquetes in tamshiyacu station the 47 type 1 repiquetes events observed in tamshiyacu and san regis and the 15 type 3 repiquetes events found in tamshiyacu san regis and requena are studied in more detail in the following sections in summary the main precursor of observed repiquetes greater than 20 cm in tamshiyacu in the amazonas river is the marañón river and there is typically a day of delay fig 3c between the events registered in san regis and tamshiyacu gauging stations on the other hand repiquetes in the ucayali river do not show a clear delay with respect to events in tamshiyacu fig 3c table 2 shows that for type 1 repiquetes the precursor events in the marañón river are greater than repiquetes in amazonas river by almost 60 cm with a duration of 14 and 12 days respectively similar results are found in the four type 2 repiquetes for type 3 repiquetes there are notable differences between the marañón and ucayali rivers with a higher magnitude in the case of the former the median duration at tamshiyacu is the longest reaching 13 vs 9 days in upstream stations the type 4 repiquetes only observed in tamshiyacu station have an average close to one meter but their duration of eight days is the shortest among the four repiquete types figs 4 a and b show the monthly variation of the characteristics for types 1 2 and 3 repiquetes types 1 and 2 are associated with higher magnitudes in september and october with the first quartile above 50 cm types 1 and 3 display high duration values in june including outliers but values higher than 60 days only begin in july resulting from a combination of both tributaries t3 finally repiquetes in tamshiyacu higher than 20 cm are more frequent from the second fortnight of june until the second fortnight of september fig 4c at the tamshiyacu station there is an average of 3 2 repiquetes per year higher than 20 cm the occurrence of repiquetes higher than 10 cm in the marañón river is prevalent when compared to the ucayali river during the critical phases of crops from june 15th to september 31st with an average of 5 1 vs 3 7 repiquetes per year however in the ucayali river the occurrence of repiquetes is variable with less events from july to september regarding the amazonas river the repiquetes are more frequent between august and september 3 2 rainfall and atmospheric circulation anomalies related to repiquetes the 15 events categorized as type 3 events in tamshiyacu that are observed previously in san regis and requena show northeasterly low level winds in the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon during d 10 and d 9 with negative rainfall anomalies over the marañón basin and no significant rainfall anomalies over the ucayali basin fig 5 from d 8 to d 6 northerly cross equatorial low level winds are intensified and easterly wind anomalies are strengthened over the colombian and ecuadorian amazon region unlike d 9 these wind anomalies are associated with positive rainfall anomalies over the ecuadorian amazon andes transition region above 500 masl during d 8 in the following days d 7 and d 6 the low level circulation is similar to that of d 8 but there are low rainfall anomalies from d 5 to d 3 a change in low level wind anomalies can be observed characterized by a strong convergence of northerly wind anomalies with southern wind incursion resulting from anticyclonic anomalous circulation over argentina near 30 s and 67 w at low level fig 6 these atmospheric features are characteristic of southerly wind incursions to the east of the andes which promote positive rainfall anomalies from the bolivian amazon and produce cold surges penetration into the amazon basin garreaud and wallace 1998 espinoza et al 2012 2013 paccini et al 2017 during these days high positive rainfall anomalies are observed in the andes amazon transition region between peru and ecuador figs 5 and 6 abundant rainfall is probably due to interactions between local convective processes over the equatorial andean topography and to large scale wind convergence between southeasterly and northeasterly wind anomalies over this region particularly clear in d 5 and d 4 fig 6 according to these features during d 3 a predominance of easterly and southeasterly wind anomalies over the northern equatorial amazon is associated with positive rainfall anomalies over the northern marañón basin in the northern amazon basin fig 6 in addition enhanced southerly wind anomalies over the bolivian amazon are associated with positive rainfall anomalies moving northward to the central and southern peruvian amazon in the central ucayali basin on d 3 southerly wind anomalies reach the northern peruvian amazon while positive rainfall anomalies decrease over the lower ucayali basin and most of the marañón basin during d 2 and d 1 there are southeasterly wind anomalies over the peruvian and western brazilian amazon and low positive rainfall anomalies over the central ucayali d 2 and marañón d 1 basins finally d0 and d 1 are characterized by a weakening of the southerly wind anomalies while westerly wind anomalies prevail over the northern region this feature being opposite to the pattern observed during rainy days these atmospheric patterns reduce the convective activity over the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon which reduces rainfall over the northern marañón basin and dries up the ucayali basin similar rainfall patterns are observed by performing the same analysis with the trmm dataset fig s2 for instance the days with more intense positive rainfall anomalies over the two basins are d 5 d 4 and d 3 however using the trmm dataset the positive rainfall anomalies in the northern region between peru and ecuador are slightly lower probably due to the lower spatial resolution of trmm the 47 events categorized as type 1 events in tamshiyacu that are observed previously only in san regis show similar atmospheric patterns to those for events categorized as type 3 with some relevant differences described below figs 7 and 8 days d 10 to d 7 are characterized by weak northwesterly wind anomalies over the peruvian amazon and westerly wind anomalies near the equator these anomalies are related to dry conditions in d 10 d 9 d 8 and d 7 fig 7 during d 6 and d 5 over the northern marañón basin there is a change in wind direction from north to the northeast that is associated with the high positive rainfall anomalies in d 5 over the ecuadorian andes amazon transition region the following days d 4 and d 3 are characterized by southeasterly wind anomalies over the peruvian amazon plain but weaker rainfall anomalies in contrast to type 3 repiquetes for which the change from northeasterly to southeasterly winds occurs earlier in addition easterly wind anomalies are also observed over the northern region associated with positive rainfall anomalies over the northwestern amazon basin figs 7 and 8 finally from d 2 to d 1 wind anomalies over most of the tamshiyacu basin are not significant resulting in no significant rainfall anomaly fig 7 similar rainfall patterns to those described in fig 7 are observed by performing the same analysis with the trmm dataset fig s3 but similar to type 1 repiquetes analysis rainfall anomalies are lower in the trmm dataset in comparison to chirps as expected the main difference regarding type 3 repiquetes is that rainfall is mostly observed in the north marañón basin there is no northeasterly wind anomaly and no convergence with the southeastern advection over the ucayali only weak rainfall anomalies carried by the incursion over this middle basin as consequence no repiquetes are reported in the ucayali river these atmospheric patterns are coherent with the role of the marañón river instead of the ucayali river as the precursor of the repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu furthermore a longitudinal cross section of type 1 repiquetes from 1000 hpa to 200 hpa at 3 25 s northern marañón basin is shown in fig 9 values of specific humidity greater than 16 g kg under 925 hpa can be seen from d 8 to d 4 d 6 up to d 4 are characterized by large equivalent potential temperature ept values between 78 w 73 w with a smooth decrease in height from the surface to medium levels this condition is associated with an increase in the velocity of vertical winds from d 5 to d 3 in the eastern andes these features suggest atmospheric instability related to enhanced specific humidity low level wind convergence forced by the andes and wind ascendance over the northern marañón basin during d 5 to d 3 consistent with precipitation patterns observed over this region in fig 7 table 3 and table s1 supplementary material relate each repiquete type to large scale atmospheric circulation patterns cps previously defined by paccini et al 2017 which synthesize the nine main modes of winds variability on an intra seasonal timescale in this way the percentages of days of these cp s occurrence was calculated for each day for each repiquete type first for type 3 repiquetes within the 1997 2014 period 11 out of 15 events in d 10 and d 9 cp8 is prevailing 36 36 of the days apart from other cps characterized by the northerly wind regime see table 3 in the following days there is a predominance of cp2 between 45 45 and 63 64 that changes to cp4 in d 2 36 36 apart from other cps with southerly wind regimes like cp5 and cp6 therefore a change from a northerly to a southerly wind regime is evident especially from 5 to 3 days before to the beginning of the repiquete in tamshiyacu however the easterly flow over the northwest is weak during these cps and that could explain why the percentages of days of the occurrence are distributed among other cps 4 discussion for the first time our results show the respective influences of the marañón and ucayali rivers on repiquetes in the amazonas river in terms of magnitude figs 2b d and the annual number of repiquetes higher than 10 cm in the marañón and ucayali rivers fig 4c in addition the influences of upstream rivers on repiquetes in the amazonas river in terms of frequency magnitude timing and duration are also documented in figs 3 and 4 most of our results regarding frequency magnitude and duration of repiquetes in the peruvian amazonas river are in accordance with previous studies including the average of 3 2 repiquetes per year higher than 20 cm coomes et al 2016 ronchail et al 2018 however in this study we use a different definition of the recession period based on the annual maximum and minimum water levels see section 2 and consider a longer period 4 more years than the studies mentioned regarding the delay between the repiquetes in tamshiyacu and those in its tributaries a greater lag can be seen in requena ucayali river as precursor than san regis marañón river as precursor up to six days compared to four days these results and the major influence of the marañón river on the repiquetes in the amazonas river during june october are related to the higher discharge of the marañón river almost twice the discharge of the ucayali river due to the presence of rainfall in the northern amazon from june to september they also are related to the vast floodplains that characterize the ucayali river and the numerous oxbow lakes around its main channel to which excess water flows before reaching the amazonas river abizaid 2005 coomes et al 2009 abad et al 2013 armijos et al 2013 despite the rapid transfer of water from tributaries to the main stream this lag between stations could be used to warn downstream farmers not to use valuable seeds and not waste their time and money however to develop a reliable hydrological information service for farmers the magnitude and duration of repiquetes in the seeding period june july would need to be considered and also their possible negative impacts on the early growing season on the other hand higher magnitudes observed in type 2 repiquetes in september and october are related to increased discharges from the ucayali river at the beginning of the hydrological year caused by the onset of the sams from mid august to early december arias et al 2015 changes from northerly to southerly anomalies in low level winds are related to precipitation 3 5 days before the occurrence of repiquetes previous studies have documented that southeastern flux and intense precipitation over the north western amazon are related to anomalous anticyclonic circulations in eastern bolivia the eastward displacement of extra tropical systems and equatorial circulations wang and fu 2002 santos et al 2015 paccini et al 2017 besides in some cases these fluxes could be related to cold surges with high surface pressures espinoza et al 2013 however our study provides new information regarding the main atmospheric processes associated with repiquetes in the peruvian ecuadorian amazon in particular positive rainfall anomalies over the northern marañón basin are a common feature observed days before the start of the repiquete enhanced convective activity over the northern marañón basin is related to southerly wind incursions and an intensification of easterly low level winds which transport moisture from the central amazon to the western amazon basin thus low level wind convergence forced by the andean topography are observed over the northern marañón basin from five to three days before the start of the repiquete in tamshiyacu fig 9 previous studies found a strong relationship between wind circulation and rainfall patterns on a monthly and intraseasonal scale in the upper amazon basin e g paccini et al 2017 mayta et al 2018 however wind circulation is better represented in atmospheric models than precipitation particularly over the andes minvielle and garreaud 2011 therefore the use of wind circulation would be useful to predict repiquetes events furthermore our results are fundamental to the development of measures to help farmers cope with flood reversals the forecast of repiquetes generally occurs too late so they inevitably flood newly seeded fields choke the young plants with sediment and shorten the growing season which is a significant impediment to the development of the agricultural potential of the lowlands in western amazonia however the beginning of the seeding period june july is crucial when prediction could be useful for avoiding unproductive seeding so it will be necessary to improve atmospheric and hydrological forecasts focusing on prevention during the beginning of the crop period before farmers plant theirs seeds forecasting repiquetes in june and july for this purpose we encourage future research with this approach combined with the implementation of regional scales 1d 2d hydrological models wongchuig correa et al 2017 another alternative to improve the accuracy of short term streamflow forecasting hybrid models which have recently been developed pramanik et al 2011 santos et al 2014 vergara and lavado 2016 is the use of data about atmospheric patterns as input to improve these models as they are less uncertain than precipitation a limitation in this study is the lack of additional time series of water level data which could be solved by combining remote sensing techniques and the use of virtual stations based on altimetry satellites and synthetic aperture radar sar applications which can measure the extent of floods and changes in water level e g wdowinski et al 2008 ovando et al 2016 häfliger et al 2019 nevertheless it is necessary to consider that this work does not analyze factors like fluvial morpho dynamics and groundwater anomalies that could affect repiquete events moreover some projections based on the western amazon indicated a future increase in the frequency of wet years and increased mean and maximum discharges along the peruvian floodplain guimberteau et al 2013 langerwisch et al 2013 sorribas et al 2016 zulkafli et al 2016 these changes could affect the frequency seasonality duration and magnitude of repiquetes as well 5 conclusions this work investigates the frequency magnitude and timing of river stage recessional reversals known as repiquetes along the peruvian amazon river and its two formative tributaries the ucayali and marañón rivers water level data is used to understand the influence of upstream tributaries as precursors of repiquetes in the amazonas river and to classify the occurrence of reversals higher than 20 cm in the amazonas and higher than 10 cm in the tributaries into types according to their origin as a result type 1 repiquetes repiquetes in the amazonas river with a precursor in the marañón river are the most frequent 64 of the total significant repiquetes in the amazonas river while repiquetes in the amazonas river with a precursor in the ucayali river type 2 are much less frequent 5 thus the study shows that repiquetes in the marañón river are the primary precursors of repiquetes in the amazonas river this is consistent with the fact that rains can occur during the winter months in the marañón basin which is much rarer in the ucayali basin moreover precursors in the marañón river greater than 1 m will systematically cause repiquetes higher than 20 cm in the amazonas river on average repiquetes in the marañón river occur one day before those observed in the amazonas river and most last around 12 days however the ucayali river has an increasing influence on the frequency and magnitude of repiquetes in september and october due to the beginning of the hydrological year in the southern tropical amazon basin this study identifies rainfall and large scale atmospheric circulation patterns related to the occurrence of repiquetes events it focuses on hydro meteorological conditions related to type 1 and type 3 repiquetes repiquetes in the amazonas river with a precursor in both tributaries and rainfall anomalies which were analyzed from ten days before d 10 to the beginning day of repiquetes d0 in tamshiyacu station amazonas river we found that the peruvian and ecuadorian andes amazon transition region in the northern marañón basin is a key region that presents positive rainfall anomalies from five to three days before the repiquete d 5 to d 3 the positive rainfall anomalies are associated with changes in low level circulations patterns in the days leading up to the repiquete in general there is a progressive intensification of the northerly flow from d 10 to d 7 over the equatorial region followed by a clear low level northerly to southerly winds change between d 5 and d 3 supported by an easterly flow during these days convergence forced by the presence of the andes is observed in the northern marañón basin which enhanced convective activity over this region repiquetes with precursors in both rivers type 3 are characterized by a strong convergence between intense northeasterly winds and southerly winds over the northern and central tamshiyacu basin from d 5 to d 3 however in type 1 repiquetes northeasterly winds are weaker than in type 3 and wind convergence is predominant only in the northern marañón basin this study shows the origin of repiquetes upstream of tamshiyacu station and their connection with atmospheric patterns these results encourage further analysis regarding other factors like fluvial morpho dynamics and groundwater anomalies that could affect repiquete events in order to improve the forecast of such events which principally have an atmospheric origin while the lack of gauge data remains a major limitation new information mainly based on remotely sensed observations will supply water surface elevations covering more river sections with better spatial and temporal resolution in addition to this the major application of our results is to give alternatives to improve the accuracy of short term streamflow forecasting during the annual recession using atmospheric patterns that could be inputted to hybrid models for recently developed short term streamflow forecasting these results are fundamental to the development of measures to help farmers deal with repiquetes and they can be added to the efforts to obtain a secure flood index or hydrological services for farmers focusing on the periods before and during planting considering the fragility of seeds and young plants credit authorship

8301,study region the amazonas river and its tributaries peru where riparian farmers face hydrological events that put their lowland crops at high risk of production loss during the flood recession period study focus this paper analyzes the hydro meteorological mechanisms over the andes amazon basins that produce repiquetes which are sudden reversals of the river stage they are defined and characterized for the period 1996 2018 by using river stage data from three hydrological gauging stations for the amazonas marañón and ucayali rivers daily rainfall and low level winds depict the large scale atmospheric patterns associated with repiquetes new hydrological insights among 73 significant repiquetes reversal 20 cm observed in the amazonas river 64 were preceded by repiquetes only in the marañón river 5 by repiquetes only in the ucayali river 21 by repiquetes in both rivers and 10 was only registered in the amazonas river without upstream precursor these results show that repiquetes in the marañón river are the primary precursors of repiquetes in the amazonas river most repiquetes are associated with abundant rainfall over the peruvian and ecuadorian andes amazon transition region related to a remarkable change in the direction of the meridional wind from north to south and an easterly flow five to three days before the beginning of a repiquete in the amazonas river keywords repiquetes rainfall circulation patterns recessional agriculture western amazon 1 introduction most of the andean rivers within the amazon basin of peru and ecuador flow into the amazonas river which is formed by the confluence of the ucayali and marañón rivers at tamshiyacu station the first hydrological station in amazonas river fig 1 a a mean discharge of about 32 000 m3 s is estimated espinoza et al 2009a the andean amazon hydrological basin upstream of tamshiyacu station hereafter tamshiyacu basin covers 726 400 km2 downstream the confluence of the ucayali and marañón rivers and near to the city of iquitos riparian communities practice riverine agriculture they take advantage of the falling water level of the flooding cycle to cultivate in the exposed riverbed floodplains and point bars during annual recession hiraoka 1985 rios arevalo 2005 coomes et al 2016 list 2016 list and coomes 2017 ronchail et al 2018 since the soils are enriched by sediment transport from the andes mcclain and naiman 2008 riparian farmers grow crops with a shorter growing season like rice and cowpea on the active channel taking into account the elevation of the river and the date in order to choose reliable seed varieties and they grow plantain maize and manioc on the levees list and coomes 2017 however there are crucial factors that affect crop production such as poor soil early flooding and unpredictable stage reversals or interruptions of the recession limb of the annual hydrograph known as repiquetes list 2016 list and coomes 2017 coomes et al 2016 defined repiquetes as unexpected reversal or inversions in direction sign of water level equal or greater than 1 cm and studied their effect on crop loss on the floodplain communities near the city of iquitos the repiquetes affect farmers livelihoods and are associated with high crop loss due to either crop damage or seeds being washed away and often farmers have nothing more to plant i e they caused a reduction of the household potential outputs list and coomes 2017 later ronchail et al 2018 found evidence of a lengthening of the low water period since the eighties and linked repiquetes events to unusually high rainfall over the tamshiyacu basin during the week leading up to these events in tamshiyacu regarding the high impacts of repiquetes on riverine communities in the peruvian amazon the first objective of this study is to characterize the occurrence of repiquetes over the main tributaries of the amazonas river at tamshiyacu in terms of frequency duration magnitude and timing in addition repiquetes in the ucayali and marañón rivers are analyzed to define precursors of those in the amazonas river due to its meridional extension from the southern tropics to the equator and its complex topography the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon basin is characterized by a striking rainfall contrast the highest values occur towards the equator and on the eastern slopes of the andes especially under windward conditions between 1000 1500 masl while low rainfall values occur in the southern part of the basin and over the mountains generally above 2500 masl killeen et al 2007 espinoza et al 2009b 2015 chavez and takahashi 2017 in addition rainfall variability over this region is modulated by dynamic and thermodynamic atmospheric variability that occurs on a regional and local scale covering a multitude of timescales see section 2 these characteristics make short term flow forecasts challenging in the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin in this context our second objective is to identify rainfall and large scale atmospheric circulation patterns related to the occurrence of repiquetes events these objectives are oriented towards providing information for the mitigation risk of crop loss in the region as well as scientific bases to improve the accuracy of flow forecasts in the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin 2 data and methods 2 1 study area and main climatic features over the western amazon two of the major andean amazonian rivers the ucayali and the marañón rivers flow into the amazonas river 80 km from the city of iquitos peru fig 1a the amazonas river is considered an anabranching river with high migration rates of meanders near its origin kalliola et al 1992 moreover abad et al 2013 classified the ucayali and marañón rivers as a meandering river and an anabranching river respectively the ucayali and the marañón rivers have a mean discharge of 13 500 m3 s and 14 900 m3 s and their basins have an areal extent of about 350 000 km2 and 362 000 km2 respectively espinoza et al 2009a lavado casimiro et al 2013 precipitation over this region is characterized by complex annual cycle regimes espinoza et al 2020 and references therein previous studies have shown a seasonal rainfall distribution over the northwest equatorial amazon region especially over peru ecuador and colombia with a somewhat marked bimodal regime a peak with slightly more rainfall is observed during february may in relation to enhanced convection due to the southward displacement of the intertropical convergence zone itcz and another relative peak in october november is associated with westward moisture transport laraque et al 2007 espinoza et al 2009b segura et al 2019 conversely over the central and southern peruvian amazon basin the seasonal cycle of precipitation has a marked dry season may to september and a peak in december to march related to the mature phase of the south american monsoon system sams vera et al 2006 in addition the south american low level jet east of the andes llj enhances moisture transport from the tropical atlantic ocean and the tropical rainforest to the southern amazon and subtropical south america marengo et al 2004 likewise laraque et al 2007 have documented the complex relationship between rainfall regimes and streamflow regimes over the equatorial andes especially over the santiago pastaza and napo basins ecuadorian and peruvian upper amazon sub basin the above described rainfall seasonality over the basin explains the annual cycle of discharge in the ucayali marañón and amazonas rivers at requena san regis and tamshiyacu stations respectively fig 1 there are two seasons defined by their river stage i the high stage with high water levels of the river generally during march april related to the abundant rainfall during the austral summer december to march over the central and southern part of the peruvian amazon espinoza et al 2009a lavado casimiro et al 2013 and ii the low stage with low water levels between september october associated with low rainfall rates during the austral winter especially in the southern region espinoza et al 2011 coomes et al 2016 ronchail et al 2018 in addition it is important to note that the discharge of the marañón river is twice the discharge of the ucayali river from june to october armijos et al 2013 the mean difference between low and high water levels is approximately seven meters at tamshiyacu station ronchail et al 2018 this seasonal variation in water level is already taken into account by the riparian communities which practice riverine agriculture during the falling water season however unpredictable stage reversals during falling water levels are among the main risks that affect riparian farmers and their crops along the peruvian amazon river the day to day rainfall variability over the peruvian ecuadorian amazon basin is modulated by a complex interaction between atmospheric circulation and the andean orography involving several dynamic and thermodynamic processes acting from the local to the large scale satyamurty et al 1998 wang and fu 2002 kiladis et al 2009 espinoza et al 2012 paccini et al 2017 mayta et al 2018 recalde coronel et al 2020 wang and fu 2002 described that the cross equatorial flow at low levels is more frequently from the south north when it rains over the equatorial regions southern amazon according to the above mentioned studies the mechanisms responsible for the cross equatorial regimes vary on different timescales on a sub monthly timescale the variability of the cross equatorial regime could be related to easterly waves equatorial waves madden julian oscillation among others on the other hand paccini et al 2017 defined nine large scale atmospheric circulation patterns cps from meridional and zonal winds to identify the main intra seasonal meteorological features over the amazon basin by using hierarchical ascendant classification and self organizing maps subsequently these nine cp s are classified in terms of types of dominant low level circulations over the amazon basin into northerly wind regimes cp2 cp8 and cp9 southerly wind regimes cp4 cp5 and cp6 and intermediate states cp1 cp3 cp7 but each one with different zonal wind characteristics finally the cp4 is the rainiest cp over the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon at tamshiyacu station and opposite conditions are observed during the cp5 such a difference between southerly regimes can be explained by a much greater westerly flow in cp5 related to rainfall over the eastern amazon basin however the relationship between large scale intraseasonal atmospheric circulation patterns and changes in the amazonas river stage has not been documented previously and this work is an attempt to look for proxies to improve streamflow forecasting 2 2 hydro climatic data 2 2 1 river stages and stream velocity daily river stages are analyzed in three hydrological stations requena on the ucayali river san regis on the marañón river and tamshiyacu on the amazonas river located upstream from the city of iquitos fig 1a similarly the downstream distance between san regis and tamshiyacu station is approximately 150 km and between requena and tamshiyacu station 220 km river stages are provided by the environmental observatory so hybam and the national service of meteorology and hydrology of peru senamhi this information is available at http www ore hybam org tamshiyacu and san regis river stages data cover the period 1985 2018 however requena station has a shorter time series from july 1996 to december 2018 stream velocity was computed in each hydrological station using the cross section velocity measured with the acoustic doppler current profiler adcp in the low water season of the 2002 2011 period http www ore hybam org stream velocity is the mean of the number n of field measurements in which the adcp measured at least four transects along a stretch of the river table 1 2 2 2 rainfall data in this study two rainfall datasets have been used i climate hazards group infrared precipitation with station v 2 chirps v 2 funk et al 2015 daily data with 0 05 and 0 25 spatial resolutions covering the 1996 2018 period this dataset is a combination of global rain gauge data containing a large number of observations from brazil colombia peru and others countries and satellite precipitation estimates using a regression method from global daily cold cloud duration values and calibration using the tropical rainfall measurement mission trmm product 3b42 v 7 trmm 3b42 v 7 moreover chirps v 2 has been evaluated over this region by previous studies paccini et al 2017 wongchuig correa et al 2017 espinoza et al 2018 recalde coronel et al 2020 this dataset was used for the period 1996 2018 ii trmm 3b42 v 7 quasi global dataset which has a 0 25 spatial resolution has been widely used for hydro meteorological research in the peruvian amazon basin zulkafli et al 2014 zubieta et al 2015 paccini et al 2017 wongchuig correa et al 2017 this dataset was used considering the period 1998 2018 2 2 3 atmospheric circulation data atmospheric circulation was analyzed using both meridional and zonal winds at 850 hpa from the european centre for medium range weather forecasts reanalysis era interim dee et al 2011 over the region defined by 45 s 15 n 85 30 w this data set was used for the 1996 2018 period with a spatial resolution of 0 25 0 25 the horizontal wind components at 850 hpa have been used in studies related to the atmospheric patterns over the andes amazon basin espinoza et al 2012 paccini et al 2017 santos et al 2015 segura et al 2019 ampuero et al 2020 moreover the structure of the atmosphere in the eastern andes is described using era interim 0 25 temperature specific humidity relative humidity vertical velocity and horizontal winds at 1000 950 925 850 700 600 500 300 and 200 hpa 2 3 definition and classification of repiquetes the study focuses on the annual recession and the low water period generally from may to october espinoza et al 2011 ronchail et al 2018 the repiquetes were calculated individually for each gauging station within each year as follows i the maximum value of daily river stage after may 1st and the minimum value during the low water stage before november 1st are identified to define the annual recession fig 1b the choice of these dates is based on a the mean annual cycle of the river stage at tamshiyacu station and b the impact of the repiquetes on downstream recessional agriculture considering that this period includes the mean planting dates that range from june 11th to june 25th and the growing season 75 150 days of most rice varieties coomes et al 2016 list and coomes 2017 examples of annual recession defined for the year 1997 are between the red lines beginning and final days in figs 1b d and s1 supplementary material ii the river stage on the first day of the repiquete must be higher than on the preceding day day zero d0 i e when there is a positive reversal of the stage in addition the last day of the repiquete is when the river stage returns to the same value or lower than the stage of d0 except the last annual repiquete considering the last repiquete of the year d0 corresponds to the lowest annual river stage and concludes when the river stage stops rising fig s1 note that this study focuses on repiquetes during the annual recession the rising period has not been analyzed after the identification of repiquetes in each river they are characterized according to their magnitude duration and timing ronchail et al 2018 the magnitude in cm corresponds to the maximum value of the reversal throughout the entire duration of the event the duration of the repiquete is the period in days between d0 and the last day defined above fig s1 shows a sketch that defines and illustrates the characteristics of repiquetes subsequently values greater than or equal to 10 cm for the ucayali and marañón rivers and 20 cm for the amazonas river were taken as thresholds for events with potential impacts on farming activities in the amazon plain as well as to look for a relationship with rainfall and circulation anomalies during the preceding days the 20 cm threshold used in the amazonas river has been documented by previous studies based on its impact on crops coomes et al 2016 ronchail et al 2018 a lower value 10 cm has been chosen for the san regis and requena stations in order to reduce failure in detecting events that may cause relevant changes in the water level at tamshiyacu station first the repiquetes of each station were arranged chronologically then to match events that occur upstream with those that occur downstream a delay in days was considered using the minimum stream velocity and the calculated distances between requena or san regis and tamshiyacu table 1 we consider these delays to represent the maximum time of wave propagation for each river hence the repiquetes that are supposed to trigger the beginning of an event at tamshiyacu occur the same day up to three days before in the marañón river and up to six days before in the ucayali river also we used a cross correlation method lee et al 2006 guevara díaz 2014 to compare results with the delay obtained above in the same way using the cross correlation method we obtained one day for the marañón and four days for the ucayali however as this method involves raw time series that includes the high level water period we decided to use a longer period of time between the two methods from zero to three six days prior in the marañón ucayali river this approach allows us to identify types of repiquetes in tamshiyacu as a function of their precursors on the marañón or ucayali rivers thus we identify four types of repiquetes type 1 repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu with a precursor in the marañón river at san regis type 2 repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu with a precursor in the ucayali river at requena type 3 repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu with precursors in both tributaries and type 4 repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu and not detected upstream 2 4 relationship between repiquetes rainfall anomalies and atmospheric circulation using a composite analysis rainfall anomalies from chirps and trmm datasets were generated for each repiquete type the same procedure was applied considering low level 850 hpa horizontal winds from era interim reanalysis data for each repiquete type daily rainfall anomalies and horizontal wind anomalies at 850 hpa were calculated from 10 days before d 10 to the first day after d 1 the repiquete event taking as day zero d0 the beginning day of the event at the tamshiyacu station the anomalies were computed considering monthly climatology the 1997 2017 period for chirps 1998 2017 for trmm and 1997 2017 for era interim datasets only significant anomalies higher than a standard deviation within the study period were analyzed for the annual recession on the other hand we used the large scale atmospheric circulation patterns cps defined by paccini et al 2017 to identify the main meteorological features involved in these events from d 10 to d 1 3 results 3 1 main hydrological features of repiquetes for the period 1985 2018 tamshiyacu gauging station recorded 193 repiquetes fig 2 a the distribution of repiquetes according to their magnitude shows a total of 83 repiquetes lower than 20 cm i e 43 of the total repiquetes in addition the remaining 57 are grouped into larger intervals 110 events are greater than 20 cm 71 greater than 50 cm 36 greater than 1 m and nine greater than 2 m within the common period analyzed for the three rivers and considering as significant only those repiquetes that exceed the thresholds of 20 cm in tamshiyacu and 10 cm in san regis and requena stations only 73 117 and 85 repiquetes are found in tamshiyacu san regis and requena stations respectively figs 2b d and circles in fig 3 a among these 73 events for tamshiyacu only seven repiquetes 10 occur without any previous upstream event type 4 repiquetes shown in black in figs 2b and 3b meanwhile 66 repiquetes 90 greater than 20 cm were previously observed upstream of which 64 are type 1 repiquetes with a precursor in the marañón river 5 type 2 repiquetes with a precursor in the ucayali river and 21 type 3 repiquetes with precursors in both tributaries the other colors in fig 2b characterize repiquete events in tamshiyacu greater than 20 cm and are chosen to compare the differences in magnitude between these events and relate them to the magnitude of events observed upstream in san regis or requena station figs 2c and d that means that a given color links upstream events with downstream events 15 repiquetes detected in both marañón and ucayali rivers impact tamshiyacu station in preceding days type 3 repiquetes intersection between three circles in fig 3a the main differences in figs 2b and c for this period in contrast with the 1985 1995 period are a higher occurrence of repiquetes with magnitudes higher than 100 cm 0 5 times more in amazonas river and more than double in marañón river and a higher occurrence of repiquetes only observed in a specific station tamshiyacu or san regis in the san regis gauging station 62 out of 117 repiquetes impact tamshiyacu intersection between the dark gray and gray circles in fig 3a where there are 47 type 1 repiquetes which happen first in san regis and some days later in the amazonas river at tamshiyacu no events between 10 and 20 cm in san regis are affecting tamshiyacu first column in fig 2c moreover by analyzing blue and green tones in figs 2b and c it appears that most events greater than 1 m and 1 75 m registered in san regis will systematically cause events that exceed 20 cm and 1 m in tamshiyacu respectively same colors for the related events in figs 2b and c regarding the repiquetes in requena 19 out of 85 events greater than 10 cm see colored events in fig 2d or intersection between dark gray and light gray circles in fig 3a are identified as precursors to the repiquetes in tamshiyacu of which four are type 2 repiquetes the distribution is very similar to that of the other stations figs 3a and b summarize information about the precursor of repiquetes in tamshiyacu station the 47 type 1 repiquetes events observed in tamshiyacu and san regis and the 15 type 3 repiquetes events found in tamshiyacu san regis and requena are studied in more detail in the following sections in summary the main precursor of observed repiquetes greater than 20 cm in tamshiyacu in the amazonas river is the marañón river and there is typically a day of delay fig 3c between the events registered in san regis and tamshiyacu gauging stations on the other hand repiquetes in the ucayali river do not show a clear delay with respect to events in tamshiyacu fig 3c table 2 shows that for type 1 repiquetes the precursor events in the marañón river are greater than repiquetes in amazonas river by almost 60 cm with a duration of 14 and 12 days respectively similar results are found in the four type 2 repiquetes for type 3 repiquetes there are notable differences between the marañón and ucayali rivers with a higher magnitude in the case of the former the median duration at tamshiyacu is the longest reaching 13 vs 9 days in upstream stations the type 4 repiquetes only observed in tamshiyacu station have an average close to one meter but their duration of eight days is the shortest among the four repiquete types figs 4 a and b show the monthly variation of the characteristics for types 1 2 and 3 repiquetes types 1 and 2 are associated with higher magnitudes in september and october with the first quartile above 50 cm types 1 and 3 display high duration values in june including outliers but values higher than 60 days only begin in july resulting from a combination of both tributaries t3 finally repiquetes in tamshiyacu higher than 20 cm are more frequent from the second fortnight of june until the second fortnight of september fig 4c at the tamshiyacu station there is an average of 3 2 repiquetes per year higher than 20 cm the occurrence of repiquetes higher than 10 cm in the marañón river is prevalent when compared to the ucayali river during the critical phases of crops from june 15th to september 31st with an average of 5 1 vs 3 7 repiquetes per year however in the ucayali river the occurrence of repiquetes is variable with less events from july to september regarding the amazonas river the repiquetes are more frequent between august and september 3 2 rainfall and atmospheric circulation anomalies related to repiquetes the 15 events categorized as type 3 events in tamshiyacu that are observed previously in san regis and requena show northeasterly low level winds in the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon during d 10 and d 9 with negative rainfall anomalies over the marañón basin and no significant rainfall anomalies over the ucayali basin fig 5 from d 8 to d 6 northerly cross equatorial low level winds are intensified and easterly wind anomalies are strengthened over the colombian and ecuadorian amazon region unlike d 9 these wind anomalies are associated with positive rainfall anomalies over the ecuadorian amazon andes transition region above 500 masl during d 8 in the following days d 7 and d 6 the low level circulation is similar to that of d 8 but there are low rainfall anomalies from d 5 to d 3 a change in low level wind anomalies can be observed characterized by a strong convergence of northerly wind anomalies with southern wind incursion resulting from anticyclonic anomalous circulation over argentina near 30 s and 67 w at low level fig 6 these atmospheric features are characteristic of southerly wind incursions to the east of the andes which promote positive rainfall anomalies from the bolivian amazon and produce cold surges penetration into the amazon basin garreaud and wallace 1998 espinoza et al 2012 2013 paccini et al 2017 during these days high positive rainfall anomalies are observed in the andes amazon transition region between peru and ecuador figs 5 and 6 abundant rainfall is probably due to interactions between local convective processes over the equatorial andean topography and to large scale wind convergence between southeasterly and northeasterly wind anomalies over this region particularly clear in d 5 and d 4 fig 6 according to these features during d 3 a predominance of easterly and southeasterly wind anomalies over the northern equatorial amazon is associated with positive rainfall anomalies over the northern marañón basin in the northern amazon basin fig 6 in addition enhanced southerly wind anomalies over the bolivian amazon are associated with positive rainfall anomalies moving northward to the central and southern peruvian amazon in the central ucayali basin on d 3 southerly wind anomalies reach the northern peruvian amazon while positive rainfall anomalies decrease over the lower ucayali basin and most of the marañón basin during d 2 and d 1 there are southeasterly wind anomalies over the peruvian and western brazilian amazon and low positive rainfall anomalies over the central ucayali d 2 and marañón d 1 basins finally d0 and d 1 are characterized by a weakening of the southerly wind anomalies while westerly wind anomalies prevail over the northern region this feature being opposite to the pattern observed during rainy days these atmospheric patterns reduce the convective activity over the peruvian and ecuadorian amazon which reduces rainfall over the northern marañón basin and dries up the ucayali basin similar rainfall patterns are observed by performing the same analysis with the trmm dataset fig s2 for instance the days with more intense positive rainfall anomalies over the two basins are d 5 d 4 and d 3 however using the trmm dataset the positive rainfall anomalies in the northern region between peru and ecuador are slightly lower probably due to the lower spatial resolution of trmm the 47 events categorized as type 1 events in tamshiyacu that are observed previously only in san regis show similar atmospheric patterns to those for events categorized as type 3 with some relevant differences described below figs 7 and 8 days d 10 to d 7 are characterized by weak northwesterly wind anomalies over the peruvian amazon and westerly wind anomalies near the equator these anomalies are related to dry conditions in d 10 d 9 d 8 and d 7 fig 7 during d 6 and d 5 over the northern marañón basin there is a change in wind direction from north to the northeast that is associated with the high positive rainfall anomalies in d 5 over the ecuadorian andes amazon transition region the following days d 4 and d 3 are characterized by southeasterly wind anomalies over the peruvian amazon plain but weaker rainfall anomalies in contrast to type 3 repiquetes for which the change from northeasterly to southeasterly winds occurs earlier in addition easterly wind anomalies are also observed over the northern region associated with positive rainfall anomalies over the northwestern amazon basin figs 7 and 8 finally from d 2 to d 1 wind anomalies over most of the tamshiyacu basin are not significant resulting in no significant rainfall anomaly fig 7 similar rainfall patterns to those described in fig 7 are observed by performing the same analysis with the trmm dataset fig s3 but similar to type 1 repiquetes analysis rainfall anomalies are lower in the trmm dataset in comparison to chirps as expected the main difference regarding type 3 repiquetes is that rainfall is mostly observed in the north marañón basin there is no northeasterly wind anomaly and no convergence with the southeastern advection over the ucayali only weak rainfall anomalies carried by the incursion over this middle basin as consequence no repiquetes are reported in the ucayali river these atmospheric patterns are coherent with the role of the marañón river instead of the ucayali river as the precursor of the repiquetes observed in tamshiyacu furthermore a longitudinal cross section of type 1 repiquetes from 1000 hpa to 200 hpa at 3 25 s northern marañón basin is shown in fig 9 values of specific humidity greater than 16 g kg under 925 hpa can be seen from d 8 to d 4 d 6 up to d 4 are characterized by large equivalent potential temperature ept values between 78 w 73 w with a smooth decrease in height from the surface to medium levels this condition is associated with an increase in the velocity of vertical winds from d 5 to d 3 in the eastern andes these features suggest atmospheric instability related to enhanced specific humidity low level wind convergence forced by the andes and wind ascendance over the northern marañón basin during d 5 to d 3 consistent with precipitation patterns observed over this region in fig 7 table 3 and table s1 supplementary material relate each repiquete type to large scale atmospheric circulation patterns cps previously defined by paccini et al 2017 which synthesize the nine main modes of winds variability on an intra seasonal timescale in this way the percentages of days of these cp s occurrence was calculated for each day for each repiquete type first for type 3 repiquetes within the 1997 2014 period 11 out of 15 events in d 10 and d 9 cp8 is prevailing 36 36 of the days apart from other cps characterized by the northerly wind regime see table 3 in the following days there is a predominance of cp2 between 45 45 and 63 64 that changes to cp4 in d 2 36 36 apart from other cps with southerly wind regimes like cp5 and cp6 therefore a change from a northerly to a southerly wind regime is evident especially from 5 to 3 days before to the beginning of the repiquete in tamshiyacu however the easterly flow over the northwest is weak during these cps and that could explain why the percentages of days of the occurrence are distributed among other cps 4 discussion for the first time our results show the respective influences of the marañón and ucayali rivers on repiquetes in the amazonas river in terms of magnitude figs 2b d and the annual number of repiquetes higher than 10 cm in the marañón and ucayali rivers fig 4c in addition the influences of upstream rivers on repiquetes in the amazonas river in terms of frequency magnitude timing and duration are also documented in figs 3 and 4 most of our results regarding frequency magnitude and duration of repiquetes in the peruvian amazonas river are in accordance with previous studies including the average of 3 2 repiquetes per year higher than 20 cm coomes et al 2016 ronchail et al 2018 however in this study we use a different definition of the recession period based on the annual maximum and minimum water levels see section 2 and consider a longer period 4 more years than the studies mentioned regarding the delay between the repiquetes in tamshiyacu and those in its tributaries a greater lag can be seen in requena ucayali river as precursor than san regis marañón river as precursor up to six days compared to four days these results and the major influence of the marañón river on the repiquetes in the amazonas river during june october are related to the higher discharge of the marañón river almost twice the discharge of the ucayali river due to the presence of rainfall in the northern amazon from june to september they also are related to the vast floodplains that characterize the ucayali river and the numerous oxbow lakes around its main channel to which excess water flows before reaching the amazonas river abizaid 2005 coomes et al 2009 abad et al 2013 armijos et al 2013 despite the rapid transfer of water from tributaries to the main stream this lag between stations could be used to warn downstream farmers not to use valuable seeds and not waste their time and money however to develop a reliable hydrological information service for farmers the magnitude and duration of repiquetes in the seeding period june july would need to be considered and also their possible negative impacts on the early growing season on the other hand higher magnitudes observed in type 2 repiquetes in september and october are related to increased discharges from the ucayali river at the beginning of the hydrological year caused by the onset of the sams from mid august to early december arias et al 2015 changes from northerly to southerly anomalies in low level winds are related to precipitation 3 5 days before the occurrence of repiquetes previous studies have documented that southeastern flux and intense precipitation over the north western amazon are related to anomalous anticyclonic circulations in eastern bolivia the eastward displacement of extra tropical systems and equatorial circulations wang and fu 2002 santos et al 2015 paccini et al 2017 besides in some cases these fluxes could be related to cold surges with high surface pressures espinoza et al 2013 however our study provides new information regarding the main atmospheric processes associated with repiquetes in the peruvian ecuadorian amazon in particular positive rainfall anomalies over the northern marañón basin are a common feature observed days before the start of the repiquete enhanced convective activity over the northern marañón basin is related to southerly wind incursions and an intensification of easterly low level winds which transport moisture from the central amazon to the western amazon basin thus low level wind convergence forced by the andean topography are observed over the northern marañón basin from five to three days before the start of the repiquete in tamshiyacu fig 9 previous studies found a strong relationship between wind circulation and rainfall patterns on a monthly and intraseasonal scale in the upper amazon basin e g paccini et al 2017 mayta et al 2018 however wind circulation is better represented in atmospheric models than precipitation particularly over the andes minvielle and garreaud 2011 therefore the use of wind circulation would be useful to predict repiquetes events furthermore our results are fundamental to the development of measures to help farmers cope with flood reversals the forecast of repiquetes generally occurs too late so they inevitably flood newly seeded fields choke the young plants with sediment and shorten the growing season which is a significant impediment to the development of the agricultural potential of the lowlands in western amazonia however the beginning of the seeding period june july is crucial when prediction could be useful for avoiding unproductive seeding so it will be necessary to improve atmospheric and hydrological forecasts focusing on prevention during the beginning of the crop period before farmers plant theirs seeds forecasting repiquetes in june and july for this purpose we encourage future research with this approach combined with the implementation of regional scales 1d 2d hydrological models wongchuig correa et al 2017 another alternative to improve the accuracy of short term streamflow forecasting hybrid models which have recently been developed pramanik et al 2011 santos et al 2014 vergara and lavado 2016 is the use of data about atmospheric patterns as input to improve these models as they are less uncertain than precipitation a limitation in this study is the lack of additional time series of water level data which could be solved by combining remote sensing techniques and the use of virtual stations based on altimetry satellites and synthetic aperture radar sar applications which can measure the extent of floods and changes in water level e g wdowinski et al 2008 ovando et al 2016 häfliger et al 2019 nevertheless it is necessary to consider that this work does not analyze factors like fluvial morpho dynamics and groundwater anomalies that could affect repiquete events moreover some projections based on the western amazon indicated a future increase in the frequency of wet years and increased mean and maximum discharges along the peruvian floodplain guimberteau et al 2013 langerwisch et al 2013 sorribas et al 2016 zulkafli et al 2016 these changes could affect the frequency seasonality duration and magnitude of repiquetes as well 5 conclusions this work investigates the frequency magnitude and timing of river stage recessional reversals known as repiquetes along the peruvian amazon river and its two formative tributaries the ucayali and marañón rivers water level data is used to understand the influence of upstream tributaries as precursors of repiquetes in the amazonas river and to classify the occurrence of reversals higher than 20 cm in the amazonas and higher than 10 cm in the tributaries into types according to their origin as a result type 1 repiquetes repiquetes in the amazonas river with a precursor in the marañón river are the most frequent 64 of the total significant repiquetes in the amazonas river while repiquetes in the amazonas river with a precursor in the ucayali river type 2 are much less frequent 5 thus the study shows that repiquetes in the marañón river are the primary precursors of repiquetes in the amazonas river this is consistent with the fact that rains can occur during the winter months in the marañón basin which is much rarer in the ucayali basin moreover precursors in the marañón river greater than 1 m will systematically cause repiquetes higher than 20 cm in the amazonas river on average repiquetes in the marañón river occur one day before those observed in the amazonas river and most last around 12 days however the ucayali river has an increasing influence on the frequency and magnitude of repiquetes in september and october due to the beginning of the hydrological year in the southern tropical amazon basin this study identifies rainfall and large scale atmospheric circulation patterns related to the occurrence of repiquetes events it focuses on hydro meteorological conditions related to type 1 and type 3 repiquetes repiquetes in the amazonas river with a precursor in both tributaries and rainfall anomalies which were analyzed from ten days before d 10 to the beginning day of repiquetes d0 in tamshiyacu station amazonas river we found that the peruvian and ecuadorian andes amazon transition region in the northern marañón basin is a key region that presents positive rainfall anomalies from five to three days before the repiquete d 5 to d 3 the positive rainfall anomalies are associated with changes in low level circulations patterns in the days leading up to the repiquete in general there is a progressive intensification of the northerly flow from d 10 to d 7 over the equatorial region followed by a clear low level northerly to southerly winds change between d 5 and d 3 supported by an easterly flow during these days convergence forced by the presence of the andes is observed in the northern marañón basin which enhanced convective activity over this region repiquetes with precursors in both rivers type 3 are characterized by a strong convergence between intense northeasterly winds and southerly winds over the northern and central tamshiyacu basin from d 5 to d 3 however in type 1 repiquetes northeasterly winds are weaker than in type 3 and wind convergence is predominant only in the northern marañón basin this study shows the origin of repiquetes upstream of tamshiyacu station and their connection with atmospheric patterns these results encourage further analysis regarding other factors like fluvial morpho dynamics and groundwater anomalies that could affect repiquete events in order to improve the forecast of such events which principally have an atmospheric origin while the lack of gauge data remains a major limitation new information mainly based on remotely sensed observations will supply water surface elevations covering more river sections with better spatial and temporal resolution in addition to this the major application of our results is to give alternatives to improve the accuracy of short term streamflow forecasting during the annual recession using atmospheric patterns that could be inputted to hybrid models for recently developed short term streamflow forecasting these results are fundamental to the development of measures to help farmers deal with repiquetes and they can be added to the efforts to obtain a secure flood index or hydrological services for farmers focusing on the periods before and during planting considering the fragility of seeds and young plants credit authorship

8302,this study uses the surface energy balance system sebs and the topographic driven model topmodel in estimating soil moisture for mbire district in zimbabwe and validates these estimates with ground based gravimetric measurements baseded on fifty four soil moisture sampling sites five atmospherically corrected modis images for the period 2013were processed and used to estimate evapotransiration the result of the relative evaporation from the sebs algorithm was multiplied by the average of the porosity and the field capacity to get the spatial and temporal soil moisture estimates the topmodel rainfall runoff model whose land surface inputs were obtained from remote sensing was calibrated with runoff data for the period ranging 2008 2013 after successful calibration the model was used to to simulate spatial and temporal soil moisture estimates and compare with insitu measured soil moisture from the fifty two sampling sites an upscaling procedure to improve the comparison between soil moisture retrieval point measurements remote sensing and topmodel outputs was accomplished by the use of geostatistical tools land suitability analysis for flood recession farming was performed using soil moisture maps distance from stream network vertical channel distance and land use cover datasets the model performance indicators for topmodel simulations show an acceptable match with measured discharge nse 0 765 and 0 812 and pbias 6 04 and 10 5 for manyame and angwa sub catchments respectively results show that the sebs approach show spatial and temporal soil moisture variability across the mbire district simulated there is a strong relationship r2 0 796 between upscaled insitu based soil moisture measurements and sebs based techniques for the period of march to july 2013 the study further revealed that there is a fair relationship r2 0 60 between upscaled ground soil moisture measurements and hydrological modelling topmodel for the same period topmodel soil moisture increases towards the angwa and manyame river tributaries results also show that approximately 22800 ha of mbire district has suitable to moderately suitable flood recession farming area the study concludes that the use of geostatistical approaches remote sensing and hydrologic models is promising in planning and management of soil moisture and water resources in data scarce and water limited environments keywords land suitability modis soil moisture variation sebs topmodel 1 introduction in semi arid areas rain fed dependent farmers have to deal with the inter and intra annual variability of climate and weather which has the potential to destroy crops especially through drought long dry spells or prevailing arid semi arid conditions campbell 2016 fao 2016 schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 the impact of tclimate and weather variability acts as a significant exogenous shock on the production systems and household economies of poor and often food insecure rural communities campbell 2016 fao 2016 consequently livelihoods and human health are negatively affected schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 in order to cope farmers in the lower stages of the river profile that are geomorphologically characterized by wide and flat floodplains practice flood recession farming duvail and hamerlynck 2007 balana et al 2019 and traore kalifa et al 2020 an example is shown for the lower rufiji river in tanzania that is 20 km wide duvail and hamerlynck 2007 as well as the middle zambezi floodplains which are approximately 10 15 km gumindoga et al 2018 flood recession farming is cropping that utilizes residual moisture that is left in the subsurface of floodplains or lake shores after annual or seasonal inundation recedes on the floodplains flood inundations also deposit nutrient rich soils as the river loses its velocity the soil moisture and nutrients are good for plant growth it is therefore no surprise that some communities globally have made use of the flood recession patterns to cultivate crops in a relatively cheaper way and thereby increasing food production and enhancing food security motsumi and magole 2012 the residual soil moisture that is retained at root zone depth provides moisture conditions that are a kin to irrigated farming and hence flood recession is practiced mbire district in zimbabwe is prone to low and erratic rainfall seasonal floods and droughts there are four major tributaries of the zambezi river passing through the district and the zambezi river bordering it to the north despite abundance of surface water resources the inhabitants are facing a challenge in securing enough water for small scale agricultural production resulting in increased hunger and poverty since their livelihoods and subsistence depends on rainfed agriculture recently traore kalifa et al 2020 described flood recession farming in mali west africa in which farmers sow sorghum varieties of the durra type the paper also assesses techniques to improve sorghum yields from the farming practices balanaa et al 2019 applied optimization modelling to see the crop mix and water management options that maximised household level incomes and food security from flood recession farming on the floodplains of the white volta river in ghana in the okavango delta in botswana nthaba et al 2018 assessed the impact of flood recession farming frequency on weed species diversity and composition results reveal that cultivation frequency influenced weed species diversity and composition in some areas of the delta dry land weeds were seen on cultivated floodplains in the same okavango delta kashe et al 2015 evaluated maize yields from flood recession agriculture the study showed that soil fertility and yields were statistically higher on the floodplains compared to dry land plots bosekeng et al 2017 investigated the influence of soil moisture on maize growth and yield in the okavango s flood recession agricultural practices they pointed out the need to know the moisture regimes of the floodplains areas close to the river channel may be too wet or waterlogged whilst further away maybe too dry to support crop growth and hence low yields it has also been shown that flood recession agriculture is affected by the construction of dams saarnak 2003 and uncertain regulatory and policy guidelines chimbari et al 2009 a number of of studies on flood recession agriculture exist balanaa et al 2019 traore kalifa et al 2020 bosekeng et al 2017 a limited number of these studies focus on understanding the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of soil moisture which is the primary focus of this work to some extent this work builds on the conclusion of bosekeng et al 2017 that emphasized the need to understand soil moisture regimes so as to define the most suitable areas in the context of flood recession agriculture understanding soil moisture regimes can help to resolve policy and regulatory uncertainties improve production and balance production and the need for environmental protection these floodplain based recession systems that are also the focus of this paper are different from the other type of flood based systems that have been studied and utilized in southern africa for years i e dambos dambos are isolated local depressions that experience seasonal water level changes or are sometimes referred to as seasonal wetlands in zimbabwe they are commonly referred to as matoro amongst the shona the hydrology of these dambos has been studied and adequately presented by mccartney and neal 1999 mccartney 2000 von der heyden and new 2003 and von der heyden 2004 overall understanding soil moisture variation is of global interest in view of climate change and variability reference the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture has enormous implications in hydrological agricultural economic and social planning and development vicent et al 2004 western et al 2002 soil moisture is a key hydrologic parameter since it has close relationships with the infiltration evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge zhao et al 2020 understanding soil moisture trend is critical in drought and flood prediction water resources management and agricultural production liu et al 2008 one hydrological variable frequently found to be nonlinearly related to runoff is soil moisture which impacts the catchment runoff response at the field and headwater scale soil moisture also affects the partitioning of latent and sensible heat fluxes and hence evapotranspiration su et al 2003 soil moisture is generally measured in the field at point scale using soil moisture probes or soil samples and oven baking the field based approach can be expensive tedious time consuming and does not account for regional spatial variability remote sensing relative evaporation and land surface hydrological modelling provide an alternative way to obtain spatial estimates soil moisture nicolai 2015 mousa and shu 2020 myeni et al 2019 land surface models currently provide soil moisture products globally and regionally e g gldas rodell et al 2004 land surface models often couple the land surface exchange processes surface hydrology and vadose zone processes rodell et al 2004 meng and quiring 2008 and cai et al 2014 lo 2018 hydrological models are also available to simulate rainfall runoff processes and to predict soil moisture examples of such hydrological models include the variable infiltration capacity model vic soil and water assessment tool swat topmodel and hydrologysca byrans vattenbalnavdelning hbv liang et al 1994 beven 1984 hornberger et al 1985 bergstrm 1995 fu et al 2018 topmodel is a topographic based hydrological model that uses topographic derivatives such as slope and topographic position that serve as important hydrological drivers kirkby and chorley 1967 gallant and wilson 1996 variations in topography affect different hydrological processes such as infiltration which influence soil moisture content and runoff generation dunne 1978 wolock and price 1994 thus the application of this model for floodplain soil moisture simulation in different model versions topmodel has been applied in more than 40 countries all over the world it has been applied to countries with such different climatic conditions as for example sweden zimbabwe india colombia and united kingdom beven 1984 hornberger et al 1985 quinn and beven 1993 robson et al 1993 albek et al 2004 gumindoga 2010 muhammed 2012 however few studies exist on application of the model in floodplains such as the zambezi basin with the increasing availability of remote sensing data there is now established in literature the sound ability to estimate evapotranspiration from satellite data a number of evapotranspiration algorithms have been developed for this purpose including the surface energy balance technique sebs su 2002 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 these algorothims estimate actual evapotranspiration which is often difficult to measure using an energy balance framework each model has its own conceptualizations and simplifications of the diffusive evapotranspiration process based on the temperature gradient between the ground and air differences are in the manner in which resistances and wet and dry limits are conceptualized a number of studies has shown that the application satellite evapotranspiration algorithms can be used to estimate actual evapotranspiration rwasoka et al 2011 applied the sebs algorithm to estimate actual evapotranspiration in the upper manyame subcatchment in zimbabwe shoko et al 2016 also applied the sebs algorithm in south west zimbabwe and underscored the role of satellite et estimation in semi arid areas shoko et al 2016 estimated actual evaporation in the umngeni catchment in south africa using landsat 8 and modis satellite products landsat 8 products showed relatively a good performance in evaporation prediction furthermore gokoo et al 2016 applied sebs to estimate spatially variable evaporation and applied a a gap filling technique to result in a poor performing sebs output on the other hand su et al 2003 proposed a theory and method of estimating soil moisture in the rootzone using relative evaporation used the derivation of sebs algorithm in su 2002 to estimatethe relative evaporation using sensible heat flux and its value at the wet and dry limit the derivation is useful because of the already tested efficacy is using remote sensing for actual evapotranspiration estimation however the method has not been applied a lot and still needs to be tested therefore in this study the ability of sebs and topmodel to estimate spatio temporal soil moisture variation iwas assessed the objectives of this study are i to estimate the spatial temporal variation of soil moisture in the mbire district as inferred from the sebs driven relative evaporation ii to calibrate the rainfall runoff model topmodel with hydro meteorological data for soil moisture prediction in the mbire district hydrological catchments iii to analyse and apply geo statistical tools to interpolate point based measurements of soil moisture along the major tributaries of the zambezi basin in the mbire district and compare outputs against sebs and topmodel based simulations and iv to evaluate land for flood recession crop farming in the district 2 description of study area the mbire district is located between 30 60ᵒ and 31 20ᵒ east and 15 60ᵒ and 16 40ᵒ south and it covers an area of approximately 4700 km2 see fig 1 the study area is characterized by floodplains of the zambezi river basin at an average altitude of 400 m above mean sea level the basin is drained by the rivers mwanzamutanda angwa manyame musengezi and kadzi rivers lgda 2009 and gumindoga et al 2018 mbire district lies in zimbabwe s natural agro ecological region iv the climate is dry tropical with low and very variable annual rainfalls of approximately 650 700 mm but it is highly variable with one year in four being below 500 550 mm and one in four being above 800 850 mm phiri 2011 mbire district has a diversity of soils however a significant part of the district is characterized by calcic solonetz soils and these soils are sodic fao 1996 lgda 2009 dube 2001 the main soil types in the basin are the acid leached out tropical soils of low fertility commonly known as red soils which are easily degradable and erodible promoting the occurrence of gullies 3 methodology fig 2 shows the flow chart diagram of the methodology section 3 1 data collection and availability of ground data in this work the following datasets were required and were collected from the study area web sites previous studies and laboratory analysis 3 1 1 meteorological data meteorological data was obtained at a daily time step from five weather stations of which two are within the catchment namely kanyemba mushumbi rainfall only and three stations outside the catchment guruve muzarabani and karoi the stations are monitored and maintained by the meteorological services department msd of zimbabwe except mushumbi which is being monitored by agricultural technical and extension services of zimbabwe agritex data on precipitation wind speed relative humidity and temperature at two meters height was obtained from the stations www wunderground com http weather online com and nasa covering the period of 2008 2013 this period corresponds to insitu based soil moisture data available 3 1 2 data on physical properties of soils a total of 54 soil sampling sites were located at a 5 km stretch along transects in the major tributaries of zambezi river in mbire district that are manyame angwa and musengezi euclidean distances from the river channels at most 1000 m elevation and site accessibility were the main factors that were considered in locating these sampling sites both systematic and stratified sampling was implemented fig 3 shows how the sampling points were located soil moisture data was obtained through sampling and laboratory analysis several soil characteristics should be evaluated to determine soil suitability for farming the primary factors are soil moisture relationships toxicity fertility depth to gravel and cobble continuing layer and the erosion hazard zone 2019 therefore for this study soil type soil drainage soil depth of 10 100 cm obstacle to roots of crops impermeable layer phase and texture classes were used in determination of soil moisture and physical properties to determine the field capacity values the soil water characteristic software soil water characteristics version 6 02 74 was used together with soil particle size distribution particle density which is the mass of the soil particles mineral grains in a given volume is determined as the mass of the soil divided by the volume of the mineral grains only particle density is used with bulk density data to calculate the porosity of a soil a value of 2 65 g cm 3 was assumed for most soils bulk density was determined by dividing the mass of a sample dried for 24 h or more at 105 c by the volume porosity is given by subtracting the ratio of the bulk density to the particle density from one 3 1 3 discharge data daily discharge data for c64 and c68 flow gauging stations on manyame and musengezi river respectively

l1b data are in swath orbit based format therefore the data was re projected to standard projection and format compatible with gis software both the modis level 1b and geolocation data products were converted to geotiff format and re projected to geographic projection ready for ilwis importing in modisswathtool desired bands and coordinates for each image were selected 3 2 3 modis image pre processing for sebs all the selected and reprojected bands were imported to ilwis for further processing on which ilwis script was used to import all the files i converting raw to radiances reflectance modis the modis level 1b data are given in simplified integer number si therefore the data were converted to reflectances and radiances modis channels 1 7 were converted to reflectances

sebs determined evapotranspiration estimated evapotranspiration from sebs was validated using e pan evaporation data from the study area the derived potential evapotranspiration was used to cross reference the actual evapotranspiration simulated by sebs and topmodel gibson et al 2011 3 3 deriving potential maximum wetness pmw from the sampling sites physical properties of the top soil in the study area were analysed in a soil physical laboratory to determine the field capacity values soil particle size distribution for the 54 sampling stations was determined and used to retrieve field capacity using soil water characteristic software soil water characteristics version 6 02 74 by saxton 2004 for particle density value of 2 65 g cm 3 was assumed for most soils core method was used to determine the bulk density of the soil for the 54 sampling stations the bulk density value was determined by dividing the mass of a sample dried for 24 h or more at 105 c by the volume to determine soil porosity for each of the 54 sampling sites the following formula was used 9 1 b d p d where porosity bd bulk density and pd particle density potential soil wetness map for the study area was derived from field capacity and porosity using the following relationship 10 θ w e t θ f c 2 where θ f c field capacity θwet water content at limiting case taken as porosity of the soil this potential maximum wetness limiting value has also been shown to be approximated to a midpoint between the field capacity and the total water capacity porosity by wagner et al 1999a point based potential maximum wetness was up scaled by interpolation using the inverse distance weighting finally the pmw was used to down scale sebs outputs to 30 m 30 m pixel resolution and infer soil moisture from relative evapotranspiration as a product of pmw and relative evapotranspiration 3 4 determining spatial and temporal soil moisture variation using topmodel 3 4 1 dem hydro processing an advanced spaceborne

removal filling of sinks the fill sinks operation removes local depressions according to maathuis and wang 2006 the height value of a single pixel depression is raised to the smallest value of the neighbours of a single pixel depression and height values of a local depression consisting of multiple pixels are raised to the lowest value of a pixel that is adjacent to the outlet for the depression and that would discharge into the initial depression hengl et al 2007 this will ensure that flow direction will be found for every pixel in the map ii flow determination flow direction was computed using the d8 algorithm ilwis software which can take eight different directional values expressed as degrees or as numeric codes the d8 method is more applicable to delineation of the drainage network for drainage areas with well developed channels garbrecht and martz 1999 iii network and catchment extraction the dem hydroprocessing algorithm in ilwis was used extract drainage network from the filled dem flow direction and flow accumulation order the drainage network and to extract desired catchments on which three desired catchments for mbire district were extracted basing on the location of upstream flow gauging stations 3 4 2 preparation of topmodel inputs i the topographic index ti file in this study the topographic index ti for each subcatchment was calculated from

these topographic index distribution values were reclassified in to different classes to fit in the limitation of less than or equal to 30 classes of the topmodel program available tabular distribution of topographic index was converted to a text file ready for topmodel input file ii catchment data file the area distance file area distance maps were computed from the ilwis 3 3 academic

catchment outlet was computed the distance map was reclassified into segments for simplicity for the routing of surface flows to the outlet tabular distribution of distance was converted to a text

soil hydraulic conductivity decay parameter m was estimated by recession curve analysis from historical river discharge data the parameter m is simply the reciprocal of the slope of the curve of base flows against time ambroise et al 1996 beven 1997a b the fractional area and its distance from the outlet as well as channel velocity were used as inputs as to estimate flow travel time used in the flow routing procedure of the model class gumindoga et al 2011 2014 to estimate most critical parameter in root zone soil moisture prediction the maximum root zone storage srrmax weighted average catchment soil available water capacity were used fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2008 3 4 4 topmodel calibration the model was calibrated basing on three parameters using knowledge obtained from the following literature beven and kirkby 1979 beven et al 1995 beven 1997a b 2001 beven and freer 2000 gumindoga et al 2011 muhammed 2012 of which parameters is most sensitive these are the soil hydraulic conductivity decay parameter m and the soil transmissivity at saturation t0 an average root zone available water capacity srmax was used for each sub catchment a time step of 24 h was selected for computations to calibrate the model the value of parameter m was varied holding values of remaining four parameters at initial value and value of parameter m was determined which yield the highest efficiency this method was repeated for remaining parameters to arrive at a set of parameters which gave highest value of efficiency the final calibration for the years 2008 2010 was performed by changing topmodel parameters manually to optimize model performance for each model run after each run two objective indices of goodness of fit were used for model performance evaluation 3 4 5 topmodel validation the model was validated using the 2011 october 2013 july dataset simulated streamflow was then compared to observed streamflow graphically visual comparison and numerically using performance indicators the performance indicators used in this study are the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias the percentage difference of runoff pdq

moisture content in a gis environment for comparison purposes 3 5 point based soil measurement gravimetric method and interpolation a hand auger was used to collect samples at a depth of 0 25 0 5 m from 54 sampling sites the depth for sampling were chosen based on the rooting depths of the various crops grown in the flood plain which range from 0 2 m for maize to 0 5 m for leguminous plants since these are the most common crops grown in the study area at each sampling site four subsamples were collected and mixed to form a composite sample composite samples of approximately 200 g was collected at each site in a sealed container to preserve the moisture the procedure was repeated once per month for the months march 2013 april 2013 may 2013 june 2013 and july 2013 the moisture content was determined in the laboratory using the gravimetric method as described by western et al 2002 and sandor 2008 the resultant gravimetric soil moisture content was converted to volumetric water content by multiplying it by bulk density point based soil moisture measurements were up scaled using the inverse distance weighting idw techniqueand compared to sebs and topmodel derived soil moisture the cross tool in ilwis was used to allow pixel to pixel comparison regression analysis and two paired t test was used to test for difference between spatial soil moisture outputs in spss software at p 0 05 3 6 land evaluation for flood recession crop cultivation for mbire district the essence of land evaluation is to compare or match the requirements of each potential land use with the characteristics of each land unit the result of land evaluation is a measure of the suitability of each land unit for a given land use these suitability assessments are then examined in the light of economic social and environmental considerations in order to develop an actual land use plan generally flood recession farming land is situated in flood plain at very low vertical height from river channel at flat slope less than 2 and on soils with high water holding capacity and high plant available capacity oku et al 2007 ma et al 2007 jia et al 2007 in mbire district flooding is mainly influenced by high stream flows and back flows from the zambezi river due to its geographical location and kariba dam and cabora bassa dam operations crop cultivation in flood plain must be situated as far as possible from sensitive areas such as water bodies and river bed channel because of environmental implications and from protected areas and parks as a result there are minimum requirements used to identify the most suitable land and exclude certain land 3 6 1 derivation and preparation of datasets i distance calculation the distance allocation tool in arcgis spatial analyst tools was used to allocate euclidean distance of each pixel from stream network derived from dem hydro processing the distance operation assigns to each pixel the smallest distance to the nearest channel the output is called a distance map ii height above channel flow accumulation drainage network and filled aster dem 30 m resolution was used to derive the channel base elevations in ilwis 3 3 academic the channel base elevations were then interpolated to form a channel height layer that if subtracted from the dem produces the vertical distance to the closest channel of each location in the study area murwira and schmidt murwira 2005 the vertical height above the nearest channel was then determined by subtracting the channel base height interpolation from the original dem 17 k v r where k is height above channel v is elevation dem and r is channel height iii landcover use classes a landsat tm satellite image of the 02 07 2012 was used to determine landuse and land cover within the mbire district landsat tm images were used because of their relatively high spatial resolution 30 m and their wide application for landcover classification across the world lillesand and kiefer 2000 chen and vierling 2004 masek and vermote 2006 landsat has the optimal ground resolution and spectral bands to efficiently maximum likelihood supervised classification method was used because it dichotomizes the area into the following main classes forest woodland mixed shrub and grassland grassland water bodies and cropland and open ground maximum likelihood classification assumes that the statistics for each class in each band are normally distributed and calculates the probability that a given pixel belongs to a specific class lucas and janssen 2002 for land classification validation ground control points using global positioning system gps were taken from different landuse cover classes include grassland agricultural fields water and forest the error matrix was used to quantify the level of error from the correct or actual measurements on the ground to assess the accuracy of an image classification error matrix confusion matrix was calculated to determine the accuracy of the classification and to identify where misclassification occurs the overall average accuracy of the classified landuse land cover map for 2012 was 88 11 which is excellent iv slope the digital elevation model fill was used to calculate height differences in x and y direction using linear filter operation in ilwis to calculate a slope map in percentages from height differences equation 56 was used 18

spatio temporal soil moisture variation developed from sebs and topmodel was combined to one thematic layer for use in the suitability analysis evaluation for flood recession crop cultivation 3 6 2 deriving suitability map model builder in arcgis spatial analyst was used to reclassify all the derived datasets into desired three suitability classes using the criteria reclassifying was done to combine the four layers in their present form a weighted overlay tool was used to combine the five coded layers all classes of zeros were assigned to restricted scale values which are areas that are not suitable for flood recession farming each reclassified layer was assigned to a percentage of influence weight suitability map was obtained after running the model 4 results and discussion 4 1 determination of spatio temporal soil moisture variation using sebs fig 4 shows the spatio temporal variation of actual evapotranspiration for the whole mbire district as observed on 28 march 2013 and 16 april 2013 the northen part of the district has high values of eta 4 mm day for the 28th of march 2013 as compared to the southern and western parts for 16 april 2013 overal results shows that actual evapotranspiration in the distict varies in space and in time validation of sebs evapotranspiration was done using pan evaporation data from cabora bassa on which sebs evapotranspiration pixel was compared to pan evaporation from the same pixel fig 5 shows that there is very good relationship between pan evaporation and sebs retrieved evapotranspiration r2 0 8442 thus based on the strong coefficient of determination r² between pan evaporation and sebs eta the sebs algorithm can be used to estimate evapotranspiration in data scarce catchments fig 6 shows the spatial variation of relative evaporation in the mbire district just like actual evaptraspiration relative evaporation varies in space and in time low values of relative evaporation were observed in densely forested areas compared to grassland this may be due to that available energy is partitioned into the sensible heat flux and the latent heat dense forest covered areas which have high values of displacement heights and roughness heights for heat transfer the aerodynamic resistance becomes low su 1999 this in combination with higher difference in the surface air temperature leads to high values of the instantaneous heat flux only to be limited by the dry sensible heat limit rwasoka 2010 this in turn leads to low relative evaporation values and the daily evaporation and the evaporative fraction values will become low as a result the soil moisture values will also be low fig 7 shows the spatial variation of potential maximum wetness expressed as percent volumetric water content for angwa and manyame river study sites high potential maximum wetness was observed for manyame sampling site compared to the other two sites the potential maximum wetness is mainly affected by soil texture soils with high proportion of clay particles have high water holding capacity due to high volume of microspores fractional soil particle distribution analysis that was conducted during the research showed that manyame sampling site have high clay particle fraction compared to the other two sampling site hence high potential maximum wetness for all sampling sites high potential maximum wetness were observed close to the river channel due to clay deposition by flooding fig 7 show the spatial potential maximum wetness variation of two sampling sites in this research top soil moisture retrieval was attempted from remote sensing methods developed for estimation of surface turbulent fluxes sebs model was explored to retrieve soil moisture using the relation between evapotranspiration and soil moisture the average of the porosity and the field caacity was considered for the potential wetness capacity of the top soil the result of the relative evaporation from the sebs algorithm was multiplied by the average of the porosity and the field capacity to get the soil moisture figs 8 and 9 shows soil moisture obtained from objective one fig 9 shows that there is temporal variability in soil moisture as there is an overall decrease in soil moisture from march 2013 to july 2013 there is a uniform decrease in average soil moisture for all sampling sites except for musengezi sampling site for the period 10 05 2013 13 7 2013 were there is a slight decrease in soil moisture this is explained by the effect of cabora bassa back throw as observed from the zinwa gauging station c109 levels and from point based soil measurements close to the river channel 4 2 soil moisture simulation using topmodel 4 2 1 dem hydro processing fig 10 shows delineated sub catchments and the inputs into the topographic index such as filled corrected dem flow direction and flow accumulation are shown for musengezi river sub catchment as computed from dem hydro processing algorithm 4 2 2 the spatial variation of the topographic index the topographic index map and the histogram for the topographic index ln a tanβ of the musengezi river sub catchment derived from aster dem is shown in fig 11 higher topographic indices are found in the central and northern part of the basin especially in and around the streams the highest number of pixels is found in the topographic index of 11 lower tanβ values indicate lower hydraulic gradient and more accumulation of water the areas with higher ln a tanβ imply a higher degree of wetness thus more soil moisture contents by higher upslope contributing areas this is consistent with topmodel s demonstrated principles of hillslope hydrology in which locations with large upslope contributing areas and low surface gradients maintain higher soil moisture levels than locations that are steep or have a small upslope contributing areas band and peterson 1991 4 2 3 runoff calibration results for manyame and angwa river sub catchments the available data for the calibration and validation was all in all 4 years long starting october 01 2008 and ending july 31 2013 the first run and calibration of the simulation for all sub catchments was done for the period starting october 01 2008 and ending september 30 2010 final calibration was only done for manyame and angwa river sub catchments validation and root zone soil moisture simulation using the optimised parameters was done for the period october 01 2011 july 31 2013 the optimised model parameter obtained from final calibration for the parameters specified in section 3 5 5 and their corresponding nash sutcliffe s coefficient of efficiency nse value and percent bias pbias for manyame and angwa river sub catchments are shown in table 2 figs 12 and 13 show the comparison between simulated and observed flows for manyame river sub catchment the simulated runoff curve performed well particularly for the low flows the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse indicates an acceptable with very good match nse 0 757 and 0 801 for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments respectively krause and boyle 2005 willmott and robeson 2011 while the percent bias pbias pbias 10 45 and 5 5623 for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments respectively shows an acceptable performance this combination of performance indicators were the best found during the calibration exercise and the model was used to simulate flows this allowed the transfer of model parameters for soil simulation 4 2 4 runoff validation results for manyame and angwa river sub catchments figs 14 and 15 shows the comparison between simulated and observed flows for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments from 1 oct 2011 31 july 2013 the three 3 higher flows observed varies from 16 5932 m³ s 21 4563 m³ s and 23 4045 m³ s and were recorded on 05 jan 2012 21 feb 2012 and 22 feb 2013 for the validation period the simulated runoff curve follows the same trend as the observed curve table 3 shows the difference in magnitude and lead time of the five simulated flows high flows are under estimated 19 8 24 5 being the global average under estimation the lead time the time between when a forecast is made and the forecasted event occurs vary from 2 to 2 days with an overall average of 0 2 days which is good for forecasting soil moisture the under and overestimation of the peaks base flow and recession limbs in both the final calibration and validation process are not entirely due to the modelling errors but could be due to data errors and the spatial distribution of rainfall this is because four of the five weather stations used in the thiessen polygon rainfall estimation method was outside the study area thus could have an impact on the simulated discharge or the observed runoff which was converted from water levels using unreliable rating curves the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse indicates an acceptable with very good match nse 0 765 and 0 81 for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments respectively while the percent bias pbias pbias 9 54 and 6 03 for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments respectively shows an acceptable performance after validation as in table 4 4 2 5 the spatial variation of soil moisture using topmodel the aim of running and calibrating the hydrological modelling was to compare the outputs of the soil moisture from this model with the results found in the sebs approach and the measured values from the point based observations gravimetric measurements on catchment level for musengezi river subcatchment the simulated discharge is not in good agreement with the observed discharge and hence no comparison could be made for the subcatchment this is due to the fact that levels from zinwa gauging station c109 overestimate discharge due to cabora bassa water back throw fig 16 shows that topmodel simulated spatial soil moisture varies temporarily and spatially with high values near the angwa river channel fig 17 shows that low soil moisture values were simulated for angwa sampling site compared to manyame sampling site this is mainly because of high topographic index in the later sampling site simulated soil moisture is decreasing with time 4 3 upscaled point based soil measurements 4 3 1 analysis of point based soil measurements figs 18 and 19 shows the moisture content variation with distance from the musengezi river sampling site at chidodo and manyame river sampling site at chikafa the results show that the moisture content decreased with distance from the flood plain at musengezi high moisture content values were obtained during the month of march 2013 for all sampling stations across the flood plain with station 1 having the highest due to its closeness to the river channel a peak in soil in soil moisture content was observed in june 2013 at sampling station 1 for all transect at musengezi river sampling site due to cabora bassa back flows explained by high water levels for that months at zinwa c109 gauging station residual soil moisture at musengezi is mainly due to combination of high stream flow floods and back flows from zambezi river figs 17 and 18 clearly shows that soil moisture in the flood plain decrease with increase in distance from the river channel at manyame for transect three sampling station one near the river channel recorded the highest soil moisture content throughout the study period and low values were from station four furthest from the river channel the soil moisture at manyame decreased gradually for all the stations compared to musengezi this site is because this site is not affected by back flows from cabora bassa as the later site high soil residual soil moisture at manyame sampling site is mainly influence high stream flow and soil type which are rich in clay content and the effect of back throw which are experienced during peak discharge in manyame river angwa sampling site recorded the least soil moisture values this is due to that the sampling site does not experience back throw and the soils have poor water holding capacity compared to manyame sampling site where the effect of back throw is less residual soil moisture at this site is mainly influenced by high stream fig 20 shows upscaled ground based measurements and their mean pixel soil moisture for all sampling sites and soil moisture outputs of sebs and topmodel fig 21 4 3 2 comparison of soil moisture outputs from sebs and topmodel to ground based measurements in this research top soil moisture retrieval was attempted from remote sensing methods developed for estimation of surface turbulent fluxes and the rainfall runoff modelling approach topmodel fig 22 a shows a scatter plot comparing pixel based soil moisture values retrieved using remote sensing sebs to direct method gravimetric method as seen from the scatter there is a strong positive linear relationship between the gravimetric measured soil moisture and the remote sensing derived soil moisture values as explained by high values of the coefficient of determination r2 0 885 and an average of r2 0 796 for all sampling sites sebs underestimated soil moisture especially at dense vegetation this mainly due that instantaneous sensible heat flux in sebs is limited between the dry and the wet limits of the sensible heat flux su 1999 therefore sebs can be used to estimate spatial soil moisture variation in grasslands accurately fig 22 b shows a scatter plot comparing soil moisture values simulated by topmodel to ground based measured soil moisture gravimetric method as shown by the scatter there is fair relation in spatial variation of sm between the measured soil moisture and the topmodel derived soil moisture values as explained by generally low values compared to sebs of the coefficient of determination r2 0 6434 and an average of r2 0 597 for manyame and angwa sampling sites also there is significant different between topmodel sm values and ground based observations for all sampling sites spatially and temporally paired t test 95 confidence interval p 0 05 all p values were less than 0 05 hence we reject the reject null hypothesis the spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture in mbire district is influenced by high stream flows and floods topmodel was not able to accurately predict the soil moisture in the flood plain due to the effect of back flows from zambezi river may be under estimation was due to the modelling errors of it could be due to data errors and the spatial distribution of rainfall this is because four of the five weather stations used in the thiessen polygon rainfall estimation method was outside the study area thus could have an impact on the simulated discharge 4 4 results for land evaluation for floodplain agriculture fig 23 shows the suitability map provided in this report provide crucial information to farmers in mbire district as it was derived using several scientific considerations to map optimum land for flood recession farming in deriving the map environmental implication of river bank cultivation was considered by creating a buffer zone which is critical to soil and water recourses degradation for the district suitable areas occupy an area of 188 km2 moderately suitable areas occupy an area of 110 km2 whereas unsuitable areas occupy an area of 4 386 km2 suitable and moderately areas are close to the main drainage channels where floodplains occur fig 24 5 discussion the main goal of this study was to model the spatio temporal soil moisture variation along the major tributaries of zambezi river in the mbire district zimbabwe a new approach is presented to estimate soil moisture with freely available modis derived satellite based surface energy balance sebs techniques a topographic driven rainfall runoff model topmodel is successfully calibrated to simulate variable soil moisture remote sensing is recommended for frequent and continuous monitoring of floodplains as it has the ability to provide rapid information on the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture sebs algorithms are generally best fit to derive evapotranspiration and soil moisture variability the findings of this research show that there is a strong relationship r2 0 796 between upscaled ground soil moisture measurements and remote sensing methods sebs for the period of march to july 2013 the study further revealed that there is a fair relationship r2 0 60 between upscaled ground soil moisture measurements and hydrological modelling topmodel the study is consistent with the findings of li et al 2019 who revealed that the inﬂuencing factors of the spatial temporal variation of soil moisture could be influenced by some hydrological processes the study is also relevant to profile 2016 who alluded that flood recession farming is practiced in floodplains wetlands inland valleys and lake banks in several parts of west africa farmers derive benefits from seasonal floods that simultaneously bring both moisture and fertility to soils along the river banks future studies should explore other methods beyond the sebs and topmodel used to simulate soil moisture variability in the study area a particular challenge for this model is the application to semi arid regions because of high variability in rainfall and potential data quality problems however it is useful that future studies could use ensemble and hybrid models to model soil moisture variability the results across the study region indicate that the areas near the tributaries are suitable for recession farming from the results of this study mbire district have a total area of about 4684 km2 and about 6 3 is suitable to moderately suitable for flood recession farming most suitable land is located close to the zambezi river due to the effect of back flows on residual soil moisture accumulation vertical height above channel was one of the important factors in deriving the suitability map as it defines areas that are prone to high stream flows and flooding comparing the suitability map to current land use cover 50 percent of the potential suitable to moderately suitable land is being utilised for crop production this is in line with studies that project soil moisture with a high degree of spatial heterogeneity the study on the spatial variability and the driving factors of soil moisture in different scales is a significant part of the soil moisture and hydrological model and its scale deduction and the forecast factor choice in the construction process of mid long term forecast model which thus has become one of the international research hotspots weng et al 2018 6 conclusions and recommendations 6 1 conclusions the sebs algorithm developed with freely available satellite images gives reasonably good estimates of spatial and temporal variation of catchment level top soil moisture and therefore can be used in soil moisture monitoring and water resourcs management this is based on the validationand comparison with fifty four ground based soil moisture sampling sites this study demonstrated that the rainfall runoff model with calibration results ns 0 797 pbias 10 45 and validation results ns 0 765 pbias 6 03 can be extended beyond its original design of using the topographic index for predicting local variations in water table see kirkby 1975 the model in this study was used to simulate soil moisture variations in the mbire district whereby soil moisture levels increases towards the flood plain and river confluences the suitability map for floodplain cultivation in this work provides crucial information to farmers and all stakeholders for proper water resources planning and decision making in mbire district as it was derived using several scientific considerations to map optimum land for flood recession farming 6 2 recommendations there in need to improve the gauging of rivers in the district as to integrate hydrological models and remote sensing methods and ground measurements in soil moisture monitoring and even to validate hydrological models and remote sensing against ground measurements by establishing automatic loggers future research should measure hydraulic properties of soils since they play an important role in movement of soil moisture from the land surface to the water table through the unsaturated zone and hence affect the runoff and groundwater recharge processes future application of topmodel in the study should incorporate remote sensed meteorological data and move to a fully distributed approach

8302,this study uses the surface energy balance system sebs and the topographic driven model topmodel in estimating soil moisture for mbire district in zimbabwe and validates these estimates with ground based gravimetric measurements baseded on fifty four soil moisture sampling sites five atmospherically corrected modis images for the period 2013were processed and used to estimate evapotransiration the result of the relative evaporation from the sebs algorithm was multiplied by the average of the porosity and the field capacity to get the spatial and temporal soil moisture estimates the topmodel rainfall runoff model whose land surface inputs were obtained from remote sensing was calibrated with runoff data for the period ranging 2008 2013 after successful calibration the model was used to to simulate spatial and temporal soil moisture estimates and compare with insitu measured soil moisture from the fifty two sampling sites an upscaling procedure to improve the comparison between soil moisture retrieval point measurements remote sensing and topmodel outputs was accomplished by the use of geostatistical tools land suitability analysis for flood recession farming was performed using soil moisture maps distance from stream network vertical channel distance and land use cover datasets the model performance indicators for topmodel simulations show an acceptable match with measured discharge nse 0 765 and 0 812 and pbias 6 04 and 10 5 for manyame and angwa sub catchments respectively results show that the sebs approach show spatial and temporal soil moisture variability across the mbire district simulated there is a strong relationship r2 0 796 between upscaled insitu based soil moisture measurements and sebs based techniques for the period of march to july 2013 the study further revealed that there is a fair relationship r2 0 60 between upscaled ground soil moisture measurements and hydrological modelling topmodel for the same period topmodel soil moisture increases towards the angwa and manyame river tributaries results also show that approximately 22800 ha of mbire district has suitable to moderately suitable flood recession farming area the study concludes that the use of geostatistical approaches remote sensing and hydrologic models is promising in planning and management of soil moisture and water resources in data scarce and water limited environments keywords land suitability modis soil moisture variation sebs topmodel 1 introduction in semi arid areas rain fed dependent farmers have to deal with the inter and intra annual variability of climate and weather which has the potential to destroy crops especially through drought long dry spells or prevailing arid semi arid conditions campbell 2016 fao 2016 schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 the impact of tclimate and weather variability acts as a significant exogenous shock on the production systems and household economies of poor and often food insecure rural communities campbell 2016 fao 2016 consequently livelihoods and human health are negatively affected schmidhuber and tubiello 2007 in order to cope farmers in the lower stages of the river profile that are geomorphologically characterized by wide and flat floodplains practice flood recession farming duvail and hamerlynck 2007 balana et al 2019 and traore kalifa et al 2020 an example is shown for the lower rufiji river in tanzania that is 20 km wide duvail and hamerlynck 2007 as well as the middle zambezi floodplains which are approximately 10 15 km gumindoga et al 2018 flood recession farming is cropping that utilizes residual moisture that is left in the subsurface of floodplains or lake shores after annual or seasonal inundation recedes on the floodplains flood inundations also deposit nutrient rich soils as the river loses its velocity the soil moisture and nutrients are good for plant growth it is therefore no surprise that some communities globally have made use of the flood recession patterns to cultivate crops in a relatively cheaper way and thereby increasing food production and enhancing food security motsumi and magole 2012 the residual soil moisture that is retained at root zone depth provides moisture conditions that are a kin to irrigated farming and hence flood recession is practiced mbire district in zimbabwe is prone to low and erratic rainfall seasonal floods and droughts there are four major tributaries of the zambezi river passing through the district and the zambezi river bordering it to the north despite abundance of surface water resources the inhabitants are facing a challenge in securing enough water for small scale agricultural production resulting in increased hunger and poverty since their livelihoods and subsistence depends on rainfed agriculture recently traore kalifa et al 2020 described flood recession farming in mali west africa in which farmers sow sorghum varieties of the durra type the paper also assesses techniques to improve sorghum yields from the farming practices balanaa et al 2019 applied optimization modelling to see the crop mix and water management options that maximised household level incomes and food security from flood recession farming on the floodplains of the white volta river in ghana in the okavango delta in botswana nthaba et al 2018 assessed the impact of flood recession farming frequency on weed species diversity and composition results reveal that cultivation frequency influenced weed species diversity and composition in some areas of the delta dry land weeds were seen on cultivated floodplains in the same okavango delta kashe et al 2015 evaluated maize yields from flood recession agriculture the study showed that soil fertility and yields were statistically higher on the floodplains compared to dry land plots bosekeng et al 2017 investigated the influence of soil moisture on maize growth and yield in the okavango s flood recession agricultural practices they pointed out the need to know the moisture regimes of the floodplains areas close to the river channel may be too wet or waterlogged whilst further away maybe too dry to support crop growth and hence low yields it has also been shown that flood recession agriculture is affected by the construction of dams saarnak 2003 and uncertain regulatory and policy guidelines chimbari et al 2009 a number of of studies on flood recession agriculture exist balanaa et al 2019 traore kalifa et al 2020 bosekeng et al 2017 a limited number of these studies focus on understanding the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of soil moisture which is the primary focus of this work to some extent this work builds on the conclusion of bosekeng et al 2017 that emphasized the need to understand soil moisture regimes so as to define the most suitable areas in the context of flood recession agriculture understanding soil moisture regimes can help to resolve policy and regulatory uncertainties improve production and balance production and the need for environmental protection these floodplain based recession systems that are also the focus of this paper are different from the other type of flood based systems that have been studied and utilized in southern africa for years i e dambos dambos are isolated local depressions that experience seasonal water level changes or are sometimes referred to as seasonal wetlands in zimbabwe they are commonly referred to as matoro amongst the shona the hydrology of these dambos has been studied and adequately presented by mccartney and neal 1999 mccartney 2000 von der heyden and new 2003 and von der heyden 2004 overall understanding soil moisture variation is of global interest in view of climate change and variability reference the spatial and temporal distribution of soil moisture has enormous implications in hydrological agricultural economic and social planning and development vicent et al 2004 western et al 2002 soil moisture is a key hydrologic parameter since it has close relationships with the infiltration evapotranspiration surface runoff and groundwater recharge zhao et al 2020 understanding soil moisture trend is critical in drought and flood prediction water resources management and agricultural production liu et al 2008 one hydrological variable frequently found to be nonlinearly related to runoff is soil moisture which impacts the catchment runoff response at the field and headwater scale soil moisture also affects the partitioning of latent and sensible heat fluxes and hence evapotranspiration su et al 2003 soil moisture is generally measured in the field at point scale using soil moisture probes or soil samples and oven baking the field based approach can be expensive tedious time consuming and does not account for regional spatial variability remote sensing relative evaporation and land surface hydrological modelling provide an alternative way to obtain spatial estimates soil moisture nicolai 2015 mousa and shu 2020 myeni et al 2019 land surface models currently provide soil moisture products globally and regionally e g gldas rodell et al 2004 land surface models often couple the land surface exchange processes surface hydrology and vadose zone processes rodell et al 2004 meng and quiring 2008 and cai et al 2014 lo 2018 hydrological models are also available to simulate rainfall runoff processes and to predict soil moisture examples of such hydrological models include the variable infiltration capacity model vic soil and water assessment tool swat topmodel and hydrologysca byrans vattenbalnavdelning hbv liang et al 1994 beven 1984 hornberger et al 1985 bergstrm 1995 fu et al 2018 topmodel is a topographic based hydrological model that uses topographic derivatives such as slope and topographic position that serve as important hydrological drivers kirkby and chorley 1967 gallant and wilson 1996 variations in topography affect different hydrological processes such as infiltration which influence soil moisture content and runoff generation dunne 1978 wolock and price 1994 thus the application of this model for floodplain soil moisture simulation in different model versions topmodel has been applied in more than 40 countries all over the world it has been applied to countries with such different climatic conditions as for example sweden zimbabwe india colombia and united kingdom beven 1984 hornberger et al 1985 quinn and beven 1993 robson et al 1993 albek et al 2004 gumindoga 2010 muhammed 2012 however few studies exist on application of the model in floodplains such as the zambezi basin with the increasing availability of remote sensing data there is now established in literature the sound ability to estimate evapotranspiration from satellite data a number of evapotranspiration algorithms have been developed for this purpose including the surface energy balance technique sebs su 2002 the surface energy balance algorithm for land sebal bastiaanssen et al 1998 and the mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration metric allen et al 2007 these algorothims estimate actual evapotranspiration which is often difficult to measure using an energy balance framework each model has its own conceptualizations and simplifications of the diffusive evapotranspiration process based on the temperature gradient between the ground and air differences are in the manner in which resistances and wet and dry limits are conceptualized a number of studies has shown that the application satellite evapotranspiration algorithms can be used to estimate actual evapotranspiration rwasoka et al 2011 applied the sebs algorithm to estimate actual evapotranspiration in the upper manyame subcatchment in zimbabwe shoko et al 2016 also applied the sebs algorithm in south west zimbabwe and underscored the role of satellite et estimation in semi arid areas shoko et al 2016 estimated actual evaporation in the umngeni catchment in south africa using landsat 8 and modis satellite products landsat 8 products showed relatively a good performance in evaporation prediction furthermore gokoo et al 2016 applied sebs to estimate spatially variable evaporation and applied a a gap filling technique to result in a poor performing sebs output on the other hand su et al 2003 proposed a theory and method of estimating soil moisture in the rootzone using relative evaporation used the derivation of sebs algorithm in su 2002 to estimatethe relative evaporation using sensible heat flux and its value at the wet and dry limit the derivation is useful because of the already tested efficacy is using remote sensing for actual evapotranspiration estimation however the method has not been applied a lot and still needs to be tested therefore in this study the ability of sebs and topmodel to estimate spatio temporal soil moisture variation iwas assessed the objectives of this study are i to estimate the spatial temporal variation of soil moisture in the mbire district as inferred from the sebs driven relative evaporation ii to calibrate the rainfall runoff model topmodel with hydro meteorological data for soil moisture prediction in the mbire district hydrological catchments iii to analyse and apply geo statistical tools to interpolate point based measurements of soil moisture along the major tributaries of the zambezi basin in the mbire district and compare outputs against sebs and topmodel based simulations and iv to evaluate land for flood recession crop farming in the district 2 description of study area the mbire district is located between 30 60ᵒ and 31 20ᵒ east and 15 60ᵒ and 16 40ᵒ south and it covers an area of approximately 4700 km2 see fig 1 the study area is characterized by floodplains of the zambezi river basin at an average altitude of 400 m above mean sea level the basin is drained by the rivers mwanzamutanda angwa manyame musengezi and kadzi rivers lgda 2009 and gumindoga et al 2018 mbire district lies in zimbabwe s natural agro ecological region iv the climate is dry tropical with low and very variable annual rainfalls of approximately

of the district is characterized by calcic solonetz soils and these soils are sodic fao 1996 lgda 2009 dube 2001 the main soil types in the basin are the acid leached out tropical soils of low fertility commonly known as red soils which are easily degradable and erodible promoting the occurrence of gullies 3 methodology fig 2 shows the flow chart diagram of the methodology section 3 1 data

agricultural technical and extension services of zimbabwe agritex data on precipitation wind speed relative humidity and temperature at two meters height was obtained from the stations www wunderground com http weather online com and nasa covering the period of 2008 2013 this period corresponds to insitu based soil moisture data available 3 1 2 data on physical properties of soils a total of 54 soil sampling sites were located at a 5 km stretch along transects in the major tributaries of zambezi river in mbire district that are manyame angwa and musengezi euclidean distances from the river channels at most 1000 m elevation and site accessibility were the main factors that were considered in locating these sampling sites both systematic and stratified sampling was implemented fig 3 shows how the sampling points were located soil moisture data was obtained through sampling and laboratory analysis several soil characteristics should be evaluated to determine soil suitability for farming the primary factors are soil moisture relationships toxicity fertility depth to gravel and cobble continuing layer and the erosion hazard zone 2019 therefore for this study soil type soil drainage soil depth of 10 100 cm obstacle to roots of crops impermeable layer phase and texture classes were used in determination of soil moisture and physical properties to determine the field capacity values the soil water characteristic software soil water characteristics version 6 02 74 was used together with soil particle size distribution particle density which is the mass of the soil particles mineral grains in a given volume is determined as the mass of the soil divided by the volume of the mineral grains only particle density is used with bulk density data to calculate the porosity of a soil a value of 2 65 g cm 3 was assumed for most soils bulk density was determined by dividing the mass of a sample dried for 24 h or more at 105 c by the volume porosity is given by subtracting the ratio of the bulk density to the particle density from one 3 1 3 discharge data daily discharge data for c64 and c68 flow gauging stations on manyame and musengezi river respectively

sebs determined evapotranspiration estimated evapotranspiration from sebs was validated using e pan evaporation data from the study area the derived potential evapotranspiration was used to cross reference the actual evapotranspiration simulated by sebs and topmodel gibson et al 2011 3 3 deriving potential maximum wetness pmw from the sampling sites physical properties of the top soil in the study area were analysed in a soil physical laboratory to determine the field capacity values soil particle size distribution for the 54 sampling stations was determined and used to retrieve field capacity using soil water characteristic software soil water characteristics version 6 02 74 by saxton 2004 for particle density value of 2 65 g cm 3 was assumed for most soils core method was used to determine the bulk density of the soil for the 54 sampling stations the bulk density value was determined by dividing the mass of a sample dried for 24 h or more at 105 c by the volume to determine soil porosity for each of the 54 sampling sites the following formula was used 9 1 b d p d where porosity bd bulk density and pd particle density potential soil wetness map for the study area was derived from field capacity and porosity using the following relationship 10 θ w e t θ f c 2 where θ f c field capacity θwet water content at limiting case taken as porosity of the soil this potential maximum wetness limiting value has also been shown to be approximated to a midpoint between the field capacity and the total water capacity porosity by wagner et al 1999a point based potential maximum wetness was up scaled by interpolation using the inverse distance weighting finally the pmw was used to down scale sebs outputs to 30 m 30 m pixel resolution and infer soil moisture from relative evapotranspiration as a product of pmw and relative evapotranspiration 3 4 determining spatial and temporal soil moisture variation using topmodel 3 4 1 dem hydro processing an advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer aster dem 30 m resolution covering the study area was retrieved free of charge from the website of the global aster gdem http www gdem aster ersdac or jp i removal filling of sinks the fill sinks operation removes local depressions according to maathuis and wang 2006 the height value of a single pixel depression is raised to the smallest value of the neighbours of a single pixel depression and height values of a local depression consisting of multiple pixels are raised to the lowest value of a pixel that is adjacent to the outlet for the depression and that would discharge into the initial depression hengl et al 2007 this will ensure that flow direction will be found for every pixel in the map ii flow determination flow direction was computed using the d8 algorithm ilwis software which can take eight different directional values expressed as degrees or as numeric codes the d8 method is more applicable to delineation of the drainage network for drainage areas with well developed channels garbrecht and martz 1999 iii network and catchment extraction the dem hydroprocessing algorithm in ilwis was used extract drainage network from the filled dem flow direction and flow accumulation order the drainage network and to extract desired catchments on which three desired catchments for mbire district were extracted basing on the location of upstream flow gauging stations 3 4 2 preparation of topmodel inputs i the topographic index ti file in this study the topographic index ti for each subcatchment was calculated from 30 m 30 m aster dem using the following formulae in ilwis 3 3 academic software 11 t i l n a t a n b where a flow accumulation pixel area slopedeg slope in degrees the maximum and minimum value of these topographic index distribution values were reclassified in to different classes to fit in the limitation of less than or equal to 30 classes of the topmodel program available tabular

soil hydraulic conductivity decay parameter m was estimated by recession curve analysis from historical river discharge data the parameter m is simply the reciprocal of the slope of the curve of base flows against time ambroise et al 1996 beven 1997a b the fractional area and its distance from the outlet as well as channel velocity were used as inputs as to estimate flow travel time used in the flow routing procedure of the model class gumindoga et al 2011 2014 to estimate most critical parameter in root zone soil moisture prediction the maximum root zone storage srrmax weighted average catchment soil available water capacity were used fao iiasa isric isscas jrc 2008 3 4 4 topmodel calibration the model was calibrated basing on three parameters using knowledge obtained from the following literature beven and kirkby 1979 beven et al 1995 beven 1997a b 2001 beven and freer 2000 gumindoga et al 2011 muhammed 2012 of which parameters is most sensitive these are the soil hydraulic conductivity decay parameter m and the soil transmissivity at saturation t0 an average root zone available water capacity srmax was used for each sub catchment a time step of 24 h was selected for computations to calibrate the model the value of parameter m was varied holding values of remaining four parameters at initial value and value of parameter m was determined which yield the highest efficiency this method was repeated for remaining parameters to arrive at a set of parameters which gave highest value of efficiency the final calibration for the years 2008 2010 was performed by changing topmodel parameters manually to optimize model performance for each model run after each run two objective indices of goodness of fit were used for model performance evaluation 3

using performance indicators the performance indicators used in this study are the nash sutcliffe efficiency ns nash and sutcliffe 1970 and percent bias pbias the percentage difference of runoff pdq

moisture content in a gis environment for comparison purposes 3 5 point based soil measurement gravimetric method and interpolation a hand auger was used to collect samples at a depth of 0 25 0 5 m from 54 sampling sites the depth for sampling were chosen based on the rooting depths of the various crops grown in the flood plain which range from 0 2 m for maize to 0 5 m for leguminous plants since these are the most common crops grown in the study area at each sampling site four subsamples were collected and mixed to form a composite sample composite samples of approximately 200 g was collected at each site in a sealed container to preserve the moisture the procedure was repeated once per month for the months march 2013 april 2013 may 2013 june 2013 and july 2013 the moisture content was determined in the laboratory using the gravimetric method as described by western et al 2002 and sandor 2008 the resultant gravimetric soil moisture content was converted to volumetric water content by multiplying it by bulk density point based soil moisture measurements were up scaled using the inverse distance weighting idw techniqueand compared to sebs and topmodel derived soil moisture the cross tool in ilwis was used to allow pixel to pixel comparison regression analysis and two paired t test was used to test for difference between spatial soil moisture outputs in spss software at p 0 05 3 6 land evaluation for flood recession crop cultivation for mbire district the essence of land evaluation is to compare or match the requirements of each potential land use with the characteristics of each land unit the result of land evaluation is a measure of the suitability of each land unit for a given land use these suitability assessments are then examined in the light of economic social and environmental considerations in order to develop an actual land use plan generally flood recession farming land is situated in flood plain at very low vertical height from river channel at flat slope less than 2 and on soils with high water holding capacity and high plant available capacity oku et al 2007 ma et al 2007 jia et al 2007 in mbire district flooding is mainly influenced by high stream flows and back flows from the zambezi river due to its geographical location and kariba dam and cabora bassa dam operations crop cultivation in flood plain must be situated as far as possible from sensitive areas such as water bodies and river bed channel because of environmental implications and from protected areas and parks as a result there are minimum requirements used to identify the most suitable land and exclude certain land 3 6 1 derivation and preparation of datasets i distance calculation the distance allocation tool in arcgis spatial analyst tools was used to allocate euclidean distance of each pixel from stream network derived from dem hydro processing the distance operation assigns to each pixel the smallest distance to the nearest channel the output is called a distance map ii height above channel flow accumulation drainage network and filled aster dem 30 m resolution was used to derive the channel base elevations in ilwis 3 3 academic the channel base elevations were then interpolated to form a channel height layer that if subtracted from the dem produces the vertical distance to the closest channel of each location in the study area murwira and schmidt murwira 2005 the vertical height above the nearest channel was then determined by subtracting the channel base height interpolation from the original dem 17 k v r where k is height above channel v is elevation dem and r is channel height iii landcover use classes a landsat tm satellite image of the 02 07 2012 was used to determine landuse and land cover within the mbire district landsat tm images were used because of their relatively high spatial resolution 30 m and their wide application for landcover classification across the world lillesand and kiefer 2000 chen and vierling 2004 masek and vermote 2006 landsat has the optimal ground resolution and spectral bands to efficiently maximum likelihood supervised classification method was used because it dichotomizes the area into the following main classes forest woodland mixed shrub and grassland grassland water bodies and cropland and open ground maximum likelihood classification assumes that the statistics for each class in each band are normally distributed and calculates the probability that a given pixel belongs to a specific class lucas and janssen 2002 for land classification validation ground control points using global positioning system gps were taken from different landuse cover classes include grassland agricultural fields water and forest the error matrix was used to quantify the level of error from the correct or actual measurements on the ground to assess the accuracy of an image classification error matrix confusion matrix was calculated to determine the accuracy of the classification and to identify where misclassification occurs the overall average accuracy of the classified landuse land cover map for 2012 was 88 11 which is excellent iv slope the digital elevation model fill was used to calculate height differences in x and y direction using linear filter operation in ilwis to calculate a slope map in percentages from height differences equation 56 was used 18

spatio temporal soil moisture variation developed from sebs and topmodel was combined to one thematic layer for use in the suitability analysis evaluation for flood recession crop cultivation 3 6 2 deriving suitability map model builder in arcgis spatial analyst was used to reclassify all the derived datasets into desired three suitability classes using the criteria reclassifying was done to combine the four layers in their present form a weighted overlay tool was used to combine the five coded layers all classes of zeros were assigned to restricted scale values which are areas that are not suitable for flood recession farming each reclassified layer was assigned to a percentage of influence weight suitability map was obtained after running the model 4 results and discussion 4 1 determination of spatio temporal soil moisture variation using sebs fig 4 shows the spatio temporal variation of actual evapotranspiration for the whole mbire district as observed on 28 march 2013 and 16 april 2013 the northen part of the district has high values of eta 4 mm day for the 28th of march 2013 as compared to the southern and western parts for 16 april 2013 overal results shows that actual evapotranspiration in the distict varies in space and in time validation of sebs evapotranspiration was done using pan evaporation data from cabora bassa on which sebs evapotranspiration pixel was compared to pan evaporation from the same pixel fig 5 shows that there is very good relationship between pan evaporation and sebs retrieved evapotranspiration r2 0 8442 thus based on the strong coefficient of determination r² between pan evaporation and sebs eta the sebs algorithm can be used to estimate evapotranspiration in data scarce catchments fig 6 shows the spatial variation of relative evaporation in the mbire district just like actual evaptraspiration relative evaporation varies in space and in time low values of relative evaporation were observed in densely forested areas compared to grassland this may be due to that available energy is partitioned into the sensible heat flux and the latent heat dense forest covered areas which have high values of displacement heights and roughness heights for heat transfer the aerodynamic resistance becomes low su 1999 this in combination with higher difference in the surface air temperature leads to high values of the instantaneous heat flux only to be limited by the dry sensible heat limit rwasoka 2010 this in turn leads to low relative evaporation values and the daily evaporation and the evaporative fraction values will become low as a result the soil moisture values will also be low fig 7 shows the spatial variation of potential maximum wetness expressed as percent volumetric water content for angwa and manyame river study sites high potential maximum wetness was observed for manyame sampling site compared to the other two sites the potential maximum wetness is mainly affected by soil texture soils with high proportion of clay particles have high water holding capacity due to high volume of microspores fractional soil particle distribution analysis that was conducted during the research showed that manyame sampling site have high clay particle fraction compared to the other two sampling site hence high potential maximum wetness for all sampling sites high potential maximum wetness were observed close to the river channel due to clay deposition by flooding fig 7 show the spatial potential maximum wetness variation of two sampling sites in this research top soil moisture retrieval was attempted from remote sensing methods developed for estimation of surface turbulent fluxes sebs model was explored to retrieve soil moisture using the relation between evapotranspiration and soil moisture the average of the porosity and the field caacity was considered for the potential wetness capacity of the top soil the result of the relative evaporation from the sebs algorithm was multiplied by the average of the porosity and the field capacity to get the soil moisture figs 8 and 9 shows soil moisture obtained from objective one fig 9 shows that there is temporal variability in soil moisture as there is an overall decrease in soil moisture from march 2013 to july 2013 there is a uniform decrease in average soil moisture for all sampling sites except for musengezi sampling site for the period 10 05 2013 13 7 2013 were there is a slight decrease in soil moisture this is explained by the effect of cabora bassa back throw as observed from the zinwa gauging station c109 levels and from point based soil measurements close to the river channel 4 2 soil moisture simulation using topmodel 4 2 1 dem hydro processing fig 10 shows delineated sub catchments and the inputs into the topographic index such as filled corrected dem flow direction and flow accumulation are shown for musengezi river sub catchment as computed from dem hydro processing algorithm 4 2 2 the spatial variation of the topographic index the topographic index map and the histogram for the topographic index ln a tanβ of the musengezi river sub catchment derived from aster dem is shown in fig 11 higher topographic indices are found in the central and northern part of the basin especially in and around the streams the highest number of pixels is found in the topographic index of 11 lower tanβ values indicate lower hydraulic gradient and more accumulation of water the areas with higher ln a tanβ imply a higher degree of wetness thus more soil moisture contents by higher upslope contributing areas this is consistent with topmodel s demonstrated principles of hillslope hydrology in which locations with large upslope contributing areas and low surface gradients maintain higher soil moisture levels than locations that are steep or have a small upslope contributing areas band and peterson 1991 4 2 3 runoff calibration results for manyame and angwa river sub catchments the available data for the calibration and validation was all in all 4 years long starting october 01 2008 and ending july 31 2013 the first run and calibration of the simulation for all sub catchments was done for the period starting october 01 2008 and ending september 30 2010 final calibration was only done for manyame and angwa river sub catchments validation and root zone soil moisture simulation using the optimised parameters was done for the period october 01 2011 july 31 2013 the optimised model parameter obtained from final calibration for the parameters specified in section 3 5 5 and their corresponding nash sutcliffe s coefficient of efficiency nse value and percent bias pbias for manyame and angwa river sub catchments are shown in table 2 figs 12 and 13 show the comparison between simulated and observed flows for manyame river sub catchment the simulated runoff curve performed well particularly for the low flows the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse indicates an acceptable with very good match nse 0 757 and 0 801 for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments respectively krause and boyle 2005 willmott and robeson 2011 while the percent bias pbias pbias 10 45 and 5 5623 for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments respectively shows an acceptable performance this combination of performance indicators were the best found during the calibration exercise and the model was used to simulate flows this allowed the transfer of model parameters for soil simulation 4 2 4 runoff validation results for manyame and angwa river sub catchments figs 14 and 15 shows the comparison between simulated and observed flows for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments from 1 oct 2011 31 july 2013 the three 3 higher flows observed varies from 16 5932 m³ s 21 4563 m³ s and 23 4045 m³ s and were recorded on 05 jan 2012 21 feb 2012 and 22 feb 2013 for the validation period the simulated runoff curve follows the same trend as the observed curve table 3 shows the difference in magnitude and lead time of the five simulated flows high flows are under estimated 19 8 24 5 being the global average under estimation the lead time the time between when a forecast is made and the forecasted event occurs vary from 2 to 2 days with an overall average of 0 2 days which is good for forecasting soil moisture the under and overestimation of the peaks base flow and recession limbs in both the final calibration and validation process are not entirely due to the modelling errors but could be due to data errors and the spatial distribution of rainfall this is because four of the five weather stations used in the thiessen polygon rainfall estimation method was outside the study area thus could have an impact on the simulated discharge or the observed runoff which was converted from water levels using unreliable rating curves the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse indicates an acceptable with very good match nse 0 765 and 0 81 for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments respectively while the percent bias pbias pbias 9 54 and 6 03 for manyame river and angwa river sub catchments respectively shows an acceptable performance after validation as in table 4 4 2 5 the spatial variation of soil moisture using topmodel the aim of running and calibrating the hydrological modelling was to compare the outputs of the soil moisture from this model with the results found in the sebs approach and the measured values from the point based observations gravimetric measurements on catchment level for musengezi river subcatchment the simulated discharge is not in good agreement with the observed discharge and hence no comparison could be made for the subcatchment this is due to the fact that levels from zinwa gauging station c109 overestimate discharge due to cabora bassa water back throw fig 16 shows that topmodel simulated spatial soil moisture varies temporarily and spatially with high values near the angwa river channel fig 17 shows that low soil moisture values were simulated for angwa sampling site compared to manyame sampling site this is mainly because of high topographic index in the later sampling site simulated soil moisture is decreasing with time 4 3 upscaled point based soil measurements 4 3 1 analysis of point based soil measurements figs 18 and 19 shows the moisture content variation with distance from the musengezi river sampling site at chidodo and manyame river sampling site at chikafa the results show that the moisture content decreased with distance from the flood plain at musengezi high moisture content values were obtained during the month of march 2013 for all sampling stations across the flood plain with station 1 having the highest due to its closeness to the river channel a peak in soil in soil moisture content was observed in june 2013 at sampling station 1 for all transect at musengezi river sampling site due to cabora bassa back flows explained by high water levels for that months at zinwa c109 gauging station residual soil moisture at musengezi is mainly due to combination of high stream flow floods and back flows from zambezi river figs 17 and 18 clearly shows that soil moisture in the flood plain decrease with increase in distance from the river channel at manyame for transect three sampling station one near the river channel recorded the highest soil moisture content throughout the study period and low values were from station four furthest from the river channel the soil moisture at manyame decreased gradually for all the stations compared to musengezi this site is because this site is not affected by back flows from cabora bassa as the later site high soil residual soil moisture at manyame sampling site is mainly influence high stream flow and soil type which are rich in clay content and the effect of back throw which are experienced during peak discharge in manyame river angwa sampling site recorded the least soil moisture values this is due to that the sampling site does not experience back throw and the soils have poor water holding capacity compared to manyame sampling site where the effect of back throw is less residual soil moisture at this site is mainly influenced by high stream fig 20 shows upscaled ground based measurements and their mean pixel soil moisture for all sampling sites and soil moisture outputs of sebs and topmodel fig 21 4 3 2 comparison of soil moisture outputs from sebs and topmodel to ground based measurements in this research top soil moisture retrieval was attempted from remote sensing methods developed for estimation of surface turbulent fluxes and the rainfall runoff modelling approach topmodel fig 22 a shows a scatter plot comparing pixel based soil moisture values retrieved using remote sensing sebs to direct method gravimetric method as seen from the scatter there is a strong positive linear relationship between the gravimetric measured soil moisture and the remote sensing derived soil moisture values as explained by high values of the coefficient of determination r2 0 885 and an average of r2 0 796 for all sampling sites sebs underestimated soil moisture especially at dense vegetation this mainly due that instantaneous sensible heat flux in sebs is limited between the dry and the wet limits of the sensible heat flux su 1999 therefore sebs can be used to estimate spatial soil moisture variation in grasslands accurately fig 22 b shows a scatter plot comparing soil moisture values simulated by topmodel to ground based measured soil moisture gravimetric method as shown by the scatter there is fair relation in spatial variation of sm between the measured soil moisture and the topmodel derived soil moisture values as explained by generally low values compared to sebs of the coefficient of determination r2 0 6434 and an average of r2 0 597 for manyame and angwa sampling sites also there is significant different between topmodel sm values and ground based observations for all sampling sites spatially and temporally paired t test 95 confidence interval p 0 05 all p values were less than 0 05 hence we reject the reject null hypothesis the spatial and temporal variation of soil moisture in mbire district is influenced by high stream flows and floods topmodel was not able to accurately predict the soil moisture in the flood plain due to the effect of back flows from zambezi river may be under estimation was due to the modelling errors of it could be due to data errors and the spatial distribution of rainfall this is because four of the five weather stations used in the thiessen polygon rainfall estimation method was outside the study area thus could have an impact on the simulated discharge 4 4 results for land evaluation for floodplain agriculture fig 23 shows the suitability map provided in this report provide crucial information to farmers in mbire district as it was derived using several scientific considerations to map optimum land for flood recession farming in deriving the map environmental implication of river bank cultivation was considered by creating a buffer zone which is critical to soil and water recourses degradation for the district suitable areas occupy an area of 188 km2 moderately suitable areas occupy an area of 110 km2 whereas unsuitable areas occupy an area of 4 386 km2 suitable and moderately areas are close to the main drainage channels where floodplains occur fig 24 5 discussion the main goal of this study was to model the spatio temporal soil moisture variation along the major tributaries of zambezi river in the mbire district zimbabwe a new approach is presented to estimate soil moisture with freely available modis derived satellite based surface energy balance sebs techniques a topographic driven rainfall runoff model topmodel is successfully calibrated to simulate variable soil moisture remote sensing is recommended for frequent and continuous monitoring of floodplains as it has the ability to provide rapid information on the spatio temporal variability of soil moisture sebs algorithms are generally best fit to derive evapotranspiration and soil moisture variability the findings of this research show that there is a strong relationship r2 0 796 between upscaled ground soil moisture measurements and remote sensing methods sebs for the period of march to july 2013 the study further revealed that there is a fair relationship r2 0 60 between upscaled ground soil moisture measurements and hydrological modelling topmodel the study is consistent with the findings of li et al 2019 who revealed that the inﬂuencing factors of the spatial temporal variation of soil moisture could be influenced by some hydrological processes the study is also relevant to profile 2016 who alluded that flood recession farming is practiced in floodplains wetlands inland valleys and lake banks in several parts of west africa farmers derive benefits from seasonal floods that simultaneously bring both moisture and fertility to soils along the river banks future studies should explore other methods beyond the sebs and topmodel used to simulate soil moisture variability in the study area a particular challenge for this model is the application to semi arid regions because of high variability in rainfall and potential data quality problems however it is useful that future studies could use ensemble and hybrid models to model soil moisture variability the results across the study region indicate that the areas near the tributaries are suitable for recession farming from the results of this study mbire district have a total area of about 4684 km2 and about 6 3 is suitable to moderately suitable for flood recession farming most suitable land is located close to the zambezi river due to the effect of back flows on residual soil moisture accumulation vertical height above channel was one of the important factors in deriving the suitability map as it defines areas that are prone to high stream flows and flooding comparing the suitability map to current land use cover 50 percent of the potential suitable to moderately suitable land is being utilised for crop production this is in line with studies that project soil moisture with a high degree of spatial heterogeneity the study on the spatial variability and the driving factors of soil moisture in different scales is a significant part of the soil moisture and hydrological model and its scale deduction and the forecast factor choice in the construction process of mid long term forecast model which thus has become one of the international research hotspots weng et al 2018 6 conclusions and recommendations 6 1 conclusions the sebs algorithm developed with freely available satellite images gives reasonably good estimates of spatial and temporal variation of catchment level top soil moisture and therefore can be used in soil moisture monitoring and water resourcs management this is based on the validationand comparison with fifty four ground based soil moisture sampling sites this study demonstrated that the rainfall runoff model with calibration results ns 0 797 pbias 10 45 and validation results ns 0 765 pbias 6 03 can be extended beyond its original design of using the topographic index for predicting local variations in water table see kirkby 1975 the model in this study was used to simulate soil moisture variations in the mbire district whereby soil moisture levels increases towards the flood plain and river confluences the suitability map for floodplain cultivation in this work provides crucial information to farmers and all stakeholders for proper water resources planning and decision making in mbire district as it was derived using several scientific considerations to map optimum land for flood recession farming 6 2 recommendations there in need to improve the gauging of rivers in the district as to integrate hydrological models and remote sensing methods and ground measurements in soil moisture monitoring and even to validate hydrological models and remote sensing against ground measurements by establishing automatic loggers future research should measure hydraulic properties of soils since they play an important role in movement of soil moisture from the land surface to the water table through the unsaturated zone and hence affect the runoff and groundwater recharge processes future application of topmodel in the study should incorporate remote sensed meteorological data and move to a fully distributed approach

8303,study region the lakes basin is located in the main ethiopian rift it covers the northern part of the rift valley basin the upper awash river basin and some sub basins from the omo river basin due to the presence of high fluoride f content natural contamination of groundwater has long been recognized as a water related health issue in the area study focus a multidisciplinary research effort including geological hydrogeological hydro chemical and geophysical investigations was adopted to understand the 3d hydrogeological conceptual model and to evaluate f enrichment in groundwater new hydrological insights for the region the 3d hydrogeological conceptual model shows a complex hydrogeological environment and a clear hydraulic interconnection between different aquifers the geological setting has deeply influenced the geometry of the aquifers recharge and discharge areas and f enrichment in groundwater two hydrogeological units namely sedimentary and volcanic multi aquifers were identified the analyses of groundwater circulation flow paths and distribution of f concentrations in each aquifer were conducted in groundwater the concentration of fluoride varies from 0 1 to 68 9 mg l 1 in surface water it ranges from 0 6 to 244 2 mg l 1 fluoride concentration of 62 of the water samples analyzed exceeded the 1 5 mg l 1 who threshold for fluoride concentration in drinking water the proposed methodological approach has been demonstrated to be a powerful tool that could be applied in other similar areas keywords main ethiopian rift mer fluoride pollution groundwater management 3d hydrogeological conceptual model geophysical surveys 1 introduction at least 44 of the population in sub saharan africa approximately 320 million people do not have access to clean and reliable water supplies jmp 2004 macdonald et al 2008 ghiglieri and carletti 2010 the majority of those without access to clean water approximately 85 live in rural areas where the consequent poverty and ill health severely affect women and children jmp 2004 macdonald et al 2008 in these areas groundwater plays a central role pietersen 2005 davies 2008 the unregulated and rapidly increasing groundwater exploitation is one of the major problems in water resources management ghiglieri and carletti 2010 in addition the problem is exacerbated by natural water contamination due to high fluoride f content alemayehu 2010 ghiglieri et al 2010 and 2012 ayenew 2018 some of the highest fluoride contents in groundwater ever recorded in the world have been found in the east african rift system ears with the concentrations of up to 68 9 mg l 1 in ethiopia and even more than 100 mg l 1 in tanzania alemayehu 2010 mckenzie et al 2010 for this reason fluoride has long been recognized as a water related health concern in ethiopia fluoride problems are largely found in groundwater from active volcanic zones where fluorine is derived from volcanic rocks and associated geothermal activities alemayehu 2010 ghiglieri et al 2010 and 2012 ayenew 2018 these high fluoride contents are ascribed to geological processes including thermal springs groundwater flow through rocks with fluorite and apatite minerals and volcanic activity ghiglieri et al 2012 delcamp et al 2016 reported various water evolutionary trends in volcanic aquifers they emphasize that many changes in hydrogeological conditions strongly influence fluoride dynamics for a mature volcano it is reasonable to first address the geochemical association of f with the hydrogeological and geological setting to understand these dynamics and prior to the development of groundwater facilities the capability of project should be confirmed through a hydrogeological conceptual model of the area based on geological information geophysical data aquifer and hydrogeochemical properties xue et al 2004 tam et al 2014 during the last few years the techniques in three dimensional 3d hydrogeological model reconstruction and visualization have been tested and applied as an effective approach ghiglieri et al 2016 and references therein butscher et al 2017 combining different datasets e g geological hydrogeological and geophysical the thickness depth lateral facies extent stratigraphy and geometry of aquifers can be exhibited using 3d visualization software to produce block diagrams and slice maps this offers a better and more reliable

flowered project de fluoridation technologies for improving quality of water and agro animal products along the east african rift valley in the context of adaptation to climate change www floweredproject com 2 description of the study area 2 1 geographic climatic and physiographic setting the study area is located in the main ethiopian rift mer and extends between latitudes 6 50 n and 8 37 n and longitudes 38 27 e and 39 40 e fig 1 it covers a rhomboidal area of approximately 30 000 km2 where the elevation ranges between 1600 and 2500 m above sea level it covers the northern part of the rift valley basin the upper awash river basin and some sub basins from the omo river basin more specifically in this work the lake ziway area has been selected for comprehensive studies as it is characterized by the most interesting hydrogeological and hydrochemical features within the overall study area as well as the availability of an already existing comprehensive dataset the lake ziway watershed covers approximately 7300 km2 including the rift valley floor the escarpment areas two major river inlets ketar and meki rivers and one river outlet bulbula river the area can be divided into three physiographic zones the rift transitional escarpments and rift shoulders the topography of the area is strongly controlled by geology volcanism and faulting and erosion the mer is a broad depression bounded by discontinuous border faults tectonics and volcanic activities became restricted to the narrow axial zone during the quaternary boccaletti et al 1999 giving rise to grabens half grabens and horsts corti 2009 2012 this morphology provides suitable pathway for the circulation and storage of surface water and groundwater fed by numerous rivers flowing towards the rift floor there are also numerous perennial streams restricted to the rift valley the largest being the awash river all rift lakes receive recharge from both rain and groundwater whereas some lakes such as abijata and shalla do not have groundwater outflow alemayehu et al 2006 kebede et al 2008 the rift is also characterized by wetlands that are sustained by groundwater alemayehu 2010 the climate is warm and precipitation mostly occurs during summer and persists from mid june to mid september whereas scanty rainfall may also occur during march april and may the average annual temperature is 19 3 c in ziway with an annual average rainfall of 837 mm alemayehu 2010 the driest month is december with precipitation going as low as 6 mm in the region the water most commonly used by residents for drinking and domestic use is that from springs and wells 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the rift is bordered by the escarpments that separate its floor from the adjacent plateaus the rift floor hosts several lakes volcanoes and calderas the development of the ears in ethiopia began with the eruption of continental flood basins between 30 and 29 my wolfenden et al 2004 followed by faulting in the north and south which propagated towards the central part of the rift this major tectono magmatic event which altered the configuration of the landscape has also entirely changed the region s hydrological setting the study area is almost exclusively covered by acid to basic volcanic rocks lacustrine and alluvial sediments quaternary lacustrine and alluvial sediments occupy the low lying flat to gently sloping grabens and half grabens late pliocene and quaternary volcanic rocks dominate the escarpment zone and low lying rift wolde gabriel et al 1990 abebe et al 2007 quaternary acidic centers erupted pyroclastic products and lavas located mainly along the active rift axis named the wonji fault belt kebede et al 2008 associated with those localized basaltic flows and aligned monogenetic basaltic cones are observed trippanera et al 2015 precambrian and mesozoic rocks are locally exposed in the kella area western margin under a thick oligocene and pliocene volcanic rocks sequence the main aquifer systems are typically fractured and or weathered volcanics or weathered contact zones between different lithological units these aquifers are often confined or semi confined aquifers with relatively high permeability are found in sediments covering parts of the rift floor the permeability of rocks in the mer is medium 4 10 4 ms 1 although there is considerable local variation alemayehu 2010 indeed geological events have deeply influenced the geometry of the aquifers recharge and discharge areas and groundwater quality rocks are laterally discontinuous aquifer composition is heterogeneous and aquifer hydrodynamic characteristics are variable kebede et al 2008 therefore the connection between the volcanic volcano lacustrine and alluvial aquifers along with volcanic highland aquifers pose significant challenges because of the complex nature of groundwater flow recharge and geochemical evolution in these aquifers due to the presence of faults and volcanic activity geothermal activity is manifested by the occurrence of hot springs fumaroles boiling pools hot and steaming grounds closely associated with quaternary volcanoes in the axis of the rift ayenew 2008 hot springs also occur on the flanks of the rift where they are associated with peripheral faults as reported by ayenew 2008 the volcanic centers are characterized by geothermal manifestations and are aligned along the tectonically active fault system called the wonji fault belt wfb 3 material and methods literature review and direct field surveys are the input data sources for the present research fig 2 reports the conceptual workflow of the methodological approach developed herein according to a method already applied in previous research ghiglieri et al 2016 dodagoudar 2018 and used for the construction of the geological and hydrogeological 3d model and to understand f enrichment in groundwater literature data e g papers reports and maps were verified and homogenized the consulted data are different in terms of nomenclature colors and degree of differentiation of the lithological units geological stratigraphic tectonics hydrogeology and so on and then loaded into the database field surveys were performed to acquire new datasets using a multidisciplinary approach integrating geology geophysics hydrogeology hydrochemistry and isotopes 3 1 stratigraphic analysis geological cross sections and data handling preliminary geological information was obtained from previous studies geological map of the northern main ethiopian rift scale 1 200 000 abebe et al 2005 whereas detailed mapping has been carried out during the present research fig 3 stratigraphic data have been gathered from stratigraphic well logs papers abebe et al 2005 agostini et al 2011 or previous projects and unpublished work a great effort was made to homogenize all the geological stratigraphic and tectonic information and to convert the data into hydrogeological features as a second step several geological sections were constructed and the area around lake ziway was selected for the 3d hydrogeological model as it represents one of the most interesting hydrogeological and hydrochemical features in the study area six geological cross sections selected from a set of twelve drawn at 1 200 000 scale were used for the reconstruction of the geological model and three of them ran perpendicular to the rift axis whereas the remaining three runs parallel two cross rift sections aa and bb extend from the western rift shoulder to the eastern one whereas the mm section ends at the center the three cross sections parallel to the rift axis run in the rift center ff and dd and in the eastern shoulder bb respectively fig 3 the geographic information system gis geodatabase was populated with all these data an arcgis tool arcgis exacto section v2 0 developed by the illinois state usa geological survey was used to process each geological cross section the move software package www mve com software move was used to verify the 3d consistency of the geological model it provides a powerful platform for data integration cross section construction and 3d model building each geological surface was modeled by the interpolation of the contour lines depths drawn considering the geological cross sections stratigraphic data and interpreted geophysical data 3 2 field surveys to supplement the data acquisition and interpretation described in the previous section geological geophysical hydrogeological and hydrochemical surveys were planned and executed 3 2 1 geophysical survey to better constrain the 3d geological model geophysical measurements such as classical electrical soundings ves schlumberger spread and controlled source audio magnetotelluric deep soundings csamt were carried out along two traverses the ziway butajira traverse on the southwest and the meki midrekebid traverse on the northeast as shown in fig 3 these traverses follow the major access roads and cross the western side of the rift from the escarpment to the rift floor an average sounding interval of 3 km was employed and each traverse was composed of two lines designated as line 1 on the southeast and line 2 on the northwest the electrical soundings were carried out with a maximum half current electrode spacing ab 2 of 1000 m and in the csamt electromagnetic sounding frequencies of 0 1 1000 hz were employed however we noticed that the resistivity pseudo sections obtained through the amt surveys are undoubtedly better than those obtained with the vertical electrical soundings and are more useful in the current work due to their greater depth of investigation therefore the whole interpretation was performed only based on the amt data 3 2 2 hydrogeological and hydrochemical data collection the selection of the water points of interest was carried out according to the following criteria i complete knowledge of the water points in terms of previous chemistry stratigraphic and hydrogeological information considering the fluoride values aquifer material depth of wells and water temperature ii wells containing at least the stratigraphic description iii homogeneous geographic distribution of water points and iv significant differences among various aquifers two sampling field surveys were conducted along mer to observe the potential seasonal chemical variations and the recharge water influence the 1st campaign was conducted during the dry season and the 2nd just after the rainy season the 1st survey included 56 water sampling points namely 34 boreholes 6 hand dug wells 11 springs 3 rivers and 2 lakes fig 3 the 2nd field survey was carried out along 47 of the 56 water points identified during the 1st campaign three additional points 1 hand dug well and 2 lakes were sampled as new water points leading to a total of 50 water points 27 boreholes 5 hand dug wells 11 springs 3 rivers and 4 lakes for the 2nd field survey constructive and technical data of each well were acquired at each water point location elevation and geographical coordinates using a differential global positioning system www trimble com moreover in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters ph temperature electrical conductivity and redox potential were performed using a hach hq40d multiparameter device water samples were collected for the analysis of fluoride and analyzed at the laboratory of the university of barcelona using a thermo fisher scientific orion high performance ion selective electrode 9609bnwp the precision of the analysis defined as the standard deviation 1σ of the corrected concentration measured in duplicate samples was better than 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 structural and geological setting the mer constitutes the northern part of the ears connecting the kenyan rift with the afar depression the mer started to develop during the miocene period davidson and rex 1980 wolde gabriel et al 1990 during the pliocene and quaternary it progressively deepened and faulted and magmatism became more confined to the narrow rift axis this rift segment is bounded by discontinuous border faults striking between nne ssw in the south and ne sw in the north korme et al 2004 the axial rift zone which developed in the quaternary is dominated by dense n s to nne ssw striking faults volcanism is characterized by bimodal basalt rhyolite association with localized occurrences of intermediate rocks however the volume of acidic rocks in the area significantly exceeds that of the basaltic rocks the rift is dominated by acidic centers with associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits as well as subordinate basalts erupted from fissures and monogenetic events in the geo hydrogeological map of the study area fig 3 the oldest unit is represented by a small sliver of precambrian rocks overlain by mesozoic sediments north of butajira eocene oligocene continental flood basalts related to the rift initiation are exposed in the southwestern part of the area mid upper miocene silicic rocks and basalts lie over older rocks on the western rift margin acidic and trachytic volcanic centers of the upper miocene pliocene age outcrop on both rift flanks the late pliocene pleistocene is dominated by extensive ignimbrite flows and the falls of the nazreth group which cover both the western and eastern escarpments the exposed thickness of this unit the basal part consisting of alternating basaltic lava flows and agglomerates reaches 300 m wolde gabriel et al 1990 this is overlain by another widespread ignimbrite flow of the pleistocene age covering most parts of the rift floor small highly eroded plio pleistocene acidic volcanoes associated with the nazreth group rocks occur in the northeastern part of the study area the pleistocene recent rhyolites constitute some of the youngest volcanic products of the study area and consist of rhyolite flows domes obsidians and pitchstones along with extensive ignimbrites tuffs and pumices they are associated with axial silicic volcanic centers a close spatial and temporal relationship between these silicic volcanoes and propagating faults accompanied or followed by basaltic eruptions from fissures and aligned monogenetic cones suggests that these centers guide deformation and subsequent eruptions abebe et al 2007 basaltic lavas cinder cones and maars occupy the rift floor and they belong to the pleistocene recent basalts their eruption history spans the entire quaternary period the youngest radiometric data showing an age of ca 200 years for basaltic flows sieburg et al 2018 the contemporaneous butajira volcanic field is restricted to a narrow marginal graben at the base of the western escarpment and is marked by nne ssw aligned cinder cones maars and some lava aprons the quaternary sediment units occupy grabens half grabens basal slopes of foot walls of faults and foot slopes of volcanic ranges these units consist of alluvial colluvial and lacustrine sands and silts mainly of volcanic origin calcrete hardpans intercalated with these sediments have significant impacts on water infiltration 4 2 geophysical data processing and interpretation field data were analyzed processed and interpreted to show the results in 2d resistivity sections first the geoelectrical sections were evaluated merely in geophysical terms and were then interpreted into geological and hydrogeological terms considering the knowledge of both surface and subsurface geology 4 3 ziway butajira transect line 1 and line 2 as previously reported the ziway butajira transect is composed of lines 1 and 2 the resistivity pseudo section of line 1 was obtained using seven amt soundings mt 1 to mt 7 as shown in fig 4 this pseudo section and the following ones show the subsurface apparent resistivity distribution to a depth of 1 km or more in the apparent resistivity field of ziway butajira line 1 two relatively high resistivity areas can be observed most likely the response of the massive basalt the first one develops laterally in the region beneath mt 3 for approximately 6 km and down to a depth of at least 1 5 km the second one develops between mt 5 and mt 7 on the contrary very low resistivity values were found between mt 4 and mt 5 this zone and the one corresponding to mt 1 and mt 2 could be the response of highly fractured basalt and ignimbrite saturated with freshwater the resistivity pseudo section of line 2 is associated with the western part of the ziway butajira transect and is oriented in a near e w direction the line consists of six mt soundings mt 8 to mt 13 the pseudo resistivity section amt data is shown in fig 5 this mt section shows a wide and deep low resistivity area that extends between mt 10 and the mid point between mt 11 and mt 12 extends at smaller depths also at the mt 12 and decreases towards mt13 as in the previous case the low resistivity anomaly could be very likely associated with a fractured rock volume hopefully ignimbrites hosting freshwater 4 4 meki midre kebd transect line 1 and line 2 the meki midre kebd transect also consists of line 1 and line 2 in turn line 1 consists of eight mt soundings starts close to meki town and extends westward with an average sounding station spacing of 3 km the 2d resistivity section is shown in fig 6 low resistivity can be observed in three areas namely in the mt 1 mt 3 regions in depth close to mt 4 and centered in mt 7 moreover in this case low resistivity could be very likely associated with fractured rock volumes and it is expected that these are ignimbrites that host fresh water 4 5 meki midre kebd transect line 2 the 2d resistivity section for line 2 of the meki midre kebd transect consisting of sounding mt 8 to mt 13 is shown in fig 7 the uppermost low resistivity regions between mt 8 and mt 9 as well as between mt 11 and mt 12 show a response attributable to weathered and fractured ignimbrite potentially saturated with water 4 6 geological cross sections among the twelve geological cross sections analyzed six were used to reconstruct the geological model fig 8 the cross sections perpendicular to the rift axis show horst graben and half graben structures the western highlands the rift shoulders are made of the oldest deposits of the pre rift phase from precambrian to miocene subsequently during the rift phase they are displaced by the border faults in the main rift and currently they are found at different depths up to a few kilometers low the syn rift deposits are represented by the pliocene nazret group ignimbrites whereas the younger geological formations are located along the rift floor and are dissected by normal faults a large area of the rift floor is mantled by lacustrine sediments among the six sections three were geophysically interpreted fig 9 in these sections the low resistivity volumes are highlighted as mentioned above the low resistivity is attributable to weathered and fractured ignimbrite potentially saturated with water moreover the condition that the extension of the low resistivity field corresponds to faulting zones e g abosa fault could be associated with deep groundwater circulation 4 7 3d hydrogeological conceptual model the 3d model in fig 10 has the twin goal of elaborating a local hydrogeological conceptual model and defining the major groundwater flows to predict the diffusion of f in the aquifers two hydrogeological units hu were identified for the selected area the sedimentary and volcanic units the sedimentary aquifer unit consists of aquifers of loose unconsolidated sediments that are mainly composed of lacustrine alluvial and volcano clastic materials they are moderately productive porous aquifers with transmissivity values ranging from 50 to 10 x m2d 1 and a well discharge of 2 5 ls 1 fentaw and mihret 2011 the volcanic aquifer unit according to fentaw and mihret 2011 is represented by five aquifers hosted in five rock units a pleistocene recent basalts having high productivity in fissured rocks with transmissivity ranging from 100 to 500 x m2d 1 and well discharge of 5 10 ls 1 b pleistocene pyroclastics composed dominantly of pyroclastic fall and ash deposits having low to medium aquifer productivity in fissured and or porous media having transmissivity ranging from 1 10 m2d 1 and well discharge that varies from 0 05 0 5 ls 1 c pliocene fissured ignimbrites moderately productive having transmissivity values ranging from 50 10 m2d 1 and a well discharge that varies from 2 5 ls 1 d mid upper miocene basalts and trachybasalts constituting a fissured aquifer of moderate productivity having transmissivity ranging from 50 10 m2d 1 and well discharge varying from 2 5 ls 1 e eocene oligocene basalts hosting a moderately productive fissured aquifer with transmissivity of 50 10 m2d 1 and a well discharge of 2 5 ls 1 the 3d hydrogeological model shows the groundwater circulation system fig 10 the main recharge areas are located in the east and west shoulders of the rift the discharge zones take place in the flanks towards the center of the graben which is the main groundwater reservoir the sedimentary aquifer unit is recharged laterally by groundwater flowing from the aquifers hosted in the flanks of the rift groundwater sometimes feeds the streams and later infiltrates through channel loss to recharge the aquifers in the transitional slope and in the rift floor in most parts of the area shallow aquifers hosted in alluvial sediments are the main groundwater source for water supply through hand dug wells fresh groundwater is also found in basaltic aquifers kebede 2013 fault zones act as either hydraulic conduits connecting different aquifer systems or form effective barriers to groundwater flow because regional fault systems are also present the groundwater is drained through deep circuits and then rises again in the form of thermal water fig 10 4 8 regional groundwater flow according to azazegn et al 2015 differently oriented horsts caped with impermeable rock units in the western plateau and in the rift margins on the western side of the northern main ethiopian rift nmer define the groundwater divide the groundwater contribution inter basin flow flows from the surrounding western plateau to the nmer aquifer system fig 11 the groundwater systems range from the highlands recharge areas in the western northern and eastern sides of the rift to the lowland discharge areas towards the rift axis which is as expected along the regional slope and depending on the rift structure geometry fig 11 the study area is divided into three groundwater sub basins awash koka ziway shala and awassa abaya the awash koka sub basin lies on the northern side of the study area in this sub basin groundwater flows towards the east and northeast the recharge areas are the western and northwestern escarpments including the surrounding addis ababa region which lies outside the study area the transfer of groundwater from the blue nile basin to this sub basin has been reported in previous studies kebede et al 2007 yitbarek et al 2012 azagegn et al 2015 in the ziway shala central sub basin groundwater flows towards the lake s region and to the rift axis the awassa abaya groundwater sub basin lies in the southern part of the study area in this sub basin groundwater converges from the surrounding escarpments including the central part of the rift towards lake abaya outside the study area approximately 100 km south of lake awassa 4 9 physico chemical features and fluoride distribution in groundwater a summary of the values of temperature electrical conductivity ph and redox potential measured in situ at all sampling points is provided in table 1 the groundwater gw samples show a wide temperature range from 15 3 to 91 8 c and from 14 3 to 92 1 c for the 1st and 2nd surveys respectively where the highest temperatures correspond to springs and confirm the presence of thermal water the temperature in surface waters sw ranges from 18 9 to 25 9 c and from 20 1 to 26 1 c respectively for the 1st and 2nd surveys in gw the ec varies from 96 μscm 1 to 9710 μscm 1 for the 1st survey and from 85 μscm 1 to 5800 μscm 1 for the 2nd survey whereas surface waters present a narrower range of conductivities for the 1st survey from 210 μscm 1 to 1690 μscm 1 the ec of sw for the 2nd survey ranged from 89 μscm 1 to 21 700 μscm 1 due to the presence of a sample from a saline lake l3 however the highest ph values measured in both types of water were quite similar 8 9 in both gw and sw for the 1st survey and 9 3 and 9 7 in gw and sw respectively for the 2nd survey the lowest measured ph values were found in groundwater samples with the values of 6 1 and 5 9 1st and 2nd surveys respectively in contrast to the 7 6 ph value measured in surface waters in both surveys the redox potential eh ranges from 287 to 224 mv 1st survey and from 251 to 589 mv 2nd survey in gw whereas in sw ranges from 123 to 185 mv 1st survey and from 113 to 201 mv 2nd survey the most negative values of gw are attributable to the thermal spring eth s5 rising from lake sediments close to lake langano in gw fluoride concentrations vary from 0 1 to 68 9 mg l 1 in the 1st survey and from 0 1 to 68 2 mg l 1 in the 2nd survey showing similar ranges in both cases but with different average values 6 7 and 7 8 mg l 1 for the 1st and 2nd surveys respectively in sw the fluoride concentration ranges from 0 7 to 12 9 mg l 1 1st survey and from 0 6 to 244 2 mg l 1 2nd survey the wider range for the sw in the 2nd survey is due to the high value sampled on lake shala the highest concentrations correspond to hydrothermal springs samples s3 s5 and s9 with the concentrations of 68 9 44 5 and 24 0 mg l 1 respectively and to the hand dug well hw2 34 0 mg l 1 overall higher fluoride concentrations have been detected along the rift floor specifically in correspondence with lake sediments moving to the highland towards both the eastern and western plateau the fluoride concentration tends to decrease as shown by the spatial distribution in fig 12 in the study area seasonal variations of fluoride content have been detected fig 13 the f concentrations tend to increase from the dry season 1st survey to the period after the rainy season 2nd survey in those samples from the area of the central main ethiopian rift cmer whereas it decreases in samples from the nmer area a positive f trend has been highlighted with ec and in some cases with temperature fig 14 a and b the ec tends to increase the movement towards the rift floor an evident relationship can be observed regarding temperature for f values below 4 mg l 1 conversely no apparent tendency is observed over this value as previously described the nmer groundwater circulation is strongly influenced by the geological structures and has a higher time response to the cmer during the rainy season this probably results in a dilution effect on the fluoride concentration which decreases in the 2nd survey multiple and concurrent factors currently under investigation can affect the dynamic fluoride contamination previous studies in the area ayenew 2008 rango et al 2009 and 2010 bretzler et al 2011 showed that high fluoride contents are related to water hosted in acidic volcanic rocks especially in ignimbrites rhyolites and pumice cropping out in the rift floor the water rock sediment interaction together with the weathering products of glass components enriched groundwaters with major ions and f in this study we found the same spatial water rock type association fig 12 5 conclusions the complex set of all the studies carried out in the research area i e the bibliographic geological stratigraphic hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and geophysical studies along with data strictly concerning water quality allow us to formulate some important but not definitive conclusions the synthesis of these studies is well represented by the combination of figs 8 to 12 the aquifers are recharged from rain floodwaters stream channel loss or groundwater inflow from the mountains the hydrogeological conceptual model shows a complex hydrogeological environment and an evident hydraulic interconnection between different aquifer units approximately 62 of the analyzed water samples exceeded the who threshold of 1 5 mg l 1 for fluoride concentration in drinking water the highest values were detected for the samples located in correspondence of lacustrine sediments and thermal water a firm point of these conclusions is that all water points with acceptable fluoride content are systematically found in environments characterized by fractured ignimbrite outcrops namely the pliocene nazret group ignimbrites see also fig 3 aforementioned ignimbrites outcrop at the shoulders of the rift and tend to deepen towards the rift axis except for some interesting outcrops in the downstream areas in this context some observations must be made first the ignimbrites which have thicknesses of the order of several hundred meters lie on oligocene miocene basalts that generally in similar environments have acceptable fluoride contents this condition would exclude water contamination generated in depth which has to be verified if the last consideration is reliable the contamination should originate from the surface and near surface materials such as the quaternary sediments of alluvial and lacustrine origin to verify the above interpretation the following questions need to be resolved if the water fluoride contamination spread vertically from top to bottom or if it can be assumed that the fluoride contamination is confined to the surface and the near surface regions regardless of the in depth study of the whole information already acquired to answer the above question it would be interesting and useful to drill at least two research wells the first at an ignimbrite outcrop downstream from the rift shoulders and the second at an area where outcropping materials are the quaternary sediments penetrating the underlying ignimbrites to verify the water quality in purely practical terms it would also be advisable to accurately verify the conditions of one or more existing wells located in the ignimbrite outcroppings at the shoulders of the rift and in the case of favorable outcomes to design straightforward and economic hydraulic facilities to provide the resident populations in the downstream regions with water of acceptable quality moreover ongoing tracer based studies by the authors should emphasize groundwater age indicators 14c 3h 36cl and tracers such as sulfur and strontium isotopes to better systematize the hydrogeology of the study area noticeably the present dataset provides a basis for planning an effective groundwater management strategy to improve access to safe water nevertheless such plans cannot be designed merely based on hydrogeological scientific and technical results as other solutions such as the innovative defluoridation method are effective for rural communities and social and economic factors must also be considered idini et al 2020 declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this

8303,study region the lakes basin is located in the main ethiopian rift it covers the northern part of the rift valley basin the upper awash river basin and some sub basins from the omo river basin due to the presence of high fluoride f content natural contamination of groundwater has long been recognized as a water related health issue in the area study focus a multidisciplinary research effort including geological hydrogeological hydro chemical and geophysical investigations was adopted to understand the 3d hydrogeological conceptual model and to evaluate f enrichment in groundwater new hydrological insights for the region the 3d hydrogeological conceptual model shows a complex hydrogeological environment and a clear hydraulic interconnection between different aquifers the geological setting has deeply influenced the geometry of the aquifers recharge and discharge areas and f enrichment in groundwater two hydrogeological units namely sedimentary and volcanic multi aquifers were identified the analyses of groundwater circulation flow paths and distribution of f concentrations in each aquifer were conducted in groundwater the concentration of fluoride varies from 0 1 to 68 9

3d hydrogeological conceptual model geophysical surveys 1 introduction at least 44 of the population in sub saharan africa approximately 320 million people do not have access to clean and reliable water supplies jmp 2004 macdonald et al 2008 ghiglieri and carletti 2010 the majority of those without access to clean water approximately 85 live in rural areas where the consequent poverty and ill health severely affect women and children jmp 2004 macdonald et al 2008 in these areas groundwater plays a central role pietersen 2005 davies 2008 the unregulated and rapidly increasing groundwater exploitation is one of the major problems in water resources management ghiglieri and carletti 2010 in addition the problem is exacerbated by natural water contamination due to high fluoride f content alemayehu 2010 ghiglieri et al 2010 and 2012 ayenew 2018 some of the highest fluoride contents in groundwater ever recorded in the world have been found in the east african rift system ears with the concentrations of up to 68 9 mg l 1 in ethiopia and even more than 100 mg l 1 in tanzania alemayehu 2010 mckenzie et al 2010 for this reason fluoride has long been recognized as a water related health concern in ethiopia fluoride problems are largely found in groundwater from active volcanic zones where fluorine is derived from volcanic rocks and associated geothermal activities alemayehu 2010 ghiglieri et al 2010 and 2012 ayenew 2018 these high fluoride contents are ascribed to geological processes including thermal springs groundwater flow through rocks with fluorite and apatite minerals and volcanic activity ghiglieri et al 2012 delcamp et al 2016 reported various water evolutionary trends in volcanic aquifers they emphasize that many changes in hydrogeological conditions strongly influence fluoride dynamics for a mature volcano it is reasonable to first address the geochemical association of f with the hydrogeological and geological setting to understand these dynamics and prior to the development of groundwater facilities the capability of project should be confirmed through a hydrogeological conceptual model of the area based on geological information geophysical data aquifer and hydrogeochemical properties xue et al 2004 tam et al 2014 during the last few years the techniques in three dimensional 3d hydrogeological model reconstruction and visualization have been

floweredproject com 2 description of the study area 2 1 geographic climatic and physiographic setting the study area is located in the main ethiopian rift mer and extends between latitudes 6 50 n and 8 37 n and longitudes 38 27 e and 39 40 e fig 1 it covers a rhomboidal area of approximately 30 000 km2 where the elevation ranges between 1600 and 2500 m above sea level it covers the northern part of the rift valley basin the upper awash river basin and some sub basins from the omo river basin more specifically in this work the lake ziway area has been selected for comprehensive studies as it is characterized by the most interesting hydrogeological and hydrochemical features within the overall study area as well as the availability of an already existing comprehensive dataset the lake ziway watershed covers approximately 7300 km2 including the rift valley floor the escarpment areas two major river inlets ketar and meki rivers and one river outlet bulbula river the area can be divided into three physiographic zones the rift transitional escarpments and rift shoulders the topography of the area is strongly controlled by geology volcanism and faulting and erosion the mer is a broad depression bounded by discontinuous border faults tectonics and volcanic activities became restricted to the narrow axial zone during the quaternary boccaletti et al 1999 giving rise to grabens half grabens and horsts corti 2009 2012 this morphology provides suitable pathway for the circulation and storage of surface water and groundwater fed by numerous rivers flowing towards the rift floor there are also numerous perennial streams restricted to the rift valley the largest being the awash river all rift lakes receive recharge from both rain and groundwater whereas some lakes such as abijata and shalla do not have groundwater outflow alemayehu et al 2006 kebede et al 2008 the rift is also characterized by wetlands that are sustained by groundwater alemayehu 2010 the climate is warm and precipitation mostly occurs during summer and persists from mid june to mid september whereas scanty rainfall may also occur during march april and may the average annual temperature is 19 3 c in ziway with an annual average rainfall of 837 mm alemayehu 2010 the driest month is december with precipitation going as low as 6 mm in the region the water most commonly used by residents for drinking and domestic use is that from springs and wells 2 2 geological and hydrogeological setting the rift is bordered by the escarpments that separate its floor from the adjacent plateaus the rift floor hosts several lakes volcanoes and calderas the development of the ears in ethiopia began with the eruption of continental flood basins between 30 and 29 my wolfenden et al 2004 followed by faulting in the north and south which propagated towards the central part of the rift this major tectono magmatic event which altered the configuration of the landscape has also entirely changed the region s hydrological setting the study area is almost exclusively covered by acid to basic volcanic rocks lacustrine and alluvial sediments quaternary lacustrine and alluvial sediments occupy the low lying flat to gently sloping grabens and half grabens late pliocene and quaternary volcanic rocks dominate the escarpment zone and low lying rift wolde gabriel et al 1990 abebe et al 2007 quaternary acidic centers erupted pyroclastic products and lavas located mainly along the active rift axis named the wonji fault belt kebede et al 2008 associated with those localized basaltic flows and aligned monogenetic basaltic cones are observed trippanera et al 2015 precambrian and mesozoic rocks are locally exposed in the kella area western margin under a thick oligocene and pliocene volcanic rocks sequence the main aquifer systems are typically fractured and or weathered volcanics or weathered contact zones between different lithological units these aquifers are often confined or semi confined aquifers with relatively high permeability are found in sediments covering parts of the rift floor the permeability of rocks in the mer is medium 4 10 4 ms 1 although there is considerable local variation alemayehu 2010 indeed geological events have deeply influenced the geometry of the aquifers recharge and discharge areas and groundwater quality rocks are laterally discontinuous aquifer composition is heterogeneous and aquifer hydrodynamic characteristics are variable kebede et al 2008 therefore the connection between the volcanic volcano lacustrine and alluvial aquifers along with volcanic highland aquifers pose significant challenges because of the complex nature of groundwater flow recharge and geochemical evolution in these aquifers due to the presence of faults and volcanic activity geothermal activity is manifested by the occurrence of hot springs fumaroles boiling pools hot and steaming grounds closely associated with quaternary volcanoes in the axis of the rift ayenew 2008 hot springs also occur on the flanks of the rift where they are associated with peripheral faults as reported by ayenew 2008 the volcanic centers are characterized by geothermal manifestations and are aligned along the tectonically active fault system called the wonji fault belt wfb 3 material and methods literature review and direct field surveys are the input data sources for the present research fig 2 reports the conceptual workflow of the methodological approach developed herein according to a method already applied in previous research ghiglieri et al 2016 dodagoudar 2018 and used for the construction of the geological and hydrogeological 3d model and to understand f enrichment in groundwater literature data e g papers reports and maps were verified and homogenized the consulted data are different in terms of nomenclature colors and degree of differentiation of the lithological units geological stratigraphic tectonics hydrogeology and so on and then loaded into the database field surveys were performed to acquire new datasets using a multidisciplinary approach integrating geology geophysics hydrogeology hydrochemistry and isotopes 3 1 stratigraphic analysis geological cross sections and data handling preliminary geological information was obtained from previous studies geological map of the northern main ethiopian rift scale 1 200 000 abebe et al 2005 whereas detailed mapping has been carried out during the present research fig 3 stratigraphic data have been gathered from stratigraphic well logs papers abebe et al 2005 agostini et al 2011 or previous projects and unpublished work a great effort was made to homogenize all the geological stratigraphic and tectonic information and to convert the data into hydrogeological features as a second step several geological sections were constructed and the area around lake ziway was selected for the 3d hydrogeological model as it represents one of the most interesting hydrogeological and hydrochemical features in the study area six geological cross sections selected from a set of twelve drawn at 1 200 000 scale were used for the reconstruction of the geological model and three of them ran perpendicular to the rift axis whereas the remaining three runs parallel two cross rift sections aa and bb extend from the western rift shoulder to the eastern one whereas the mm section ends at the center the three cross sections parallel to the rift axis run in the rift center ff and dd and in the eastern shoulder bb respectively fig 3 the geographic information system gis geodatabase was populated with all these data an arcgis tool arcgis exacto section v2 0 developed by the illinois state usa geological survey was used to process each geological cross section the move software package www mve com software move was used to verify the 3d consistency of the geological model it provides a powerful platform for data integration cross section construction and 3d model building each geological surface was modeled by the interpolation of the contour lines depths drawn considering the geological cross sections stratigraphic data and interpreted geophysical data 3 2 field surveys to supplement the data acquisition and interpretation described in the previous section geological geophysical hydrogeological and hydrochemical surveys were planned and executed 3 2 1 geophysical survey to better constrain the 3d geological model geophysical measurements such as classical electrical soundings ves schlumberger spread and controlled source audio magnetotelluric deep soundings csamt were carried out along two traverses the ziway butajira traverse on the southwest and the meki midrekebid traverse on the northeast as shown in fig 3 these traverses follow the major access roads and cross the western side of the rift from the escarpment to the rift floor an average sounding interval of 3 km was employed and each traverse was composed of two lines designated as line 1 on the southeast and line 2 on the northwest the electrical soundings were carried out with a maximum half current electrode spacing ab 2 of 1000 m and in the csamt electromagnetic sounding frequencies of 0 1 1000 hz were employed however we noticed that the resistivity pseudo sections obtained through the amt surveys are undoubtedly better than those obtained with the vertical electrical soundings and are more useful in the current work due to their greater depth of investigation therefore the whole interpretation was performed only based on the amt data 3 2 2 hydrogeological and hydrochemical data collection the selection of the water points of interest was carried out according to the following criteria i complete knowledge of the water points in terms of previous chemistry stratigraphic and hydrogeological information considering the fluoride values aquifer material depth of wells and water temperature ii wells containing at least the stratigraphic description iii homogeneous geographic distribution of water points and iv significant differences among various aquifers two sampling field surveys were conducted along mer to observe the potential seasonal chemical variations and the recharge water influence the 1st campaign was conducted during the dry season and the 2nd just after the rainy season the 1st survey included 56 water sampling points namely 34 boreholes 6 hand dug wells 11 springs 3 rivers and 2 lakes fig 3 the 2nd field survey was carried out along 47 of the 56 water points identified during the 1st campaign three additional points 1 hand dug well and 2 lakes were sampled as new water points leading to a total of 50 water points 27 boreholes 5 hand dug wells 11 springs 3 rivers and 4 lakes for the 2nd field survey constructive and technical data of each well were acquired at each water point location elevation and geographical coordinates using a differential global positioning system www trimble com moreover in situ measurements of physicochemical parameters ph temperature electrical conductivity and redox potential were performed using a hach hq40d multiparameter device water samples were collected for the analysis of fluoride and analyzed at the laboratory of the university of barcelona using a thermo fisher scientific orion high performance ion selective electrode 9609bnwp the precision of the analysis defined as the standard deviation 1σ of the corrected concentration measured in duplicate samples was better than 1 4 results and discussion 4 1 structural and geological setting the mer constitutes the northern part of the ears connecting the kenyan rift with the afar depression the mer started to develop during the miocene period davidson and rex 1980 wolde gabriel et al 1990 during the pliocene and quaternary it progressively deepened and faulted and magmatism became more confined to the narrow rift axis this rift segment is bounded by discontinuous border faults striking between nne ssw in the south and ne sw in the north korme et al 2004 the axial rift zone which developed in the quaternary is dominated by dense n s to nne ssw striking faults volcanism is characterized by bimodal basalt rhyolite association with localized occurrences of intermediate rocks however the volume of acidic rocks in the area significantly exceeds that of the basaltic rocks the rift is dominated by acidic centers with associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits as well as subordinate basalts erupted from fissures and monogenetic events in the geo hydrogeological map of the study area fig 3 the oldest unit is represented by a small sliver of precambrian rocks overlain by mesozoic sediments north of butajira eocene oligocene continental flood basalts related to the rift initiation are exposed in the southwestern part of the area mid upper miocene silicic rocks and basalts lie over older rocks on the western rift margin acidic and trachytic volcanic centers of the upper miocene pliocene age outcrop on both rift flanks the late pliocene pleistocene is dominated by extensive ignimbrite flows and the falls of the nazreth group which cover both the western and eastern escarpments the exposed thickness of this unit the basal part consisting of alternating basaltic lava flows and agglomerates reaches 300 m wolde gabriel et al 1990 this is overlain by another widespread ignimbrite flow of the pleistocene age covering most parts of the rift floor small highly eroded plio pleistocene acidic volcanoes associated with the nazreth group rocks occur in the northeastern part of the study area the pleistocene recent rhyolites constitute some of the youngest volcanic products of the study area and consist of rhyolite flows domes obsidians and pitchstones along with extensive ignimbrites tuffs and pumices they are associated with axial silicic volcanic centers a close spatial and temporal relationship between these silicic volcanoes and propagating faults accompanied or followed by basaltic eruptions from fissures and aligned monogenetic cones suggests that these centers guide deformation and subsequent eruptions abebe et al 2007 basaltic lavas cinder cones and maars occupy the rift floor and they belong to the pleistocene recent basalts their eruption history spans the entire quaternary period the youngest radiometric data showing an age of ca 200 years for basaltic flows sieburg et al 2018 the contemporaneous butajira volcanic field is restricted to a narrow marginal graben at the base of the western escarpment and is marked by nne ssw aligned cinder cones maars and some lava aprons the quaternary sediment units occupy grabens half grabens basal slopes of foot walls of faults and foot slopes of volcanic ranges these units consist of alluvial colluvial and lacustrine sands and silts mainly of volcanic origin calcrete hardpans intercalated with these sediments have significant impacts on water infiltration 4 2 geophysical data processing and interpretation field data were analyzed processed and interpreted to show the results in 2d resistivity sections first the geoelectrical sections were evaluated merely in geophysical terms and were then interpreted into geological and hydrogeological terms considering the knowledge of both surface and subsurface geology 4 3 ziway butajira transect line 1 and line 2 as previously reported the ziway butajira transect is composed of lines 1 and 2 the resistivity pseudo section of line 1 was obtained using seven amt soundings mt 1 to mt 7 as shown in fig 4 this pseudo section and the following ones show the subsurface apparent resistivity distribution to a depth of 1 km or more in the apparent resistivity field of ziway butajira line 1 two relatively high resistivity areas can be observed most likely the response of the massive basalt the first one develops laterally in the region beneath mt 3 for approximately 6 km and down to a depth of at least 1 5 km the second one develops between mt 5 and mt 7 on the contrary very low resistivity values were found between mt 4 and mt 5 this zone and the one corresponding to mt 1 and mt 2 could be the response of highly fractured basalt and ignimbrite saturated with freshwater the resistivity pseudo section of line 2 is associated with the western part of the ziway butajira transect and is oriented in a near e w direction the line consists of six mt soundings mt 8 to mt 13 the pseudo resistivity section amt data is shown in fig 5 this mt section shows a wide and deep low resistivity area that extends between mt 10 and the mid point between mt 11 and mt 12 extends at smaller depths also at the mt 12 and decreases towards mt13 as in the previous case the low resistivity anomaly could be very likely associated with a fractured rock volume hopefully ignimbrites hosting freshwater 4 4 meki midre kebd transect line 1 and line 2 the meki midre kebd transect also consists of line 1 and line 2 in turn line 1 consists of eight mt soundings starts close to meki town and extends westward with an average sounding station spacing of 3 km the 2d resistivity section is shown in fig 6 low resistivity can be observed in three areas namely in the mt 1 mt 3 regions in depth close to mt 4 and centered in mt 7 moreover in this case low resistivity could be very likely associated with fractured rock volumes and it is expected that these are ignimbrites that host fresh water 4 5 meki midre kebd transect line 2 the 2d resistivity section for line 2 of the meki midre kebd transect consisting of sounding mt 8 to mt 13 is shown in fig 7 the uppermost low resistivity regions between mt 8 and mt 9 as well as between mt 11 and mt 12 show a response attributable to weathered and fractured ignimbrite potentially saturated with water 4 6 geological cross sections among the twelve geological cross sections analyzed six were used to reconstruct the geological model fig 8 the cross sections perpendicular to the rift axis show horst graben and half graben structures the western highlands the rift shoulders are made of the oldest deposits of the pre rift phase from precambrian to miocene subsequently during the rift phase they are displaced by the border faults in the main rift and currently they are found at different depths up to a few kilometers low the syn rift deposits are represented by the pliocene nazret group ignimbrites whereas the younger geological formations are located along the rift floor and are dissected by normal faults a large area of the rift floor is mantled by lacustrine sediments among the six sections three were geophysically interpreted fig 9 in these sections the low resistivity volumes are highlighted as mentioned above the low resistivity is attributable to weathered and fractured ignimbrite potentially saturated with water moreover the condition that the extension of the low resistivity field corresponds to faulting zones e g abosa fault could be associated with deep groundwater circulation 4 7 3d hydrogeological conceptual model the 3d model in fig 10 has the twin goal of elaborating a local hydrogeological conceptual model and defining the major groundwater flows to predict the diffusion of f in the aquifers two hydrogeological units hu were identified for the selected area the sedimentary and volcanic units the sedimentary aquifer unit consists of aquifers of loose unconsolidated sediments that are mainly composed of lacustrine alluvial and volcano clastic materials they are moderately productive porous aquifers with transmissivity values ranging from 50 to 10 x m2d 1 and a well discharge of 2 5 ls 1 fentaw and mihret 2011 the volcanic aquifer unit according to fentaw and mihret 2011 is represented by five aquifers hosted in five rock units a pleistocene recent basalts having high productivity in fissured rocks with transmissivity ranging from 100 to 500 x m2d 1 and well discharge of 5 10 ls 1 b pleistocene pyroclastics composed dominantly of pyroclastic fall and ash deposits having low to medium aquifer productivity in fissured and or porous media having transmissivity ranging from 1 10 m2d 1 and well discharge that varies from 0 05 0 5 ls 1 c pliocene fissured ignimbrites moderately productive having transmissivity values ranging from 50 10 m2d 1 and a well discharge that varies from 2 5 ls 1 d mid upper miocene basalts and trachybasalts constituting a fissured aquifer of moderate productivity having transmissivity ranging from 50 10 m2d 1 and well discharge varying from 2 5 ls 1 e eocene oligocene basalts hosting a moderately productive fissured aquifer with transmissivity of 50 10 m2d 1 and a well discharge of 2 5 ls 1 the 3d hydrogeological model shows the groundwater circulation system fig 10 the main recharge areas are located in the east and west shoulders of the rift the discharge zones take place in the flanks towards the center of the graben which is the main groundwater reservoir the sedimentary aquifer unit is recharged laterally by groundwater flowing from the aquifers hosted in the flanks of the rift groundwater sometimes feeds the streams and later infiltrates through channel loss to recharge the aquifers in the transitional slope and in the rift floor in most parts of the area shallow aquifers hosted in alluvial sediments are the main groundwater source for water supply through hand dug wells fresh groundwater is also found in basaltic aquifers kebede 2013 fault zones act as either hydraulic conduits connecting different aquifer systems or form effective barriers to groundwater flow because regional fault systems are also present the groundwater is drained through deep circuits and then rises again in the form of thermal water fig 10 4 8 regional groundwater flow according to azazegn et al 2015 differently oriented horsts caped with impermeable rock units in the western plateau and in the rift margins on the western side of the northern main ethiopian rift nmer define the groundwater divide the groundwater contribution inter basin flow flows from the surrounding western plateau to the nmer aquifer system fig 11 the groundwater systems range from the highlands recharge areas in the western northern and eastern sides of the rift to the lowland discharge areas towards the rift axis which is as expected along the regional slope and depending on the rift structure geometry fig 11 the study area is divided into three groundwater sub basins awash koka ziway shala and awassa abaya the awash koka sub basin lies on the northern side of the study area in this sub basin groundwater flows towards the east and northeast the recharge areas are the western and northwestern escarpments including the surrounding addis ababa region which lies outside the study area the transfer of groundwater from the blue nile basin to this sub basin has been reported in previous studies kebede et al 2007 yitbarek et al 2012 azagegn et al 2015 in the ziway shala central sub basin groundwater flows towards the lake s region and to the rift axis the awassa abaya groundwater sub basin lies in the southern part of the study area in this sub basin groundwater converges from the surrounding escarpments including the central part of the rift towards lake abaya outside the study area approximately 100 km south of lake awassa 4 9 physico chemical features and fluoride distribution in groundwater a summary of the values of temperature electrical conductivity ph and redox potential measured in situ at all sampling points is provided in table 1 the groundwater gw samples show a wide temperature range from 15 3 to 91 8 c and from 14 3 to 92 1 c for the 1st and 2nd surveys respectively where the highest temperatures correspond to springs and confirm the presence of thermal water the temperature in surface waters sw ranges from 18 9 to 25 9 c and from 20 1 to 26 1 c respectively for the 1st and 2nd surveys in gw the ec varies from 96 μscm 1 to 9710 μscm 1 for the 1st survey and from 85 μscm 1 to 5800 μscm 1 for the 2nd survey whereas surface waters present a narrower range of conductivities for the 1st survey from 210 μscm 1 to 1690 μscm 1 the ec of sw for the 2nd survey ranged from 89 μscm 1 to 21 700 μscm 1 due to the presence of a sample from a saline lake l3 however the highest ph values measured in both types of water were quite similar 8 9 in both gw and sw for the 1st survey and 9 3 and 9 7 in gw and sw respectively for the 2nd survey the lowest measured ph values were found in groundwater samples with the values of 6 1 and 5 9 1st and 2nd surveys respectively in contrast to the 7 6 ph value measured in surface waters in both surveys the redox potential eh ranges from 287 to 224 mv 1st survey and from 251 to 589 mv 2nd survey in gw whereas in sw ranges from 123 to 185 mv 1st survey and from 113 to 201 mv 2nd survey the most negative values of gw are attributable to the thermal spring eth s5 rising from lake sediments close to lake langano in gw fluoride concentrations vary from 0 1 to 68 9 mg l 1 in the 1st survey and from 0 1 to 68 2 mg l 1 in the 2nd survey showing similar ranges in both cases but with different average values 6 7 and 7 8 mg l 1 for the 1st and 2nd surveys respectively in sw the fluoride concentration ranges from 0 7 to 12 9 mg l 1 1st survey and from 0 6 to 244 2 mg l 1 2nd survey the wider range for the sw in the 2nd survey is due to the high value sampled on lake shala the highest concentrations correspond to hydrothermal springs samples s3 s5 and s9 with the concentrations of 68 9 44 5 and 24 0 mg l 1 respectively and to the hand dug well hw2 34 0 mg l 1 overall higher fluoride concentrations have been detected along the rift floor specifically in correspondence with lake sediments moving to the highland towards both the eastern and western plateau the fluoride concentration tends to decrease as shown by the spatial distribution in fig 12 in the study area seasonal variations of fluoride content have been detected fig 13 the f concentrations tend to increase from the dry season 1st survey to the period after the rainy season 2nd survey in those samples from the area of the central main ethiopian rift cmer whereas it decreases in samples from the nmer area a positive f trend has been highlighted with ec and in some cases with temperature fig 14 a and b the ec tends to increase the movement towards the rift floor an evident relationship can be observed regarding temperature for f values below 4 mg l 1 conversely no apparent tendency is observed over this value as previously described the nmer groundwater circulation is strongly influenced by the geological structures and has a higher time response to the cmer during the rainy season this probably results in a dilution effect on the fluoride concentration which decreases in the 2nd survey multiple and concurrent factors currently under investigation can affect the dynamic fluoride contamination previous studies in the area ayenew 2008 rango et al 2009 and 2010 bretzler et al 2011 showed that high fluoride contents are related to water hosted in acidic volcanic rocks especially in ignimbrites rhyolites and pumice cropping out in the rift floor the water rock sediment interaction together with the weathering products of glass components enriched groundwaters with major ions and f in this study we found the same spatial water rock type association fig 12 5 conclusions the complex set of all the studies carried out in the research area i e the bibliographic geological stratigraphic hydrogeological hydrogeochemical and geophysical studies along with data strictly concerning water quality allow us to formulate some important but not definitive conclusions the synthesis of these studies is well represented by the combination of figs 8 to 12 the aquifers are recharged from rain floodwaters stream channel loss or groundwater inflow from the mountains the hydrogeological conceptual model shows a complex hydrogeological environment and an evident hydraulic interconnection between different aquifer units approximately 62 of the analyzed water samples exceeded the who threshold of 1 5 mg l 1 for fluoride concentration in drinking water the highest values were detected for the samples located in correspondence of lacustrine sediments and thermal water a firm point of these conclusions is that all water points with acceptable fluoride content are systematically found in environments characterized by fractured ignimbrite outcrops namely the pliocene nazret group ignimbrites see also fig 3 aforementioned ignimbrites outcrop at the shoulders of the rift and tend to deepen towards the rift axis except for some interesting outcrops in the downstream areas in this context some observations must be made first the ignimbrites which have thicknesses of the order of several hundred meters lie on oligocene miocene basalts that generally in similar environments have acceptable fluoride contents this condition would exclude water contamination generated in depth which has to be verified if the last consideration is reliable the contamination should originate from the surface and near surface materials such as the quaternary sediments of alluvial and lacustrine origin to verify the above interpretation the following questions need to be resolved if the water fluoride contamination spread vertically from top to bottom or if it can be assumed that the fluoride contamination is confined to the surface and the near surface regions regardless of the in depth study of the whole information already acquired to answer the above question it would be interesting and useful to drill at least two research wells the first at an ignimbrite outcrop downstream from the rift shoulders and the second at an area where outcropping materials are the quaternary sediments penetrating the underlying ignimbrites to verify the water quality in purely practical terms it would also be advisable to accurately verify the conditions of one or more existing wells located in the ignimbrite outcroppings at the shoulders of the rift and in the case of favorable outcomes to design straightforward and economic hydraulic facilities to provide the resident populations in the downstream regions with water of acceptable quality moreover ongoing tracer based studies by the authors should emphasize groundwater age indicators 14c 3h 36cl and tracers such as sulfur and strontium isotopes to better systematize the hydrogeology of the study area noticeably the present dataset provides a basis for planning an effective groundwater management strategy to improve access to safe water nevertheless such plans cannot be designed merely based on hydrogeological scientific and technical results as other solutions such as the innovative defluoridation method are effective for rural communities and social and economic factors must also be considered idini et al 2020 declaration of competing interest the authors declare no conflict of interest acknowledgments this

edge over other energy sources wind solar thermal nuclear etc as a reliable efficient sustainable and environmental friendly energy generation option globally untapped hydropower potential stands at 10 000 tw h year with the potential for future development reaching 2000 2050 gw of installed hydropower capacity by 2050 international hydropower association iha 2016 from the viewpoint of environmental sustainability hydropower technologies produce less greenhouse gas emissions ghgs relative to fossil fuel electricity generation options kuanda et al 2012 and hence preferable to fossil fuels or nuclear power renofalt et al 2010 it is estimated that the life cycle ghg emission factors for hydropower is about 40 48 times less than that of fossil fuel generation options an indication of the environmental friendliness of hydropower systems kabo bah and mensah 2018 the multi faceted dimension of hydropower infrastructure in the provision of water supply systems water navigation and transport systems irrigation schemes fishing flood control among others cannot be over emphasized as large scale hydropower developments are capital intensive the concepts of small hydropower shp development has shot to limelight due to its ease of development cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness there is no internationally acceptable definition of shp however variant definitions exist based on a country s level of hydropower development ohunakin et al 2011 for example in canada installed capacity of less than 50 mw is classified as shp cyr et al 2011 whereas a capacity in the ranges of 5 100 mw is considered shp in the united states johnson et al 2015 the globally installed shp capacity is estimated at 78 gw against total estimated potential of 217 gw unido 2016 with china leading the shp developmental agenda on the continental front asia leads shp development with a total of 50 729 hydropower systems whiles africa lag with 580 shp in ghana the total installed capacity for existing plants is 4132 mw consisting of hydro 38 thermal 61 and solar 1 eshun and amoako tuffour 2016 since 1965 when the akosombo dam the first hydropower plant was completed ghana has rather taken a snail s pace towards exploring and developing its hydropower potentials the akosombo hydropower plant is augmented with 400 mw and 160 mw installed capacities from bui and kpong hydropower plants respectively international hydropower association iha 2018 according to the strategic development goal of ghana irena 2012 the government envisages expanding energy coverage from 20 in 2018 to 80 by 2030 however this energy coverage projection will only remain a myth unless pragmatic efforts are taken to expand the energy network to meet the ever increasing demand most of the unmet populations are the rural and peri urban communities whose energy demand may not have to be hosted by the major hydropower plants but rather considerations of shp to absorb such loads this is particularly true since connecting to the national power grid is prohibitively expensive due to the transmission losses thus local hydropower production is an attractive and sometimes viable option international hydropower association iha 2018 having recognized the need to augment ghana s energy mix it thus becomes imperative that lessons are drawn from global best practices with regards to shp potential exploration in india pandey et al 2015 assessed the hydropower potential of the mat river using a set of geospatial technologies together with the soil and water assessment tool swat in the ciwidey subwatershed in indonesia rospriandana and fujii 2017 also examined the potential for shp development with geographic information system tools coupled with the swat hydrologic model similarly theoretical hydropower potential has been evaluated for the misamis occidental tarife et al 2017 and quite recently for the mindanao river basin guiamel and lee 2020 all in the philippines the aforementioned discussions reiterate the need to leverage on advances in technology to promote potential hydropower exploration planning and development with least cost and resources in ghana earlier investigations indicated that many river reaches have the potential for small hydropower development arthur 2014 nonetheless no in depth studies have been initiated to assess the technical and economic viability of shps in ghana on this backdrop this study sought to investigate the potential for the development of shp within the lower pra river basin lprb by i identifying optimal sites for shp development and ii examining the technical feasibility of the proposed shp through hydrologic modeling and geographic information systems gis application 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the lower pra river basin lprb remain the focus of this study fig 1 however the description given herein is for the whole of the pra river basin prb the prb is located between latitudes 5 n 7 30ʹ n and longitudes 2 30ʹ w 0 30ʹ w in south central ghana the drainage network comprises the main pra river and its major tributaries of birim anum and offin rivers and their tributaries the pra river and its tributaries constitute the largest river basin of the three major south western basins system ankobra tano and pra the principal pra river together with its tributaries takes its source from the highlands of kwahu plateau in the eastern region and flows for 240 km prior to entering the gulf of guinea close to shama in the western region water resources commission 2010 the drainage area is about 22 106 km2 with an average elevation of about 300 m and uniformly appearing plateau at elevation ranging from 0 m to 429 m the pra river traverses 41 administrative districts the pra basin which lies within the southern forest and transitional climatic zones is characterized by a bi modal rainfall regime with two rainy seasons which extends from april to june and also from september to november the mean annual rainfall increases southwards from 1393 mm to 1779 mm due to the high amount of rainfall in the area the inhabitants are mostly farmers the area is characterized by uniformly high temperatures with a mean annual temperature of 27 c from 1988 to 2018 the main river and its tributaries form a principal source of water supply to communities within the basin the main tributaries are perennial and make all year round dependable water source the basin is one of the most extensively and intensively utilized river basin areas in ghana with respect to settlement agriculture logging and mining the presence of gold and other mineral resources has encouraged the operations of large mining companies in the basin as well as illegal small scale mining locally referred to as galamsey the increasing forest clearance for mining settlement and infrastructural development poses substantial loss of soil minerals and accompanying high sediment transport in the pra and its tributaries the basin hosts most of the large cocoa growing areas in the eastern ashanti and central regions nevertheless anthropogenic activities such as logging and mining are having detrimental impacts and deteriorating the surface water resource of the basin cocoa and oil palm constitute the major cash crop cultivation in the basin the basin contains the highest density of settlements both rural and urban in ghana water resources commission 2010 2 2 spatial datasets and processes a 1 arc second shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem bounding the pra river was downloaded from the usgs website https earthexplorer usgs org from the dem a contour map was generated at an interval of 2 m while the stream ordering was performed using the strahler method the ordering of the pra river into stream network was necessary to determine streams of higher order which would provide sufficient flow for hydropower generation using the fill tool in arcgis the dem was filled to remove any sinks followed by flow direction and flow accumulation from arcmap the raster calculator was used to define and generate flow accumulation with minimum accumulated flows of 10 000 cells the output of the raster calculator was then utilized to order and generate the stream network of pra river using the stream order tool fig 2 rainfall and temperature data for three weather stations in the pra basin daboase twifo praso and dunkwa on offin were obtained from the ghana meteorological agency for the period 1988 2018 streamflow data for the daboase hydrological station was also acquired for 1988 2018 from the hydrological services department ghana as a key determinant of hydrological processes land use characteristics were examined through land cover classification to identify the dominant land cover features in the pra basin in performing the land use land cover classification a landsat 8 oli tirs scene was used the downloaded image was acquired on 3rd january 2018 a true colour composite combination of band 4 red band 3 green and band 2 blue were used as well as a false colour composite which consisted of the combination of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi band 1 aerosol and band 6 swir the ndvi were extracted based on eq 1 1 b a n d 4 b a n d 3 b a n d 4 b a n d 3 or n i r r n i r r the true and false colour composites aided in the identification of various features in the image and the performance of unsupervised and supervised classification to aid the supervised classification process a 500 m moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis dataset was used in combination with the unsupervised classification to identify the dominant features in the pra basin for the performance of the supervised classification the fao digital soil map of the world dsmw esri shapefile format at a scale of 1 5 000 000 was used in this study although this data exist at a very coarse resolution it is the only dataset available that presents comprehensive information on the study area in preparing the soil code for the swat model the fao soil database was imported from mwswat mwswat is an extension to mapwindow 4 8 8 which host the fao soil database 2 3 head and flow determination hydropower is a function of two main factors the head and the flow the determination of reaches or network of pra river with sufficient flow for hydropower siting was accomplished through stream ordering stream ordering is a river classification technique into stream network or reaches which depicts the magnitude of flow at the classified stream network among the different stream ordering methods such as the shreve horton and strahler method the stahler method was used in ordering the pra river due to its extensive application and simplicity this method is such that there will be an increase in stream order when two streams of equal order meets for instance the adjoining of two first order streams form a second order stream and so on consequently an increase in stream order results in the relative increase in the magnitude of flow and vice versa pandey et al 2015 in order to ensure that there is sufficient flow available for hydropower generation only higher 3rd order streams were considered in the selection of hydropower sites a conceptual illustration of the strahler stream ordering method is shown in fig 3 the determination of available head i e difference in elevation emax emin and river reach i e distance between maximum and minimum elevation dmax dmin were performed using the srtm derived contour map of the pra basin fig 2 as a consistency check google earth elevation profile technique was used as an alternative tool to verify the head and river reach as determined by the srtm derived contour in determining the head each higher stream order of the pra river 3rd order stream was overlaid on the contour map to determine the head the available head was determined beginning from the main outlet of the pra river towards the upstream using the contour map the number of contour lines that passes through a particular reach of the pra river multiplied by the contour interval 2 m determines the head conceptually the available head reach and site spacing is illustrated in fig 4 2 4 hydropower siting siting of locations with hydropower potential along the pra river was conducted based on criteria adopted from kusre et al 2010 and yuksel 2007 the approaches used by kusre et al 2010 and yuksel 2007 were adopted because of their minimum data requirements and simplicity but however providing robust and reliable outputs it is therefore useful for regions with data paucity challenges the hydropower siting was divided into two distinct stages preliminary assessment and final assessment fig 5 in the preliminary assessment three criteria sufficient flow availability of adequate head and maximum stream reach of 3000 m were considered kusre et al 2010 the maximum stream reach was to ensure that the water surface slope of the falling water is not too high or too low for hydropower generation to guarantee sufficient flow and head for hydropower generation a minimum of third 3rd order stream and a minimum head of 8 m were adopted in the preliminary assessment the minimum head and flow were also to ensure the project considers small to high hydropower generation the locations on the pra river that meet the three criteria were designated as preliminary hydropower sites and subsequently subjected to the final assessment in the final assessment all the preliminary hydropower sites were tested against two final criteria head and minimum site spacing yuksel 2007 to avoid clustering of potential sites as identified in the preliminary assessment the final suitable sites were selected based on minimum criteria of 10 m and 500 m respectively for head and site spacing the head criterion was to guarantee the availability of adequate head for hydropower generation whiles ensuring the elimination of unsuitable sites to prevent clustering of final sites the site spacing is the distance between two successive hydropower sites the site spacing of 500 m was adopted to evaluate the potential for a cascade hydropower project the minimum spacing would ensure that the tailrace tail water elevation of the upstream site is not affected by the backwater ponding of the downstream site the preliminary hydropower sites that met the two criteria in the final assessment were designated as the final and proposed hydropower sites with the potential for hydropower generation within the lprb fig 5 2 5 swat model and flow simulation the soil and water assessment tool swat is a small watershed to river basin scale model widely applied across the world to study hydrology sediment in stream water quality impact of land use climate change and various water management interventions on water quantity and quality swat delineates the basin into sub basins and then into hydrologic response units hrus based on homogeneous soil characteristics land use and topology the creation of hrus enhances the prediction accuracy in the sub basin neitsch et al 2002 williams et al 2012 it is a distributed hydrological model and can be used to estimate the long term impact of land management practices on runoff sediment loads and loss of nutrients at different scales the hydrological simulation of watershed processes in swat is premised on the water balance equation formulated as 2 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where swt is the final soil water content mm h2o sw0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm h2o t is the time days rday is the amount of precipitation on day i mm h2o qsurf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm h2o ea is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm h2o wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm h2o and qgw is the amount of return flow on day i mm h2o arcswat an extension to arcgis was used in the flow simulation of the proposed hydropower sites the flow simulations in arcswat were executed using the spatial datasets described under section 2 2 in delineating the river networks for the study area a threshold area of 103 5 km2 was considered to zoom into relatively larger streams in the lprb in the hru definition a multiple land surface slope made up of three land surface slope classes 0 7 7 17 and 17 87 was chosen to define the land surface slopes the land use data was reclassified according to the crop and urban tables in swat2012 mdb database whereas the soil data was reclassified according to the usersoil table in the swat2012 mdb database with consideration to the hru definition the multiple criteria was used with land use soil class and land surface slope classes set at 2 1 and 2 respectively the threshold levels were set to ensure that all the dominant classes in the land use soil and land surface slope definition are considered in the creation of the hrus her et al 2015 finally the simulations were executed for a 30 year period 1988 2018 with the first two years as equilibration period the output was printed on a monthly timestep 2 6 calibration validation and model performance evaluation the model was calibrated using both manual calibration swat calibration helper v1 0 and automatic calibration with the swat calibration uncertainty program swat cup the automatic calibration was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm the daboase stream flow data obtained from the hydrological services department was used for the calibration and validation the period of data used for the calibration was 01 01 1990 to 31 12 2010 while that for the validation was from 01 01 2011 to 31 12 2018 the calibration and validation were performed on a monthly time step based on the literature cn2 esco surlag sol k alpha bf gw delay gwqmn revapmn gw revap rchrg dp and sol awc were selected for sensitivity analysis sensitive parameters were evaluated based on one at a time and global sensitivity analysis in swat cup following flow calibration procedure proposed by neitsch et al 2002 the initial ranges for the model parameters were attained from the absolute swat values txt in swat cup the parameters were adjusted by method of absolute change a and replacement v the performance of the model was adjudged against four objective criteria nse r² rsr and pbias kwarteng et al 2020 franco and bonuma 2017 gyamfi et al 2016a moriasi et al 2007 the model uncertainty was also assessed by the p factor and r factor in swat cup the optimal value for both nse and r² is one 1 while that for pbias is zero 0 r² varies between 0 and 1 whiles nse varies between and 1 a pbias of 0 is optimal and is an indication that the model neither under estimated nor overestimated the observed arnold et al 2012 2 7 energy estimation for each of the proposed sites a flow duration curve fdc and power duration curve pdc were constructed a monthly interval was used for the construction of both the fdc and pdc in the construction of the fdc the cumulative frequency number of flows n in descending order was calculated the flow exceedance probability dependability was estimated as 3 d e p e n d a b i l i t y c u m u l a t i v e f r e q u e n c y o f f l o w s n n u m b e r o f d a t a s e t n 100 following computation of dependability fdc at each hydropower site was plotted with discharge m3 s against the percent of exceedance or dependability the pdc was constructed by first computing the power using eq 4 4 p o w e r k w ρ g h e q η 1000 where ρ is the density of water 1000 kg m3 g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m2 s he is the effective head at the hydropower site m q is the discharge at the proposed hydropower site m3 s η is the overall system efficiency 86 the effective head at each hydropower site was determined from equation 5 5 h e h g h e a d l o s s hg is the gross head the total head determined at each hydropower site the head loss was taken to be 10 of gross head clarke et al 2008 the pdc of each hydropower site was obtained by plotting power kw against percent exceedance or dependability for hydropower generation the firm power and firm flow are often determined at the 90 dependability dudhani et al 2006 for estimation of the firm energy kwh and total annual energy production aep the plant capacity factor cf which represents the ratio of expected output from the plant to the total installed capacity of the hydropower plant was taken as 0 8 clarke et al 2008 this value is so chosen to allow for flow variation maintenance of old and faulty system and other uncertainties in power generation subsequently the annual firm hydroelectric energy was computed as 6 e n e r g y k w h p 90 t 90 c f where p90 is the power at 90 dependability t90 is time in hours for a non leap year at 90 dependability 7884 hrs and cf is the capacity factor 0 8 the aep was computed by estimating for the area under the pdc in this case the resolution of the integral function under the pdc for each site was used in the determination of the aep 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of preliminary hydropower sites the identification of preliminary hydropower sites were based on criteria proposed by kusre et al 2010 they include availability of sufficient flow availability of adequate head and a stream reach of 3000 m the minimum head set for the assessment of preliminary hydropower sites was 8 m with a minimum third 3rd order stream based on the above criteria a total of forty five 45 hydropower sites were identified the number of preliminary hydropower sites identified included twenty eight 28 thirteen 13 and four 4 hydropower sites on a fifth 5th fourth 4th and third 3rd order streams respectively table 1 3 2 selection of final hydropower sites to guarantee small to high energy generation the final selection of hydropower locations involved a minimum head of 10 m and a minimum site spacing of 500 m the site spacing is to ensure that the tailrace of the upstream site is not affected by the diversion arrangement of the downstream site and also to ensure that the river ecosystem has enough time to recover dudhani et al 2006 a total of ten 10 hydropower sites were selected after the final assessment the final hydropower sites selected included seven 7 sites on a fifth 5th order stream two 2 on a fourth 4th order stream and one on a third 3rd order stream fig 6 the maximum and minimum head of the final hydropower sites are 21 m and 10 m respectively the maximum head occurs on a third 3rd order stream whereas the minimum head occurs on fifth 5th and fourth 4th order streams the maximum stream reach of the final hydropower sites is 858 m from hydropower site ten hp10 which is well below the maximum threshold of 3000 m proposed by kusre et al 2010 the minimum site spacing of the final hydropower sites is 548 m from hydropower site six hp6 which is greater than the minimum threshold of 500 m proposed by yuksel 2007 the maximum and minimum water surface slopes of the proposed sites are 6 9 and 1 2 from hydropower sites five hp5 and ten hp10 respectively table 2 3 3 land use land cover characteristics over the lprb the land cover types of the lprb was characterized into four land use land cover classes to include vegetation forest built up and water fig 7 vegetation was found to be the dominant land cover type representing 70 2 of the basin area with forest built up and water constituting 23 6 3 7 and 2 5 respectively of the basin area table 3 3 4 sensitivity analysis and fitted parameter values table 4 presents global sensitivity parameters with their corresponding p value and t stats in global sensitivity analysis the larger the absolute value of t stat and the smaller the p value the more sensitive the parameter abbaspour et al 2004 given the 5 significance level the most sensitive parameters were esco t stat 126 1 p 0 gw delay t stat 6 1 p 0 and cn2 foeb t stat 2 2 p 0 table 5 shows the most sensitive parameters and their respective fitted values gw delay defines the time in days taken by the water that exits the soil profile to percolate and recharge the shallow aquifer the delay in time depends on the water table and the hydraulic properties of the geologic formations in the vadose and phreatic zones gyamfi et al 2016b 2017 the fitted value of the gw delay from the calibration is 31 days initial scs curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 was one of the most sensitive parameters that affected the model output the scs curve number is a function of the soil s permeability landuse and antecedent soil water conditions impermeability of the surface increases as the curve number increases from 35 to 98 thus a high cn value means a high surface runoff and a reduction in base flow williams et al 2012 gyamfi et al 2016b the dominant soil types ao1 ab 1046 and ao7 ab 1067 in the pra basin belong to the hydrologic soil group d and c which are characterized by high runofff and low infiltration rate the fitted values of cn2 foeb ao1 ab 1046 75 and cn2 foeb ao7 ab 1067 70 indicate that the forest cover in the basin is characterized by moderate surface runoff and moderate infiltration rate the soil evaporation compensation factor esco determines the depth distribution required to meet the soil evaporative demand to account for the effect of capillary action crusting and cracks abbaspour et al 2015 it must range from 0 01 to 1 as the value of esco is increased the model extracts more of the soil evaporative demand from the upper soil layer the fitted value of 1 table 5 shows that most of the basin s soil evaporative demand is met by the upper soil layer 3 5 calibration and validation of flow fig 8 and table 6 shows the model performance statistics for both calibration 01 01 1990 31 12 2010 and validation 01 01 2011 31 12 2018 periods it is evidenced that all the model statistics fell well within the acceptable limits the nse for both calibration and validation periods were well above 0 6 a model with an nse value between 0 65 and 0 75 shows a good performance moriasi et al 2007 the r2 values recorded in the model calibration and validation are 0 73 and 0 70 respectively according to kwarteng et al 2020 a model with an r2 value between 0 70 and 0 75 indicates a good performance also a model with a pbias value below 10 shows very good performance and between 10 and 15 in absolute value indicates a good agreement between the observed and simulated flows gyamfi et al 2016b it is therefore inferred that the model s pbias values of 6 76 and 13 14 during calibration and validation respectively indicate a very good model performance the model however underestimated the observed flow the underestimation in flows compared to the observed data may be attributed to inconsistencies in the weather data particularly rainfall and the observed discharge hydrologic modelling presents a number of uncertainties due to the complex processes that occurs within a watershed abbaspour et al 2015 in view of this the goodness of fit and the degree to which the calibrated model accounts for the uncertainties were assessed by the p factor and r factor the p factor indicates the percentage of observed data that is bracketed by the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu envelope and the r factor is the uncertainty indicator the p factor ranges from zero 0 to one 1 and r factor ranges between zero 0 and infinity a p factor of one 1 and r factor of zero 0 depicts a simulation that corresponds exactly to the observed data abbaspour et al 2004 from table 6 a p factor of 55 0 55 and 57 0 57 are observed in both calibration and validation periods repectively based on the criteria espoused by abbaspour et al 2004 the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95 ppu envelope of the observed flow is in a satisfactory range the model s r factor values of 0 37 in the calibration and validation stages indicate a good reduction of the model uncertainty and thus the acceptability of model results for further hydrological analysis of hydropower potential 3 6 flow assessment fig 9 depicts that apart from the flow at daboase stream gauge 180 m3 s hydropower site 1 hp1 172 9 m3 s recorded the highest flow followed by hydropower site 3 hp3 165 3 m3 s the lowest flow recorded was at hydropower site two hp2 5 3 m3 s both hp1 and hp3 are located on a fifth 5th order stream whereas hydropower site two hp2 occurs on a third 3rd order stream this accounted for the differences in their mean annual flows 3 7 power and energy assessment the firm power annual firm energy and the total annual energy production with the minimum flow requirements for each of the proposed 10 sites are shown in table 7 for hydropower development a dependability of 90 is often the preferrd choice to establish the firm power hidayah and wahyuni 2017 consequently for this project the firm power at each proposed hydropower site was established at 90 dependability from fig 10 it is seen that the firm power and flow at hydropower sites 1 hp1 is 12 2 mw and 100 6 m3 s respectively annually this is the minimum power that can be generated 325 days at the hydropower site the fdc also shows that the pra river is perennial in that even at 100 dependability there is still water flowing through the channel thus the firm power guarantees the minimum power that can be produced even in the driest year hydropower site one hp1 recorded the highest firm power 12 2 mw about twenty five times the firm power to be generated at hydropower site two 0 49 mw fig 10 the reason is that hydropower site one hp1 occurs on a fifth 5th order stream and is located 2 7 km downstream of hydropower site two hp2 hydropower site two on the other hand occurs on a third 3rd order stream hydropower site three hp3 has a firm power of 9 94 mw second only to hydropower site one hp1 hydropower site nine hp9 which occurs on a fourth 4th order stream has a firm power of 4 43 mw with a firm flow of 44 3m3 s thus from table 7 and fig 10 it is evidenced that the higher the stream flow the higher the power to be generated out of the ten 10 proposed hydropower sites hp1 and hp2 recorded the maximum and minimum firm power respectively it is expected that an annual firm energy of 77 1 gw h and total annual energy production aep of 183 8 gw h is to be harnessed from hydropower site one hp1 the firm energy is the minimum annual energy to be harnessed at 90 of the time the total and firm energy were computed considering 86 system efficiency 80 plant capacity factor and 10 loss in hydraulic head clarke et al 2008 the least annual firm energy expected to be harnessed from the ten 10 proposed hydropower sites is 2 3 gw h at hydropower site two hp2 this site has a firm power of 0 49 mw and a total annaul energy production aep of 8 5 gw h hydropower sites three hp3 and seven hp7 also show high hydropower potential with firm power of 10 mw and 9 mw respectively table 7 the annual firm energy expected to be harnessed from hp3 and hp7 are 47 0 gw h and 40 8 gw h respectively table 7 also the total annual energy production aep expected to be harnessed from hp3 and hp7 are 157 7 gw h and 141 9 gw h respectively the average firm power average annual firm energy and average total annual energy production aep expected to be harnessed from the ten 10 hydropower sites are 6 26 mw 31 55 gw h and 99 62 gw h respectively table 7 3 8 proposed cascade hydropower project along pra river from fig 11 it can be observed that the distance between hydropower site hp1 and hp3 is 6 5 km whereas that between hp3 and hp7 is 15 3 km according to yuksel 2007 in order to prevent the backwater or ponding created by a downstream hydropower site from affecting the tailrace arrangement tail water of the upstream hydropower site the minimum distance between successive hydropower sites should be greater than or equal to 0 5 km this condition is necessary to ensure a successful cascade hydropower project along the same river therefore hydropower sites hp1 hp3 and hp7 can be developed as a cascade project along the pra river without any interference fig 11 these three sites are proposed to be developed as cascade hydropower project along the pra river due to the considerable annual firm energy and annual total energy expected to be harnessed when combined in fact the combined total annual energy production aep expected to be harnessed from these sites is 483 4 gw h and the combined annual firm energy is 164 9 gw h fig 11 3 9 sediment management strategies given the current state and catchment characteristics two notable sediment management techniques bypassing and sluicing drawdown routing are proposed for sustainable operations of potential hydropower developments along the pra river theoretically bypassing technique diverts some of the sediment through or around the reservoir while sluicing technique removes or rearranges sediment that has already been deposited in the reservoir in bypassing a weir constructed upstream of the reservoir diverts sediment laden inflow into a diversion channel which then conveys the sediment laden water downstream of the dam to reconnect with the river this technique is such that the weir diverts during peak flows when sediment load is high but ceases during low flows when sediment load is low to allow inflow into the reservoir this technique has been successfully applied in other jurisdiction for more than 100 years sumi et al 2004 in sluicing drawdown routing the reservoir pool is lowered with the objective of permitting sediment transport through the reservoir at high velocity thus minimizing sedimentation and allowing some already deposited sediments to flush out this technique is initiated during peak flows and hence requires relatively large dam outlets it should be noted however that the adoption and implementation of any of these major sediment management strategies should be informed by feasibility and cost benefit analysis again given the increased mining activities in the pra river basin and the high erosion of finer sediments into the river turbidity current venting offers further suitable technique for discharging sediments out of the reservoir moreover erosion control strategy involving improvement in vegetation cover along the pra riverbank will also be utilized to reduce upstream sediment erosion 4 conclusion the pra river has a potential for hydropower generation ten 10 sites with potential for hydropower generation were identified after the final assessment the maximum and minimum head of the sites are 21 m and 10 m respectively statistically the final model performance proved good with a nash sutcliffe efficiency of nse 0 71 and 0 63 coefficient of determination of r2 0 73 and 0 70 percent bias of pbias 6 76 and 13 14 rmse standard deviation ratio of rsr 0 54 and 0 6 p factor of 0 55 and 0 57 and r factor of 0 37 and 0 37 for calibration and validation respectively the maximum and minimum mean annual flows of 172 9 m3 s and 5 3 m3 s were recorded at hydropower sites one hp1 and two hp2 respectively hydropower sites three hp3 and four hp4 also recorded high flows with mean annual flow of 165 3 m3 s and 163 3 m3 s respectively with regards to hydropower potential the maximum firm power of 12 22 mw was obtained at site 1 hp1 while the minimum firm power of 0 49 mw was at site 2 hp2 the average firm power of the ten 10 hydropower sites is 6 26 mw moreover the highest and lowest annual firm energy expected to be harnessed were 77 10 gw h and 2 33 gw h at hp1 and hp2 respectively a total annual energy production aep of 183 77 gw h is to be harnessed at hydropower site one hp1 and is the highest among the proposed sites the average firm energy and total aep from the ten 10 proposed hydropower sites are 31 55 gw h and 99 62 gw h respectively conclusively the combined total annual energy production aep expected to be harnessed from hydropower sites hp1 hp2 and hp3 is 483 4 gw h with a combined annual firm energy of 164 9 gw h authorship contribution emmanuel arthur data analysis and write up fred oppong kyekyeku anyemedu project conceptualization

consideration of hydropower flow duration curves fdc and power duration curves pdc have been constructed for suitable sites from which design flow and firm energy is established new hydrological insights for the region the final assessment resulted in the identification of ten sites hp1 hp10 along the lpr with potential for hydropower generation the maximum and minimum mean annual flows were 172 9 m3 s and 5 3 m3 s at hydropower sites hp1 and hp2 respectively hp1 demonstrated the highest hydropower potential with firm power and annual firm energy at 90 dependability estimated as 12 22 mw and 77 10 gw h with a total annual energy production aep of 183 77 gw h hydropower sites hp3 and hp7 also had relatively high hydropower potential with firm power and annual firm energy of 10 0 mw 47

edge over other energy sources wind solar thermal nuclear etc as a reliable efficient sustainable and environmental friendly energy generation option globally untapped hydropower potential stands at 10 000 tw h year with the potential for future development reaching 2000 2050 gw of installed hydropower capacity by 2050 international hydropower association iha 2016 from the viewpoint of environmental sustainability hydropower technologies produce less greenhouse gas emissions ghgs relative to fossil fuel electricity generation options kuanda et al 2012 and hence preferable to fossil fuels or nuclear power renofalt et al 2010 it is estimated that the life cycle ghg emission factors for hydropower is about 40 48 times less than that of fossil fuel generation options an indication of the environmental friendliness of hydropower systems kabo bah and mensah 2018 the multi faceted dimension of hydropower infrastructure in the provision of water supply systems water navigation and transport systems irrigation schemes fishing flood control among others cannot be over emphasized as large scale hydropower developments are capital intensive the concepts of small hydropower shp development has shot to limelight due to its ease of development cost effectiveness and environmental friendliness there is no internationally acceptable definition of shp however variant definitions exist based on a country s level of hydropower development ohunakin et al 2011 for example in canada installed capacity of less than 50 mw is classified as shp cyr et al 2011 whereas a capacity in the ranges of 5 100 mw is considered shp in the united states johnson et al 2015 the globally installed shp capacity is estimated at 78 gw against total estimated potential of 217 gw unido 2016 with china leading the shp developmental agenda on the continental front asia leads shp development with a total of 50 729 hydropower systems whiles africa lag with 580 shp in ghana the total installed capacity for existing plants is 4132 mw consisting of hydro 38 thermal 61 and solar 1 eshun and amoako tuffour 2016 since 1965 when the akosombo dam the first hydropower plant was completed ghana has rather taken a snail s pace towards exploring and developing its hydropower potentials the akosombo hydropower plant is augmented with 400 mw and 160 mw installed capacities from bui and kpong hydropower plants respectively international hydropower association iha 2018 according to the strategic development goal of ghana irena 2012 the government envisages expanding energy coverage from 20 in 2018 to 80 by 2030 however this energy coverage projection will only remain a myth unless pragmatic efforts are taken to expand the energy network to meet the ever increasing demand most of the unmet populations are the rural and peri urban communities whose energy demand may not have to be hosted by the major hydropower plants but rather considerations of shp to absorb such loads this is particularly true since connecting to the national power grid is prohibitively expensive due to the transmission losses thus local hydropower production is an attractive and sometimes viable option international hydropower association iha 2018 having recognized the need to augment ghana s energy mix it thus becomes imperative that lessons are drawn from global best practices with regards to shp potential exploration in india pandey et al 2015 assessed the hydropower potential of the mat river using a set of geospatial technologies together with the soil and water assessment tool swat in the ciwidey subwatershed in indonesia rospriandana and fujii 2017 also examined the potential for shp development with geographic information system tools coupled with the swat hydrologic model similarly theoretical hydropower potential has been evaluated for the misamis occidental tarife et al 2017 and quite recently for the mindanao river basin guiamel and lee 2020 all in the philippines the aforementioned discussions reiterate the need to leverage on advances in technology to promote potential hydropower exploration planning and development with least cost and resources in ghana earlier investigations indicated that many river reaches have the potential for small hydropower development arthur 2014 nonetheless no in depth studies have been initiated to assess the technical and economic viability of shps in ghana on this backdrop this study sought to investigate the potential for the development of shp within the lower pra river basin lprb by i identifying optimal sites for shp development and ii examining the technical feasibility of the proposed shp through hydrologic modeling and geographic information systems gis application 2 materials and methods 2 1 study location the lower pra river basin lprb remain the focus of this study fig 1 however the description given herein is for the whole of the pra river basin prb the prb is located between latitudes 5 n 7 30ʹ n and longitudes 2 30ʹ w 0 30ʹ w in south central ghana the drainage network comprises the main pra river and its major tributaries of birim anum and offin rivers and their tributaries the pra river and its tributaries constitute the largest river basin of the three major south western basins system ankobra tano and pra the principal pra river together with its tributaries takes its source from the highlands of kwahu plateau in the eastern region and flows for 240 km prior to entering the gulf of guinea close to shama in the western region water resources commission 2010 the drainage area is about 22 106 km2 with an average elevation of about 300 m and uniformly appearing plateau at elevation ranging from 0 m to 429 m the pra river traverses 41 administrative districts the pra basin which lies within the southern forest and transitional climatic zones is characterized by a bi modal rainfall regime with two rainy seasons which extends from april to june and also from september to november the mean annual rainfall increases southwards from 1393 mm to 1779 mm due to the high amount of rainfall in the area the inhabitants are mostly farmers the area is characterized by uniformly high temperatures with a mean annual temperature of 27 c from 1988 to 2018 the main river and its tributaries form a principal source of water supply to communities within the basin the main tributaries are perennial and make all year round dependable water source the basin is one of the most extensively and intensively utilized river basin areas in ghana with respect to settlement agriculture logging and mining the presence of gold and other mineral resources has encouraged the operations of large mining companies in the basin as well as illegal small scale mining locally referred to as galamsey the increasing forest clearance for mining settlement and infrastructural development poses substantial loss of soil minerals and accompanying high sediment transport in the pra and its tributaries the basin hosts most of the large cocoa growing areas in the eastern ashanti and central regions nevertheless anthropogenic activities such as logging and mining are having detrimental impacts and deteriorating the surface water resource of the basin cocoa and oil palm constitute the major cash crop cultivation in the basin the basin contains the highest density of settlements both rural and urban in ghana water resources commission 2010 2 2 spatial datasets and processes a 1 arc second shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model srtm dem bounding the pra river was downloaded from the usgs website https earthexplorer usgs org from the dem a contour map was generated at an interval of 2 m while the stream ordering was performed using the strahler method the ordering of the pra river into stream network was necessary to determine streams of higher order which would provide sufficient flow for hydropower generation using the fill tool in arcgis the dem was filled to remove any sinks followed by flow direction and flow accumulation from arcmap the raster calculator was used to define and generate flow accumulation with minimum accumulated flows of 10 000 cells the output of the raster calculator was then utilized to order and generate the stream network of pra river using the stream order tool fig 2 rainfall and temperature data for three weather stations in the pra basin daboase twifo praso and dunkwa on offin were obtained from the ghana meteorological agency for the period 1988 2018 streamflow data for the daboase hydrological station was also acquired for 1988 2018 from the hydrological services department ghana as a key determinant of hydrological processes land use characteristics were examined through land cover classification to identify the dominant land cover features in the pra basin in performing the land use land cover classification a landsat 8 oli tirs scene was used the downloaded image was acquired on 3rd january 2018 a true colour composite combination of band 4 red band 3 green and band 2 blue were used as well as a false colour composite which consisted of the combination of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi band 1 aerosol and band 6 swir the ndvi were extracted based on eq 1 1 b a n d 4 b a n d 3 b a n d 4 b a n d 3 or n i r r n i r r the true and false colour composites aided in the identification of various features in the image and the performance of unsupervised and supervised classification to aid the supervised classification process a 500 m moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis dataset was used in combination with the unsupervised classification to identify the dominant features in the pra basin for the performance of the supervised classification the fao digital soil map of the world dsmw esri shapefile format at a scale of 1 5 000 000 was used in this study although this data exist at a very coarse resolution it is the only dataset available that presents comprehensive information on the study area in preparing the soil code for the swat model the fao soil database was imported from mwswat mwswat is an extension to mapwindow 4 8 8 which host the fao soil database 2 3 head and flow determination hydropower is a function of two main factors the head and the flow the determination of reaches or network of pra river with sufficient flow for hydropower siting was accomplished through stream ordering stream ordering is a river classification technique into stream network or reaches which depicts the magnitude of flow at the classified stream network among the different stream ordering methods such as the shreve horton and strahler method the stahler method was used in ordering the pra river due to its extensive application and simplicity this method is such that there will be an increase in stream order when two streams of equal order meets for instance the adjoining of two first order streams form a second order stream and so on consequently an increase in stream order results in the relative increase in the magnitude of flow and vice versa pandey et al 2015 in order to ensure that there is sufficient flow available for hydropower generation only higher 3rd order streams were considered in the selection of hydropower sites a conceptual illustration of the strahler stream ordering method is shown in fig 3 the determination of available head i e difference in elevation emax emin and river reach i e distance between maximum and minimum elevation dmax dmin were performed using the srtm derived contour map of the pra basin fig 2 as a consistency check google earth elevation profile technique was used as an alternative tool to verify the head and river reach as determined by the srtm derived contour in determining the head each higher stream order of the pra river 3rd order stream was overlaid on the contour map to determine the head the available head was determined beginning from the main outlet of the pra river towards the upstream using the contour map the number of contour lines that passes through a particular reach of the pra river multiplied by the contour interval 2 m determines the head conceptually the available head reach and site spacing is illustrated in fig 4 2 4 hydropower siting siting of locations with hydropower potential along the pra river was conducted based on criteria adopted from kusre et al 2010 and yuksel 2007 the approaches used by kusre et al 2010 and yuksel 2007 were adopted because of their minimum data requirements and simplicity but however providing robust and reliable outputs it is therefore useful for regions with data paucity challenges the hydropower siting was divided into two distinct stages preliminary assessment and final assessment fig 5 in the preliminary assessment three criteria sufficient flow availability of adequate head and maximum stream reach of 3000 m were considered kusre et al 2010 the maximum stream reach was to ensure that the water surface slope of the falling water is not too high or too low for hydropower generation to guarantee sufficient flow and head for hydropower generation a minimum of third 3rd order stream and a minimum head of 8 m were adopted in the preliminary assessment the minimum head and flow were also to ensure the project considers small to high hydropower generation the locations on the pra river that meet the three criteria were designated as preliminary hydropower sites and subsequently subjected to the final assessment in the final assessment all the preliminary hydropower sites were tested against two final criteria head and minimum site spacing yuksel 2007 to avoid clustering of potential sites as identified in the preliminary assessment the final suitable sites were selected based on minimum criteria of 10 m and 500 m respectively for head and site spacing the head criterion was to guarantee the availability of adequate head for hydropower generation whiles ensuring the elimination of unsuitable sites to prevent clustering of final sites the site spacing is the distance between two successive hydropower sites the site spacing of 500 m was adopted to evaluate the potential for a cascade hydropower project the minimum spacing would ensure that the tailrace tail water elevation of the upstream site is not affected by the backwater ponding of the downstream site the preliminary hydropower sites that met the two criteria in the final assessment were designated as the final and proposed hydropower sites with the potential for hydropower generation within the lprb fig 5 2 5 swat model and flow simulation the soil and water assessment tool swat is a small watershed to river basin scale model widely applied across the world to study hydrology sediment in stream water quality impact of land use climate change and various water management interventions on water quantity and quality swat delineates the basin into sub basins and then into hydrologic response units hrus based on homogeneous soil characteristics land use and topology the creation of hrus enhances the prediction accuracy in the sub basin neitsch et al 2002 williams et al 2012 it is a distributed hydrological model and can be used to estimate the long term impact of land management practices on runoff sediment loads and loss of nutrients at different scales the hydrological simulation of watershed processes in swat is premised on the water balance equation formulated as 2 s w t s w 0 i 1 t r d a y q s u r f e a w s e e p q g w where swt is the final soil water content mm h2o sw0 is the initial soil water content on day i mm h2o t is the time days rday is the amount of precipitation on day i mm h2o qsurf is the amount of surface runoff on day i mm h2o ea is the amount of evapotranspiration on day i mm h2o wseep is the amount of water entering the vadose zone from the soil profile on day i mm h2o and qgw is the amount of return flow on day i mm h2o arcswat an extension to arcgis was used in the flow simulation of the proposed hydropower sites the flow simulations in arcswat were executed using the spatial datasets described under section 2 2 in delineating the river networks for the study area a threshold area of 103 5 km2 was considered to zoom into relatively larger streams in the lprb in the hru definition a multiple land surface slope made up of three land surface slope classes 0 7 7 17 and 17 87 was chosen to define the land surface slopes the land use data was reclassified according to the crop and urban tables in swat2012 mdb database whereas the soil data was reclassified according to the usersoil table in the swat2012 mdb database with consideration to the hru definition the multiple criteria was used with land use soil class and land surface slope classes set at 2 1 and 2 respectively the threshold levels were set to ensure that all the dominant classes in the land use soil and land surface slope definition are considered in the creation of the hrus her et al 2015 finally the simulations were executed for a 30 year period 1988 2018 with the first two years as equilibration period the output was printed on a monthly timestep 2 6 calibration validation and model performance evaluation the model was calibrated using both manual calibration swat calibration helper v1 0 and automatic calibration with the swat calibration uncertainty program swat cup the automatic calibration was performed using the sequential uncertainty fitting sufi 2 algorithm the daboase stream flow data obtained from the hydrological services department was used for the calibration and validation the period of data used for the calibration was 01 01 1990 to 31 12 2010 while that for the validation was from 01 01 2011 to 31 12 2018 the calibration and validation were performed on a monthly time step based on the literature cn2 esco surlag sol k alpha bf gw delay gwqmn revapmn gw revap rchrg dp and sol awc were selected for sensitivity analysis sensitive parameters were evaluated based on one at a time and global sensitivity analysis in swat cup following flow calibration procedure proposed by neitsch et al 2002 the initial ranges for the model parameters were attained from the absolute swat values txt in swat cup the parameters were adjusted by method of absolute change a and replacement v the performance of the model was adjudged against four objective criteria nse r² rsr and pbias kwarteng et al 2020 franco and bonuma 2017 gyamfi et al 2016a moriasi et al 2007 the model uncertainty was also assessed by the p factor and r factor in swat cup the optimal value for both nse and r² is one 1 while that for pbias is zero 0 r² varies between 0 and 1 whiles nse varies between and 1 a pbias of 0 is optimal and is an indication that the model neither under estimated nor overestimated the observed arnold et al 2012 2 7 energy estimation for each of the proposed sites a flow duration curve fdc and power duration curve pdc were constructed a monthly interval was used for the construction of both the fdc and pdc in the construction of the fdc the cumulative frequency number of flows n in descending order was calculated the flow exceedance probability dependability was estimated as 3 d e p e n d a b i l i t y c u m u l a t i v e f r e q u e n c y o f f l o w s n n u m b e r o f d a t a s e t n 100 following computation of dependability fdc at each hydropower site was plotted with discharge m3 s against the percent of exceedance or dependability the pdc was constructed by first computing the power using eq 4 4 p o w e r k w ρ g h e q η 1000 where ρ is the density of water 1000 kg m3 g is the acceleration due to gravity 9 81 m2 s he is the effective head at the hydropower site m q is the discharge at the proposed hydropower site m3 s η is the overall system efficiency 86 the effective head at each hydropower site was determined from equation 5 5 h e h g h e a d l o s s hg is the gross head the total head determined at each hydropower site the head loss was taken to be 10 of gross head clarke et al 2008 the pdc of each hydropower site was obtained by plotting power kw against percent exceedance or dependability for hydropower generation the firm power and firm flow are often determined at the 90 dependability dudhani et al 2006 for estimation of the firm energy kwh and total annual energy production aep the plant capacity factor cf which represents the ratio of expected output from the plant to the total installed capacity of the hydropower plant was taken as 0 8 clarke et al 2008 this value is so chosen to allow for flow variation maintenance of old and faulty system and other uncertainties in power generation subsequently the annual firm hydroelectric energy was computed as 6 e n e r g y k w h p 90 t 90 c f where p90 is the power at 90 dependability t90 is time in hours for a non leap year at 90 dependability 7884 hrs and cf is the capacity factor 0 8 the aep was computed by estimating for the area under the pdc in this case the resolution of the integral function under the pdc for each site was used in the determination of the aep 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of preliminary hydropower sites the identification of preliminary hydropower sites were based on criteria proposed by kusre et al 2010 they include availability of sufficient flow availability of adequate head and a stream reach of 3000 m the minimum head set for the assessment of preliminary hydropower sites was 8 m with a minimum third 3rd order stream based on the above criteria a total of forty five 45 hydropower sites were identified the number of preliminary hydropower sites identified included twenty eight 28 thirteen 13 and four 4 hydropower sites on a fifth 5th fourth 4th and third 3rd order streams respectively table 1 3 2 selection of final hydropower sites to guarantee small to high energy generation the final selection of hydropower locations involved a minimum head of 10 m and a minimum site spacing of 500 m the site spacing is to ensure that the tailrace of the upstream site is not affected by the diversion arrangement of the downstream site and also to ensure that the river ecosystem has enough time to recover dudhani et al 2006 a total of ten 10 hydropower sites were selected after the final assessment the final hydropower sites selected included seven 7 sites on a fifth 5th order stream two 2 on a fourth 4th order stream and one on a third 3rd order stream fig 6 the maximum and minimum head of the final hydropower sites are 21 m and 10 m respectively the maximum head occurs on a third 3rd order stream whereas the minimum head occurs on fifth 5th and fourth 4th order streams the maximum stream reach of the final hydropower sites is 858 m from hydropower site ten hp10 which is well below the maximum threshold of 3000 m proposed by kusre et al 2010 the minimum site spacing of the final hydropower sites is 548 m from hydropower site six hp6 which is greater than the minimum threshold of 500 m proposed by yuksel 2007 the maximum and minimum water surface slopes of the proposed sites are 6 9 and 1 2 from hydropower sites five hp5 and ten hp10 respectively table 2 3 3 land use land cover characteristics over the lprb the land cover types of the lprb was characterized into four land use land cover classes to include vegetation forest built up and water fig 7 vegetation was found to be the dominant land cover type representing 70 2 of the basin area with forest built up and water constituting 23 6 3 7 and 2 5 respectively of the basin area table 3 3 4 sensitivity analysis and fitted parameter values table 4 presents global sensitivity parameters with their corresponding p value and t stats in global sensitivity analysis the larger the absolute value of t stat and the smaller the p value the more sensitive the parameter abbaspour et al 2004 given the 5 significance level the most sensitive parameters were esco t stat 126 1 p 0 gw delay t stat 6 1 p 0 and cn2 foeb t stat 2 2 p 0 table 5 shows the most sensitive parameters and their respective fitted values gw delay defines the time in days taken by the water that exits the soil profile to percolate and recharge the shallow aquifer the delay in time depends on the water table and the hydraulic properties of the geologic formations in the vadose and phreatic zones gyamfi et al 2016b 2017 the fitted value of the gw delay from the calibration is 31 days initial scs curve number for moisture condition ii cn2 was one of the most sensitive parameters that affected the model output the scs curve number is a function of the soil s permeability landuse and antecedent soil water conditions impermeability of the surface increases as the curve number increases from 35 to 98 thus a high cn value means a high surface runoff and a reduction in base flow williams et al 2012 gyamfi et al 2016b the dominant soil types ao1 ab 1046 and ao7 ab 1067 in the pra basin belong to the hydrologic soil group d and c which are characterized by high runofff and low infiltration rate the fitted values of cn2 foeb ao1 ab 1046 75 and cn2 foeb ao7 ab 1067 70 indicate that the forest cover in the basin is characterized by moderate surface runoff and moderate infiltration rate the soil evaporation compensation factor esco determines the depth distribution required to meet the soil evaporative demand to account for the effect of capillary action crusting and cracks abbaspour et al 2015 it must range from 0 01 to 1 as the value of esco is increased the model extracts more of the soil evaporative demand from the upper soil layer the fitted value of 1 table 5 shows that most of the basin s soil evaporative demand is met by the upper soil layer 3 5 calibration and validation of flow fig 8 and table 6 shows the model performance statistics for both calibration 01 01 1990 31 12 2010 and validation 01 01 2011 31 12 2018 periods it is evidenced that all the model statistics fell well within the acceptable limits the nse for both calibration and validation periods were well above 0 6 a model with an nse value between 0 65 and 0 75 shows a good performance moriasi et al 2007 the r2 values recorded in the model calibration and validation are 0 73 and 0 70 respectively according to kwarteng et al 2020 a model with an r2 value between 0 70 and 0 75 indicates a good performance also a model with a pbias value below 10 shows very good performance and between 10 and 15 in absolute value indicates a good agreement between the observed and simulated flows gyamfi et al 2016b it is therefore inferred that the model s pbias values of 6 76 and 13 14 during calibration and validation respectively indicate a very good model performance the model however underestimated the observed flow the underestimation in flows compared to the observed data may be attributed to inconsistencies in the weather data particularly rainfall and the observed discharge hydrologic modelling presents a number of uncertainties due to the complex processes that occurs within a watershed abbaspour et al 2015 in view of this the goodness of fit and the degree to which the calibrated model accounts for the uncertainties were assessed by the p factor and r factor the p factor indicates the percentage of observed data that is bracketed by the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95ppu envelope and the r factor is the uncertainty indicator the p factor ranges from zero 0 to one 1 and r factor ranges between zero 0 and infinity a p factor of one 1 and r factor of zero 0 depicts a simulation that corresponds exactly to the observed data abbaspour et al 2004 from table 6 a p factor of 55 0 55 and 57 0 57 are observed in both calibration and validation periods repectively based on the criteria espoused by abbaspour et al 2004 the 95 percent prediction uncertainty 95 ppu envelope of the observed flow is in a satisfactory range the model s r factor values of 0 37 in the calibration and validation stages indicate a good reduction of the model uncertainty and thus the acceptability of model results for further hydrological analysis of hydropower potential 3 6 flow assessment fig 9 depicts that apart from the flow at daboase stream gauge 180 m3 s hydropower site 1 hp1 172 9 m3 s recorded the highest flow followed by hydropower site 3 hp3 165 3 m3 s the lowest flow recorded was at hydropower site two hp2 5 3 m3 s both hp1 and hp3 are located on a fifth 5th order stream whereas hydropower site two hp2 occurs on a third 3rd order stream this accounted for the differences in their mean annual flows 3 7 power and energy assessment the firm power annual firm energy and the total annual energy production with the minimum flow requirements for each of the proposed 10 sites are shown in table 7 for hydropower development a dependability of 90 is often the preferrd choice to establish the firm power hidayah and wahyuni 2017 consequently for this project the firm power at each proposed hydropower site was established at 90 dependability from fig 10 it is seen that the firm power and flow at hydropower sites 1 hp1 is 12 2 mw and 100 6 m3 s respectively annually this is the minimum power that can be generated 325 days at the hydropower site the fdc also shows that the pra river is perennial in that even at 100 dependability there is still water flowing through the channel thus the firm power guarantees the minimum power that can be produced even in the driest year hydropower site one hp1 recorded the highest firm power 12 2 mw about twenty five times the firm power to be generated at hydropower site two 0 49 mw fig 10 the reason is that hydropower site one hp1 occurs on a fifth 5th order stream and is located 2 7 km downstream of hydropower site two hp2 hydropower site two on the other hand occurs on a third 3rd order stream hydropower site three hp3 has a firm power of 9 94 mw second only to hydropower site one hp1 hydropower site nine hp9 which occurs on a fourth 4th order stream has a firm power of 4 43 mw with a firm flow of 44 3m3 s thus from table 7 and fig 10 it is evidenced that the higher the stream flow the higher the power to be generated out of the ten 10 proposed hydropower sites hp1 and hp2 recorded the maximum and minimum firm power respectively it is expected that an annual firm energy of 77 1 gw h and total annual energy production aep of 183 8 gw h is to be harnessed from hydropower site one hp1 the firm energy is the minimum annual energy to be harnessed at 90 of the time the total and firm energy were computed considering 86 system efficiency 80 plant capacity factor and 10 loss in hydraulic head clarke et al 2008 the least annual firm energy expected to be harnessed from the ten 10 proposed hydropower sites is 2 3 gw h at hydropower site two hp2 this site has a firm power of 0 49 mw and a total annaul energy production aep of 8 5 gw h hydropower sites three hp3 and seven hp7 also show high hydropower potential with firm power of 10 mw and 9 mw respectively table 7 the annual firm energy expected to be harnessed from hp3 and hp7 are 47 0 gw h and 40 8 gw h respectively table 7 also the total annual energy production aep expected to be harnessed from hp3 and hp7 are 157 7 gw h and 141 9 gw h respectively the average firm power average annual firm energy and average total annual energy production aep expected to be harnessed from the ten 10 hydropower sites are 6 26 mw 31 55 gw h and 99 62 gw h respectively table 7 3 8 proposed cascade hydropower project along pra river from fig 11 it can be observed that the distance between hydropower site hp1 and hp3 is 6 5 km whereas that between hp3 and hp7 is 15 3 km according to yuksel 2007 in order to prevent the backwater or ponding created by a downstream hydropower site from affecting the tailrace arrangement tail water of the upstream hydropower site the minimum distance between successive hydropower sites should be greater than or equal to 0 5 km this condition is necessary to ensure a successful cascade hydropower project along the same river therefore hydropower sites hp1 hp3 and hp7 can be developed as a cascade project along the pra river without any interference fig 11 these three sites are proposed to be developed as cascade hydropower project along the pra river due to the considerable annual firm energy and annual total energy expected to be harnessed when combined in fact the combined total annual energy production aep expected to be harnessed from these sites is 483 4 gw h and the combined annual firm energy is 164 9 gw h fig 11 3 9 sediment management strategies given the current state and catchment characteristics two notable sediment management techniques bypassing and sluicing drawdown routing are proposed for sustainable operations of potential hydropower developments along the pra river theoretically bypassing technique diverts some of the sediment through or around the reservoir while sluicing technique removes or rearranges sediment that has already been deposited in the reservoir in bypassing a weir constructed upstream of the reservoir diverts sediment laden inflow into a diversion channel which then conveys the sediment laden water downstream of the dam to reconnect with the river this technique is such that the weir diverts during peak flows when sediment load is high but ceases during low flows when sediment load is low to allow inflow into the reservoir this technique has been successfully applied in other jurisdiction for more than 100 years sumi et al 2004 in sluicing drawdown routing the reservoir pool is lowered with the objective of permitting sediment transport through the reservoir at high velocity thus minimizing sedimentation and allowing some already deposited sediments to flush out this technique is initiated during peak flows and hence requires relatively large dam outlets it should be noted however that the adoption and implementation of any of these major sediment management strategies should be informed by feasibility and cost benefit analysis again given the increased mining activities in the pra river basin and the high erosion of finer sediments into the river turbidity current venting offers further suitable technique for discharging sediments out of the reservoir moreover erosion control strategy involving improvement in vegetation cover along the pra riverbank will also be utilized to reduce upstream sediment erosion 4 conclusion the pra river has a potential for hydropower generation ten 10 sites with potential for hydropower generation were identified after the final assessment the maximum and minimum head of the sites are 21 m and 10 m respectively statistically the final model performance proved good with a nash sutcliffe efficiency of nse 0 71 and 0 63 coefficient of determination of r2 0 73 and 0 70 percent bias of pbias 6 76 and 13 14 rmse standard deviation ratio of rsr 0 54 and 0 6 p factor of 0 55 and 0 57 and r factor of 0 37 and 0 37 for calibration and validation respectively the maximum and minimum mean annual flows of 172 9 m3 s and 5 3 m3 s were recorded at hydropower sites one hp1 and two hp2 respectively hydropower sites three hp3 and four hp4 also recorded high flows with mean annual flow of 165 3 m3 s and 163 3 m3 s respectively with regards to hydropower potential the maximum firm power of 12 22 mw was obtained at site 1 hp1 while the minimum firm power of 0 49 mw was at site 2 hp2 the average firm power of the ten 10 hydropower sites is 6 26 mw moreover the highest and lowest annual firm energy expected to be harnessed were 77 10 gw h and 2 33 gw h at hp1 and hp2 respectively a total annual energy production aep of 183 77 gw h is to be harnessed at hydropower site one hp1 and is the highest among the proposed sites the average firm energy and total aep from the ten 10 proposed hydropower sites are 31 55 gw h and 99 62 gw h respectively conclusively the combined total annual energy production aep expected to be harnessed from hydropower sites hp1 hp2 and hp3 is 483 4 gw h with a combined annual firm energy of 164 9 gw h authorship contribution emmanuel arthur data analysis and write up fred oppong kyekyeku anyemedu project conceptualization
