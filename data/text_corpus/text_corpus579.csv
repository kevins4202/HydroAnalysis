2895,the trapezoid configuration constituted by spatially distributed land surface temperature lst and fraction vegetation cover fvc has been widely used for estimating surface soil moisture ssm with satellite data however the trapezoid based methods still suffer from a major challenge that the determination of the trapezoid pixel window is always subjective because it requires quasi identical atmospheric conditions to make ssm retrievals for each pixel spatially comparable meanwhile the trapezoid pixel window should also contain full vegetation coverages and ssm dynamics to fulfill theinscape of the trapezoid due to the heterogeneity of atmospheric variables and underlying surfaces it is commonly difficult to determine a proper trapezoid pixel window in practices the development of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid aims to decrease the dependence of trapezoid based ssm retrieval on the subjective requirements of quasi identical atmospheric conditions full vegetation coverages and ssm dynamics in the present study for each pixel over the north china plain a unique virtual trapezoid was created and the theoretical boundaries were determined following the principle of surface energy balance where satellite derived essential atmospheric variables of air temperature net surface shortwave radiation and relative humidity were provided as inputs based on the proposed approach a daily 5 km ssm dataset during the growing season from april to october in 2016 was produced over the north china plain a preliminary evaluation reveals an overall acceptable accuracy of the estimated ssm with root mean square error of 0 06 m3 m3 and 0 08 m3 m3 when comparing to in situ measurements and microwave ssm product respectively data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture sm is widely recognized as an essential parameter for understating the exchange and feedback of water energy and carbon between the earth s surface and atmosphere doody et al 2017 koster et al 2010 schwingshackl et al 2017 humphrey et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 in general the sm profile can be divided into two sections in the remote sensing community the surface sm ssm that can be directly detected by most of the remote sensing signals and the root zone sm that usually be determined with an indirect manner li et al 2021 traditional ground based measurements usually cannot well capture the spatiotemporal sm variation due to the high heterogeneity of sm across space and time susha et al 2014 babaeian et al 2019 with the rapid developments of remote sensing technology a number of algorithms have been developed to estimate ssm using satellite derived spectral spatial temporal and polarized signals at various scales babaeian et al 2019 li et al 2021 ma et al 2020 specifically the successful in orbit operation of the two dedicated microwave missions of the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap has provided an unprecedented opportunity to obtain global ssm dynamics nowadays a most remarkable satellite ssm product at present is the climate change initiative cci that takes advantage of different active and passive observations including smos smap and other missions available to produce blended ssm datasets with fixed spatial resolution at daily interval gruber et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however a critical issue behind most of the currently available microwave based ssm products is that the coarse spatial resolution mostly at 25 km makes them more feasible in global applications in the contrast most of the applications such as irrigation scheduling flood and drought monitoring with field watershed or regional scale require ssm dataset at finer spatial resolution e g 100 m to 5 km peng et al 2021 among all the commonly used satellite data sources for ssm retrieval active microwave is able to penetrate through clouds in theory and to observe the earth s surface with high spatial resolution however the temporal resolution for most of the currently available active microwave missions is poor and the swath range is commonly narrow making it difficult to obtain frequent ssm estimations over large regions compared to active microwave remote sensing optical and passive microwave are more frequently adopted to estimate ssm at adequate spatiotemporal resolution to fulfill the requirements of ssm dataset for the aforementioned investigations specifically in order to obtain ssm at finer spatial resolution disaggregation algorithms are commonly used to downscale coarse microwave based ssm products into fine spatial resolution where optical observations are provided as auxiliary inputs peng et al 2017 besides many optical based methods can also be used to estimate ssm with finer spatial resolution directly rather than the indirect manner with the downscaling process zhang and zhou 2016 zhao et al 2018 petropoulos et al 2009 however as optical bands are susceptible to clouds ssm retrieval directly from optical data commonly surfers from a major limitation that valid ground observations are not available under cloudy conditions making it a huge challenge to obtain spatially seamless ssm over large regions as a consequence although most of the currently available optical data are adequate for ssm retrieval in the spatiotemporal resolutions no operational optical based ssm product is currently available thus far in the contrast an increasing number of investigations have been focused on the downscaling algorithms for the obtaining of ssm at high spatial resolution from coarse microwave based ssm products peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2020 which should be mostly attributed to the fact that microwave has the ability to penetrate through clouds and thus to obtain ground ssm under all weather conditions in theory although microwave still seems the mainstream for ssm retrieval nowadays and even in the near future a critical issue behind the ssm downscaling is that the accuracy of disaggregated ssm not only depends largely on the original coarse resolution ssm products but also to be greatly affected by the auxiliary parameters in the downscaling algorithms moreover it is noteworthy that most of the currently available downscaling algorithms still require optical data as auxiliary inputs as a result it remains a huge challenge to obtain spatially seamless high spatial resolution ssm simply from the synergetic use of microwave and optical data through downscaling procedure from this perspective although microwave based ssm retrieval has received more attention in comparison to those estimated from optical data nowadays it seems that the straightforward way to obtain ssm at high spatial resolution from optical data is also a feasible alternative and might need to be preferentially encouraged especially under the situations where the radio frequency interference of microwave frequencies has strong impacts or over dense vegetation that microwave based retrieval is not reliable bycontrast due to the capacity of describing vegetation water stress vegetation indices obtained from optical data may show a certain superiority for indirectly reflecting ssm status the trapezoid configuration constituted by spatially distributed land surface temperature lst and fraction vegetation cover fvc is one of the most widely used approaches for estimating ssm content with optical data carlson 2007 wang et al 2011 holzman et al 2014 shafian and maas 2015 sadeghi et al 2017 petropoulos et al 2009 2020 przeździecki and zawadzki 2020 the physicalmechanism for deriving ssm from the trapezoid configuration is actually relying on the decreased sensitivity of ssm to lst with the increasing of fvc petropoulos et al 2009 except for the classical trapezoid based on lst and fvc many different forms of the trapezoid have also been developed for estimating ssm at various spatial scales in recent years gómez et al 2005 sobrino et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 babaeian et al 2018 in the traditional spatially distributed lst and fvc two dimension scatterplots based trapezoid the determination of the trapezoid pixel window and associated trapezoid boundaries i e dry edge and wet edge is an essential step for ssm estimation there are generally two approaches to determine the trapezoid pixel window and boundaries the one is through empirical fitting of pixels within the trapezoid garcia et al 2014 tang et al 2010 the other is through theoretical calculation following the principle of surface energy balance moran et al 1994 long et al 2012 sun 2016 it notes that no matter which approach is used in practices the trapezoid pixel window should have quasi identical atmospheric conditions in theory to make ssm retrievals for each pixel within the trapezoid pixel window spatially comparable meanwhile it also requires full vegetation coverages and ssm dynamics within the trapezoid pixel window to fulfill theinscape of the trapezoid petropoulos et al 2009 sandholt et al 2002 however due to the spatial heterogeneity of atmospheric and underlying surface conditions the determination of the trapezoid pixel window and trapezoid boundaries in practices is commonly a huge challenge especially over large regions li et al 2021 the development of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid has the ability to decrease the dependence of trapezoid based ssm retrieval on the subjective requirement of atmospheric and underlying surface conditions in a previous study leng et al 2017 developed a pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid for estimating ssm the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid differs significantly from the traditional spatially distributed lst and fvc two dimension scatterplots based trapezoid the former assumes a virtual trapezoid uniquely corresponding to each pixel while the latter is constituted by all the pixels within a defined pixel window as a result the concept of the trapezoid pixel window no longer exists for the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid while the determination of the trapezoid boundaries for the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid can only through theoretical calculation following the principle of surface energy balance in recent years a number of algorithms have been proposed to estimate atmospheric variables based on satellite observations tang et al 2006 zhu et al 2017 famiglietti et al 2018 liao et al 2021 among these atmospheric variables the air temperature net surface shortwave radiation and relative humidity are essential to determine the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid via surface energy balance hence one of the main motivations of the present study is to provide a practical framework for estimating ssm content over large regions primarily based on satellite observations since most of the previous investigations can but take advantage of ground meteorological measurements or atmospheric analysis in the determination of the trapezoid boundaries it is evident that the different spatiotemporal resolution between satellite pixels and ground meteorological measurements or atmospheric analysis would probably lead to various degree of uncertainties in the determination of the trapezoid boundaries as well as ssm retrievals another motivation of the present study is to investigate the feasibility of ssm retrieval using the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid under all weather conditions since the aforementioned satellite based retrieval algorithms for estimating atmospheric variables have a certain ability under such circumstances and an increasing number of literatures have also highlighted the feasibility of restoring cloud contaminated pixels and obtaining spatially seamless surface properties in the optical domain martins et al 2019 wu et al 2021 the present study is organized as follows section 2 presents the materials and methods the results and discussion are presented in section 3 and section 4 respectively conclusions will be provided in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 determination of ssm based on trapezoid configuration fig 1 depicts a schematic diagram of traditional trapezoid constituted by the spatially distributed lst and fvc and the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid configuration respectively as for the traditional trapezoid a trapezoid pixel window and the associated boundaries dry edge and wet edge should be primarily determined petropoulos et al 2009 it notes that the trapezoid configuration was constituted by all the pixels within the trapezoid pixel window an assumption behind the traditional trapezoid is that all the pixels within the trapezoid pixel window should have quasi identical atmospheric conditions to make ssm retrievals for each pixel spatially comparable sandholt et al 2002 li et al 2021 moreover the trapezoid pixel window should better contain full range vegetation coverages and ssm dynamics to fulfill the requirements of the inscape of the trapezoid in general these restrictions have greatly constrained the trapezoid based ssm retrieval in practices especially over large regions to overcome these difficulties the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid was developed for each pixel e g p within the study area a virtual trapezoid was assumed to exist and uniquely associated to this pixel specifically the virtual trapezoid of the target pixel can beexclusively determined by two theoretical boundaries the one is theoretical dry edge with zero sm availability m 0 the other is theoretical wet edge with sufficient ssm for evapotranspiration moran et al 1994 firstly provided a solution for the determination of the theoretical boundaries with atmospheric variables including air temperature net surface radiation relative humidity and wind speed in the present study the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid configuration were obtained following the method proposed by moran et al 1994 the theoretical dry and wet boundaries can be expressed as functions of lst to fvc as follows 1 t dry f t v max t s max f t s max 2 t wet f t v min t s min f t s min where f is fvc t dry f and t wet f are the functions of the theoretical dry and wet boundaries to fvc respectively t s max t v max t v min t s min are the lst t s values for the four apexes of the trapezoid i ii iii iv shown in fig 1 a detailed description on the determination of the lst values for the trapezoid apexes can be referred to moran et al 1994 as follows 3 t s max r a r n s g c v t a t s min r a r n s g c v γ δ γ vpd δ γ t a t v max r a r n v g c v γ 1 r cx r a δ γ 1 r cx r a vpd δ γ 1 r cx r a t a t v min r a r n v g c v γ 1 r cp r a δ γ 1 r cp r a vpd δ γ 1 r cp r a t a where r n s and r n v are surface net radiation for soil and vegetation components g is soil heat flux t a is air temperature c v is the volumetric heat capacity of air γ is the psychrometric constant δ is the slope of saturated vapor pressure versus air temperature vpd is the vapor pressure deficit of the air r a is aerodynamic resistance r cx is the canopy resistance associated with nearly complete stomatal closure whereas r cp is canopy resistance at the well watered vegetation condition because the vertical axis of the trapezoid configuration represents lst variation the distances of a and b can be obtained by lsts for the target pixel p and interpolation of the dry and wet edges specifically a and b can be written as follows 4 a t v max t s max f p t s max t s p 5 b t s p t v min t s min f p t s min where f p and t s p are fvc and lst for the target pixel p respectively a and b are the distance of the target pixel to the dry edge and wet edge respectively with the assumption that ssm varies linearly to lst under a given fvc condition m 0 for the target pixel can be written as follows 6 m 0 a a b in general because the theoretical dry edge and wet edge correspond to zero and plenty water available for evapotranspiration volumetric ssm content for the target pixel can be reasonably assumed to fluctuate between a minimum and a maximum volumetric ssm content verstraeten et al 2006 fan et al 2015 as a result volumetric ssm content for the target pixel can be written as follows 7 θ θ max θ min m 0 θ min where θ is volumetric ssm content for the target pixel θ max and θ min are the maximum and minimum ssm content for the pixel respectively 2 2 estimation of atmospheric variables from satellite data following the equation 3 in previous section it is evident that several essential atmospheric variables including air temperature relative humidity net surface radiation and wind speed are required to determine the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel of the trapezoid because no practical algorithms for estimating wind speed over land with satellite data are available at present wind speed data derived from the china meteorology administration land data assimilation system cldas at high spatiotemporal resolution was used in the present study specifically the cldas covers the entire territory of china and surrounding areas between 0 and 60 n and 70 150 e which also generally outperforms several other commonly used atmospheric reanalysis datasets over the mainland china region yang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the outputs of the cldas include atmospheric variables e g solar radiation air temperature specific humidity precipitation wind speed and sm reanalysis in different depths with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 at hourly interval another reason for the selection of the cldas data is due to the relatively high spatial resolution which is also close to the pixel size of the satellite data used in the present study in addition the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis atmospheric and land products were applied to obtain the other three atmospheric variables which is to be illustrated in the following sub sections 2 2 1 determination of t a and rh based on the daily modis atmosphere profile product mod07 l2 that with a spatial resolution of 5 km famiglietti et al 2018 proposed a parameterization scheme to obtain air temperature t a and dew point temperature t d over clear sky pixels through the virtually interpolation of available temperature at atmospheric profile to near surface level by air pressure which can be written as follows 8 z lower r g t lower 273 16 log p surface p lower 9 z upper r g t upper 273 16 log p lower p upper 10 t clear t lower t lower t upper z upper z lower where t clear refers to clear sky t a or t d t lower and t upper are the atmospheric temperature t a or t d given at the nearest lower and higher altitudes respectively p lower and p upper are their corresponding pressure levels respectively p surface is the surface pressure obtained from mod07 l2 r is the gas constant of dry air defined as 287 053 j k kg g is the acceleration of gravity that can be set as 9 8 m s2 following the study by famiglietti et al 2018 and zhu et al 2017 liao et al 2021 further developed a method to obtain rh entirely based on modis data under all weather conditions in their method it is assumed that a linear relationship between t a and lst time series over clear skies for a given pixel exists further the linear relationship is regarded to be feasible over cloudy skies for the same given pixel because mod06 l2 is able to provide lst under all weather conditions t a over cloudy skies can be finally obtained with the linear relationship and mod06 l2 derived lst for the same pixel similarly the linear relationship between actual vapor pressure e a and precipitable water vapor pwv time series over clear skies for a given pixel is also assumed to be feasible over cloudy skies for the same pixel as a consequence e a over cloudy skies for the given pixel can also be obtained with the linear relationship and mod05 l2 derived pwv it should be noted that when cloud occurs the modis channels in the 0 8 2 5 μm generally contain information about absorptions due to water vapor above and within clouds hence the pixels with optically thick clouds could potentially lead to uncertainties for deriving e a following the method proposed by liao et al 2021 based on the estimated t a and e a under all weather conditions rh can be obtained as follows 11 rh e a e s e a a exp b t a t a c where a b and c are constants that can be set as 6 11 hpa 17 502 and 240 97 c respectively 2 2 2 determination of r n at soil and vegetation components following a previous study by kustas and norman 2000 an algorithm to obtain r n at soil and vegetation components was proposed in which transmission of direct and diffuse shortwave radiation and transmission of longwave radiation through the canopy are separately considered specifically soil and vegetation components can be written as follows 12 r n s τ sw 1 α s r g exp k l l a i l sky 1 exp k l l a i l v l s 13 r n v 1 τ sw 1 α v r g 1 exp k l l a i l sky l s 2 l v where τ sw is canopy transmittance of the shortwave radiation α s and α v are soil and vegetation albedos respectively r g is the solar radiation w m2 l sky l v and l s are longwave emissions from the sky vegetation and soil respectively lai refers to leaf area index k l is extinction coefficient that can be commonly set as a constant of 0 95 following previous literatures kustas and norman 2000 tang and li 2017 in the present study the main component of r g namely the net surface shortwave radiation nssr was firstly derived using the algorithm proposed by tang et al 2006 where only modis products were required as inputs specifically nssr over both clear sky and cloudy pixels can be derived using the narrowband apparent reflectance at the top of atmosphere toa as follows 14 nssr α e 0 cos θ s d 2 where α is the flux absorbed at the surface that can be parameterized with toa narrowband reflectance at optical channels e 0 is the toa solar irradiance at one astronomical unit θ s is the solar zenith angle d is the earth sun distance in astronomical units specifically all the modis products required for the determination of nssr include the daily mod021km mod03 mod05 l2 and mod35 l2 that with a spatial resolution of 1 km the detail parameterization of the α and determination of e 0 can refer to tang et al 2006 because solar radiation is mainly the shortwave radiation with the modis derived nssr in equation 14 rg can be obtained as 15 rg nssr 1 a where a refers to land surface albedo 2 3 data description 2 3 1 modis data in the present study the modis atmospheric and land products were used as remote sensing data sources to estimate ssm over the study area the main reason to use the modis data is that it can provide all the required parameters for deriving the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid specifically the fvc at 5 km resolution is obtained from the aggregation of 1 km product of mod13a2 derived normalized difference vegetation index ndvi following the approach proposed by prihodko and goward 1997 moreover the savitzky golay filter is used to improve the quality of the ndvi time series and to obtain spatially complete ndvi for each day by interpolation over the study period following a previous study by moukomla and blanken 2016 lst at 5 km resolution under all sky condition is determined by merging mod11 b1 and mod06 l2 as follows 16 lst m o d 11 1 c mask m o d 06 c mask where mod11 is the lst from mod 11b1 mod06 is the skin temperature derived from mod06 l2 cmask is the cloud mask extracted from mod06 l2 except for the crucial parameter of lst and fvc the essential atmospheric variables are also required to obtain the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid configuration table 1 summarizes the main modis products used in the present study it notes that all the required modis products used in the present study can be freely obtained from the level 1 and atmosphere archive and distribution system distributed active archive center as a registered user https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search 2 3 2 smap data to convert remotely sensed m 0 for each pixel to volumetric ssm content the minimum and maximum ssm values for each pixel are required verstraeten et al 2006 yan et al 2022 previous investigations have developed empirical relationships between soil texture and soil water characteristic such as wilting point and filed capacity gijsman et al 2002 van looy et al 2017 however these empirical relationships were primarily obtained based on limited field sampling and laboratory analyses which can probably lead to uncertainties for estimating soil water characteristic at pixel scale saxton and rawls 2006 in the present study the 9 km soil moisture active passive smap enhanced lever 3 radiometer global daily ssm product https nsidc org data spl3smp e versions 4 over the year 2015 to 2020 is first resampled to 5 km accord with the modis resolution the main reasons for the use of the 9 km smap product in the present study can be generally attributed to two aspects the one is that the smap enhanced lever 3 radiometer global daily ssm product is almost characterized with the highest spatial resolution among currently available global ssm products which can be reasonably resampled to 5 km for further investigations the other is that an overall accuracy with unbiased root mean square error rmse around 0 04 0 05 m3 m3 was obtained from several recent validation activities over varied climates and landscapes which is quite close to the target accuracy of the smap mission 0 04 m3 m3 chan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 for the long term smap measurements at each pixel a minimum percentile level of 5 and maximum percentile level of 95 were used to filter smap outliers the rationale behindthis lies inthe expectation that extreme quantiles better reflect theoretical dry and wet ssm statuses as they approach the distribution extremes hence it is reasonable that the long term smap measurements at the percentile levels of 5 and 95 can be reasonable to approximate the θ min and θ max in this study respectively 2 4 study area the study area in the present investigation includes three provinces hebei henan and shandong and two municipalities beijing and tianjin which is also recognized as the north china plain in addition ssm measurements collected from a total number of 193 stations have been used to evaluate the estimated results over the study area fig 2 specifically the daily averaged ssm observed at a depth of 10 cm and characterized as volumetric content with a physical unit of m3 m3 were used to evaluate the estimated ssm meanwhile ground observations of hourly air temperature and relative humidity were also collected from 15 meteorological stations all these ground based ssm and meteorological measurements were provided by the china meteorological data sever centre https data cma cn en the north china plain is the second largest plain in china that covers an area over 300 thousand square kilometers specifically this region is one of the main agricultural production areas that contributes to nearly one third of total grainoutput of china because ssm is one of the most essential parameters for agricultural activities such as irrigation schedule and yield predication it is very meaningful to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of ssm over this area 3 results 3 1 accuracy assessment of satellite derived atmospheric variables because the atmospheric variables are essential for the determination of the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid it is necessary to investigate the accuracies of the modis derived atmospheric variables over the study area in advance due to the lack of ground based solar radiation or nssr over the study area only the satellite derived air temperature and relative humidity were assessed with ground based observations in the present study nevertheless previous studies have highlighted that the method proposed by tang et al 2006 is capable of estimating reliable nssr using modis products with considerable accuracy inamdar and guillevic 2015 liang et al 2010 in addition a sensitivity analysis will also be implemented to investigate the possible effects of the errors of satellite derived atmospheric variables on the determination of ssm with the proposed approach fig 3 shows the accuracy of satellite derived air temperature and relative humidity versus those observed from the meteorologicalstations over the growing season from april to october 2016 following the results the rmse of air temperature and relative humidity are 2 62 k and 17 9 respectively although biases exist for the satellite derived atmospheric variables it is feasible to further decrease the errors by bias correction over the study area with the bias correction the unbiased rmse for air temperature and relative humidity can decrease to 2 46 k and 15 1 respectively which are generally comparable to previous investigations based on satellite observations zhu et al 2017 liao et al 2021 it is noteworthy that significant scale mismatch between the satellite derived atmospheric variables 5km spatial resolution and ground meteorological observations site specific exist that may affect the assessments however the satellite derived atmospheric variables remain with considerable accuracy which can guarantee the estimation of ssm with the proposed framework in the present study the satellite derived atmospheric variables with bias correction were used in further investigations 3 2 evaluation of estimated ssm with in situ measurements with the modis data listed in table 1 a first daily 5 km ssm dataset during the growing season from april to october in the year 2016 was derived over the study area further ground ssm measurements at the top soil layer with a depth of 10 cm collected at 193 stations were used to assess the accuracy of the estimated ssm specifically a number of literatures have highlighted the systematic differences between satellite derived ssm and ground in situ measurements which can prevent absolute agreement between the two datasets in time series lee and im 2015 zeng et al 2020 as a consequence the direct comparison of two datasets with different spatial scales e g satellite derived ssm at pixel scale and in situ ssm measurements at site scale is commonly not encouraged to this end the cumulative distribution function cdf matching technique was used in the present study to remove systematic differences between satellite and site specific ssm data drusch et al 2005 the principle of the cdf can be regarded as an enhanced nonlinear procedure to rescale satellite derived ssm time series in such a way that its cdf matches the cdf of in situ ssm measurements the cdf commonly includes two steps first the differences in ssm values between the corresponding elements of each ranked data set are consecutively computed second these differences are plotted against the satellite derived ssm and a fitting function is used to calculate the bias corrected ssm brocca et al 2011 in recent years the cdf matching technique has been widely used to assess satellite derived ssm al bitar et al 2017 tekeli and fouli 2017 liu et al 2022 to assess the estimated results the present study firstly takes the first day for each month over the growing season from april to october as an example to compare the ground ssm measurements collected at the 193 stations and the estimated ssm with the application of cdf matching fig 4 depicts the comparison of the estimated ssm and in situ measurements for the selected days following the results it is evident that estimated ssm was well correlated to ground in situ ssm measurements with an overall determination of coefficient of 0 288 and a rmse of approximately 0 066 m3 m3 indicating that the estimated ssm can achieve acceptable performances over the study area it can be found that many ground in situ measurements are grouped in lines the main reason should be attributed to the fact that only two significant digits were kept for the ground ssm observations although this would somewhat affect the evaluation it is still reasonable that the estimated ssm can fairly reflect the ssm dynamics nevertheless more accurate ground ssm measurements are required to further assess the proposed method in the ongoing work to further assess the satellite derived ssm dataset the estimated ssm time series over the growing season for each station was investigated fig 5 depicts the rmse of the ground in situ ssm measurements versus estimated ssm at each sm station over the study period from april to october 2016 with the application of the cdf matching approach among all the 193 sm stations about 42 and 90 of the total stations were with rmse under 0 05 m3 m3 and under 0 10 m3 m3 respectively additionally a small percentage of approximately 10 of the total stations reveal relatively high rmse over 0 10 m3 m3 furthermore an average rmse of approximately 0 061 m3 m3 was obtained for all the 193 stations over the study period all these results has further confirmed that the proposed approach can generally well capture the overall variations of in situ ssm over the study period 3 3 evaluation of estimated ssm with smap product assessments with the ground in situ ssm measurements indicted that the proposed approach can generally obtain ssm with acceptable accuracy however the ground in situ measurements are discretely distributed and thus it is still expected to better understand the behaviors of satellite derived ssm dataset on the entire study region and study period traditionally such constrains can be well compensated by evaluating with widely used gridded ssm datasets yin et al 2020 wang et al 2021 to this end the 9 km smap daily product was conducted to evaluate the satellite derived ssm over the entire study area and study period due to the relatively high spatial resolution and accuracy of the smap product that widely used in agricultural applications lawston et al 2017 sadri et al 2018 specifically to match the pixel size of the satellite derived ssm the 9 km smap daily ssm product was finally resampled to 5 km with the nearest neighbor resampling method fig 6 depicts the distribution of rmse between the two datasets over the study period from april to october 2016 it is obvious that rmse over the study area is within a reasonable range where the majority of the entire pixels are with rmse under 0 10 m3 m3 from the perspective of visual discrimination it is obvious that pixels with large rmse generally occur over the mountain areas in south henan province the coastal regions of shandong and hebei provinces and mountain forest regions in the north of beijing in the contrast it is noteworthy that grassland over the north of hebei province reveals the overall best accuracy with rmse around 0 05 m3 m3 except for these the dominated cropland over the study area exhibits a moderate accuracy between 0 05 and 0 10 m3 m3 fig 7 depicts the frequencydistributionof rmse for the entire pixels over the study area following the statistics the percentages of rmse under 0 05 m3 m3 and 0 10 m3 m3 are 14 3 and 73 4 respectively furthermore an average rmse of approximately 0 084 m3 m3 with a medium value of approximately 0 080 m3 m3 were obtained for the entire pixels over the study period these results have further confirmed the reliability of the estimated ssm with the proposed method in addition to the metric of rmse the characteristic of bias was also investigated fig 8 depicts the distribution of bias between the satellite derived ssm and smap product over the study period from april to october 2016 similar to the rmse it is obvious that significant bias generally occurs over the regions where larger rmse appears except for these regions bias for most of the pixels generally varied within a small range between 0 05 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 fig 9 shows the frequencydistribution of bias for the entire pixels over the study area it is obvious that bias for the pixels generally concentrated well following the statistics approximately 85 7 of the total pixels reveal slight bias of 0 05 m3 m3 furthermore an average bias of approximately 0 015 m3 m3 with a medium value of approximately 0 012 m3 m3 were obtained for the entire pixels over the study period indicating a considerable consistency of the two ssm datasets based on all these results it is evident that the proposed method can generally obtain reliable ssm over the study area 3 4 ssm retrieval accuracy over different land cover types following previous results it is noteworthy that the accuracy of satellite derived ssm generally varied with land cover types with respect to either provide better recommendations for potential users of the satellite derived ssm dataset or to further support the improvements of ssm retrieval with the proposed approach it is of great interests to investigate the performances of the estimated ssm dataset across different land cover types following the land cover types over the study area shown in fig 1 the present study primarily investigated three major land cover types including cropland natural vegetation mosaic grasslands and forest fig 10 depicts the accuracy statistics of satellite derived ssm and smap product over the three dominant land cover types over the study area it is obvious that best accuracy can be found over grasslands where the average rmse is around 0 062 m3 m3 in addition the forest pixels revealed an average rmse of approximately 0 072 m3 m3 which is slightly lower than that of the grasslands as for the dominated pixels labeled as cropland natural vegetation mosaic a decreased average rmse of approximately 0 084 m3 m3 was obtained over the study area indicating that the most significant uncertainty for ssm retrieval with the proposed approach is most likely to appear over cropland natural vegetation mosaic in the contrast the grasslands can probably the most credible ssm estimates although further investigations are required to explain these results a possible reason can be attributed to the irrigations for the croplands over the growing season while grasslands are commonly in astateofnatural growth since several previous literatures have also highlighted the decreased accuracy of satellite derived ssm while frequent irrigation events happen fan et al 2015 fontanet et al 2018 kim et al 2020 4 discussion 4 1 sensitive analysis following previous section it is evident that the proposed approach can obtain spatially ssm with generally acceptable accuracy when compared with ground in situ measurements and microwave ssm product nevertheless it is noteworthy that errors could still exist in both the atmospheric and land variables for the proposed framework for estimating ssm making it necessary to further investigate the possible impacts of the errors in the remotely sensed inputs on ssm retrieval to this end a sensitive analysis is conducted in the present study to address this issue in the present study the variable controllingapproach was used to investigate the sensitivity of each input on the determination of ssm with the proposed framework specifically the variable controllingapproach was conducted with a perturbated variable while the other variables remain unchanged following the essential inputs shown in table 1 the sensitive analysis of five variables including lst fvc t a nssr and rh were considered in the present study it is noteworthy that gaussian distribution with different variances were considered for these variables specifically random errors in modis derived lst were regarded to obey the gaussian distribution with a variance of 1 σ 1 whereas modis derived fvc were considered to obey the gaussian distribution with a variance of 0 01 σ 0 1 moreover the variances of the gaussian distribution for t a nssr and rh were set as 4 σ 2 400 σ 20 and 0 0225 σ 15 respectively taking the in situ ssm measurements collected at the 193 stations on every first day from april to october 2016 as an example table 2 shows the comparisons of ssm derived from the variable controllingapproach derived ssm and the original ssm estimation it is obvious from table 2 that the accuracy of t a has a most significant effects on ssm retrieval based on the proposed approach specifically a standarddeviationof 2 k in ta can lead to ssm estimation with an rmse of approximately 0 054 m3 m3 in addition a standarddeviation of 1 k and 0 1 in lst and fvc respectively has similar impacts on ssm retrieval 0 034 m3 m3 and 0 033 m3 m3 respectively in comparison to these three variables errors in rh and nssr have less impacts on ssm retrieval with rmses approximately 0 022 m3 m3 and 0 014 m3 m3 respectively results from the sensitive analysis indicate that any remotely sensed input can lead to errors for ssm retrieval following the method for obtaining the theoretical boundaries by moran et al 1994 it is obvious that t a was used as a crucial item to directly determine the theoretical boundary hence it is quite reasonable that the accuracy of t a has a significant impact on ssm retrieval with the trapezoid based approaches meanwhile although with less impacts it also notes that nssr and rh are essential inputs to determine the theoretical boundary of the trapezoid configuration and will also affect ssm retrieval to some extent furthermore following the trapezoid configuration shown in fig 1 it is evident that the location for the target pixel within the trapezoid configuration completely depends on the lst and fvc values for the pixel hence errors in these two variables can also seriously affect the location of the target pixel as well as the determination of m 0 and ssm retrieval 4 2 comparison with previous investigations compared to previous methods for deriving ssm with optical observations under all weather conditions the present study primarily reveals two superiorities the one is that except for the wind speed the other atmospheric variables for the determination of the theoretical trapezoid boundaries were derived from satellite observations thus no longer depend on ground observations assimilated products or reanalysis data that commonly used in previous investigations it notes that ground observations are available only in a few geographic locations worldwide whereas assimilated products or reanalysis data cannot well match the transit time of remotely sensed images as a consequence the mismatch between satellite overpassing time and observation time of atmospheric variables through traditional manners can inevitably result in uncertainties for ssm retrieval with the trapezoid based approaches with this in mind the superiority enables to obtain synchronous lst and atmospheric variables based on satellite observations which can potentially eliminate possible uncertainties lead by time inconsistencies between remotely sensed images and atmospheric variables the other superiority is that ssm over cloudy pixels were also determined with the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid configuration which is the same with the clear sky pixels in previous studies ssm over cloudy pixels were estimated either from atmospheric variables derived aerodynamic and surface resistance or based on disaggregation process where auxiliary data were required leng et al 2017 leng et al 2019 it is obvious that resistance parameters are difficult to determine accurately with satellite data at present furthermore most of the currently available disaggregation algorithms also suffer from various challenges such as the unavailability of valid satellite observations over cloudy pixels and the quantification of scaling effects from this perspective the present study has provided another alternative to estimate ssm over cloudy pixels more specifically the present study reveals an overall slightly better accuracy 0 06 m3 m3 than previous investigations 0 07 to 0 08 m3 m3 when comparing with ground in situ measurements leng et al 2017 4 3 further developments the present study provides a practical approach for deriving ssm primarily from remotely sensed data although with reasonable accuracy when comparing to ground in situ measurements and smap product several critical issues remain to be addressed in further investigations based on the sensitive analysis it is noteworthy that t a reveals significant impacts on ssm retrieval with the proposed approach up to present although several algorithms have been developed to derive t a from remotely sensed data the accuracy for most of the currently available algorithms exhibits an accuracy of approximately 2 to 3 k which is significantly lower than that observed from ground meteorological stations hence it is quite necessary to develop practical algorithm for deriving t a as well as other atmospheric variables from satellite data with high accuracy in future developments specifically the accurate determination of these atmospheric variables under cloudy conditions should be seriously investigated another issue is with respect to the validation of satellite derived ssm at pixel scale as we known it is quite difficult to obtain actual ssm ground truth at pixel level at present hence the present study takes the cdf matching approach to remove the systematic differences between satellite ssm and ground in situ measurements nevertheless the satellite derived ssm after the application of cdf matching approach is only to make its cdf matches the cdf of ground in situ measurements rather than to provide actual ssm at pixel level as a consequence it is recommended to develop feasible methods for obtaining ground ssm truth in further developments to this end the neutron probe can be a promising way to detect ground ssm within a certain area circle region with radius of 300 to 500 m rather than the traditional methods that can observe ssm with only a limited spatial representativeness e g a maximum of a few square meters due to the high spatiotemporal of ssm over heterogeneous surfaces a last issue is to further investigate the performances of the proposed approach across different land cover types and climate patterns since the preliminary evaluation indicates that satellite derived ssm generally reveals better accuracy over grasslands than that over forest regions or croplands natural vegetation mosaic this is not only a necessary ongoing work before applying the approach over large regions but also beneficial to further improve the approach for obtaining better ssm estimates 5 conclusions the present study provides a practical framework for obtaining ssm dataset primarily based on satellite data in this framework the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid was used to estimate ssm specifically the theoretical boundaries of the trapezoid was determined through the principle of surface energy balance where satellite derived atmospheric variables were provided as essential inputs with the proposed framework a daily 5 km ssm dataset over the north china plain during the growing season from april to october 2016 was finally obtained specifically compared to previous approaches using meteorological variables derived resistance parameters or by means of disaggregation processes the present study provided another alternative for deriving ssm over cloudy pixels which has a potential to decrease the dependence of ssm retrieval on auxiliary data accuracy assessments with both in situ measurements and smap product indicates that the estimated ssm reveals generally acceptable accuracy over the study area with an overall rmse of 0 06 m3 m3 and 0 08 m3 m3 respectively in summary the present study has successfully achieved ssm retrieval from currently available satellite observations indicating a promising approach for the generation of spatially seamless ssm dataset in future developments credit authorship contribution statement pei leng conceptualization

2895,the trapezoid configuration constituted by spatially distributed land surface temperature lst and fraction vegetation cover fvc has been widely used for estimating surface soil moisture ssm with satellite data however the trapezoid based methods still suffer from a major challenge that the determination of the trapezoid pixel window is always subjective because it requires quasi identical atmospheric conditions to make ssm retrievals for each pixel spatially comparable meanwhile the trapezoid pixel window should also contain full vegetation coverages and ssm dynamics to fulfill theinscape of the trapezoid due to the heterogeneity of atmospheric variables and underlying surfaces it is commonly difficult to determine a proper trapezoid pixel window in practices the development of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid aims to decrease the dependence of trapezoid based ssm retrieval on the subjective requirements of quasi identical atmospheric conditions full vegetation coverages and ssm dynamics in the present study for each pixel over the north china plain a unique virtual trapezoid was created and the theoretical boundaries were determined following the principle of surface energy balance where satellite derived essential atmospheric variables of air temperature net surface shortwave radiation and relative humidity were provided as inputs based on the proposed approach a daily 5 km ssm dataset during the growing season from april to october in 2016 was produced over the north china plain a preliminary evaluation reveals an overall acceptable accuracy of the estimated ssm with root mean square error of 0 06 m3 m3 and 0 08 m3 m3 when comparing to in situ measurements and microwave ssm product respectively data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction soil moisture sm is widely recognized as an essential parameter for understating the exchange and feedback of water energy and carbon between the earth s surface and atmosphere doody et al 2017 koster et al 2010 schwingshackl et al 2017 humphrey et al 2021 zhao et al 2017 in general the sm profile can be divided into two sections in the remote sensing community the surface sm ssm that can be directly detected by most of the remote sensing signals and the root zone sm that usually be determined with an indirect manner li et al 2021 traditional ground based measurements usually cannot well capture the spatiotemporal sm variation due to the high heterogeneity of sm across space and time susha et al 2014 babaeian et al 2019 with the rapid developments of remote sensing technology a number of algorithms have been developed to estimate ssm using satellite derived spectral spatial temporal and polarized signals at various scales babaeian et al 2019 li et al 2021 ma et al 2020 specifically the successful in orbit operation of the two dedicated microwave missions of the soil moisture and ocean salinity smos and soil moisture active passive smap has provided an unprecedented opportunity to obtain global ssm dynamics nowadays a most remarkable satellite ssm product at present is the climate change initiative cci that takes advantage of different active and passive observations including smos smap and other missions available to produce blended ssm datasets with fixed spatial resolution at daily interval gruber et al 2019 wang et al 2021 however a critical issue behind most of the currently available microwave based ssm products is that the coarse spatial resolution mostly at 25 km makes them more feasible in global applications in the contrast most of the applications such as irrigation scheduling flood and drought monitoring with field watershed or regional scale require ssm dataset at finer spatial resolution e g 100 m to 5 km peng et al 2021 among all the commonly used satellite data sources for ssm retrieval active microwave is able to penetrate through clouds in theory and to observe the earth s surface with high spatial resolution however the temporal resolution for most of the currently available active microwave missions is poor and the swath range is commonly narrow making it difficult to obtain frequent ssm estimations over large regions compared to active microwave remote sensing optical and passive microwave are more frequently adopted to estimate ssm at adequate spatiotemporal resolution to fulfill the requirements of ssm dataset for the aforementioned investigations specifically in order to obtain ssm at finer spatial resolution disaggregation algorithms are commonly used to downscale coarse microwave based ssm products into fine spatial resolution where optical observations are provided as auxiliary inputs peng et al 2017 besides many optical based methods can also be used to estimate ssm with finer spatial resolution directly rather than the indirect manner with the downscaling process zhang and zhou 2016 zhao et al 2018 petropoulos et al 2009 however as optical bands are susceptible to clouds ssm retrieval directly from optical data commonly surfers from a major limitation that valid ground observations are not available under cloudy conditions making it a huge challenge to obtain spatially seamless ssm over large regions as a consequence although most of the currently available optical data are adequate for ssm retrieval in the spatiotemporal resolutions no operational optical based ssm product is currently available thus far in the contrast an increasing number of investigations have been focused on the downscaling algorithms for the obtaining of ssm at high spatial resolution from coarse microwave based ssm products peng et al 2017 sabaghy et al 2020 which should be mostly attributed to the fact that microwave has the ability to penetrate through clouds and thus to obtain ground ssm under all weather conditions in theory although microwave still seems the mainstream for ssm retrieval nowadays and even in the near future a critical issue behind the ssm downscaling is that the accuracy of disaggregated ssm not only depends largely on the original coarse resolution ssm products but also to be greatly affected by the auxiliary parameters in the downscaling algorithms moreover it is noteworthy that most of the currently available downscaling algorithms still require optical data as auxiliary inputs as a result it remains a huge challenge to obtain spatially seamless high spatial resolution ssm simply from the synergetic use of microwave and optical data through downscaling procedure from this perspective although microwave based ssm retrieval has received more attention in comparison to those estimated from optical data nowadays it seems that the straightforward way to obtain ssm at high spatial resolution from optical data is also a feasible alternative and might need to be preferentially encouraged especially under the situations where the radio frequency interference of microwave frequencies has strong impacts or over dense vegetation that microwave based retrieval is not reliable bycontrast due to the capacity of describing vegetation water stress vegetation indices obtained from optical data may show a certain superiority for indirectly reflecting ssm status the trapezoid configuration constituted by spatially distributed land surface temperature lst and fraction vegetation cover fvc is one of the most widely used approaches for estimating ssm content with optical data carlson 2007 wang et al 2011 holzman et al 2014 shafian and maas 2015 sadeghi et al 2017 petropoulos et al 2009 2020 przeździecki and zawadzki 2020 the physicalmechanism for deriving ssm from the trapezoid configuration is actually relying on the decreased sensitivity of ssm to lst with the increasing of fvc petropoulos et al 2009 except for the classical trapezoid based on lst and fvc many different forms of the trapezoid have also been developed for estimating ssm at various spatial scales in recent years gómez et al 2005 sobrino et al 2007 zhang et al 2015 babaeian et al 2018 in the traditional spatially distributed lst and fvc two dimension scatterplots based trapezoid the determination of the trapezoid pixel window and associated trapezoid boundaries i e dry edge and wet edge is an essential step for ssm estimation there are generally two approaches to determine the trapezoid pixel window and boundaries the one is through empirical fitting of pixels within the trapezoid garcia et al 2014 tang et al 2010 the other is through theoretical calculation following the principle of surface energy balance moran et al 1994 long et al 2012 sun 2016 it notes that no matter which approach is used in practices the trapezoid pixel window should have quasi identical atmospheric conditions in theory to make ssm retrievals for each pixel within the trapezoid pixel window spatially comparable meanwhile it also requires full vegetation coverages and ssm dynamics within the trapezoid pixel window to fulfill theinscape of the trapezoid petropoulos et al 2009 sandholt et al 2002 however due to the spatial heterogeneity of atmospheric and underlying surface conditions the determination of the trapezoid pixel window and trapezoid boundaries in practices is commonly a huge challenge especially over large regions li et al 2021 the development of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid has the ability to decrease the dependence of trapezoid based ssm retrieval on the subjective requirement of atmospheric and underlying surface conditions in a previous study leng et al 2017 developed a pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid for estimating ssm the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid differs significantly from the traditional spatially distributed lst and fvc two dimension scatterplots based trapezoid the former assumes a virtual trapezoid uniquely corresponding to each pixel while the latter is constituted by all the pixels within a defined pixel window as a result the concept of the trapezoid pixel window no longer exists for the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid while the determination of the trapezoid boundaries for the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid can only through theoretical calculation following the principle of surface energy balance in recent years a number of algorithms have been proposed to estimate atmospheric variables based on satellite observations tang et al 2006 zhu et al 2017 famiglietti et al 2018 liao et al 2021 among these atmospheric variables the air temperature net surface shortwave radiation and relative humidity are essential to determine the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid via surface energy balance hence one of the main motivations of the present study is to provide a practical framework for estimating ssm content over large regions primarily based on satellite observations since most of the previous investigations can but take advantage of ground meteorological measurements or atmospheric analysis in the determination of the trapezoid boundaries it is evident that the different spatiotemporal resolution between satellite pixels and ground meteorological measurements or atmospheric analysis would probably lead to various degree of uncertainties in the determination of the trapezoid boundaries as well as ssm retrievals another motivation of the present study is to investigate the feasibility of ssm retrieval using the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid under all weather conditions since the aforementioned satellite based retrieval algorithms for estimating atmospheric variables have a certain ability under such circumstances and an increasing number of literatures have also highlighted the feasibility of restoring cloud contaminated pixels and obtaining spatially seamless surface properties in the optical domain martins et al 2019 wu et al 2021 the present study is organized as follows section 2 presents the materials and methods the results and discussion are presented in section 3 and section 4 respectively conclusions will be provided in section 5 2 materials and methods 2 1 determination of ssm based on trapezoid configuration fig 1 depicts a schematic diagram of traditional trapezoid constituted by the spatially distributed lst and fvc and the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid configuration respectively as for the traditional trapezoid a trapezoid pixel window and the associated boundaries dry edge and wet edge should be primarily determined petropoulos et al 2009 it notes that the trapezoid configuration was constituted by all the pixels within the trapezoid pixel window an assumption behind the traditional trapezoid is that all the pixels within the trapezoid pixel window should have quasi identical atmospheric conditions to make ssm retrievals for each pixel spatially comparable sandholt et al 2002 li et al 2021 moreover the trapezoid pixel window should better contain full range vegetation coverages and ssm dynamics to fulfill the requirements of the inscape of the trapezoid in general these restrictions have greatly constrained the trapezoid based ssm retrieval in practices especially over large regions to overcome these difficulties the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid was developed for each pixel e g p within the study area a virtual trapezoid was assumed to exist and uniquely associated to this pixel specifically the virtual trapezoid of the target pixel can beexclusively determined by two theoretical boundaries the one is theoretical dry edge with zero sm availability m 0 the other is theoretical wet edge with sufficient ssm for evapotranspiration moran et al 1994 firstly provided a solution for the determination of the theoretical boundaries with atmospheric variables including air temperature net surface radiation relative humidity and wind speed in the present study the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid configuration were obtained following the method proposed by moran et al 1994 the theoretical dry and wet boundaries can be expressed as functions of lst to fvc as follows 1 t dry f t v max t s max f t s max 2 t wet f t v min t s min f t s min where f is fvc t dry f and t wet f are the functions of the theoretical dry and wet boundaries to fvc respectively t s max t v max t v min t s min are the lst t s values for the four apexes of the trapezoid i ii iii iv shown in fig 1 a detailed description on the determination of the lst values for the trapezoid apexes can be referred to moran et al 1994 as follows 3 t s max r a r n s g c v t a t s min r a r n s g c v γ δ γ vpd δ γ t a t v max r a r n v g c v γ 1 r cx r a δ γ 1 r cx r a vpd δ γ 1 r cx r a t a t v min r a r n v g c v γ 1 r cp r a δ γ 1 r cp r a vpd δ γ 1 r cp r a t a where r n s and r n v are surface net radiation for soil and vegetation components g is soil heat flux t a is air temperature c v is the volumetric heat capacity of air γ is the psychrometric constant δ is the slope of saturated vapor pressure versus air temperature vpd is the vapor pressure deficit of the air r a is aerodynamic resistance r cx is the canopy resistance associated with nearly complete stomatal closure whereas r cp is canopy resistance at the well watered vegetation condition because the vertical axis of the trapezoid configuration represents lst variation the distances of a and b can be obtained by lsts for the target pixel p and interpolation of the dry and wet edges specifically a and b can be written as follows 4 a t v max t s max f p t s max t s p 5 b t s p t v min t s min f p t s min where f p and t s p are fvc and lst for the target pixel p respectively a and b are the distance of the target pixel to the dry edge and wet edge respectively with the assumption that ssm varies linearly to lst under a given fvc condition m 0 for the target pixel can be written as follows 6 m 0 a a b in general because the theoretical dry edge and wet edge correspond to zero and plenty water available for evapotranspiration volumetric ssm content for the target pixel can be reasonably assumed to fluctuate between a minimum and a maximum volumetric ssm content verstraeten et al 2006 fan et al 2015 as a result volumetric ssm content for the target pixel can be written as follows 7 θ θ max θ min m 0 θ min where θ is volumetric ssm content for the target pixel θ max and θ min are the maximum and minimum ssm content for the pixel respectively 2 2 estimation of atmospheric variables from satellite data following the equation 3 in previous section it is evident that several essential atmospheric variables including air temperature relative humidity net surface radiation and wind speed are required to determine the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel of the trapezoid because no practical algorithms for estimating wind speed over land with satellite data are available at present wind speed data derived from the china meteorology administration land data assimilation system cldas at high spatiotemporal resolution was used in the present study specifically the cldas covers the entire territory of china and surrounding areas between 0 and 60 n and 70 150 e which also generally outperforms several other commonly used atmospheric reanalysis datasets over the mainland china region yang et al 2017 liu et al 2019 the outputs of the cldas include atmospheric variables e g solar radiation air temperature specific humidity precipitation wind speed and sm reanalysis in different depths with a spatial resolution of 0 0625 at hourly interval another reason for the selection of the cldas data is due to the relatively high spatial resolution which is also close to the pixel size of the satellite data used in the present study in addition the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis atmospheric and land products were applied to obtain the other three atmospheric variables which is to be illustrated in the following sub sections 2 2 1 determination of t a and rh based on the daily modis atmosphere profile product mod07 l2 that with a spatial resolution of 5 km famiglietti et al 2018 proposed a parameterization scheme to obtain air temperature t a and dew point temperature t d over clear sky pixels through the virtually interpolation of available temperature at atmospheric profile to near surface level by air pressure which can be written as follows 8 z lower r g t lower 273 16 log p surface p lower 9 z upper r g t upper 273 16 log p lower p upper 10 t clear t lower t lower t upper z upper z lower where t clear refers to clear sky t a or t d t lower and t upper are the atmospheric temperature t a or t d given at the nearest lower and higher altitudes respectively p lower and p upper are their corresponding pressure levels respectively p surface is the surface pressure obtained from mod07 l2 r is the gas constant of dry air defined as 287 053 j k kg g is the acceleration of gravity that can be set as 9 8 m s2 following the study by famiglietti et al 2018 and zhu et al 2017 liao et al 2021 further developed a method to obtain rh entirely based on modis data under all weather conditions in their method it is assumed that a linear relationship between t a and lst time series over clear skies for a given pixel exists further the linear relationship is regarded to be feasible over cloudy skies for the same given pixel because mod06 l2 is able to provide lst under all weather conditions t a over cloudy skies can be finally obtained with the linear relationship and mod06 l2 derived lst for the same pixel similarly the linear relationship between actual vapor pressure e a and precipitable water vapor pwv time series over clear skies for a given pixel is also assumed to be feasible over cloudy skies for the same pixel as a consequence e a over cloudy skies for the given pixel can also be obtained with the linear relationship and mod05 l2 derived pwv it should be noted that when cloud occurs the modis channels in the 0 8 2 5 μm generally contain information about absorptions due to water vapor above and within clouds hence the pixels with optically thick clouds could potentially lead to uncertainties for deriving e a following the method proposed by liao et al 2021 based on the estimated t a and e a under all weather conditions rh can be obtained as follows 11 rh e a e s e a a exp b t a t a c where a b and c are constants that can be set as 6 11 hpa 17 502 and 240 97 c respectively 2 2 2 determination of r n at soil and vegetation components following a previous study by kustas and norman 2000 an algorithm to obtain r n at soil and vegetation components was proposed in which transmission of direct and diffuse shortwave radiation and transmission of longwave radiation through the canopy are separately considered specifically soil and vegetation components can be written as follows 12 r n s τ sw 1 α s r g exp k l l a i l sky 1 exp k l l a i l v l s 13 r n v 1 τ sw 1 α v r g 1 exp k l l a i l sky l s 2 l v where τ sw is canopy transmittance of the shortwave radiation α s and α v are soil and vegetation albedos respectively r g is the solar radiation w m2 l sky l v and l s are longwave emissions from the sky vegetation and soil respectively lai refers to leaf area index k l is extinction coefficient that can be commonly set as a constant of 0 95 following previous literatures kustas and norman 2000 tang and li 2017 in the present study the main component of r g namely the net surface shortwave radiation nssr was firstly derived using the algorithm proposed by tang et al 2006 where only modis products were required as inputs specifically nssr over both clear sky and cloudy pixels can be derived using the narrowband apparent reflectance at the top of atmosphere toa as follows 14 nssr α e 0 cos θ s d 2 where α is the flux absorbed at the surface that can be parameterized with toa narrowband reflectance at optical channels e 0 is the toa solar irradiance at one astronomical unit θ s is the solar zenith angle d is the earth sun distance in astronomical units specifically all the modis products required for the determination of nssr include the daily mod021km mod03 mod05 l2 and mod35 l2 that with a spatial resolution of 1 km the detail parameterization of the α and determination of e 0 can refer to tang et al 2006 because solar radiation is mainly the shortwave radiation with the modis derived nssr in equation 14 rg can be obtained as 15 rg nssr 1 a where a refers to land surface albedo 2 3 data description 2 3 1 modis data in the present study the modis atmospheric and land products were used as remote sensing data sources to estimate ssm over the study area the main reason to use the modis data is that it can provide all the required parameters for deriving the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid specifically the fvc at 5 km resolution is obtained from the aggregation of 1 km product of mod13a2 derived normalized difference vegetation index ndvi following the approach proposed by prihodko and goward 1997 moreover the savitzky golay filter is used to improve the quality of the ndvi time series and to obtain spatially complete ndvi for each day by interpolation over the study period following a previous study by moukomla and blanken 2016 lst at 5 km resolution under all sky condition is determined by merging mod11 b1 and mod06 l2 as follows 16 lst m o d 11 1 c mask m o d 06 c mask where mod11 is the lst from mod 11b1 mod06 is the skin temperature derived from mod06 l2 cmask is the cloud mask extracted from mod06 l2 except for the crucial parameter of lst and fvc the essential atmospheric variables are also required to obtain the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid configuration table 1 summarizes the main modis products used in the present study it notes that all the required modis products used in the present study can be freely obtained from the level 1 and atmosphere archive and distribution system distributed active archive center as a registered user https ladsweb modaps eosdis nasa gov search 2 3 2 smap data to convert remotely sensed m 0 for each pixel to volumetric ssm content the minimum and maximum ssm values for each pixel are required verstraeten et al 2006 yan et al 2022 previous investigations have developed empirical relationships between soil texture and soil water characteristic such as wilting point and filed capacity gijsman et al 2002 van looy et al 2017 however these empirical relationships were primarily obtained based on limited field sampling and laboratory analyses which can probably lead to uncertainties for estimating soil water characteristic at pixel scale saxton and rawls 2006 in the present study the 9 km soil moisture active passive smap enhanced lever 3 radiometer global daily ssm product https nsidc org data spl3smp e versions 4 over the year 2015 to 2020 is first resampled to 5 km accord with the modis resolution the main reasons for the use of the 9 km smap product in the present study can be generally attributed to two aspects the one is that the smap enhanced lever 3 radiometer global daily ssm product is almost characterized with the highest spatial resolution among currently available global ssm products which can be reasonably resampled to 5 km for further investigations the other is that an overall accuracy with unbiased root mean square error rmse around 0 04 0 05 m3 m3 was obtained from several recent validation activities over varied climates and landscapes which is quite close to the target accuracy of the smap mission 0 04 m3 m3 chan et al 2018 zhang et al 2018 for the long term smap measurements at each pixel a minimum percentile level of 5 and maximum percentile level of 95 were used to filter smap outliers the rationale behindthis lies inthe expectation that extreme quantiles better reflect theoretical dry and wet ssm statuses as they approach the distribution extremes hence it is reasonable that the long term smap measurements at the percentile levels of 5 and 95 can be reasonable to approximate the θ min and θ max in this study respectively 2 4 study area the study area in the present investigation includes three provinces hebei henan and shandong and two municipalities beijing and tianjin which is also recognized as the north china plain in addition ssm measurements collected from a total number of 193 stations have been used to evaluate the estimated results over the study area fig 2 specifically the daily averaged ssm observed at a depth of 10 cm and characterized as volumetric content with a physical unit of m3 m3 were used to evaluate the estimated ssm meanwhile ground observations of hourly air temperature and relative humidity were also collected from 15 meteorological stations all these ground based ssm and meteorological measurements were provided by the china meteorological data sever centre https data cma cn en the north china plain is the second largest plain in china that covers an area over 300 thousand square kilometers specifically this region is one of the main agricultural production areas that contributes to nearly one third of total grainoutput of china because ssm is one of the most essential parameters for agricultural activities such as irrigation schedule and yield predication it is very meaningful to obtain the spatiotemporal distribution and dynamics of ssm over this area 3 results 3 1 accuracy assessment of satellite derived atmospheric variables because the atmospheric variables are essential for the determination of the theoretical boundaries of the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid it is necessary to investigate the accuracies of the modis derived atmospheric variables over the study area in advance due to the lack of ground based solar radiation or nssr over the study area only the satellite derived air temperature and relative humidity were assessed with ground based observations in the present study nevertheless previous studies have highlighted that the method proposed by tang et al 2006 is capable of estimating reliable nssr using modis products with considerable accuracy inamdar and guillevic 2015 liang et al 2010 in addition a sensitivity analysis will also be implemented to investigate the possible effects of the errors of satellite derived atmospheric variables on the determination of ssm with the proposed approach fig 3 shows the accuracy of satellite derived air temperature and relative humidity versus those observed from the meteorologicalstations over the growing season from april to october 2016 following the results the rmse of air temperature and relative humidity are 2 62 k and 17 9 respectively although biases exist for the satellite derived atmospheric variables it is feasible to further decrease the errors by bias correction over the study area with the bias correction the unbiased rmse for air temperature and relative humidity can decrease to 2 46 k and 15 1 respectively which are generally comparable to previous investigations based on satellite observations zhu et al 2017 liao et al 2021 it is noteworthy that significant scale mismatch between the satellite derived atmospheric variables 5km spatial resolution and ground meteorological observations site specific exist that may affect the assessments however the satellite derived atmospheric variables remain with considerable accuracy which can guarantee the estimation of ssm with the proposed framework in the present study the satellite derived atmospheric variables with bias correction were used in further investigations 3 2 evaluation of estimated ssm with in situ measurements with the modis data listed in table 1 a first daily 5 km ssm dataset during the growing season from april to october in the year 2016 was derived over the study area further ground ssm measurements at the top soil layer with a depth of 10 cm collected at 193 stations were used to assess the accuracy of the estimated ssm specifically a number of literatures have highlighted the systematic differences between satellite derived ssm and ground in situ measurements which can prevent absolute agreement between the two datasets in time series lee and im 2015 zeng et al 2020 as a consequence the direct comparison of two datasets with different spatial scales e g satellite derived ssm at pixel scale and in situ ssm measurements at site scale is commonly not encouraged to this end the cumulative distribution function cdf matching technique was used in the present study to remove systematic differences between satellite and site specific ssm data drusch et al 2005 the principle of the cdf can be regarded as an enhanced nonlinear procedure to rescale satellite derived ssm time series in such a way that its cdf matches the cdf of in situ ssm measurements the cdf commonly includes two steps first the differences in ssm values between the corresponding elements of each ranked data set are consecutively computed second these differences are plotted against the satellite derived ssm and a fitting function is used to calculate the bias corrected ssm brocca et al 2011 in recent years the cdf matching technique has been widely used to assess satellite derived ssm al bitar et al 2017 tekeli and fouli 2017 liu et al 2022 to assess the estimated results the present study firstly takes the first day for each month over the growing season from april to october as an example to compare the ground ssm measurements collected at the 193 stations and the estimated ssm with the application of cdf matching fig 4 depicts the comparison of the estimated ssm and in situ measurements for the selected days following the results it is evident that estimated ssm was well correlated to ground in situ ssm measurements with an overall determination of coefficient of 0 288 and a rmse of approximately 0 066 m3 m3 indicating that the estimated ssm can achieve acceptable performances over the study area it can be found that many ground in situ measurements are grouped in lines the main reason should be attributed to the fact that only two significant digits were kept for the ground ssm observations although this would somewhat affect the evaluation it is still reasonable that the estimated ssm can fairly reflect the ssm dynamics nevertheless more accurate ground ssm measurements are required to further assess the proposed method in the ongoing work to further assess the satellite derived ssm dataset the estimated ssm time series over the growing season for each station was investigated fig 5 depicts the rmse of the ground in situ ssm measurements versus estimated ssm at each sm station over the study period from april to october 2016 with the application of the cdf matching approach among all the 193 sm stations about 42 and 90 of the total stations were with rmse under 0 05 m3 m3 and under 0 10 m3 m3 respectively additionally a small percentage of approximately 10 of the total stations reveal relatively high rmse over 0 10 m3 m3 furthermore an average rmse of approximately 0 061 m3 m3 was obtained for all the 193 stations over the study period all these results has further confirmed that the proposed approach can generally well capture the overall variations of in situ ssm over the study period 3 3 evaluation of estimated ssm with smap product assessments with the ground in situ ssm measurements indicted that the proposed approach can generally obtain ssm with acceptable accuracy however the ground in situ measurements are discretely distributed and thus it is still expected to better understand the behaviors of satellite derived ssm dataset on the entire study region and study period traditionally such constrains can be well compensated by evaluating with widely used gridded ssm datasets yin et al 2020 wang et al 2021 to this end the 9 km smap daily product was conducted to evaluate the satellite derived ssm over the entire study area and study period due to the relatively high spatial resolution and accuracy of the smap product that widely used in agricultural applications lawston et al 2017 sadri et al 2018 specifically to match the pixel size of the satellite derived ssm the 9 km smap daily ssm product was finally resampled to 5 km with the nearest neighbor resampling method fig 6 depicts the distribution of rmse between the two datasets over the study period from april to october 2016 it is obvious that rmse over the study area is within a reasonable range where the majority of the entire pixels are with rmse under 0 10 m3 m3 from the perspective of visual discrimination it is obvious that pixels with large rmse generally occur over the mountain areas in south henan province the coastal regions of shandong and hebei provinces and mountain forest regions in the north of beijing in the contrast it is noteworthy that grassland over the north of hebei province reveals the overall best accuracy with rmse around 0 05 m3 m3 except for these the dominated cropland over the study area exhibits a moderate accuracy between 0 05 and 0 10 m3 m3 fig 7 depicts the frequencydistributionof rmse for the entire pixels over the study area following the statistics the percentages of rmse under 0 05 m3 m3 and 0 10 m3 m3 are 14 3 and 73 4 respectively furthermore an average rmse of approximately 0 084 m3 m3 with a medium value of approximately 0 080 m3 m3 were obtained for the entire pixels over the study period these results have further confirmed the reliability of the estimated ssm with the proposed method in addition to the metric of rmse the characteristic of bias was also investigated fig 8 depicts the distribution of bias between the satellite derived ssm and smap product over the study period from april to october 2016 similar to the rmse it is obvious that significant bias generally occurs over the regions where larger rmse appears except for these regions bias for most of the pixels generally varied within a small range between 0 05 m3 m3 and 0 05 m3 m3 fig 9 shows the frequencydistribution of bias for the entire pixels over the study area it is obvious that bias for the pixels generally concentrated well following the statistics approximately 85 7 of the total pixels reveal slight bias of 0 05 m3 m3 furthermore an average bias of approximately 0 015 m3 m3 with a medium value of approximately 0 012 m3 m3 were obtained for the entire pixels over the study period indicating a considerable consistency of the two ssm datasets based on all these results it is evident that the proposed method can generally obtain reliable ssm over the study area 3 4 ssm retrieval accuracy over different land cover types following previous results it is noteworthy that the accuracy of satellite derived ssm generally varied with land cover types with respect to either provide better recommendations for potential users of the satellite derived ssm dataset or to further support the improvements of ssm retrieval with the proposed approach it is of great interests to investigate the performances of the estimated ssm dataset across different land cover types following the land cover types over the study area shown in fig 1 the present study primarily investigated three major land cover types including cropland natural vegetation mosaic grasslands and forest fig 10 depicts the accuracy statistics of satellite derived ssm and smap product over the three dominant land cover types over the study area it is obvious that best accuracy can be found over grasslands where the average rmse is around 0 062 m3 m3 in addition the forest pixels revealed an average rmse of approximately 0 072 m3 m3 which is slightly lower than that of the grasslands as for the dominated pixels labeled as cropland natural vegetation mosaic a decreased average rmse of approximately 0 084 m3 m3 was obtained over the study area indicating that the most significant uncertainty for ssm retrieval with the proposed approach is most likely to appear over cropland natural vegetation mosaic in the contrast the grasslands can probably the most credible ssm estimates although further investigations are required to explain these results a possible reason can be attributed to the irrigations for the croplands over the growing season while grasslands are commonly in astateofnatural growth since several previous literatures have also highlighted the decreased accuracy of satellite derived ssm while frequent irrigation events happen fan et al 2015 fontanet et al 2018 kim et al 2020 4 discussion 4 1 sensitive analysis following previous section it is evident that the proposed approach can obtain spatially ssm with generally acceptable accuracy when compared with ground in situ measurements and microwave ssm product nevertheless it is noteworthy that errors could still exist in both the atmospheric and land variables for the proposed framework for estimating ssm making it necessary to further investigate the possible impacts of the errors in the remotely sensed inputs on ssm retrieval to this end a sensitive analysis is conducted in the present study to address this issue in the present study the variable controllingapproach was used to investigate the sensitivity of each input on the determination of ssm with the proposed framework specifically the variable controllingapproach was conducted with a perturbated variable while the other variables remain unchanged following the essential inputs shown in table 1 the sensitive analysis of five variables including lst fvc t a nssr and rh were considered in the present study it is noteworthy that gaussian distribution with different variances were considered for these variables specifically random errors in modis derived lst were regarded to obey the gaussian distribution with a variance of 1 σ 1 whereas modis derived fvc were considered to obey the gaussian distribution with a variance of 0 01 σ 0 1 moreover the variances of the gaussian distribution for t a nssr and rh were set as 4 σ 2 400 σ 20 and 0 0225 σ 15 respectively taking the in situ ssm measurements collected at the 193 stations on every first day from april to october 2016 as an example table 2 shows the comparisons of ssm derived from the variable controllingapproach derived ssm and the original ssm estimation it is obvious from table 2 that the accuracy of t a has a most significant effects on ssm retrieval based on the proposed approach specifically a standarddeviationof 2 k in ta can lead to ssm estimation with an rmse of approximately 0 054 m3 m3 in addition a standarddeviation of 1 k and 0 1 in lst and fvc respectively has similar impacts on ssm retrieval 0 034 m3 m3 and 0 033 m3 m3 respectively in comparison to these three variables errors in rh and nssr have less impacts on ssm retrieval with rmses approximately 0 022 m3 m3 and 0 014 m3 m3 respectively results from the sensitive analysis indicate that any remotely sensed input can lead to errors for ssm retrieval following the method for obtaining the theoretical boundaries by moran et al 1994 it is obvious that t a was used as a crucial item to directly determine the theoretical boundary hence it is quite reasonable that the accuracy of t a has a significant impact on ssm retrieval with the trapezoid based approaches meanwhile although with less impacts it also notes that nssr and rh are essential inputs to determine the theoretical boundary of the trapezoid configuration and will also affect ssm retrieval to some extent furthermore following the trapezoid configuration shown in fig 1 it is evident that the location for the target pixel within the trapezoid configuration completely depends on the lst and fvc values for the pixel hence errors in these two variables can also seriously affect the location of the target pixel as well as the determination of m 0 and ssm retrieval 4 2 comparison with previous investigations compared to previous methods for deriving ssm with optical observations under all weather conditions the present study primarily reveals two superiorities the one is that except for the wind speed the other atmospheric variables for the determination of the theoretical trapezoid boundaries were derived from satellite observations thus no longer depend on ground observations assimilated products or reanalysis data that commonly used in previous investigations it notes that ground observations are available only in a few geographic locations worldwide whereas assimilated products or reanalysis data cannot well match the transit time of remotely sensed images as a consequence the mismatch between satellite overpassing time and observation time of atmospheric variables through traditional manners can inevitably result in uncertainties for ssm retrieval with the trapezoid based approaches with this in mind the superiority enables to obtain synchronous lst and atmospheric variables based on satellite observations which can potentially eliminate possible uncertainties lead by time inconsistencies between remotely sensed images and atmospheric variables the other superiority is that ssm over cloudy pixels were also determined with the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid configuration which is the same with the clear sky pixels in previous studies ssm over cloudy pixels were estimated either from atmospheric variables derived aerodynamic and surface resistance or based on disaggregation process where auxiliary data were required leng et al 2017 leng et al 2019 it is obvious that resistance parameters are difficult to determine accurately with satellite data at present furthermore most of the currently available disaggregation algorithms also suffer from various challenges such as the unavailability of valid satellite observations over cloudy pixels and the quantification of scaling effects from this perspective the present study has provided another alternative to estimate ssm over cloudy pixels more specifically the present study reveals an overall slightly better accuracy 0 06 m3 m3 than previous investigations 0 07 to 0 08 m3 m3 when comparing with ground in situ measurements leng et al 2017 4 3 further developments the present study provides a practical approach for deriving ssm primarily from remotely sensed data although with reasonable accuracy when comparing to ground in situ measurements and smap product several critical issues remain to be addressed in further investigations based on the sensitive analysis it is noteworthy that t a reveals significant impacts on ssm retrieval with the proposed approach up to present although several algorithms have been developed to derive t a from remotely sensed data the accuracy for most of the currently available algorithms exhibits an accuracy of approximately 2 to 3 k which is significantly lower than that observed from ground meteorological stations hence it is quite necessary to develop practical algorithm for deriving t a as well as other atmospheric variables from satellite data with high accuracy in future developments specifically the accurate determination of these atmospheric variables under cloudy conditions should be seriously investigated another issue is with respect to the validation of satellite derived ssm at pixel scale as we known it is quite difficult to obtain actual ssm ground truth at pixel level at present hence the present study takes the cdf matching approach to remove the systematic differences between satellite ssm and ground in situ measurements nevertheless the satellite derived ssm after the application of cdf matching approach is only to make its cdf matches the cdf of ground in situ measurements rather than to provide actual ssm at pixel level as a consequence it is recommended to develop feasible methods for obtaining ground ssm truth in further developments to this end the neutron probe can be a promising way to detect ground ssm within a certain area circle region with radius of 300 to 500 m rather than the traditional methods that can observe ssm with only a limited spatial representativeness e g a maximum of a few square meters due to the high spatiotemporal of ssm over heterogeneous surfaces a last issue is to further investigate the performances of the proposed approach across different land cover types and climate patterns since the preliminary evaluation indicates that satellite derived ssm generally reveals better accuracy over grasslands than that over forest regions or croplands natural vegetation mosaic this is not only a necessary ongoing work before applying the approach over large regions but also beneficial to further improve the approach for obtaining better ssm estimates 5 conclusions the present study provides a practical framework for obtaining ssm dataset primarily based on satellite data in this framework the pixel to pixel scheme of the trapezoid was used to estimate ssm specifically the theoretical boundaries of the trapezoid was determined through the principle of surface energy balance where satellite derived atmospheric variables were provided as essential inputs with the proposed framework a daily 5 km ssm dataset over the north china plain during the growing season from april to october 2016 was finally obtained specifically compared to previous approaches using meteorological variables derived resistance parameters or by means of disaggregation processes the present study provided another alternative for deriving ssm over cloudy pixels which has a potential to decrease the dependence of ssm retrieval on auxiliary data accuracy assessments with both in situ measurements and smap product indicates that the estimated ssm reveals generally acceptable accuracy over the study area with an overall rmse of 0 06 m3 m3 and 0 08 m3 m3 respectively in summary the present study has successfully achieved ssm retrieval from currently available satellite observations indicating a promising approach for the generation of spatially seamless ssm dataset in future developments credit authorship contribution statement pei leng conceptualization

2896,irrigation can substantially alter the hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles in river basins however little attention has been given to the quantitative evaluation of the effects of irrigation on both of these cycles in this study we utilized the latest version of the community land model clm5 to assess the effects of irrigation on the water carbon and nitrogen budgets in a cropland area of a large endorheic river basin heihe river basin hrb in northwestern china and further identified the contributions of each type of crop to the abovementioned budgets the model has been validated against local flux towers remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets demonstrating the capability of clm5 in capturing the temporal and spatial characteristics of water carbon and nitrogen at the basin scale two numerical experiments one with irrigation and one without it were conducted to explore the relationships between water and carbon nitrogen budgets for the period from 2000 to 2018 the simulation results showed that the greatest amount of irrigation was applied in the summer 50 mm month 1 and then declined to a low level during the other seasons evapotranspiration et in the cropland area sharply increased from 106 mm year 1 to 508 mm year 1 with an increase in surface runoff and baseflow after irrigation both irrigated gross primary production gpp net ecosystem exchange nee and water use efficiency wue peaked in the summer which corresponded to the crop growing season a shift in nee from 6 gc m 2 year 1 to 229 gc m 2 year 1 indicated that the cropland area in the hrb switched from being a carbon source to a carbon sink because of irrigation the corn area presented the largest increase decrease in gpp nee after irrigation whereas the lowest increase decrease in gpp nee was observed in the cotton area total ecosystem carbon tec and total ecosystem nitrogen ten markedly increased as a result of irrigation with increases of 3 29 1013 gc and 2 96 1012 gn respectively throughout the year in the cropland area overall our study demonstrates that irrigation has substantial impacts on water carbon and nitrogen budgets in the cropland area of the hrb and

hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles in semiarid arid regions both directly and indirectly vitousek et al 1997 meijninger and de bruin 2000 scheer et al 2008 leng et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 notably irrigation can moisten root zones and provide extra water to crops causing increases in evapotranspiration and latent heat flux as well as a decrease in sensible heat flux kendig et al 2000 lobell et al 2008 yu et al 2014 for biogeochemical cycles irrigation alters the regional carbon budget by affecting the magnitude of plant photosynthesis and respiration and further affects carbon emissions which are the leading triggers of global warming lashof and ahuja 1990 cox et al 2000 matthews et al 2009 zhang and cheng 2009 karimi et al 2012 tokarska and gillett 2018 zong et al 2020 paoletti et al 2022 the nitrogen budget is tightly associated with the carbon pool and nitrogen considerably impacts agricultural productivity and food security eickhout et al 2006 barakat et al 2016 nitrogen assimilated by plants is derived from the soil through complex processes some of which include nitrogen fixation and nitrogen deposition limited nitrogen fertilization accompanied with irrigation can restrict crop growth whereas excessive amounts of nitrogen applied to crops can cause water pollution thus evaluating the irrigation effects on water carbon and nitrogen budgets in semiarid arid cropland areas is crucial for an improved understanding of the interactions among water carbon and nitrogen cycles several modeling studies at different scales have been conducted and have provided critical insights into the exploration of the irrigation effects on various aspects including land atmosphere fluxes momentum fluxes and surface climate for instance the water vapor flux was found to increase to 300 kg m 2 year 1 after irrigation in eastern china based on the results from a general circulation model gcm boucher et al 2004 applying the coupled model of the community atmosphere model cam and the community land model version 3 5 clm3 5 the reduced sensible heat flux and the decreased average temperature on a global scale were interpreted to result from irrigation sacks et al 2009 according to the variable infiltration capacity vic model the bowen ratio decreases by 6 8 in the dry season over the mekong river basin after irrigation tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 in the heihe river basin hrb a high resolution 1 km numerical experiment via clm4 5 was conducted to investigate the seasonal effects of irrigation on land atmosphere fluxes and the results showed that latent heat lh sensible heat sh and net ecosystem exchange nee peaked in the summer after irrigation zeng et al 2017 on the basis of the results from a combination of the weather research and forecasting wrf model and noah multiparameterization noah mp the daily mean temperature decreased by 1 7 c and the humidity increased by 2 3 g kg 1 in the hrb with irrigation zhang et al 2017 moreover a recent study further proposed that the potential evapotranspiration tended to decrease due to irrigation in the hrb zhang et al 2020 however less research focused on carbon nitrogen cycles and identified the contributions of different crop species to the interactions of water carbon and nitrogen budgets which play an important role in local water management and regional carbon nitrogen balance in addition most models for investigating the biogeochemical scenarios of each crop species in a cropland are not available or oversimplified lawrence et al 2018 lawrence et al 2019 recently the latest version of the community land model clm5 has been updated with an improved irrigation module as well as a new scheme of carbon and nitrogen cycles lawrence et al 2019 this model can simulate the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes for 64 different crop species and thus can be utilized as an effective tool to investigate the contributions of different crop species to the water carbon and nitrogen budgets the clm has been extensively developed during the past three decades bonan 1996 oleson and bonan 2000 hack et al 2006 oleson et al 2008 lawrence et al 2011 riley et al 2011 li et al 2012 2013a swenson and lawrence 2014 2015 zeng et al 2017 sheng et al 2018 umair et al 2018 xie et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 clm5 is the 5th generation clm and constitutes the land component of the community earth system model 2 cesm2 gent et al 2011 hurrell et al 2013 lawrence et al 2018 danabasoglu et al 2020 the model covers many biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes such as surface water and groundwater cycles phenology vegetation photosynthesis wildfires and carbon and nitrogen allocation compared to other land models clm5 has several distinctive features 1 the spatial land surface heterogeneity is adequately expressed by an enclosed subgrid hierarchy where each grid cell is subdivided into multiple levels of land units e g vegetation crops soil columns e g soil elevation classes and plant functional types e g needleleaf evergreen trees broadleaf evergreen trees 2 clm5 can be driven by meteorological forcing and strongly represents the fluxes momentum and interactions between the atmosphere and land 3 the crop and irrigation module of clm5 considers both natural factors and human management in agricultural landscapes such as planting harvesting tillage fertilization and irrigation and 4 the interaction between hydrologic and ecological cycles on different spatiotemporal scales from a single point to global scale can be simulated via clm5 therefore in this study we designed two numerical experiments one with and one without irrigation to assess the influence of irrigation on water carbon and nitrogen budgets in the cropland area of the hrb by the use of clm5 we also quantified the contributions of crop species to the changes in the abovementioned budgets detailed information for the model implementation and findings are shown below 2 methodology 2 1 study area the hrb is the second largest endorheic basin in china covering a total area of 143 000 km2 from 96 42 to 102 00 e in longitude and from 37 41 to 42 42 n in latitude fig 1 the hrb has a heterogeneous landscape and comprises upstream qilian mountains at the northern margin of the tibetan plateau middle stream oases and lower stream gobi desert regions with terminal lakes specifically the gobi desert and mountainous areas account for 58 and 33 of the hrb respectively whereas the oases constitute only 9 yao et al 2014 the elevation decreases from 5600 m upstream to 900 m downstream similarly annual precipitation in the hrb decreases from 750 mm in the mountain regions upstream to 50 mm in the plains regions downstream qi and luo 2005 ding et al 2009 resulting in a semiarid arid climate in the region annual evapotranspiration et in the oasis is 500 mm but decreases to 20 80 mm in the gobi desert tian et al 2015 several field experiments have been conducted in the hrb during the past few decades including the hrb field experiment heife wang and mitsuta 1992 hu et al 1994 jinta experiment chen et al 2005 field experiment on interaction between land and atmosphere in arid region of north west china nwc aliex zhang and huang 2004 watershed allied telemetry experimental research water li et al 2009 and heihe water allied telemetry experimental research hiwater li et al 2013b these field experiments established a systematic network of eddy covariance towers and automatic weather stations and provided a fundamental platform to study the ecohydrological mechanisms and processes in the hrb in response to climate change and anthropogenic activities water security and ecological security based on the above experiments irrigation has been demonstrated to be an important component of water balance and strongly impacts local ecosystems li et al 2013b the irrigated farmland in the hrb is mainly located in the middle reaches with minor distributions in the upstream mountain ridge and lower stream riverside li et al 2016 given that the hrb is an important region for agricultural production there are multiple types of crop species including corn cereals soybean rapeseed and other c3 crop species the annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration et0 of the zhangye basin in the middle streams are 120 mm and 1 200 mm respectively zhang et al 2021a limited precipitation in the region translates to additional irrigation needed for crop growth cultivated land consumes a large amount of water resources 80 of the main channel and produces 90 of the total agricultural output in the hrb xu et al 2019 however intensive utilization of river water and groundwater for irrigation has caused severe water shortages and environmental deterioration in the region cheng et al 2014 an ecological water diversion project ewdp has been implemented since the end of the 20th century which involves a water reallocation plan within the hrb see cheng et al 2014 for details as a consequence the deterioration of ecohydrological systems in the hrb has been dramatically alleviated 2 2 model description 2 2 1 hydrological cycle module of clm5 the hydrology module considers multiple processes including infiltration throughfall interception evaporation surface runoff subsurface drainage canopy drip redistribution within the soil column and groundwater discharge and recharge in the hrb the total water balance of the system is defined via eq 1 as follows 1 δ w canopy δ w surface δ w snow δ w soil

microtopography defined as fine spatial scale elevation variations is assumed to be normally distributed around the grid cell mean elevation and controls surface water storage and outflow soil water is estimated following the one dimensional vertical richards equation and lateral subsurface runoff is determined by saturated soil moisture conditions within the soil column 2 2 2 carbon and nitrogen cycle modules of clm5 the clm5 model provides a fully prognostic treatment for all carbon and nitrogen state variables of the vegetation litter and soil organic matter separate state variables for c and n were tracked for leaf living stem dead stem living coarse root dead coarse root fine root and grain pools carbon assimilation and carbon release in plants occur through photosynthesis and respiration respectively the photosynthesis component of clm5 is simulated by a leaf utilization of nitrogen for assimilation luna based model ali et al 2016 the model can predict the potential acclimation of photosynthetic capacities under different environmental conditions as determined by temperature radiation co2 concentration day length and humidity two types of respiration namely maintenance respiration and growth respiration are parameterized under different temperatures and carbon and nitrogen uptake maintenance respiration is defined as the carbon cost to support the metabolic activity of existing living tissue while growth respiration is defined as the additional carbon cost for the synthesis of new growth the nitrogen simulation component of clm5 is based on the fixation and uptake of nitrogen model fisher et al 2010 brzostek et al 2014 shi et al 2016 and is tightly associated with carbon pools nitrogen uptake requires the consumption of energy derived from interactions with carbon the uptake of n in symbiotic bacteria in root nodules senescing tissues plants infected with arbuscular mycorrhizae and plants infected with ectomycorrhizae as well as the nonmycorrhizal uptake of nh4 and no3 are considered in clm5 denitrification and leaching are the two ways for nitrogen to exit the system 2 2 3 crop management module of clm5 the crop management module of clm5 is used to simulate biogeophysics and biogeochemistry in agricultural landscapes eight typical crop species temperate soybean tropical soybean temperate corn tropical corn spring wheat cotton rice and sugarcane are used as functional species types in the model and the soil columns between different crop species are distinctly specified each crop is divided into rainfed and irrigated fractions to capture both natural and human managed scenarios respectively phenologically there are four stages planting leaf emergence grain filling and harvest for species during a single year specifically crops first start to grow when the local temperature meets their required growing temperature on the planting day in the leaf emergence stage the leaves emerge once the growing degree days of the soil temperature at 0 05 m depth from the surface exceed the threshold the grain filling stage is triggered by the leaf area index lai and local air temperature in this phase the leaf area index also begins to decrease due to the background litterfall the final phase harvest occurs as soon as the crop reaches maturity which is determined by its growing degree day requirements the allocation of carbon and nitrogen is dynamic and driven by plant phenology simulated carbon assimilation begins every year upon leaf emergence and ends with a harvest a new scheme of carbon nitrogen ratios for the leaves stems and fine roots of crops is applied to clm5 to track seasonal change fertilization substantially impacts crop yields in clm5 fertilization is simulated by adding nitrogen directly to the soil nitrogen pool to meet the nitrogen requirement of crops the fertilization process starts at the leaf emergence stage and lasts for 20 days to limit denitrification rates in this study the fertilization rates for corn 16 gn m 2 year 1 wheat 8 gn m 2 year 1 and soybean 2 gn m 2 year 1 were set following the methods of zhu et al 2020 which are derived from usda fertilizer use and price products the rates for cotton rapeseed and other c3 crop species were set at a default rate of 2 gn m 2 year 1 table 1 2 2 4 irrigation module of clm5 the irrigation module of clm5 is designed for irrigated cropland areas the module dynamically responds to soil moisture and involves checking the lai and soil water content every morning at 6 am local time to determine whether irrigation is necessary such a mechanism could dynamically check the crop status and limit the loss of irrigation water from evaporation if the crop leaf area is 0 and the available soil water is below a specified threshold the irrigation amount is determined by the soil moisture deficit dirrig between the threshold and available soil moisture content as follows 2 d irrig w thresh w avail w t h r e s h w a v a i l 3 d irrig 0 w t h r e s h w a v a i l where wthresh refers to the irrigation moisture threshold mm and wavail refers to the available moisture mm wthresh and wavail are defined as 4 w thresh f thresh w t arg e t w wilt w wilt 5 w avail j 1 n irr θ j δ z j 6 w t arg e t j 1 n irr θ t arg e t δ z j 7 w wilt j 1 n irr θ wilt δ z j where w target is the target soil moisture mm w wilt is wilting point soil moisture mm fthresh is a tuning parameter ranging from 0 to 1 nirr is the index of the soil layer and θ t arg e t θ wilt and θ j are the target volumetric soil moisture wilting point volumetric soil moisture and volumetric soil moisture contents in layer j respectively δ z j refers to the thickness of the soil layer in layer j importantly according to clm5 irrigation water is removed from river water storage for mass conservation and directly applied to the ground surface by evenly distributing the amount of water 2 3 model setup and experimental design the input data of clm5 include meteorological forcing data domain information soil property data and regional land cover data table 2 the meteorological forcing data between 2000 and 2018 have a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 and a temporal resolution of 1 h the data are generated by the institute of tibetan plateau research of the chinese academy of sciences using the weather research forecasting model pan 2020 the dataset has been validated by daily observational data from 15 chinese meteorological bureau conventional automatic weather stations as well as hourly meteorological data from 7 sites of watershed airborne telemetry experimental research water yielding good correlation coefficient r and reasonable mean bias error mbe pan and li 2011 pan et al 2012 pan et al 2014 pan et al 2015 the forcing variables include precipitation air temperature radiation relative humidity and wind speed data the domain map containing local grids and coordinates is generated by clm domain tools the soil property dataset utilizes the clm default global soil dataset which is derived from the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp soil dataset global soil data task 2000 global soil data task 2014 the land cover data are obtained based on the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research land cover map with 30 m spatial resolution li et al 2013b zhong et al 2014 2015 the data including specific crop types vegetation types glaciers lakes urban areas and other land information in particular the crop types consist of corn 30 barley 8 cotton 8 wheat 7 soybean 4 rapeseed 2 and other c3 crop species 41 we then bilinearly interpolated the higher resolution land cover map 30 m onto 0 05 0 05 grids over the region the land cover in the hrb did not change substantially between 2000 and 2015 table 3 the observed land cover change is 0 3 during the 16 years for primary types thus the impacts of land cover change on water carbon and nitrogen are not considered in this study clm5 was first spin up for 600 years with an active irrigation module and recycled forcing data 2000 2018 until the water carbon and nitrogen state reached equilibrium two numerical experiments in the hrb were subsequently designed the first experiment involves the natural mode under which the crops are rainfed denoted as clmrainfed and the irrigation module was removed the second experiment involves an irrigation simulation with the irrigation module activated over irrigated crop areas denoted as clmirrigated the two experiments shared the same meteorological forcing land cover and initial conditions thus the effects of irrigation on each budget water carbon and nitrogen could be investigated by comparing these two cases 2 4 in situ observations remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets for validation the model performance was evaluated against in situ from eddy covariance ec data and grid values of remote sensing products four local flux towers daman station dashalong station huazhaizi station and sidaoqiao station respectively in different types of land use cropland grassland desert and shrubland respectively across the upper middle and lower streams of the hrb were selected and the variables we compared included daily sensible heat flux sh latent heat flux lh and net ecosystem exchange nee the original temporal resolution of each flux tower is 30 min but was further converted to daily resolution for validation the comparison periods between simulated data and observed data at each flux tower site consecutively ranged from 2013 to 2018 spatial evapotranspiration data with a spatial resolution of 1 km between 2000 and 2013 were obtained from the remote sensing dataset named the etwatch product wu et al 2012 the etwatch data include actual et collected by the use of multiple remote sensing data and various inversion algorithms e g tseb sebs and sebal norman et al 1995 anderson et al 1997 su 2002 bastiaanssen et al 2005 etwatch has been independently verified using different approaches over diverse landscapes wu et al 2012 gross primary production gpp 2001 2005 data were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 8 day product with a spatial resolution of 500 m mod17a2h https www nasa gov the modis gpp product is generated based on the radiation use efficiency concept assuming a linear relationship between crop productivity and solar energy latent heat lh 2001 2005 data were obtained from the era5 land reanalysis datasets which combine model data with global observations and provide a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over consecutive time periods era5 land datasets have a special resolution of 0 1 0 1 and temporal resolution of both hourly and monthly frequency 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation 3 1 1 comparison with the data collected from the flux towers the magnitude and seasonal variation in the simulated sh are consistent with the observed sh at daman r 0 75 p 0 01 and huazhaizi r 0 83 p 0 01 fig 2 in contrast the simulated sh at dashalong and at sidaoqiao is slightly overestimated r 0 40 p 0 01 and underestimated r 0 58 p 0 01 respectively for lh simulated trends in daman r 0 83 p 0 01 dashalong r 0 86 p 0 01 huazhaizi r 0 83 p 0 01 and sidaoqiao r 0 79 p 0 01 well match the observations except for a slight underestimation of the peak value in the summer the simulated nee at daman r 0 74 p 0 01 and dashalong r 0 52 p 0 01 were also close to the observed data while sidaoqiao station yields a relatively weak correlation r 0 43 p 0 01 for huazhaizi the nee is extremely low due to the lack of plants in the desert overall the model could reflect seasonal and interannual variations in energy and carbon cycles in the hrb in the cropland area the model captures the trends well and reflects the magnitudes of sh lh and nee in the grassland area the model could also reflect the sh and nee but slightly underestimates the lh in the desert area the model reflects sh and lh changes whereas both the observed and simulated nee were negligible in the shrubland the model can reflect the trends of sh lh and nee with slight underestimation of the peak of sh and lh 3 1 2 comparison with remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets the spatial pattern of et from etwatch is consistent with the simulated et with irrigation fig 3 high et is observed in the cropland area in the middle reaches the mountainous area in the upstream reaches has a relatively lower et than that in the middle reaches and the gobi desert downstream displays a low level et the annual mean et over the entire basin from etwatch was 132 mm between 2000 and 2013 in contrast the model with the irrigation experiment and the model with the rainfed experiment yield mean et values of 148 mm year 1 and 95 mm year 1 respectively fig 3 hence the irrigated et from clm5 is slightly higher than the etwatch product especially in the middle reaches however previous studies have reported that the etwatch product underestimates the data in the middle reaches e g tian et al 2015 wu et al 2015 li et al 2016 sun et al 2018 specifically wu et al 2015 proposed that the annual et in cultivated land is 450 mm year 1 while tian et al 2015 stated that the annual et in middle farmland is 600 mm year 1 in comparison an average et of 506 mm year 1 in the cropland area derived from the clm5 irrigation experiment falls in the range of previous studies therefore the et from the irrigation experiment in clm5 is reliable moreover the large difference between the irrigation experiment and the rainfed experiment mainly resulted from the addition of irrigation water in the midstream cropland gross primary production gpp reflects the rate of carbon fixation through vegetation photosynthesis generally the irrigation experiment captured the spatial distribution of gpp in the hrb well whereas this factor was overestimated in the middle reaches compared to that of the modis gpp product fig 3 however previous studies have also shown that the modis gpp product may underestimate the actual gpp of the hrb e g wang et al 2011 you et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b the annual gpp of 887 gc m 2 year 1 with a maximum value of 1200 gc m 2 year 1 in the crop land area from the clm5 irrigation experiment is consistent with a previously reported gpp 900 gc m 2 year 1 in middle farmland you et al 2020 hence the spatial pattern of gpp derived from the clm5 irrigation experiment is reliable and could reflect the real scenario of co2 sequestration in the hrb in contrast the gpp in the rainfed experiment was not sensitive to the middle reaches of the cropland area given the low resolution of the era5 land dataset the details of lh of the landscapes are not well presented however it can be seen the pattern of lh over the upper middle and lower streams in the era5 land dataset exhibits significant difference corresponding to the different landcovers fig s1 although there are slightly overestimates of lh in the middle reaches simulated lh with irrigation generally captures the trends of lh in the era5 land dataset over the entire basin in addition the distribution and the magnitude of lh in simulated lh with irrigation is near identical to the results in zeng et al 2017 in contrast the lh in the rainfed experiment is low in the cropland area due to the limited growth of plants overall based on the comparisons with remote sensing products etwatch product the modis gpp product and reanalysis dataset era5 land lh dataset in terms of spatial distribution and landscape heterogeneity within the hrb the model is robust and acceptable 3 2 simulated irrigation amount the spatial distribution of irrigation is heterogeneous fig 4 specifically irrigation mainly occurs in the middle oasis reaches with minor amounts occurring on the upper stream mountain ridge and lower stream riverside the simulation yields a mean annual irrigation amount of 476 mm over the cropland area between 2000 and 2018 in particular the annual amounts of irrigation applied to corn mean 585 mm wheat mean 675 mm barley mean 765 mm soybean mean 897 mm cotton mean 467 mm and other c3 irrigated crops mean 295 mm are also calculated by clm5 the irrigation amount for rapeseed is negligible due to its low percentage as a result the annual irrigation amount is slightly lower than that in a previous irrigation dataset 1 6 mm day 1 zeng et al 2017 derived from the cold and arid regions science data center carsdc at lanzhou this is because a large area of other c3 crop species is considered in our simulations leading to a relatively lower irrigation flux 295 mm year 1 and causing a lower total irrigation amount in the cropland area the local annual report gives an annual irrigation amount of 500 700 mm for the main crop species in the zhangye basin zhangye water conservancy bureau 2010 which is generally consistent with the clm5 simulation of irrigation excluding the other c3 crop species additionally the irrigation amounts for corn and wheat are comparable to that in previous studies in which annual water requirements of 572 mm and 430 700 mm for corn liu and shen 2018 and wheat zhao et al 2005 respectively were proposed although there are some uncertainties also see the limitation section for more details the simulated irrigation amount from clm5 is acceptable and could reflect the local water consumption there are seasonal and interannual variabilities in the simulated irrigation water amount fig 4 seasonally the irrigation flux dramatically increases between april and october corresponding to the crop growing season and then declines to a low level near 0 mm month 1 from november to march the maximum values occur in june and july with irrigation fluxes 120 mm month 1 interannually a relatively low irrigation 450 mm occurred in 2003 2005 2009 2012 2016 and 2018 with the lowest value of 411 mm while a relatively high irrigation 500 mm occurred in 2002 2004 2006 2011 2013 and 2017 with the largest value of 540 mm irrigation is mainly driven by meteorological forcing typically high precipitation and low temperature leads to reduced irrigation whereas low precipitation and high temperature leads to increased irrigation however the same trends of precipitation and temperature are also observed for some years in our simulations for example relatively low irrigation occurred in 2003 with relatively low precipitation and relatively low temperature whereas high irrigation occurred in 2017 with relatively high precipitation and temperature fig 4 such observations suggest that the irrigation amount is driven by the combination of multiple factors e g precipitation temperature water contents rather than a single factor notably the irrigation amount in the hrb cropland is much higher than precipitation to promote plant growth reflecting a heavily arid climate and relatively low water contents in the region 3 3 irrigation effects on the water budget the quantification of the contribution of each component to the water budget is important to better understand the water balance in clm5 precipitation and irrigation are considered external factors while water can leave the system through evapotranspiration surface runoff and baseflow the water balance reflects the difference between all input and output water volumes over a specified period as well as changes in internal water storage burt 1999 hence the above variables in the cropland area are highlighted here fig 5 as a result both irrigated et and rainfed et peaked in the summer and et sharply increased from 106 mm year 1 to 508 mm year 1 over the cropland area after irrigation in particular corn wheat and soybean have relatively high et 548 mm year 1 562 mm year 1 and 577 mm year 1 respectively after irrigation while barley cotton and other c3 crop species have relatively low et 432 mm year 1 128 mm year 1 367 mm year 1 respectively in addition the soybean area has the largest δ et clmirrigated clmrainfed of 504 mm year 1 whereas the cotton area has the lowest δ et of 72 mm year 1 table 4 the corn wheat barley and other c3 crop species have relatively moderate δ et ranging from 193 mm year 1 to 460 mm year 1 the significant increase in et is attributed to the additional irrigation causing increased water contents as well as increased soil evaporation and total transpiration xie et al 2005 the dramatic increase in et 400 mm year 1 for soybean and corn suggested that these species are more sensitive to water stress while the other crop species have relatively lower sensitivity daryanto et al 2016 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a the good positive correlations for all the crop species r2 0 6 p 0 01 fig 6 between δ et and irrigation amount from 2000 to 2018 further demonstrated the significant increase in et after irrigation in all crop areas additionally surface runoff increases from 13 2 mm year 1 to 74 8 mm year 1 after irrigation while baseflow is increased from 1 0 mm year 1 to 9 3 mm year 1 in particular the wheat area yields the largest difference of 76 8 mm year 1 while the cotton field has the lowest difference of 5 3 mm year 1 table 4 the largest difference in baseflow occurred in the corn area 14 7 mm year 1 whereas the other c3 crop species had the lowest baseflow change 1 8 mm year 1 the variations in the increase in surface runoff and baseflow in each crop species area suggested that the soil textures and cover crop root systems were heterogeneous yu et al 2016 based on the above results it can be summarized that irrigation affects the water budget considerably and adds a layer of complexity to the water balance in the hrb a major fraction of irrigation water use was transferred into et followed by increased runoff and baseflow in the hrb cropland area 3 4 irrigation effects on carbon budgets 3 4 1 gpp and nee changes in the hrb cropland area gross primary production gpp reflects the carbon sequestration capability of plants seasonally gpp in the irrigation experiment sharply increased in the summer corresponding to the crop growing season fig 7 notably the gpp in june and july reached 250 gc m 2 month 1 whereas the gpp from november to april remained at a relatively low level 15 gc m 2 month 1 in contrast the gpp in the rainfed experiment was maintained at a constantly low level 10 gc m 2 month 1 throughout the entire year the significant difference mean 120 gc m 2 month 1 between the irrigated gpp and rainfed gpp from april to october suggested that irrigation could dramatically promote photosynthesis capacity and facilitate plant growth interannually gpp in the irrigation experiment showed dramatic fluctuations in the cropland area from 2000 to 2018 as a result the average simulated gross primary production gpp during the 19 years considerably increases from 29 gc m 2 year 1 to 880 gc m 2 year 1 after irrigation fig 7 the highest value 958 gc m 2 year 1 and lowest value 752 gc m 2 year 1 occurred in 2002 and 2018 respectively in contrast the gpp in the rainfed experiment is lower in magnitude and the highest value and lowest value are 43 gc m 2 year 1 in 2015 and 14 gc m 2 year 1 in 2003 respectively specifically each crop species has different contributions to the regional gpp all the crops have a relatively high gpp in the summer although the rate of decrease for each crop species tended to be different in the other seasons fig 8 corn wheat and soybean contribute more gpp in the summer with maximum values of 404 gc m 2 month 1 304 gc m 2 month 1 and 312 gc m 2 month 1 respectively after which their gpp tends to decrease rapidly from august to december in comparison the maximum gpp values for barley cotton and other c3 crop species in the summer are 162 gc m 2 month 1 33 gc m 2 month 1 and 109 gc m 2 month 1 respectively after which their gpp tended to slowly decrease between august and december annually corn has the highest average gpp of 1 101 gc m 2 year 1 with the largest increase in gpp 1 066 gc m 2 year 1 after irrigation over the hrb cropland area between 2000 and 2018 while cotton has the lowest average gpp of 99 gc m 2 year 1 with the smallest increase in gpp 99 gc m 2 year 1 wheat barley soybean and other c3 species have a moderate gpp 465 1 015 gc m 2 year 1 which moderately increases 363 974 gc m 2 year 1 fig 8 phenologically the largest gpp being detected in the corn area together with the greatest increase suggested that corn a c4 crop species may have a faster rate of photosynthesis than rest of the crop species in the hrb cropland area qin et al 2015 the other crop species which are c3 species have a relatively lower gpp that moderately increases due to their slower co2 fixation rate long et al 2006 in addition the sensitivity of gpp for each crop species to irrigation amount is displayed in fig 9 although wheat and barley have relatively weaker correlations r2 0 30 p 0 01 and r2 0 36 p 0 01 respectively corn soybean cotton and other c3 plant species exhibited relatively good correlations r2 0 63 p 0 01 suggesting that irrigation promoted carbon sequestration net ecosystem exchange nee which refers to the difference between ecosystem respiration er and gpp can be an indicator of the carbon balance of a land area seasonally unlike gpp nee in the irrigation experiment starts to increase from january to april but then dramatically shifts to negative values with a negative peak in june 137 gc m 2 month 1 the dynamic change from a positive value to a negative value indicates that the cropland changes from a carbon source to a carbon sink afterward the nee rapidly increases and becomes positive again between september and december 1 7 gc m 2 month 1 in contrast the average rainfed nee 0 gc m 2 month 1 is relatively stable throughout the year notably both the gpp and the nee in the irrigation simulation peak in the summer corresponding to the largest irrigation flux hence such a pattern suggests that irrigation has the greatest contribution to crops between april and september and strongly increases the uptake of co2 by plants interannually the average simulated nee changed from 6 gc m 2 year 1 to 229 gc m 2 year 1 after irrigation in the cropland area during the 19 years fig 7 the nee pattern in the irrigation experiment tends to oscillate the highest nee occurred in 2018 186 gc m 2 year 1 and the lowest nee occurred in 2011 269 gc m 2 year 1 the nee in the rainfed experiment fluctuated during the 19 years ranging from 2 gc m 2 year 1 in 2015 to 13 gc m 2 year 1 in 2000 like for gpp the nee of all the crop species peaked in the summer suggesting that more carbon is fixed during that time specifically corn wheat and soybean exhibit similar trends of nee whereas barley other c3 plant species and cotton have similar trends of nee in a seasonal cycle annually the corn area has the maximum increase after irrigation and yields the lowest average nee of 427 gc m 2 year 1 while the minimum increase in magnitude occurs in the cotton area with an average nee of 11 gc m 2 year 1 during the 19 years fig 8 table 5 the above results indicate that different crop species exhibit different patterns and that the fluctuations in nee could reflect the variations in gpp and er from january to april most of the crops have positive nee values suggesting a larger ecosystem respiration than gpp and that more co2 is released into the atmosphere in the spring in the summer the nee became negative suggesting that irrigation promoted both gpp and er in the crop growing season to a larger degree for the former afterward the crops entered the grain filling phase and the lai started to decline causing a decrease in gpp and an increase in nee thus the correlations between δ nee and irrigation amount are not similar to those for gpp except for the other c3 plant species r2 0 66 p 0 01 the remaining crops exhibit relatively weaker correlations between δ nee and irrigation amount r2 0 39 fig 9 during the 19 years indicating that there are variations in ability of irrigation to promote gpp and er 3 4 2 water use efficiency changes in the hrb cropland area water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of gpp to et reflects the interactions between water and carbon cycles ponton et al 2006 hu et al 2008 yu et al 2008 zhu et al 2014 as a result the wue in both the irrigation and rainfed simulations increased significantly during the summer however the wue under irrigation remained at a moderate level between august and november and then rapidly decreased to a lower level in the winter while the wue under rainfed conditions tends to continually decrease after summer interannually the average wue increased from 0 27 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 to 1 73 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 in the cropland area between 2000 and 2018 after irrigation fig 10 the highest wue of the irrigation experiment and rainfed experiment occurred in 2005 1 82 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 and 2014 0 36 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 respectively in contrast the lowest wue from the irrigation experiment and rainfed experiment occurred in 2000 1 67 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 and 2003 0 17 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 respectively suggesting slight interannual variabilities specifically all the crop species presented their highest wue values in the summer corresponding to the growing season then the wue for each crop species decreases to a lower level in the autumn in the winter most crop species wheat barley cotton soybean have low wue values near 0 gc m 2 mm 1 month 1 whereas the wue values of corn and other c3 crop species remain at moderate levels 0 46 gc m 2 mm 1 month 1 and 0 72 gc m 2 mm 1 month 1 respectively fig 10 annually the corn area has the highest wue 2 01 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 with the largest increase 1 60 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 whereas the cotton area has the lowest wue value of 0 78 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 the lowest increase occurred in the barley area 0 45 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 table 5 hence these results indicate that corn cereals and soybean are probably the optimal crop species in the hrb 3 4 3 total ecosystem carbon changes in the hrb cropland area the seasonal and interannual changes in total ecosystem carbon tec are illustrated in fig 11 seasonally the maximum magnitude of tec in the irrigation simulation in the cropland occurs in the summer with a maximum value of 9 728 gc m 2 corresponding to the plant growing season in contrast the rainfed experiment exhibits a relatively stable tec 7 830 gc m 2 across all seasons interannually the irrigation experiment yields slightly fluctuating tec values during the 19 years ranging from 9 484 gc m 2 to 9 644 gc m 2 in contrast the tec of the rainfed experiment tends to slowly decrease ranging from 7 911 gc m 2 to 7 769 gc m 2 hence in this scenario a total amount of 3 29 1013 gc additionally enters the ecosystem after irrigation each year total litter carbon tlc total vegetation carbon tvc and total soil organic matter carbon tsc are the three components of tec after irrigation all three of these components significantly increased fig 12 fig s2 table 6 however the tlc tvc and tsc displayed different patterns throughout each seasonal cycle specifically the tlc in the irrigation experiment tends to decrease from january and reaches the lowest level 257 gc m 2 in the summer due to the slow decomposition and low amount of litterfall whereas the tvc slowly tends to increase and peaks 638 gc m 2 in the summer due to the accumulation of carbon in the plants tsc under irrigation tends to be generally stable and has an average value of 8 827 gc m 2 in contrast the tlc tvc and tsc in the rainfed experiment have generally stable trends with average values of 80 gc m 2 4 0 gc m 2 and 7 827 gc m 2 respectively hence irrigation promotes total root biomass and organo mineral interactions in the cropland 3 5 irrigation effects on nitrogen budgets nitrogen availability influences crop and root growth and directly impacts crop yields barakat et al 2016 nitrogen pools are tightly associated with carbon pools thus exploration of the effects of irrigation on the nitrogen cycle is important and promotes an improved understanding of the carbon cycle unlike for tec the seasonal change in total ecosystem nitrogen ten is not sensitive the ten under irrigation and rainfed conditions tend to generally be stable with average values of 1 243 gn m 2 and 987 gn m 2 respectively throughout a seasonal cycle fig 11 interannually the ten of the irrigation simulation slightly fluctuated in the cropland area during the 19 years ranging from 1 238 gn m 2 to 1 249 gn m 2 in contrast the ten of the rainfed simulation tended to increase from 966 gn m 2 to 1 011 gn m 2 hence a total amount of 2 96 1012 gn additionally enters the ecosystem after irrigation during an entire year fig 13 like for the carbon budgets total litter nitrogen tln total vegetation nitrogen tvn and total soil organic matter nitrogen tsn significantly increased after irrigation table 6 seasonally the trends of tln and tsn in both irrigation and rainfed experiments were similar to those of tlc and tsc while the seasonal change in tvn differed fig 12 however unlike the above components total soil mineral nitrogen tsmn as an additional component of ten dramatically decreases from 226 gn m 2 to 5 2 gn m 2 in the cropland area after irrigation such a decrease occurred because irrigation tends to increase the denitrification rate from 0 08 gn m 2 year 1 to 2 9 gn m 2 year 1 while increasing the mineralization rate causing more nitrogen loss from soil minerals through leaching and runoff zhu et al 2020 3 6 limitations although our study demonstrates that clm5 can accurately represent the effects of irrigation on water carbon and nitrogen budgets there are some limitations in this study for example clm5 considers only hydrological and biogeophysical processes in the vertical direction groundwater lateral flow and lateral interactions are not strongly considered in the simulations second the irrigation module of the clm5 is mainly triggered by plant lai and water contents and currently cannot distinguish between sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and flooding irritation however in reality multiple methods of irrigation are utilized simultaneously in the hrb based on the local annual reports thus clm5 could cause some biases of the irrigation amount for some specific crops and could affect the optimal water use efficiency third parameters such as photosynthetic capacity and fertilization rates in reality could be more complex than those in our cases which could cause uncertainties during the simulations fourth this study is focused on the effects of irrigation on the main crop species but some other landcovers could also be affected by irrigation e g pasture such effects will be studied in the future 4 conclusions our study utilized the latest version of the community land model clm5 to evaluate the irrigation effects on water carbon and nitrogen budgets in an hrb cropland area and identified the contributions of each crop species to the budgets two numerical experiments one with irrigation and one without it were designed for quantitative evaluation in the period of 2000 2018 in situ flux towers remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets were used for validation the good match between the simulation results and stations or remote sensing observations reanalysis dataset demonstrated the capability of clm5 to represent the temporal and spatial features of water carbon and nitrogen budgets in the hrb based on our simulations the multiyear average irrigation amount between 2000 and 2018 was 476 mm seasonally the maximum magnitudes of irrigation occurred in june and july 120 mm month 1 corresponding to the plant growing season in the winter the irrigation amount is limited near 0 mm due to plant death specifically soybean wheat and barley required a large amount of irrigation water 500 mm year 1 whereas cotton and other c3 crop species required relatively low amounts of irrigation water 500 mm year 1 the influences of irrigation on evapotranspiration surface runoff and baseflow in each crop species area are significant evapotranspiration in the cropland area sharply increased from 106 mm year to 508 mm year accompanied by an increase in surface runoff and baseflow gpp and nee increased significantly after irrigation suggesting that the uptake rate of co2 by plants was strongly promoted the shift in nee from 6 gc m 2 year 1 to 229 gc m 2 year 1 indicated that the cropland area in the hrb switched from being a carbon source to a carbon sink in particular the corn area exhibited the largest increase decrease in gpp nee whereas the lowest increase decrease in gpp nee occurred in the cotton area the water use efficiency increased from 0 27 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 to 1 73 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 after irrigation over the hrb cropland area the total ecosystem carbon nitrogen with its components accurately reflected the carbon nitrogen pools in the hrb as a result irrigation increased the tec from 7 831 gc m 2 to 9 561 gc m 2 in the cropland area with a total increase of 3 29 1013 gc in the hrb cropland area after irrigation the three components tlc tsc tvc also increased with the largest increase occurring for tsc the ten increases from 988 gn m 2 year 1 to 1 244 gn m 2 year 1 with a total increase of 2 96 1012 gn in the hrb cropland area after irrigation three of its components tln tsn tvn also increased after irrigation however the total soil mineral nitrogen tsmn decreased after irrigation due to the increase in the denitrification rate credit authorship contribution statement shuai yang conceptualization formal analysis methodology software investigation writing original draft visualization kewei

2896,irrigation can substantially alter the hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles in river basins however little attention has been given to the quantitative evaluation of the effects of irrigation on both of these cycles in this study we utilized the latest version of the community land model clm5 to assess the effects of irrigation on the water carbon and nitrogen budgets in a cropland area of a large endorheic river basin heihe river basin hrb in northwestern china and further identified the contributions of each type of crop to the abovementioned budgets the model has been validated against local flux towers remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets demonstrating the capability of clm5 in capturing the temporal and spatial characteristics of water carbon and nitrogen at the basin scale two numerical experiments one with irrigation and one without it were conducted to explore the relationships between water and carbon nitrogen budgets for the period from 2000 to 2018 the simulation results showed that the greatest amount of irrigation was applied in the summer 50 mm month 1 and then declined to a low level during the other seasons evapotranspiration et in the cropland area sharply increased from 106 mm year 1 to 508 mm year 1 with an increase in surface runoff and baseflow after irrigation both irrigated gross primary production gpp net ecosystem exchange nee and water use efficiency wue peaked in the summer which corresponded to the crop growing season a shift in nee from 6 gc m 2 year 1 to 229 gc m 2 year 1 indicated that the cropland area in the hrb switched from being a carbon source to a carbon sink because of irrigation the corn area presented the largest increase decrease in gpp nee after irrigation whereas the lowest increase decrease in gpp nee was observed in the cotton area total ecosystem carbon tec and total ecosystem nitrogen ten markedly increased as a result of irrigation with increases of 3 29 1013 gc and 2 96 1012 gn respectively throughout the year in the cropland area overall our study demonstrates that irrigation has substantial impacts on water carbon and nitrogen budgets in the cropland area of the hrb and provides important insights into the application of clm5 in an arid basin with multiple crop types keywords irrigation community land model heihe river basin biogeochemical cycles total ecosystem

hydrologic and biogeochemical cycles in semiarid arid regions both directly and indirectly vitousek et al 1997 meijninger and de bruin 2000 scheer et al 2008 leng et al 2017 zeng et al 2017 zhu et al 2020 notably irrigation can moisten root zones and provide extra water to crops causing increases in evapotranspiration and latent heat flux as well as a decrease in sensible heat flux kendig et al 2000 lobell et al 2008 yu et al 2014 for biogeochemical cycles irrigation alters the regional carbon budget by affecting the magnitude of plant photosynthesis and respiration and further affects carbon emissions which are the leading triggers of global warming lashof and ahuja 1990 cox et al 2000 matthews et al 2009 zhang and cheng 2009 karimi et al 2012 tokarska and gillett 2018 zong et al 2020 paoletti et al 2022 the nitrogen budget is tightly associated with the carbon pool and nitrogen considerably impacts agricultural productivity and food security eickhout et al 2006 barakat et al 2016 nitrogen assimilated by plants is derived from the soil through complex processes some of which include nitrogen fixation and nitrogen deposition limited nitrogen fertilization accompanied with irrigation can restrict crop growth whereas excessive amounts of nitrogen applied to crops can cause water pollution thus evaluating the irrigation effects on water carbon and nitrogen budgets in semiarid arid cropland areas is crucial for an improved understanding of the interactions among water carbon and nitrogen cycles several modeling studies at different scales have been conducted and have provided critical insights into the exploration of the irrigation effects on various aspects including land atmosphere fluxes momentum fluxes and surface climate for instance the water vapor flux was found to increase to 300 kg m 2 year 1 after irrigation in eastern china based on the results from a general circulation model gcm boucher et al 2004 applying the coupled model of the community atmosphere model cam and the community land model version 3 5 clm3 5 the reduced sensible heat flux and the decreased average temperature on a global scale were interpreted to result from irrigation sacks et al 2009 according to the variable infiltration capacity vic model the bowen ratio decreases by 6 8 in the dry season over the mekong river basin after irrigation tatsumi and yamashiki 2015 in the heihe river basin hrb a high resolution 1 km numerical experiment via clm4 5 was conducted to investigate the seasonal effects of irrigation on land atmosphere fluxes and the results showed that latent heat lh sensible heat sh and net ecosystem exchange nee peaked in the summer after irrigation zeng et al 2017 on the basis of the results from a combination of the weather research and forecasting wrf model and noah multiparameterization noah mp the daily mean temperature decreased by 1 7 c and the humidity increased by 2 3 g kg 1 in the hrb with irrigation zhang et al 2017 moreover a recent study further proposed that the potential evapotranspiration tended to decrease due to irrigation in the hrb zhang et al 2020 however less research focused on carbon nitrogen cycles and identified the contributions of different crop species to the interactions of water carbon and nitrogen budgets which play an important role in local water management and regional carbon nitrogen balance in addition most models for investigating the biogeochemical scenarios of each crop species in a cropland are not available or oversimplified lawrence et al 2018 lawrence et al 2019 recently the latest version of the community land model clm5 has been updated with an improved irrigation module as well as a new scheme of carbon and nitrogen cycles lawrence et al 2019 this model can simulate the hydrologic and biogeochemical processes for 64 different crop species and thus can be utilized as an effective tool to investigate the contributions of different crop species to the water carbon and nitrogen budgets the clm has been extensively developed during the past three decades bonan 1996 oleson and bonan 2000 hack et al 2006 oleson et al 2008 lawrence et al 2011 riley et al 2011 li et al 2012 2013a swenson and lawrence 2014 2015 zeng et al 2017 sheng et al 2018 umair et al 2018 xie et al 2018 zhu et al 2020 cheng et al 2021 clm5 is the 5th generation clm and constitutes the land component of the community earth system model 2 cesm2 gent et al 2011 hurrell et al 2013 lawrence et al 2018 danabasoglu et al 2020 the model covers many biogeophysical and biogeochemical processes such as surface water and groundwater cycles phenology vegetation photosynthesis wildfires and carbon and nitrogen allocation compared to other land models clm5 has several distinctive features 1 the spatial land surface heterogeneity is adequately expressed by an enclosed subgrid hierarchy where each grid cell is subdivided into multiple levels of land units e g vegetation crops soil columns e g soil elevation classes and plant functional types e g needleleaf evergreen trees broadleaf evergreen trees 2 clm5 can be driven by meteorological forcing and strongly represents the fluxes momentum and interactions between the atmosphere and land 3 the crop and irrigation module of clm5 considers both natural factors and human management in agricultural landscapes such as planting harvesting tillage fertilization and irrigation and 4 the interaction between hydrologic and ecological cycles on different spatiotemporal scales from a single point to global scale can be simulated via clm5 therefore in this study we designed two numerical experiments one with and one without irrigation to assess the influence of irrigation on water carbon and nitrogen budgets in the cropland area of the hrb by the use of clm5 we also quantified the contributions of crop species to the changes in the abovementioned budgets detailed information for the model implementation and findings are shown below 2 methodology 2 1 study area the hrb is the second largest endorheic basin in china covering a total area of 143 000 km2 from 96 42 to 102 00 e in longitude and from 37 41 to 42 42 n in latitude fig 1 the hrb has a heterogeneous landscape and comprises upstream qilian mountains at the northern margin of the tibetan plateau middle stream oases and lower stream gobi desert regions with terminal lakes specifically the gobi desert and mountainous areas account for 58 and 33 of the hrb respectively whereas the oases constitute only 9 yao et al 2014 the elevation decreases from 5600 m upstream to 900 m downstream similarly annual precipitation in the hrb decreases from 750 mm in the mountain regions upstream to 50 mm in the plains regions downstream qi and luo 2005 ding et al 2009 resulting in a semiarid arid climate in the region annual evapotranspiration et in the oasis is 500 mm but decreases to 20 80 mm in the gobi desert tian et al 2015 several field experiments have been conducted in the hrb during the past few decades including the hrb field experiment heife wang and mitsuta 1992 hu et al 1994 jinta experiment chen et al 2005 field experiment on interaction between land and atmosphere in arid region of north west china nwc aliex zhang and huang 2004 watershed allied telemetry experimental research water li et al 2009 and heihe water allied telemetry experimental research hiwater li et al 2013b these field experiments established a systematic network of eddy covariance towers and automatic weather stations and provided a fundamental platform to study the ecohydrological mechanisms and processes in the hrb in response to climate change and anthropogenic activities water security and ecological security based on the above experiments irrigation has been demonstrated to be an important component of water balance and strongly impacts local ecosystems li et al 2013b the irrigated farmland in the hrb is mainly located in the middle reaches with minor distributions in the upstream mountain ridge and lower stream riverside li et al 2016 given that the hrb is an important region for agricultural production there are multiple types of crop species including corn cereals soybean rapeseed and other c3 crop species the annual precipitation and reference evapotranspiration et0 of the zhangye basin in the middle streams are 120 mm and 1 200 mm respectively zhang et al 2021a limited precipitation in the region translates to additional irrigation needed for crop growth cultivated land consumes a large amount of water resources 80 of the main channel and produces 90 of the total agricultural output in the hrb xu et al 2019 however intensive utilization of river water and groundwater for irrigation has caused severe water shortages and environmental deterioration in the region cheng et al 2014 an ecological water diversion project ewdp has been implemented since the end of the 20th century which involves a water reallocation plan within the hrb see cheng et al 2014 for details as a consequence the deterioration of ecohydrological systems in the hrb has been dramatically alleviated 2 2 model description 2 2 1 hydrological cycle module of clm5 the hydrology module considers multiple processes including infiltration throughfall interception evaporation surface runoff subsurface drainage canopy drip redistribution within the soil column and groundwater discharge and recharge in the hrb the total water balance of the system is defined via eq 1 as follows 1 δ w canopy δ w surface δ w snow δ w soil δ w aquifer q rain q snow q irri e t q over q h 2 o s f c q drai q rgwl q ice δ t the left side of the equation denotes the changes in canopy water δ w canopy surface water δ w surface snow water δ w snow soil water and ice δ w soil and water in the unconfined aquifer δ w aquifer the right side of the equation denotes the liquid component of precipitation q rain the solid component of precipitation q snow irrigation q irri evaporation from vegetation and the ground et surface runoff q over runoff from surface water storage q h2osfc subsurface drainage q drai liquid and solid runoff from glaciers and lakes q rgwl and runoff from other surface types q ice δ t refers to the time duration runoff is parameterized based on the topmodel based runoff model niu et al 2005 the microtopography defined as fine spatial scale elevation variations is assumed to be normally distributed around the grid cell mean elevation and controls surface water storage and outflow soil water is estimated following the one dimensional vertical richards equation and lateral subsurface runoff is determined by saturated soil moisture conditions within the soil column 2 2 2 carbon and nitrogen cycle modules of clm5 the clm5 model provides a fully prognostic treatment for all carbon and nitrogen state variables of the vegetation litter and soil organic matter separate state variables for c and n were tracked for leaf living stem dead stem living coarse root dead coarse root fine root and grain pools carbon assimilation and carbon release in plants occur through photosynthesis and respiration respectively the photosynthesis component of clm5 is simulated by a leaf utilization of nitrogen for assimilation luna based model ali et al 2016 the model can predict the potential acclimation of photosynthetic capacities under different environmental conditions as determined by temperature radiation co2 concentration day length and humidity two types of respiration namely maintenance respiration and growth respiration are parameterized under different temperatures and carbon and nitrogen uptake maintenance respiration is defined as the carbon cost to support the metabolic activity of existing living tissue while growth respiration is defined as the additional carbon cost for the synthesis of new growth the nitrogen simulation component of clm5 is based on the fixation and uptake of nitrogen model fisher et al 2010 brzostek et al 2014 shi et al 2016 and is tightly associated with carbon pools nitrogen uptake requires the consumption of energy derived from interactions with carbon the uptake of n in symbiotic bacteria in root nodules senescing tissues plants infected with arbuscular mycorrhizae and plants infected with ectomycorrhizae as well as the nonmycorrhizal uptake of nh4 and no3 are considered in clm5 denitrification and leaching are the two ways for nitrogen to exit the system 2 2 3 crop management module of clm5 the crop management module of clm5 is used to simulate biogeophysics and biogeochemistry in agricultural landscapes eight typical crop species temperate soybean tropical soybean temperate corn tropical corn spring wheat cotton rice and sugarcane are used as functional species types in the model and the soil columns between different crop species are distinctly specified each crop is divided into rainfed and irrigated fractions to capture both natural and human managed scenarios respectively phenologically there are four stages planting leaf emergence grain filling and harvest for species during a single year specifically crops first start to grow when the local temperature meets their required growing temperature on the planting day in the leaf emergence stage the leaves emerge once the growing degree days of the soil temperature at 0 05 m depth from the surface exceed the threshold the grain filling stage is triggered by the leaf area index lai and local air temperature in this phase the leaf area index also begins to decrease due to the background litterfall the final phase harvest occurs as soon as the crop reaches maturity which is determined by its growing degree day requirements the allocation of carbon and nitrogen is dynamic and driven by plant phenology simulated carbon assimilation begins every year upon leaf emergence and ends with a harvest a new scheme of carbon nitrogen ratios for the leaves stems and fine roots of crops is applied to clm5 to track seasonal change fertilization substantially impacts crop yields in clm5 fertilization is simulated by adding nitrogen directly to the soil nitrogen pool to meet the nitrogen requirement of crops the fertilization process starts at the leaf emergence stage and lasts for 20 days to limit denitrification rates in this study the fertilization rates for corn 16 gn m 2 year 1 wheat 8 gn m 2 year 1 and soybean 2 gn m 2 year 1 were set following the methods of zhu et al 2020 which are derived from usda fertilizer use and price products the rates for cotton rapeseed and other c3 crop species were set at a default rate of 2 gn m 2 year 1 table 1 2 2 4 irrigation module of clm5 the irrigation module of clm5 is designed for irrigated cropland areas the module dynamically responds to soil moisture and involves checking the lai and soil water content every morning at 6 am local time to determine whether irrigation is necessary such a mechanism could dynamically check the crop status and limit the loss of irrigation water from evaporation if the crop leaf area is 0 and the available soil water is below a specified threshold the irrigation amount is determined by the soil moisture deficit dirrig between the threshold and available soil moisture content as follows 2 d irrig w thresh w avail w t h r e s h w a v a i l 3 d irrig 0 w t h r e s h w a v a i l where wthresh refers to the irrigation moisture threshold mm and wavail refers to the available moisture mm wthresh and wavail are defined as 4 w thresh f thresh w t arg e t w wilt w wilt 5 w avail j 1 n irr θ j δ z j 6 w t arg e t j 1 n irr θ t arg e t δ z j 7 w wilt j 1 n irr θ wilt δ z j where w target is the target soil moisture mm w wilt is wilting point soil moisture mm fthresh is a tuning parameter ranging from 0 to 1 nirr is the index of the soil layer and θ t arg e t θ wilt and θ j are the target volumetric soil moisture wilting point volumetric soil moisture and volumetric soil moisture contents in layer j respectively δ z j refers to the thickness of the soil layer in layer j importantly according to clm5 irrigation water is removed from river water storage for mass conservation and directly applied to the ground surface by evenly distributing the amount of water 2 3 model setup and experimental design the input data of clm5 include meteorological forcing data domain information soil property data and regional land cover data table 2 the meteorological forcing data between 2000 and 2018 have a spatial resolution of 0 05 0 05 and a temporal resolution of 1 h the data are generated by the institute of tibetan plateau research of the chinese academy of sciences using the weather research forecasting model pan 2020 the dataset has been validated by daily observational data from 15 chinese meteorological bureau conventional automatic weather stations as well as hourly meteorological data from 7 sites of watershed airborne telemetry experimental research water yielding good correlation coefficient r and reasonable mean bias error mbe pan and li 2011 pan et al 2012 pan et al 2014 pan et al 2015 the forcing variables include precipitation air temperature radiation relative humidity and wind speed data the domain map containing local grids and coordinates is generated by clm domain tools the soil property dataset utilizes the clm default global soil dataset which is derived from the international geosphere biosphere programme igbp soil dataset global soil data task 2000 global soil data task 2014 the land cover data are obtained based on the heihe watershed allied telemetry experimental research land cover map with 30 m spatial resolution li et al 2013b zhong et al 2014 2015 the data including specific crop types vegetation types glaciers lakes urban areas and other land information in particular the crop types consist of corn 30 barley 8 cotton 8 wheat 7 soybean 4 rapeseed 2 and other c3 crop species 41 we then bilinearly interpolated the higher resolution land cover map 30 m onto 0 05 0 05 grids over the region the land cover in the hrb did not change substantially between 2000 and 2015 table 3 the observed land cover change is 0 3 during the 16 years for primary types thus the impacts of land cover change on water carbon and nitrogen are not considered in this study clm5 was first spin up for 600 years with an active irrigation module and recycled forcing data 2000 2018 until the water carbon and nitrogen state reached equilibrium two numerical experiments in the hrb were subsequently designed the first experiment involves the natural mode under which the crops are rainfed denoted as clmrainfed and the irrigation module was removed the second experiment involves an irrigation simulation with the irrigation module activated over irrigated crop areas denoted as clmirrigated the two experiments shared the same meteorological forcing land cover and initial conditions thus the effects of irrigation on each budget water carbon and nitrogen could be investigated by comparing these two cases 2 4 in situ observations remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets for validation the model performance was evaluated against in situ from eddy covariance ec data and grid values of remote sensing products four local flux towers daman station dashalong station huazhaizi station and sidaoqiao station respectively in different types of land use cropland grassland desert and shrubland respectively across the upper middle and lower streams of the hrb were selected and the variables we compared included daily sensible heat flux sh latent heat flux lh and net ecosystem exchange nee the original temporal resolution of each flux tower is 30 min but was further converted to daily resolution for validation the comparison periods between simulated data and observed data at each flux tower site consecutively ranged from 2013 to 2018 spatial evapotranspiration data with a spatial resolution of 1 km between 2000 and 2013 were obtained from the remote sensing dataset named the etwatch product wu et al 2012 the etwatch data include actual et collected by the use of multiple remote sensing data and various inversion algorithms e g tseb sebs and sebal norman et al 1995 anderson et al 1997 su 2002 bastiaanssen et al 2005 etwatch has been independently verified using different approaches over diverse landscapes wu et al 2012 gross primary production gpp 2001 2005 data were obtained from the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis 8 day product with a spatial resolution of 500 m mod17a2h https www nasa gov the modis gpp product is generated based on the radiation use efficiency concept assuming a linear relationship between crop productivity and solar energy latent heat lh 2001 2005 data were obtained from the era5 land reanalysis datasets which combine model data with global observations and provide a consistent view of the evolution of land variables over consecutive time periods era5 land datasets have a special resolution of 0 1 0 1 and temporal resolution of both hourly and monthly frequency 3 results and discussion 3 1 model validation 3 1 1 comparison with the data collected from the flux towers the magnitude and seasonal variation in the simulated sh are consistent with the observed sh at daman r 0 75 p 0 01 and huazhaizi r 0 83 p 0 01 fig 2 in contrast the simulated sh at dashalong and at sidaoqiao is slightly overestimated r 0 40 p 0 01 and underestimated r 0 58 p 0 01 respectively for lh simulated trends in daman r 0 83 p 0 01 dashalong r 0 86 p 0 01 huazhaizi r 0 83 p 0 01 and sidaoqiao r 0 79 p 0 01 well match the observations except for a slight underestimation of the peak value in the summer the simulated nee at daman r 0 74 p 0 01 and dashalong r 0 52 p 0 01 were also close to the observed data while sidaoqiao station yields a relatively weak correlation r 0 43 p 0 01 for huazhaizi the nee is extremely low due to the lack of plants in the desert overall the model could reflect seasonal and interannual variations in energy and carbon cycles in the hrb in the cropland area the model captures the trends well and reflects the magnitudes of sh lh and nee in the grassland area the model could also reflect the sh and nee but slightly underestimates the lh in the desert area the model reflects sh and lh changes whereas both the observed and simulated nee were negligible in the shrubland the model can reflect the trends of sh lh and nee with slight underestimation of the peak of sh and lh 3 1 2 comparison with remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets the spatial pattern of et from etwatch is consistent with the simulated et with irrigation fig 3 high et is observed in the cropland area in the middle reaches the mountainous area in the upstream reaches has a relatively lower et than that in the middle reaches and the gobi desert downstream displays a low level et the annual mean et over the entire basin from etwatch was 132 mm between 2000 and 2013 in contrast the model with the irrigation experiment and the model with the rainfed experiment yield mean et values of 148 mm year 1 and 95 mm year 1 respectively fig 3 hence the irrigated et from clm5 is slightly higher than the etwatch product especially in the middle reaches however previous studies have reported that the etwatch product underestimates the data in the middle reaches e g tian et al 2015 wu et al 2015 li et al 2016 sun et al 2018 specifically wu et al 2015 proposed that the annual et in cultivated land is 450 mm year 1 while tian et al 2015 stated that the annual et in middle farmland is 600 mm year 1 in comparison an average et of 506 mm year 1 in the cropland area derived from the clm5 irrigation experiment falls in the range of previous studies therefore the et from the irrigation experiment in clm5 is reliable moreover the large difference between the irrigation experiment and the rainfed experiment mainly resulted from the addition of irrigation water in the midstream cropland gross primary production gpp reflects the rate of carbon fixation through vegetation photosynthesis generally the irrigation experiment captured the spatial distribution of gpp in the hrb well whereas this factor was overestimated in the middle reaches compared to that of the modis gpp product fig 3 however previous studies have also shown that the modis gpp product may underestimate the actual gpp of the hrb e g wang et al 2011 you et al 2020 zhang et al 2021b the annual gpp of 887 gc m 2 year 1 with a maximum value of 1200 gc m 2 year 1 in the crop land area from the clm5 irrigation experiment is consistent with a previously reported gpp 900 gc m 2 year 1 in middle farmland you et al 2020 hence the spatial pattern of gpp derived from the clm5 irrigation experiment is reliable and could reflect the real scenario of co2 sequestration in the hrb in contrast the gpp in the rainfed experiment was not sensitive to the middle reaches of the cropland area given the low resolution of the era5 land dataset the details of lh of the landscapes are not well presented however it can be seen the pattern of lh over the upper middle and lower streams in the era5 land dataset exhibits significant difference corresponding to the different landcovers fig s1 although there are slightly overestimates of lh in the middle reaches simulated lh with irrigation generally captures the trends of lh in the era5 land dataset over the entire basin in addition the distribution and the magnitude of lh in simulated lh with irrigation is near identical to the results in zeng et al 2017 in contrast the lh in the rainfed experiment is low in the cropland area due to the limited growth of plants overall based on the comparisons with remote sensing products etwatch product the modis gpp product and reanalysis dataset era5 land lh dataset in terms of spatial distribution and landscape heterogeneity within the hrb the model is robust and acceptable 3 2 simulated irrigation amount the spatial distribution of irrigation is heterogeneous fig 4 specifically irrigation mainly occurs in the middle oasis reaches with minor amounts occurring on the upper stream mountain ridge and lower stream riverside the simulation yields a mean annual irrigation amount of 476 mm over the cropland area between 2000 and 2018 in particular the annual amounts of irrigation applied to corn mean 585 mm wheat mean 675 mm barley mean 765 mm soybean mean 897 mm cotton mean 467 mm and other c3 irrigated crops mean 295 mm are also calculated by clm5 the irrigation amount for rapeseed is negligible due to its low percentage as a result the annual irrigation amount is slightly lower than that in a previous irrigation dataset 1 6 mm day 1 zeng et al 2017 derived from the cold and arid regions science data center carsdc at lanzhou this is because a large area of other c3 crop species is considered in our simulations leading to a relatively lower irrigation flux 295 mm year 1 and causing a lower total irrigation amount in the cropland area the local annual report gives an annual irrigation amount of 500 700 mm for the main crop species in the zhangye basin zhangye water conservancy bureau 2010 which is generally consistent with the clm5 simulation of irrigation excluding the other c3 crop species additionally the irrigation amounts for corn and wheat are comparable to that in previous studies in which annual water requirements of 572 mm and 430 700 mm for corn liu and shen 2018 and wheat zhao et al 2005 respectively were proposed although there are some uncertainties also see the limitation section for more details the simulated irrigation amount from clm5 is acceptable and could reflect the local water consumption there are seasonal and interannual variabilities in the simulated irrigation water amount fig 4 seasonally the irrigation flux dramatically increases between april and october corresponding to the crop growing season and then declines to a low level near 0 mm month 1 from november to march the maximum values occur in june and july with irrigation fluxes 120 mm month 1 interannually a relatively low irrigation 450 mm occurred in 2003 2005 2009 2012 2016 and 2018 with the lowest value of 411 mm while a relatively high irrigation 500 mm occurred in 2002 2004 2006 2011 2013 and 2017 with the largest value of 540 mm irrigation is mainly driven by meteorological forcing typically high precipitation and low temperature leads to reduced irrigation whereas low precipitation and high temperature leads to increased irrigation however the same trends of precipitation and temperature are also observed for some years in our simulations for example relatively low irrigation occurred in 2003 with relatively low precipitation and relatively low temperature whereas high irrigation occurred in 2017 with relatively high precipitation and temperature fig 4 such observations suggest that the irrigation amount is driven by the combination of multiple factors e g precipitation temperature water contents rather than a single factor notably the irrigation amount in the hrb cropland is much higher than precipitation to promote plant growth reflecting a heavily arid climate and relatively low water contents in the region 3 3 irrigation effects on the water budget the quantification of the contribution of each component to the water budget is important to better understand the water balance in clm5 precipitation and irrigation are considered external factors while water can leave the system through evapotranspiration surface runoff and baseflow the water balance reflects the difference between all input and output water volumes over a specified period as well as changes in internal water storage burt 1999 hence the above variables in the cropland area are highlighted here fig 5 as a result both irrigated et and rainfed et peaked in the summer and et sharply increased from 106 mm year 1 to 508 mm year 1 over the cropland area after irrigation in particular corn wheat and soybean have relatively high et 548 mm year 1 562 mm year 1 and 577 mm year 1 respectively after irrigation while barley cotton and other c3 crop species have relatively low et 432 mm year 1 128 mm year 1 367 mm year 1 respectively in addition the soybean area has the largest δ et clmirrigated clmrainfed of 504 mm year 1 whereas the cotton area has the lowest δ et of 72 mm year 1 table 4 the corn wheat barley and other c3 crop species have relatively moderate δ et ranging from 193 mm year 1 to 460 mm year 1 the significant increase in et is attributed to the additional irrigation causing increased water contents as well as increased soil evaporation and total transpiration xie et al 2005 the dramatic increase in et 400 mm year 1 for soybean and corn suggested that these species are more sensitive to water stress while the other crop species have relatively lower sensitivity daryanto et al 2016 ma et al 2018 zhang et al 2021a the good positive correlations for all the crop species r2 0 6 p 0 01 fig 6 between δ et and irrigation amount from 2000 to 2018 further demonstrated the significant increase in et after irrigation in all crop areas additionally surface runoff increases from 13 2 mm year 1 to 74 8 mm year 1 after irrigation while baseflow is increased from 1 0 mm year 1 to 9 3 mm year 1 in particular the wheat area yields the largest difference of 76 8 mm year 1 while the cotton field has the lowest difference of 5 3 mm year 1 table 4 the largest difference in baseflow occurred in the corn area 14 7 mm year 1 whereas the other c3 crop species had the lowest baseflow change 1 8 mm year 1 the variations in the increase in surface runoff and baseflow in each crop species area suggested that the soil textures and cover crop root systems were heterogeneous yu et al 2016 based on the above results it can be summarized that irrigation affects the water budget considerably and adds a layer of complexity to the water balance in the hrb a major fraction of irrigation water use was transferred into et followed by increased runoff and baseflow in the hrb cropland area 3 4 irrigation effects on carbon budgets 3 4 1 gpp and nee changes in the hrb cropland area gross primary production gpp reflects the carbon sequestration capability of plants seasonally gpp in the irrigation experiment sharply increased in the summer corresponding to the crop growing season fig 7 notably the gpp in june and july reached 250 gc m 2 month 1 whereas the gpp from november to april remained at a relatively low level 15 gc m 2 month 1 in contrast the gpp in the rainfed experiment was maintained at a constantly low level 10 gc m 2 month 1 throughout the entire year the significant difference mean 120 gc m 2 month 1 between the irrigated gpp and rainfed gpp from april to october suggested that irrigation could dramatically promote photosynthesis capacity and facilitate plant growth interannually gpp in the irrigation experiment showed dramatic fluctuations in the cropland area from 2000 to 2018 as a result the average simulated gross primary production gpp during the 19 years considerably increases from 29 gc m 2 year 1 to 880 gc m 2 year 1 after irrigation fig 7 the highest value 958 gc m 2 year 1 and lowest value 752 gc m 2 year 1 occurred in 2002 and 2018 respectively in contrast the gpp in the rainfed experiment is lower in magnitude and the highest value and lowest value are 43 gc m 2 year 1 in 2015 and 14 gc m 2 year 1 in 2003 respectively specifically each crop species has different contributions to the regional gpp all the crops have a relatively high gpp in the summer although the rate of decrease for each crop species tended to be different in the other seasons fig 8 corn wheat and soybean contribute more gpp in the summer with maximum values of 404 gc m 2 month 1 304 gc m 2 month 1 and 312 gc m 2 month 1 respectively after which their gpp tends to decrease rapidly from august to december in comparison the maximum gpp values for barley cotton and other c3 crop species in the summer are 162 gc m 2 month 1 33 gc m 2 month 1 and 109 gc m 2 month 1 respectively after which their gpp tended to slowly decrease between august and december annually corn has the highest average gpp of 1 101 gc m 2 year 1 with the largest increase in gpp 1 066 gc m 2 year 1 after irrigation over the hrb cropland area between 2000 and 2018 while cotton has the lowest average gpp of 99 gc m 2 year 1 with the smallest increase in gpp 99 gc m 2 year 1 wheat barley soybean and other c3 species have a moderate gpp 465 1 015 gc m 2 year 1 which moderately increases 363 974 gc m 2 year 1 fig 8 phenologically the largest gpp being detected in the corn area together with the greatest increase suggested that corn a c4 crop species may have a faster rate of photosynthesis than rest of the crop species in the hrb cropland area qin et al 2015 the other crop species which are c3 species have a relatively lower gpp that moderately increases due to their slower co2 fixation rate long et al 2006 in addition the sensitivity of gpp for each crop species to irrigation amount is displayed in fig 9 although wheat and barley have relatively weaker correlations r2 0 30 p 0 01 and r2 0 36 p 0 01 respectively corn soybean cotton and other c3 plant species exhibited relatively good correlations r2 0 63 p 0 01 suggesting that irrigation promoted carbon sequestration net ecosystem exchange nee which refers to the difference between ecosystem respiration er and gpp can be an indicator of the carbon balance of a land area seasonally unlike gpp nee in the irrigation experiment starts to increase from january to april but then dramatically shifts to negative values with a negative peak in june 137 gc m 2 month 1 the dynamic change from a positive value to a negative value indicates that the cropland changes from a carbon source to a carbon sink afterward the nee rapidly increases and becomes positive again between september and december 1 7 gc m 2 month 1 in contrast the average rainfed nee 0 gc m 2 month 1 is relatively stable throughout the year notably both the gpp and the nee in the irrigation simulation peak in the summer corresponding to the largest irrigation flux hence such a pattern suggests that irrigation has the greatest contribution to crops between april and september and strongly increases the uptake of co2 by plants interannually the average simulated nee changed from 6 gc m 2 year 1 to 229 gc m 2 year 1 after irrigation in the cropland area during the 19 years fig 7 the nee pattern in the irrigation experiment tends to oscillate the highest nee occurred in 2018 186 gc m 2 year 1 and the lowest nee occurred in 2011 269 gc m 2 year 1 the nee in the rainfed experiment fluctuated during the 19 years ranging from 2 gc m 2 year 1 in 2015 to 13 gc m 2 year 1 in 2000 like for gpp the nee of all the crop species peaked in the summer suggesting that more carbon is fixed during that time specifically corn wheat and soybean exhibit similar trends of nee whereas barley other c3 plant species and cotton have similar trends of nee in a seasonal cycle annually the corn area has the maximum increase after irrigation and yields the lowest average nee of 427 gc m 2 year 1 while the minimum increase in magnitude occurs in the cotton area with an average nee of 11 gc m 2 year 1 during the 19 years fig 8 table 5 the above results indicate that different crop species exhibit different patterns and that the fluctuations in nee could reflect the variations in gpp and er from january to april most of the crops have positive nee values suggesting a larger ecosystem respiration than gpp and that more co2 is released into the atmosphere in the spring in the summer the nee became negative suggesting that irrigation promoted both gpp and er in the crop growing season to a larger degree for the former afterward the crops entered the grain filling phase and the lai started to decline causing a decrease in gpp and an increase in nee thus the correlations between δ nee and irrigation amount are not similar to those for gpp except for the other c3 plant species r2 0 66 p 0 01 the remaining crops exhibit relatively weaker correlations between δ nee and irrigation amount r2 0 39 fig 9 during the 19 years indicating that there are variations in ability of irrigation to promote gpp and er 3 4 2 water use efficiency changes in the hrb cropland area water use efficiency wue defined as the ratio of gpp to et reflects the interactions between water and carbon cycles ponton et al 2006 hu et al 2008 yu et al 2008 zhu et al 2014 as a result the wue in both the irrigation and rainfed simulations increased significantly during the summer however the wue under irrigation remained at a moderate level between august and november and then rapidly decreased to a lower level in the winter while the wue under rainfed conditions tends to continually decrease after summer interannually the average wue increased from 0 27 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 to 1 73 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 in the cropland area between 2000 and 2018 after irrigation fig 10 the highest wue of the irrigation experiment and rainfed experiment occurred in 2005 1 82 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 and 2014 0 36 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 respectively in contrast the lowest wue from the irrigation experiment and rainfed experiment occurred in 2000 1 67 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 and 2003 0 17 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 respectively suggesting slight interannual variabilities specifically all the crop species presented their highest wue values in the summer corresponding to the growing season then the wue for each crop species decreases to a lower level in the autumn in the winter most crop species wheat barley cotton soybean have low wue values near 0 gc m 2 mm 1 month 1 whereas the wue values of corn and other c3 crop species remain at moderate levels 0 46 gc m 2 mm 1 month 1 and 0 72 gc m 2 mm 1 month 1 respectively fig 10 annually the corn area has the highest wue 2 01 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 with the largest increase 1 60 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 whereas the cotton area has the lowest wue value of 0 78 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 the lowest increase occurred in the barley area 0 45 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 table 5 hence these results indicate that corn cereals and soybean are probably the optimal crop species in the hrb 3 4 3 total ecosystem carbon changes in the hrb cropland area the seasonal and interannual changes in total ecosystem carbon tec are illustrated in fig 11 seasonally the maximum magnitude of tec in the irrigation simulation in the cropland occurs in the summer with a maximum value of 9 728 gc m 2 corresponding to the plant growing season in contrast the rainfed experiment exhibits a relatively stable tec 7 830 gc m 2 across all seasons interannually the irrigation experiment yields slightly fluctuating tec values during the 19 years ranging from 9 484 gc m 2 to 9 644 gc m 2 in contrast the tec of the rainfed experiment tends to slowly decrease ranging from 7 911 gc m 2 to 7 769 gc m 2 hence in this scenario a total amount of 3 29 1013 gc additionally enters the ecosystem after irrigation each year total litter carbon tlc total vegetation carbon tvc and total soil organic matter carbon tsc are the three components of tec after irrigation all three of these components significantly increased fig 12 fig s2 table 6 however the tlc tvc and tsc displayed different patterns throughout each seasonal cycle specifically the tlc in the irrigation experiment tends to decrease from january and reaches the lowest level 257 gc m 2 in the summer due to the slow decomposition and low amount of litterfall whereas the tvc slowly tends to increase and peaks 638 gc m 2 in the summer due to the accumulation of carbon in the plants tsc under irrigation tends to be generally stable and has an average value of 8 827 gc m 2 in contrast the tlc tvc and tsc in the rainfed experiment have generally stable trends with average values of 80 gc m 2 4 0 gc m 2 and 7 827 gc m 2 respectively hence irrigation promotes total root biomass and organo mineral interactions in the cropland 3 5 irrigation effects on nitrogen budgets nitrogen availability influences crop and root growth and directly impacts crop yields barakat et al 2016 nitrogen pools are tightly associated with carbon pools thus exploration of the effects of irrigation on the nitrogen cycle is important and promotes an improved understanding of the carbon cycle unlike for tec the seasonal change in total ecosystem nitrogen ten is not sensitive the ten under irrigation and rainfed conditions tend to generally be stable with average values of 1 243 gn m 2 and 987 gn m 2 respectively throughout a seasonal cycle fig 11 interannually the ten of the irrigation simulation slightly fluctuated in the cropland area during the 19 years ranging from 1 238 gn m 2 to 1 249 gn m 2 in contrast the ten of the rainfed simulation tended to increase from 966 gn m 2 to 1 011 gn m 2 hence a total amount of 2 96 1012 gn additionally enters the ecosystem after irrigation during an entire year fig 13 like for the carbon budgets total litter nitrogen tln total vegetation nitrogen tvn and total soil organic matter nitrogen tsn significantly increased after irrigation table 6 seasonally the trends of tln and tsn in both irrigation and rainfed experiments were similar to those of tlc and tsc while the seasonal change in tvn differed fig 12 however unlike the above components total soil mineral nitrogen tsmn as an additional component of ten dramatically decreases from 226 gn m 2 to 5 2 gn m 2 in the cropland area after irrigation such a decrease occurred because irrigation tends to increase the denitrification rate from 0 08 gn m 2 year 1 to 2 9 gn m 2 year 1 while increasing the mineralization rate causing more nitrogen loss from soil minerals through leaching and runoff zhu et al 2020 3 6 limitations although our study demonstrates that clm5 can accurately represent the effects of irrigation on water carbon and nitrogen budgets there are some limitations in this study for example clm5 considers only hydrological and biogeophysical processes in the vertical direction groundwater lateral flow and lateral interactions are not strongly considered in the simulations second the irrigation module of the clm5 is mainly triggered by plant lai and water contents and currently cannot distinguish between sprinkler irrigation drip irrigation and flooding irritation however in reality multiple methods of irrigation are utilized simultaneously in the hrb based on the local annual reports thus clm5 could cause some biases of the irrigation amount for some specific crops and could affect the optimal water use efficiency third parameters such as photosynthetic capacity and fertilization rates in reality could be more complex than those in our cases which could cause uncertainties during the simulations fourth this study is focused on the effects of irrigation on the main crop species but some other landcovers could also be affected by irrigation e g pasture such effects will be studied in the future 4 conclusions our study utilized the latest version of the community land model clm5 to evaluate the irrigation effects on water carbon and nitrogen budgets in an hrb cropland area and identified the contributions of each crop species to the budgets two numerical experiments one with irrigation and one without it were designed for quantitative evaluation in the period of 2000 2018 in situ flux towers remote sensing products and reanalysis datasets were used for validation the good match between the simulation results and stations or remote sensing observations reanalysis dataset demonstrated the capability of clm5 to represent the temporal and spatial features of water carbon and nitrogen budgets in the hrb based on our simulations the multiyear average irrigation amount between 2000 and 2018 was 476 mm seasonally the maximum magnitudes of irrigation occurred in june and july 120 mm month 1 corresponding to the plant growing season in the winter the irrigation amount is limited near 0 mm due to plant death specifically soybean wheat and barley required a large amount of irrigation water 500 mm year 1 whereas cotton and other c3 crop species required relatively low amounts of irrigation water 500 mm year 1 the influences of irrigation on evapotranspiration surface runoff and baseflow in each crop species area are significant evapotranspiration in the cropland area sharply increased from 106 mm year to 508 mm year accompanied by an increase in surface runoff and baseflow gpp and nee increased significantly after irrigation suggesting that the uptake rate of co2 by plants was strongly promoted the shift in nee from 6 gc m 2 year 1 to 229 gc m 2 year 1 indicated that the cropland area in the hrb switched from being a carbon source to a carbon sink in particular the corn area exhibited the largest increase decrease in gpp nee whereas the lowest increase decrease in gpp nee occurred in the cotton area the water use efficiency increased from 0 27 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 to 1 73 gc m 2 mm 1 year 1 after irrigation over the hrb cropland area the total ecosystem carbon nitrogen with its components accurately reflected the carbon nitrogen pools in the hrb as a result irrigation increased the tec from 7 831 gc m 2 to 9 561 gc m 2 in the cropland area with a total increase of 3 29 1013 gc in the hrb cropland area after irrigation the three components tlc tsc tvc also increased with the largest increase occurring for tsc the ten increases from 988 gn m 2 year 1 to 1 244 gn m 2 year 1 with a total increase of 2 96 1012 gn in the hrb cropland area after irrigation three of its components tln tsn tvn also increased after irrigation however the total soil mineral nitrogen tsmn decreased after irrigation due to the increase in the denitrification rate credit authorship contribution statement shuai yang conceptualization formal analysis methodology software investigation writing original draft visualization kewei

2897,data driven hydrological modeling has seen rapid development in recent years owing to its flexibility to approximate the complex relationships between driving forces and hydrological fluxes however traditional data driven models typically cannot simultaneously capture the processes that pose both chronic and acute impacts on streamflow thus impeding further inference therefore this study presents a baseflow filtered hydrological inference model to gain insights into hydrological processes in irrigated watersheds the proposed model starts with separating the streamflow process into two sub processes using a process based baseflow separation method each sub process is simulated through a new interpretable data driven model the resulting hydrological inferences facilitate the identification of the dominant factors influencing flows in saturated and unsaturated zones the proposed model is applied to three irrigated watersheds and the evaluation metrics show that the proposed model outperforms two conventional data driven models our findings reveal that predictors associated with air temperature and long term i e monthly irrigation are mainly responsible for characterizing baseflow dynamics while precipitation and short term i e semi weekly or weekly irrigation are primarily responsible for describing overland flow and interflow dynamics the fidelity of the derived hydrological inference is further demonstrated through sensitivity analysis the results show that the relative importance of predictors not only reflects their significance on model performance but also influence the changes on streamflow keywords data driven model hydrological inference importance ranking baseflow separation irrigated watershed data availability data will be

altered the hydrological processes and threatened the ecosystems in many regions worldwide clement et al 2009 dewandel et al 2008 dong et al 2015 gosain et al 2005 in particular flood irrigation is a prevailing irrigation method that has been widely used in many countries das bhowmik et al 2020 mottaleb et al 2019 on one hand such an irrigation method intensifies the rainfall runoff process by increasing surface runoff thereby raising the risk of flooding gu et al 2019 on the other hand it increases groundwater levels and causes salinization kong et al 2021 waleeittikul et al 2019 to help mitigate these negative impacts and to develop sound irrigation plans it is necessary to examine the contribution of relevant driving forces e g precipitation and irrigation to surface and subsurface flows hydrological processes in irrigated watersheds are more complex than those in pristine watersheds due to crop evapotranspiration vishwakarma et al 2022 and irrigation schemes li et al 2022a which should consider both flood control and optimal allocation of often insufficient irrigation water available spatially and temporally li et al 2019 razavi et al 2020 such complexities lead to a significant challenge in quantifying the relative contributions of irrigation and precipitation to the rainfall runoff processes extensive efforts have been made in the past decades to quantify associated driving forces such as the use of isotope based methods kong et al 2021 lee et al 2021 lv et al 2018 correlation based methods młyński et al 2021 qing et al 2022 you and wang 2021 sensitivity based methods kumar et al 2022 and process based simulation models ditthakit et al 2021 liu et al 2020 ramireddygari et al 2000 traylor and zlotnik 2016 zeng and cai 2014 although previous approaches advanced our understanding of the underlying hydrological mechanisms in irrigated watersheds they required tremendous time to acquire and process the data lee et al 2021 liu et al 2020 for instance the limited accessibility of high resolution spatially distributed irrigated water may hinder the application of process based simulation models moreover irrigated watersheds are often characterized by a flat terrain which is particularly difficult to delineate an appropriate watershed domain for running distributed hydrological models rahman et al 2010 as an alternative to the above mentioned approaches data driven models such as neural networks yang et al 2021 asce task committee 2000 baek et al 2020 chen et al 2014 hsu et al 1995 kratzert et al 2019a genetic programming babovic and keijzer 2002 chadalawada et al 2020 meshgi et al 2015 and regression tree ensemble rte galelli and castelletti 2013 li et al 2021a schnier and cai 2014 zhang et al 2019 have received increasing attention in recent years especially in the quantification of the contributions of driving forces for instance kratzert et al 2019b investigated the relative contributions of climatic and non climatic factors to runoff generation through long short term memory networks konapala and mishra 2020 examined 60 variables through a random forest model breiman 2001 to understand their relative contributions to hydrological drought development schmidt et al 2020 explored the relative contribution of multiple driving forces to flood events in germany through three data driven models although previous studies have effectively quantified the relationship between model inputs and outputs it is still unclear whether the relative contributions of driving forces are physically consistent physically consistent means that the obtained relative contributions not only reflect the importance of predictors influencing the goodness of fit of a model but also influence the changes on streamflow razavi 2021 in recent years the need for physically consistency of data driven models has led to research efforts on hybridizing process based and data driven approaches in hydrological sciences and beyond refer to razavi et al 2022 for a review and perspective of such hybridization efforts there are various ways of incorporating hydrological knowledge into data driven models chadalawada et al 2020 herath et al 2021 karpatne et al 2018 nearing et al 2021 singh et al 2017 for instance daw et al 2017 used physics based loss functions to guide the learning of neural networks liang et al 2019 and lu et al 2021 incorporated the outputs from a process based model into data driven models to improve predictive skills however since the above mentioned approaches did not take into account the physical processes of hydrology the interpretability is still limited in recent years attempts have been made to incorporate data driven models into the structure of process driven models bhasme et al 2021 khandelwal et al 2020 one of the successful attempts is to use data driven models to emulate sub hydrological processes e g overland flow and baseflow generated from a process based model meshgi et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 such a method allows the simulation from a data driven model to be explained under the paradigm of a two layer hydrological model structure badrzadeh et al 2016 corzo and solomatine 2007 tongal and booij 2018 wu et al 2009 the rationale behind this method is that the underlying mechanisms of streamflow dynamics are more likely to lead to distinct behaviors in terms of flow magnitudes and seasonal characteristics dralle et al 2016 newman et al 2015 specifically the baseflow mainly contributes to low flow events whereas intense storms give rise to high flow events a single global data driven model could hardly capture both high and low runoff dynamics wu et al 2009 consequently modular models i e building separate models for several sub hydrological processes are desired for hydrological simulation and inference solomatine and ostfeld 2008 nevertheless most of the existing data driven models with modular model considerations mainly focus on improving predictive accuracy tongal and booij 2018 or quantifying the contribution of different land uses meshgi et al 2015 the relative contribution of relevant driving forces to surface and sub surface flow generations has not yet been studied this requires a formal sensitivity analysis to peer inside data driven models to understand their internals and improve the interpretability of their results see section 3 4 of razavi et al 2021 for a discussion in irrigated watersheds quantifying such contribution could be particularly useful in facilitating the conjunctive operation of surface water and groundwater resources thereby reducing the risks of flooding and salinization in light of the above considerations the objective of this study is to develop a baseflow filtered stepwise clustered ensemble bfsce to improve the quantification of the relative contribution of associated driving forces e g precipitation and irrigation to sub hydrological processes i e surface and subsurface flows this study entails i analyzing sub hydrological processes including surface and subsurface flows of three irrigated watersheds in the upper reach of the yellow river basin china ii identifying the relative contribution of associated driving forces to each of the sub hydrological processes through wilks feature importance wfi method iii running a sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of precipitation irrigation and their interactions through multilevel factorial analysis mfa to support the relevant inference iv gaining insights into runoff generation mechanisms based on the results derived from wfi and mfa 2 development of the baseflow filtered stepwise clustered ensemble in this study the baseflow in this study is defined as the groundwater contribution to streamflow which can be affected by many factors such as changes in watershed characteristics soil land use and climate price 2011 the overland flow is defined as water flowing over the land surface excluding streams and rivers the interflow is defined as the lateral movement of water in the unsaturated zone or vadose zone which first returns to the surface or enters a stream before becoming groundwater ward and trimble 2003 the proposed bfsce model improved upon the previous modular models by enabling an inference module which allows the in depth understanding of sub hydrological processes the framework of the bfsce panel a in fig 1 consists of a process based baseflow separation module a simulation module and an inference module the baseflow separation module divides the streamflow into two components baseflow and the sum of overland flow and interflow hereinafter referred to as o i flows based on groundwater level fluctuations the simulation module separately estimates the daily flow rates of baseflow and o i flows the total streamflow rates are obtained as the sum of these two flow components the inference module quantifies the relative contributions of associated model predictors to sub hydrological processes i e baseflow and o i flows 2 1 process driven baseflow separation the baseflow separation module follows the study of meshgi et al 2014 which estimates the daily baseflow volume through the fluctuation of groundwater level 1 q b t q b min ba δ h p t k 2 where qb t represents the daily baseflow volume m3 day at time t qb min is the minimum daily baseflow volume for the entire training dataset m3 day b is the coefficient related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks b 0 1ks a is the total unpaved surface area in the catchment m2 k is the lag time between rainfall events and groundwater table responses δ h p t k is the normalized daily average of pressure head m δ h p t k h t k hmin in which h t k is the daily averaged pressure head at time t k and hmin is the minimum daily averaged pressure head m observed for the entire dataset in equation 1 the first term qb min represents the minimum baseflow corresponding to the deepest groundwater table in the dry period the second term ba δ h p t k 2 approximates the additional baseflow due to the rise in the groundwater table similar to darcy s law q k a h x that relates discharge to pressure head gradient the only variable in equation 1 is the pressure head h which is correlated to the saturated flow the effectiveness of this method was firstly verified in a semi urban catchment in singapore and then was further proved successful in a cross site cross scale application in a northeastern us watershed meshgi et al 2014 once the baseflow volume is calculated through equation 1 it is then converted to the daily mean baseflow rate m3 s the overland flow rate can be calculated as the difference between the streamflow m3 s and the baseflow rate m3 s compared with other baseflow estimation methods such as the digital filter method which removes the high frequency signal from a streamflow time series in order to obtain the low frequency baseflow signal eckhardt 2005 meshgi s method includes more physically meaningful information e g hydrologic conductivity and groundwater level fluctuation to derive the baseflow meshgi et al 2014 this method can thus avoid using empirical parameters that require calibration moreover since meshgi s method does not require information about streamflow the obtained baseflow time series contains signals independent of streamflow time series these independent signals are expected to provide more information than dependent ones derived using digital filter method for hydrological inference one limitation of meshgi s method is that it requires data on groundwater fluctuation as input which may be unavailable in many pristine watersheds 2 2 sce based hydrological simulation the baseflow and o i flows are separately simulated through stepwise clustered ensemble sce li et al 2021a stepwise clustered ensemble sce is an ensemble of tree structured models and it has been used as a useful alternative to the well known random forest rf breiman 2001 in particular sce has been reported as a promising data driven approach for streamflow simulation in terms of predictive accuracy and interpretability li et al 2021a the basic concept of regression tree ensemble is that when the number of ensemble members i e sca trees increases the variation of the unstable predictions is reduced thereby increasing the predictive accuracy each sca tree grows in accordance with a random subset of predictors sampled without replacement and a bootstrapped version of the training set drawn randomly from the initial training dataset with replacement this bootstrap sampling process leaves about 1 3 of the training samples as out of bag oob samples not involved in the training process these oob samples can be used for validation the tree deduction process for each sce ensemble member follows the recursive binary splitting and merging process as illustrated in panel c of fig 1 the tree deduction process begins from the top of the tree and then iteratively splits or merges the dataset i e predictors and predictands according to a certain criterion each split is indicated via two child nodes further down the tree a merge action is followed after each split action to reduce the probabilities that the two child nodes are split due to chance thereby reducing the risk of overfitting such splitting and merging actions are repeated until no nodes can be further split or merged once a tree is built the mean value of the training observations in an undividable node can be used to estimate the predicted value for model prediction the predictors are used as a reference to determine which node to enter for identifying the corresponding predicted values in such a tree deduction process the f test is used to determine whether a node s can be split or merged the calculation process for determining the splitting and merging criteria follows li et al 2021a and huang 1992 the hydrological implications of the process of an sca tree can be explained as follows suppose two groups of streamflow records in a node are statistically different from each other the underlying streamflow generation mechanisms between the two groups could be different traditionally when precipitation exceeds the soil infiltration capacity infiltration excess overland flow occurs when rain falls on the saturated soil saturation excess overland flow occurs the criterion used for splitting such a node is then interpretable because it contains the information of the possible predictor e g daily precipitation 30 mm that distinguishes the two mechanisms the cascade sequences of the criterion throughout an sca tree help explain the flow generation from a combination of events 2 3 sce based importance rankings the sce based importance ranking is achieved through the wilks feature importance wfi method li et al 2021a feature importance is widely used in statistical models to quantify and rank the variable importance the obtained importance scores can be used to measure the contribution of each predictor in predicting the model output even though many feature importance methods have been proposed previously breiman 2001 friedman 2001 lundberg and lee 2017 they suffer from issues such as stability i e a small perturbation of training data may significantly change the relative contribution of predictors bénard et al 2021 li et al 2021a schmidt et al 2020 and fail to identify the most relevant predictors li et al 2021a since previous methods often rely on certain objective functions e g minimizing the mean squared error to estimate the importance rankings which mainly reflect the relative contribution of achieving the best model predictive accuracy due to the existence of equifinality i e different importance rankings lead to the same or similar predictive accuracy it is difficult to perform a consistent inference from the results with varying rankings another challenge of the existing feature importance methods is that they may fail to identify the most relevant predictors i e predictors with the top n highest importance scores li et al 2021a our previous experiments suggested that the most relevant predictors identified by the wfi method can be universally fitted by other ml models with the highest predictive accuracy demonstrating the robustness of the wfi method li et al 2021a the essence of the wfi method is to quantify the effectiveness of a predictor in differentiating two groups of streamflow records across an sca tree through the wilks ʌ statistics nath and pavur 1985 wilks 1967 in general a ʌ value can directly indicate the significance of the difference between two groups of data i e a smaller ʌ value indicates a larger difference a detailed definition of wilks ʌ statistics can be found in li et al 2021a and li et al 2022a in an sca tree each node s with a splitting action is associated with a ʌ value ʌ and a predictor x j the contribution of x j across the tree is calculated as 2 w f i x j s s p s 1 λ s x j where s is the total set of nodes ps is the fraction of samples in node s the estimated contributions of all predictors are then scaled to the 0 1 range in this way the more effective a predictor x j can differentiate two groups the higher relative contribution i e importance score can be expected to explain the variability of streamflow compared with other methods the wfi method quantifies the difference between two groups of data rather than the effectiveness of a predictor in improving model performance and the estimated relative contributions are expected to be less biased and could potentially lead to more robust variable rankings li et al 2021a in this study the sce follows the configuration of li et al 2021a for the optimum model performance specifically the number of ensemble members ntree was set to 200 the minimum samples to be split in a node nmin were set to 5 the percentage of predictors selected for each tree mtry was set to 0 5 i e indicating half of the predictors were selected for training each sca tree the significance level α for the f test was set to 0 05 3 study of hydrological processes in the ancient yellow river irrigation system of ningxia 3 1 overview of the ancient yellow river irrigation system in ningxia the ancient yellow river irrigation system in ningxia dates back 2000 years and still plays a crucial role in ningxia province the irrigation system is located in an arid and semi arid region with annual precipitation of less than 200 mm and annual potential evaporation of 1 100 mm gauged by e601 over 90 of water use in this region comes from the yellow river which flows through the province for about 400 km by taking advantage of the special geological feature that the river elevation is higher than the elevation of surrounding fields water has been diverted naturally from the yellow river to the crop fields through irrigation canals by gravity until 2020 it was the largest irrigation system in northwest china with an irrigated area of 552 000 ha table 1 shows the water diverted from and returned to the yellow river about half of the irrigation water diverted from the yellow river will eventually return through the irrigation return flow table 1 the study area is located at the west alluvial plain of the yellow river crisscrossed by irrigation canals and drainages fig 2 shows the detailed layout of the irrigation and drainage systems including six main irrigation canals and five main drainages the water diversion usually starts in april when the water is mainly used to recharge lakes and reservoirs as well as to sustain the local ecosystem the crop water demands begin to surge in may when the three main crops i e rice wheat and corn are at their critical growth stages and thus are most sensitive to water deficit the irrigation stops at the end of september when corn is harvested and restarts at the end of october lasting until december irrigation before winter is to freeze the topsoil to retain water content and facilitate the next growing season the soil type of the study area varies from loamy sand in the south to sandy loam in the north the saturated hydraulic conductivity varies from 20 to 50 m day in the south to 8 20 m day in the north the groundwater table depth reaches a maximum of 30 m on the west edge of the study area near mountains and is thinning towards the river plain with less than 1 m on the other hand the salinity increases from 0 5 g l to 3 g l as the aquifer thickness decreases 3 2 data collection and preprocessing the datasets used in this study include daily mean streamflow rate daily mean water diversion flow rate daily precipitation daily mean air temperature daily mean evaporation and daily mean groundwater level all daily time series span from 2003 to 2015 as shown in fig 2 all gauging stations are evenly distributed within the study area in recent years urban development has changed the regime of streamflow in some drainages for instance the drainage systems of yinchuan i e the capital city of ningxia had gone through pipeline upgrades and tributary adaptations e g merge redirect and expand a recent study li et al 2021b suggested that the surrounding farmlands of yinchuan has largely vanished due to urban expansion leading to a significant reduction in irrigation water and an increase in groundwater extraction mi et al 2020 also suggested that several water saving strategies such as irrigation canal lining and the practice of deficit irrigation have substantially changed the regime of the hydrological process in this area from the perspective of flood risk mitigation the third drainage was reinforced as floodways with connections to flood storage and lakes to improve flood control capacity therefore the above mentioned non stationarities could be a primary factor compromising the performance of data driven models detrending is an effective way to address the issue of non stationarity mann kendall trend mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 was performed to examine the trend of streamflow time series before detrending based on the types of runoff generation mechanisms the hydrological process was divided into two spring irrigation si and winter irrigation wi periods separate models were built for these two periods the si spans from april to september while wi spans from october to march fig 3 illustrates the stationarity analysis for the drainage streamflow derived from the two sided seasonal mk test which ran a separate mk trend test for each of m seasons i e si and wi in our case as shown in fig 3 the issue of non stationarity exists in the streamflow time series of second fourth and fifth drainages at the significance level of 0 05 in particular the second drainage indicates a significant monotonic decreasing trend for the si periods the fourth and fifth drainages show a significant monotonic increasing trend for the wi periods to address the issue of non stationarity the interwoven drainages with strong hydrological connections were counted as one single drainage specifically the time series for the sum of second and fourth drainage flows suggest an increased stationarity for both si and wi periods the increased stationarity is also found for the sum of third and fifth drainage flows therefore streamflow time series representing three drainage basins will be modeled as shown in fig 2 the first drainage basin includes one drainage the second drainage basin consists of the second and the fourth drainages and the third drainage basin consists of the third and the fifth drainages the summary of basin properties is provided in table 2 the combined streamflow time series for each basin are further detrended using a linear model specifically daily time series were divided into two subsets including one from 01 01 2003 to 31 12 2011 for model training and the other from 01 01 2012 to 31 12 2015 for testing the streamflow time series over the training period were then used to calculate a regression line after that the deviations from the least squares fit line were subtracted from the streamflow time series for both training and testing the generated time series were used for the modeling process the daily averaged pressure head for each drainage basin was calculated as the mean value from all the monitoring wells in the basin the lag time between the rainfall irrigation events and groundwater table responses for each basin was determined through correlation analysis as shown in table 3 this table indicates that the lag time for all the basins is less than one day i e lag 0 has the highest absolute correlation coefficient the lag time agrees with previous studies by meshgi et al 2014 who found that shallower groundwater tables had shorter lag times with rainfall events the input structure of the sce was determined in consideration of antecedent watershed conditions which are critical to streamflow predictions li et al 2022 woodhouse et al 2016 in this study the moving sum temperature precipitation and irrigation ranging up to 30 days before the date of predictions represent the antecedent watershed conditions for each of the three drainage basins such a preprocessing method hypothesizes that the different window lengths of moving sums can act as surrogates representing different dynamics of watershed conditions such as soil moisture dryness of the soil as well as the water content in the unsaturated and saturated zones the generalized expression for such an sce can be written as 3 q f p i 1 p i 3 p i 5 i j 1 i j 3 i j 5 i j 7 i 15 i 30 t k 3 t k 5 where q denotes the daily streamflow at time t p i and t denote precipitation irrigation and temperature respectively pi1 denotes the precipitation for time t at the ith rain station pi3 denotes the mean precipitation for time t 2 t 1 and t at the ith rain station the number 3 indicate the length of moving window the same denotation applies to other predictor variables i15 and i30 denote the mean daily irrigation flow rate for the past 15 and 30 days respectively subscripts i j and k denote the rain station irrigation canal and climate station index respectively table 4 lists the forcing data of bfsce selected for each of the drainage basins 3 3 connecting importance rankings with physical effects once the importance rankings are obtained using the wfi method they can be associated with the physical effect of hydrological processes in general the importance score for a predictor indicates to what extent the predictor may affect the flow simulation given the physics we know that the longer the water is retained in the soil the more likely it could reach the saturated zone on the contrary the shorter the water is retained in the soil the more likely it could evaporate or release as interflow thus the importance score can tell which soil layer saturated and unsaturated the associated predictor is more likely to contribute to suppose the importance score for i15 i e irrigation volume with a 15 day moving window is higher for o i flow simulation than baseflow it indicates that the water in unsaturated zone is more likely to reach a dynamic equilibrium state i e released water is a function of irrigation water with a 15 day irrigation window such a dynamic equilibrium state provides stronger signals to facilitate the model capture the o i flow dynamics in contrast the water released from the saturated zone is less helpful in capturing the baseflow dynamics 3 4 evaluation of the bfsce model performance before investigating the interpretability of bfsce we first evaluate model performance various performance metrics were used to provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance these metrics include the coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 these indices have been widely used in hydrological studies since they are reliable and easily interpretable tongal and booij 2018 song et al 2022 the proposed bfsce was benchmarked against sce and random forest rf breiman 2001 table 5 shows the features of bfsce model and benchmark models in the presence of baseflow separation bfsce generally outperformed sce and rf for the testing period table 6 the results suggest that the subtraction of baseflow enables data driven models to identify the critical information reflecting the overland runoff process and thus improve model performance even though in many cases the improvement is limited with the mae differences being around 0 01 notably slightly lower performances were observed for the si period compared to the wi period in the first and third drainages one reason is that the irrigation scheduling for si period is more complicated than for wi period due to flood control and optimal irrigation water allocation such complex irrigation scheduling in si period was further compounded by precipitation as a result the training data for the si period would be less representative than for the wi period leading to a weaker model than the one built for the wi period in the second drainage basin the model complexity was elevated due to non stationarity leading to lower performance in the wi period figs 4 to 6 illustrate the bfsce hydrographs for the three drainage basins in the testing period the training and validation hydrographs are shown in figures s1 to s3 the simulated streamflows generally agreed with daily runoff observations specifically the nse r2 and kge values ranged from 0 7 to 0 9 for all three basins however some peak flows were underestimated by the model one of the reasons is that the sce is a rule based nonparametric simulation approach implying that the model prediction cannot extrapolate beyond the range of the training dataset as a result the bfsce might underestimate the flow records higher than the highest values in the training dataset for instance the highest o i flow over the training period was mainly caused by the compounded effect of irrigation and precipitation in the first drainage basin the model thus considers both irrigation and precipitation e g x1 70 m3 s and x2 20 mm day x1 and x2 represent the 5 day average irrigation flow rate and precipitation respectively to classify the flow as the highest one however the o i flow of a similar magnitude was outside the intensive irrigation season with x1 30 m3 s and was mainly caused by a rare precipitation event with x2 40 mm day in the testing period in such case even though the precipitation rate is the highest among the historical records the model may not consider the resulting flow rate as high as the highest record over the training period such an underestimation is also occurred for the baseflow simulation suggesting that rare and unseen events including the compounded ones could be a challenge to such models in terms of predictive accuracy the second drainage basin however experienced a non stationary change during the testing period leading to increased groundwater levels fig 7 the non stationarity was primarily due to more irrigation water being infiltrated into the unsaturated zone rather than turning into streamflow since the model was built based on the training dataset it led to an overestimation of streamflow 3 5 hydrological inference for sub hydrological processes the importance scores of predictors used for simulating the two sub hydrological processes i e baseflow and the o i flows were investigated as shown in fig 8 si and fig 9 wi in general the importance scores for the two sub hydrological processes showed significant differences for the si period in the first drainage basin the predictors associated with 7 day and 5 day averaged irrigation water of c2 canal were ranked as the highest two predictors for simulating the o i flows in comparison these two predictors were considered non critical for baseflow simulation instead the 30 day averaged irrigation water i30 was considered the most important predictor for baseflow simulation on the contrary o i flows had a more acute response to rainfall and irrigation this is can also be demonstrated by the fact that precipitation related predictors e g r1 3 r1 5 r2 3 and r6 5 achieved higher importance scores for o i flow simulation than the baseflow one the predictors tw15 and tw25 were evidenced as the second most important predictor for the baseflow simulation of the si period in the first and second drainage basins respectively this was because the intensive evaporation coupled with a shallow groundwater table and high permeable soil enabled water in the saturated zone to transport quickly to the unsaturated zone due to the capillary action and thus affected baseflow the results also show that importance score for the si period is higher than the wi the median values of importance scores for simulating overland and interflows in si periods were 3 6 2 6 and 3 1 for the first second and third drainage basins respectively whilst the values in wi were 3 2 1 7 and 1 7 respectively this was because the irrigation practices in the si period were often compounded with rainfall and intensive evapotranspiration which increased the system complexity in addition we found that i30 achieved higher importance rankings for simulating o i flows in the si period than the wi such a difference could be caused by a high daily irrigation flow rate for the wi period allowing more water discharged from interflow rather than baseflow owing to the retention effect of the porous soil i30 always achieved the highest importance score for the baseflow simulation 3 6 tracing the origin of streamflow fig 10 shows that the importance scores representing different stations canals were aggregated i e summed which allowed a direct comparison among three basins the red bars indicate the importance scores from streamflow simulation while the blue and black bars represent those from o i flow and baseflow simulation respectively the results showed that compared with hydrological inference from the entire streamflow process the inference from sub processes provided more physics based insights into the role a predictor plays in streamflow generation for example weekly 7 day averaged irrigation water was considered the most important predictor of streamflow simulation during the si period of the first drainage basin this was mainly due to the substantial contribution of o i flows i e the highest blue bar monthly 30 day averaged irrigation was ranked as the second highest important predictor of streamflow simulation such a model decision was associated with the substantial baseflow contribution i e the highest black bar the above inference suggested that weekly averaged irrigation water mainly facilitated the model to capture the dynamics of o i flows while monthly averaged irrigation water facilitated the model to capture the groundwater dynamics this was because the unsaturated zone reached a dynamic equilibrium state with weekly irrigation leading to a constant water release that facilitated the model to capture the dynamics of o i flows since the unsaturated zone was not uniform due to the variations in landscape irrigation and climatic factors the dynamic equilibrium state also varied correspondingly consequently irrigation with different window lengths suggested varying importance scores in capturing the dynamics of o i flows in the third drainage basin the 5 day averaged precipitation was responsible for capturing the dynamics of o i flows while monthly irrigation water facilitated the model to capture the groundwater dynamics these findings agreed with our field investigation that the third drainage in recent years had been reinforced as floodways connected to flood storage and lakes to embrace the floods from the mountains on the west fig 2 even though the monthly averaged irrigation showed significant importance for baseflow simulation during the wi period it did not contribute much to streamflow simulation meanwhile 3 day 7 day and 15 day averaged irrigation had the highest contributions to o i flows and streamflow simulation for the first second and third drainages respectively these results suggested that o i flows were the dominant flow components during the wi period while baseflow had a minimal contribution to streamflow these results agreed with our investigation of winter irrigation schedules the high volume of irrigation water flushes over the irrigation field bare ground in a short period to freeze the topsoil therefore the irrigation water quickly percolates into the saturated zone without being uptook by crops thereby leading to substantial o i flows 4 discussions 4 1 does the importance score lead to physically consistent results traditionally importance scores mainly reflect the relative contribution of predictors to model predictive accuracy rather than physically influence the model predictand e g volume of streamflow molnar 2020 rajbahadur et al 2021 a frequently asked question in statistical based hydrological inference is whether the importance scores can lead to physically consistent results in this study even though the physical knowledge suggested that the obtained inferences were reasonable we still need more rigorous evidence to test whether the relative importance of predictors achieved from bfsce also reflects their relative significance on the changes of streamflow to this end a multilevel factorial analysis mfa was performed as follows 1 reprocess the testing dataset of si period by multiplying its irrigation and precipitation associated time series by vectors of 1 1 0 9 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 9 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 9 0 9 0 9 1 0 and 0 9 1 1 separately 2 train 10 sets of bfsce and sce models for the si period of the training dataset with different random seeds 3 feed each of the trained models with the reprocessed testing datasets 4 calculate the mean daily streamflow baseflow and o i flow volumes m3 based on the results obtained from each model 5 use flow volumes as response variables to calculate the main effects of individual factors i e irrigation and precipitation their interactions and model error 6 the contribution of each factor can be calculated using its sum of squares divided by the total sum of squares montgomery 2017 fig 11 presents the main effects of irrigation and precipitation on streamflow o i flow and baseflow with detailed information shown in tables s1 to s3 the results suggested that precipitation for the first drainage in the red box of fig 11 had little contribution to the streamflow volume during the si period in addition precipitation contributed little to baseflow volume for all three basins shown in the blue box the differences between the relative contributions importance score obtained from wfi hereinafter shown as rc wfi and those obtained from mfa hereinafter shown as rc mfa are shown in fig 12 the rc wfi of irrigation or precipitation for simulating streamflow or its sub processes was calculated as the mean value of the three highest importance scores as indicated in fig 10 associated with the corresponding factor rc wfi reflects the relative contribution of precipitation and irrigation in describing the flow dynamics i e model performance while rc mfa reflects the sensitivity of flow volume change m3 in response to precipitation and irrigation the hypothesis is that if a predictor is more important in the modeling process it will be more influential to the changes on streamflow or its sub processes fig 12 showed that the rc wfi the top panel agreed with the rc mfa the bottom panel precipitation accounted for the highest rc mfa to streamflow generation in the third drainage basin and it also had the highest rc wfi in the modeling process the results suggested that compared with the first and second drainage basins precipitation in the third drainage basin showed higher importance in both flow simulation from the model performance perspective and formulation from the physics perspective this is because the streamflow in the third basin contains flash floods from the mountains shown in fig 2 during the rainy season making precipitation a dominant factor influencing the streamflow compared with the second and the third drainage basins precipitation in the first drainage basin achieved the lowest rc mfa to streamflow generation corresponding to the lowest rc wfi among the three basins this is because the unit area irrigation volume in the first drainage basin is the highest among all three basins leading to lower importance in precipitation precipitation showed higher rc mfa for the o i flow generation and the same pattern could also be achieved from the results of rc wfi this is because precipitation had a higher rate mm hour than irrigation in general and was more likely to generate infiltration excess flow contributing to the o i flows on the contrary irrigation water was more likely to percolate and become interflows and baseflows leading to a lower contribution to o i flow generation these findings proved our hypothesis and suggested that model inference from sce could explain the hydrological process using the knowledge from process based models it should be noted that precipitation in the first drainage basin barely influenced the flow volume nevertheless its contribution still accounted for 7 6 over half of the contribution for irrigation in the modeling process the results indicated that precipitation might not significantly change flow volume but influence other the flow characteristics such as timing of flow peaks 4 2 what role does relative importance of driving forces play in understanding hydrological processes one may wonder what role relative importance of driving forces plays in gaining insights into hydrological processes which was associated with process based models even though the process based hydrological models have been studied for more than a century mulvany 1850 hydrological processes under some complicated conditions such as in coastal basins where the hydrological processes are influenced by tide and current fluxes armenio et al 2017 bevacqua et al 2017 as well as watersheds with intensive human activities dewandel et al 2008 gosain et al 2005 are still less studied and need additional knowledge to gain a thorough understanding even for the most commonly studied watersheds a process based model may not consider every aspect of its driving forces such as large scale climatic indices e g el niño li et al 2021a in bfsce complex relationships between streamflow or its sub components and its driving forces can be examined without an assumption of any linear or non linear functions with the provision of the state of the art dataset e g soil moisture data o neill et al 2019 surface mass change data for the estimation of groundwater change landerer and swenson 2012 vegetation growth data myneni et al 2015 and snowmelt data hersbach et al 2018 the resulting relative contribution thus carries the critical information that may be neglected by a process based model such information can help us gain a more in depth understanding of hydrological sub processes in terms of the irrigated watersheds it is difficult for a conventional data driven model to achieve a robust quantification of how irrigation and precipitation influence the sub hydrological processes the cutting edge feature importance method in the bfsce model suggested that the hydrological inferences were valid for both the entire hydrological process and its sub processes the modular models specialized for sub hydrological processes can help identify the dominant factor in the saturated and unsaturated zones such an understanding can further help decision makers implement the best management practices for mitigating the risks of flooding and salinization 4 3 challenges and opportunities the proposed bfsce model has some limitations since it cannot extrapolate beyond the historical observations it may face difficulties in evaluating the impact of changing climate or other non stationary dynamics in this study the non stationary dynamics in the second drainage basins led to a significant overestimation of baseflow a possible way to improve the simulation is to extend the coverage of training data such approaches include but are not limited to using process based models as an emulator of the real system to generate synthetic data in parts of the problem space where actual data is sparse or unavailable razavi 2021 and training one model with big data covering hundreds of basins with the assumption that data from one basin can inform inference in other basins kratzert et al 2019b the selection of predictors is another challenge to the proposed bfsce model in this study we used irrigation and precipitation of various moving windows as surrogates to the basin antecedent conditions the length of these moving windows was designed in accordance with the basin characteristics nevertheless it is challenging to fully characterize the basin conditions therefore this is of particular importance to know that the robustness of the proposed bfsce is expected to improve with additional sources of data such as soil moisture and snowmelt as well as more data samples the baseflow simulation module embedded in bfsce uses constant coefficients which may face difficulties addressing uncertainties in complex hydrological systems balogun et al 2020 yang et al 2020 for the proposed bfsce model empirical equations proposed by meshgi et al 2014 were used to estimate the baseflow however previous studies suggested that the coefficients in the empirical equations optimized globally to work across many watersheds might not be optimal for any specific watershed future studies should take into account the uncertainties of process based modules such that more physically reliable results can be expected 5 conclusions this study proposed a bfsce for improving the capacity of hydrological inference with the aid of a process based baseflow separation method it is the first attempt to incorporate a feature importance method and a process based baseflow separation method for quantifying the relative contributions of associated model predictors to sub hydrological processes i e baseflow and o i flows the results revealed that the predictors associated with air temperature and long term i e monthly irrigation mainly characterized baseflow dynamics while precipitation and short term i e weekly or semi weekly irrigation mainly captured overland flow and interflow dynamics such information could help determine whether the watershed is precipitation or irrigation dominated such a better understanding could further facilitate the conjunctive operation of surface water and groundwater resources thereby reducing the risks of flooding and salinization the fidelity of hydrological inference through the feature importance method was further demonstrated through mfa the results revealed that the relative importance of predictors reflected their significance on model performance and their influence on explaining the changes of streamflow in general the higher importance of a predictor the more changes on streamflow can be explained by this predictor the proposed bfsce model is a step closer to understanding sub hydrological processes through data driven models as physics informed data driven models continue to develop in the future the improved hydrological inference through data driven

2897,data driven hydrological modeling has seen rapid development in recent years owing to its flexibility to approximate the complex relationships between driving forces and hydrological fluxes however traditional data driven models typically cannot simultaneously capture the processes that pose both chronic and acute impacts on streamflow thus impeding further inference therefore this study presents a baseflow filtered hydrological inference model to gain insights into hydrological processes in irrigated watersheds the proposed model starts with separating the streamflow process into two sub processes using a process based baseflow separation method each sub process is simulated through a new interpretable data driven model the resulting hydrological inferences facilitate the identification of the dominant factors influencing flows in saturated and unsaturated zones the proposed model is applied to three irrigated watersheds and the evaluation metrics show that the proposed model outperforms two conventional data driven models our findings reveal that predictors associated with air temperature and long term i e monthly irrigation are mainly responsible for characterizing baseflow dynamics while precipitation and short term i e semi weekly or weekly irrigation are primarily responsible for describing overland flow and interflow dynamics the fidelity of the derived hydrological inference is further demonstrated through sensitivity analysis the results show that the relative importance of predictors not only reflects their significance on model performance but also influence the changes on streamflow keywords data driven model hydrological inference importance ranking baseflow separation irrigated watershed data availability data will be

altered the hydrological processes and threatened the ecosystems in many regions worldwide clement et al 2009 dewandel et al 2008 dong et al 2015 gosain et al 2005 in particular flood irrigation is a prevailing irrigation method that has been widely used in many countries das bhowmik et al 2020 mottaleb et al 2019 on one hand such an irrigation method intensifies the rainfall runoff process by increasing surface runoff thereby raising the risk of flooding gu et al 2019 on the other hand it increases groundwater levels and causes salinization kong et al 2021 waleeittikul et al 2019 to help mitigate these negative impacts and to develop sound irrigation plans it is necessary to examine the contribution of relevant driving forces e g precipitation and irrigation to surface and subsurface flows hydrological processes in irrigated watersheds are more complex than those in pristine watersheds due to crop evapotranspiration vishwakarma et al 2022 and irrigation schemes li et al 2022a which should consider both flood control and optimal allocation of often insufficient irrigation water available spatially and temporally li et al 2019 razavi et al 2020 such complexities lead to a significant challenge in quantifying the relative contributions of irrigation and precipitation to the rainfall runoff processes extensive efforts have been made in the past decades to quantify associated driving forces such as the use of isotope based methods kong et al 2021 lee et al 2021 lv et al 2018 correlation based methods młyński et al 2021 qing et al 2022 you and wang 2021 sensitivity based methods kumar et al 2022 and process based simulation models ditthakit et al 2021 liu et al 2020 ramireddygari et al 2000 traylor and zlotnik 2016 zeng and cai 2014 although previous approaches advanced our understanding of the underlying hydrological mechanisms in irrigated watersheds they required tremendous time to acquire and process the data lee et al 2021 liu et al 2020 for instance the limited accessibility of high resolution spatially distributed irrigated water may hinder the application of process based simulation models moreover irrigated watersheds are often characterized by a flat terrain which is particularly difficult to delineate an appropriate watershed domain for running distributed hydrological models rahman et al 2010 as an alternative to the above mentioned approaches data driven models such as neural networks yang et al 2021 asce task committee 2000 baek et al 2020 chen et al 2014 hsu et al 1995 kratzert et al 2019a genetic programming babovic and keijzer 2002 chadalawada et al 2020 meshgi et al 2015 and regression tree ensemble rte galelli and castelletti 2013 li et al 2021a schnier and cai 2014 zhang et al 2019 have received increasing attention in recent years especially in the quantification of the contributions of driving forces for instance kratzert et al 2019b investigated the relative contributions of climatic and non climatic factors to runoff generation through long short term memory networks konapala and mishra 2020 examined 60 variables through a random forest model breiman 2001 to understand their relative contributions to hydrological drought development schmidt et al 2020 explored the relative contribution of multiple driving forces to flood events in germany through three data driven models although previous studies have effectively quantified the relationship between model inputs and outputs it is still unclear whether the relative contributions of driving forces are physically consistent physically consistent means that the obtained relative contributions not only reflect the importance of predictors influencing the goodness of fit of a model but also influence the changes on streamflow razavi 2021 in recent years the need for physically consistency of data driven models has led to research efforts on hybridizing process based and data driven approaches in hydrological sciences and beyond refer to razavi et al 2022 for a review and perspective of such hybridization efforts there are various ways of incorporating hydrological knowledge into data driven models chadalawada et al 2020 herath et al 2021 karpatne et al 2018 nearing et al 2021 singh et al 2017 for instance daw et al 2017 used physics based loss functions to guide the learning of neural networks liang et al 2019 and lu et al 2021 incorporated the outputs from a process based model into data driven models to improve predictive skills however since the above mentioned approaches did not take into account the physical processes of hydrology the interpretability is still limited in recent years attempts have been made to incorporate data driven models into the structure of process driven models bhasme et al 2021 khandelwal et al 2020 one of the successful attempts is to use data driven models to emulate sub hydrological processes e g overland flow and baseflow generated from a process based model meshgi et al 2015 tongal and booij 2018 such a method allows the simulation from a data driven model to be explained under the paradigm of a two layer hydrological model structure badrzadeh et al 2016 corzo and solomatine 2007 tongal and booij 2018 wu et al 2009 the rationale behind this method is that the underlying mechanisms of streamflow dynamics are more likely to lead to distinct behaviors in terms of flow magnitudes and seasonal characteristics dralle et al 2016 newman et al 2015 specifically the baseflow mainly contributes to low flow events whereas intense storms give rise to high flow events a single global data driven model could hardly capture both high and low runoff dynamics wu et al 2009 consequently modular models i e building separate models for several sub hydrological processes are desired for hydrological simulation and inference solomatine and ostfeld 2008 nevertheless most of the existing data driven models with modular model considerations mainly focus on improving predictive accuracy tongal and booij 2018 or quantifying the contribution of different land uses meshgi et al 2015 the relative contribution of relevant driving forces to surface and sub surface flow generations has not yet been studied this requires a formal sensitivity analysis to peer inside data driven models to understand their internals and improve the interpretability of their results see section 3 4 of razavi et al 2021 for a discussion in irrigated watersheds quantifying such contribution could be particularly useful in facilitating the conjunctive operation of surface water and groundwater resources thereby reducing the risks of flooding and salinization in light of the above considerations the objective of this study is to develop a baseflow filtered stepwise clustered ensemble bfsce to improve the quantification of the relative contribution of associated driving forces e g precipitation and irrigation to sub hydrological processes i e surface and subsurface flows this study entails i analyzing sub hydrological processes including surface and subsurface flows of three irrigated watersheds in the upper

into runoff generation mechanisms based on the results derived from wfi and mfa 2 development of the baseflow filtered stepwise clustered ensemble in this study the baseflow in this study is defined as the groundwater contribution to streamflow which can be affected by many factors such as changes in watershed characteristics soil land use and climate price 2011 the overland flow is defined as water flowing over the land surface excluding streams and rivers the interflow is defined as the lateral movement of water in the unsaturated zone or vadose zone which first returns to the surface or enters a stream before becoming groundwater ward and trimble 2003 the proposed bfsce model improved upon the previous modular models by enabling an inference module which allows the in depth understanding of sub hydrological processes the framework of the bfsce panel a in fig 1 consists of a process based baseflow separation module a simulation module and an inference module the baseflow separation module divides the streamflow into two components baseflow and the sum of overland flow and interflow hereinafter referred to as o i flows based on groundwater level fluctuations the simulation module separately estimates the daily flow rates of baseflow and o i flows the total streamflow rates are obtained as the sum of these two flow components the inference module quantifies the relative contributions of associated model predictors to sub hydrological processes i e baseflow and o i flows 2 1 process driven baseflow separation the baseflow separation module follows the study of meshgi et al 2014 which estimates the daily baseflow volume through the fluctuation of groundwater level 1 q b t q b min ba δ h p t k 2 where qb t represents the daily baseflow volume m3 day at time t qb min is the minimum daily baseflow volume for the entire training dataset m3 day b is the coefficient related to the saturated hydraulic conductivity ks b 0 1ks a is the total unpaved

baseflow corresponding to the deepest groundwater table in the dry period the second term ba δ h p t k 2 approximates the additional baseflow due to the rise in the groundwater table similar to darcy s law q k a h x that relates discharge to pressure head gradient the only variable in equation 1 is the pressure head h which is correlated to the saturated flow the effectiveness of this method was firstly verified in a semi urban catchment in singapore and then was further proved successful in a cross site cross scale application in a northeastern us watershed meshgi et al 2014 once the baseflow volume is calculated through equation 1 it is then converted to the daily mean baseflow rate m3 s the overland flow rate can be calculated as the difference between the streamflow m3 s and the baseflow rate m3 s compared with other baseflow estimation methods such as the digital filter method which removes the high frequency signal from a streamflow time series in order to obtain the low frequency baseflow signal eckhardt 2005 meshgi s method includes more physically meaningful information e g hydrologic conductivity and groundwater level fluctuation to derive the baseflow meshgi et al 2014 this method can thus avoid using empirical parameters that require calibration moreover since meshgi s method does not require information about streamflow the obtained baseflow time series contains signals independent of streamflow time series these independent signals are expected to provide more information than dependent ones derived using digital filter method for hydrological inference one limitation of meshgi s method is that it requires data on groundwater fluctuation as input which may be unavailable in many pristine watersheds 2 2 sce based hydrological simulation the baseflow and o i flows are separately simulated through stepwise clustered ensemble sce li et al 2021a stepwise clustered ensemble sce is an ensemble of tree structured models and it has been used as a useful alternative to the well known random forest rf breiman 2001 in particular sce has been reported as a promising data driven approach for streamflow simulation in terms of predictive accuracy and interpretability li et al 2021a the basic concept of regression tree ensemble is that when the number of ensemble members i e sca trees increases the variation of the unstable predictions is reduced thereby increasing the predictive accuracy each sca tree grows in accordance with a random subset of predictors sampled without replacement and a bootstrapped version of the training set drawn randomly from the initial training dataset with replacement this bootstrap sampling process leaves about 1 3 of the training samples as out of bag oob samples not involved in the training process these oob samples can be used for validation the tree deduction process for each sce ensemble member follows the recursive binary splitting and merging process as illustrated in panel c of fig 1 the tree deduction process begins from the top of the tree and then iteratively splits or merges the dataset i e predictors and predictands according to a certain criterion each split is indicated via two child nodes further down the tree a merge action is followed after each split action to reduce the probabilities that the two child nodes are split due to chance thereby reducing the risk of overfitting such splitting and merging actions are repeated until no nodes can be further split or merged once a tree is built the mean value of the training observations in an undividable node can be used to estimate the predicted value for model prediction the predictors are used as a reference to determine which node to enter for identifying the corresponding predicted values in such a tree deduction process the f test is used to determine whether a node s can be split or merged the calculation process for determining the splitting and merging criteria follows li et al 2021a and huang 1992 the hydrological implications of the process of an sca tree can be explained as follows suppose two groups of streamflow records in a node are statistically different from each other the underlying streamflow generation mechanisms between the two groups could be different traditionally when precipitation exceeds the soil infiltration capacity infiltration excess overland flow occurs when rain falls on the saturated soil saturation excess overland flow occurs the criterion used for splitting such a node is then interpretable because it contains the information of the possible predictor e g daily precipitation 30 mm that distinguishes the two mechanisms the cascade sequences of the criterion throughout an sca tree help explain the flow generation from a combination of events 2 3 sce based importance rankings the sce based importance ranking is achieved through the wilks feature importance wfi method li et al 2021a feature importance is widely used in statistical models to quantify and rank the variable importance the obtained importance scores can be used to measure the contribution of each predictor in predicting the model output even though many feature importance methods have been proposed previously breiman 2001 friedman 2001 lundberg and lee 2017 they suffer from issues such as stability i e a small perturbation of training data may significantly change the relative contribution of predictors bénard et al 2021 li et al 2021a schmidt et al 2020 and fail to identify the most relevant predictors li et al 2021a since previous methods often rely on certain objective functions e g minimizing the mean squared error to estimate the importance rankings which mainly reflect the relative contribution of achieving the best model predictive accuracy due to the existence of equifinality i e different importance rankings lead to the same or similar predictive accuracy it is difficult to perform a consistent inference from the results with varying rankings another challenge of the existing feature importance methods is that they may fail to identify the most relevant predictors i e predictors with the top n highest importance scores li et al 2021a our previous experiments suggested that the most relevant predictors identified by the wfi method can be universally fitted by other ml models with the highest predictive accuracy demonstrating the robustness of the wfi method li et al 2021a the essence of the wfi method is to quantify the effectiveness of a predictor in differentiating two groups of streamflow records across an sca tree through the wilks ʌ statistics nath and pavur 1985 wilks 1967 in general a ʌ value can directly indicate the significance of the difference between two groups of data i e a smaller ʌ value indicates a larger difference a detailed definition of wilks ʌ statistics can be found in li et al 2021a and li et al 2022a in an sca tree each node s with a splitting action is associated with a ʌ value ʌ and a predictor x j the contribution of x j across the tree is calculated as 2 w f i x j s s p s 1 λ s x j where s is the total set of nodes ps is the fraction of samples in node s the estimated contributions of all predictors are then scaled to the 0 1 range in this way the more effective a predictor x j can differentiate two groups the higher relative contribution i e importance score can be expected to explain the variability of streamflow compared with other methods the wfi method quantifies the difference between two groups of data rather than the effectiveness of a predictor in improving model performance and the estimated relative contributions are expected to be less biased and could potentially lead to more robust variable rankings li et al 2021a in this study the sce follows the configuration of li et al 2021a for the optimum model performance specifically the number of ensemble members ntree was set to 200 the minimum samples to be split in a node nmin were set to 5 the percentage of predictors selected for each tree mtry was set to 0 5 i e indicating half of the predictors were selected for training each sca tree the significance level α for the f test was set to 0 05 3 study of hydrological processes in the ancient yellow river irrigation system of ningxia 3 1 overview of the ancient yellow river irrigation system in ningxia the ancient yellow river irrigation system in ningxia dates back 2000 years and still plays a crucial role in ningxia province the irrigation system is located in an arid and semi arid region with annual precipitation of less than 200 mm and annual potential evaporation of 1 100 mm gauged by e601 over 90 of water use in this region comes from the yellow river which flows through the province for about 400 km by taking advantage of the special geological feature that the river elevation is higher than the elevation of surrounding fields water has been diverted naturally from the yellow river to the crop fields through irrigation canals by gravity until 2020 it was the largest irrigation system in northwest china with an irrigated area of 552 000 ha table 1 shows the water diverted from and returned to the yellow river about half of the irrigation water diverted from the yellow river will eventually return through the irrigation return flow table 1 the study area is located at the west alluvial plain of the yellow river crisscrossed by irrigation canals and drainages fig 2 shows the detailed layout of the irrigation and drainage systems including six main irrigation canals and five main drainages the water diversion usually starts in april when the water is mainly used to recharge lakes and reservoirs as well as to sustain the local ecosystem the crop water demands begin to surge in may when the three main crops i e rice wheat and corn are at their critical growth stages and thus are most sensitive to water deficit the irrigation stops at the end of september when corn is harvested and restarts at the end of october lasting until december irrigation before winter is to freeze the topsoil to retain water content and facilitate the next growing season the soil type of the study area varies from loamy sand in the south to sandy loam in the north the saturated hydraulic conductivity varies from 20 to 50 m day in the south to 8 20 m day in the north the groundwater table depth reaches a maximum of 30 m on the west edge of the study area near mountains and is thinning towards the river plain with less than 1 m on the other hand the salinity increases from 0 5 g l to 3 g l as the aquifer thickness decreases 3 2 data collection and preprocessing the datasets used in this study include daily mean streamflow rate daily mean water diversion flow rate daily precipitation daily mean air temperature daily mean evaporation and daily mean groundwater level all daily time series span from 2003 to 2015 as shown in fig 2 all gauging stations are evenly distributed within the study area in recent years urban development has changed the regime of streamflow in some drainages for instance the drainage systems of yinchuan i e the capital city of ningxia had gone through pipeline upgrades and tributary adaptations e g merge redirect and expand a recent study li et al 2021b suggested that the surrounding farmlands of yinchuan has largely vanished due to urban expansion leading to a significant reduction in irrigation water and an increase in groundwater extraction mi et al 2020 also suggested that several water saving strategies such as irrigation canal lining and the practice of deficit irrigation have substantially changed the regime of the hydrological process in this area from the perspective of flood risk mitigation the third drainage was reinforced as floodways with connections to flood storage and lakes to improve flood control capacity therefore the above mentioned non stationarities could be a primary factor compromising the performance of data driven models detrending is an effective way to address the issue of non stationarity mann kendall trend mk test kendall 1948 mann 1945 was performed to examine the trend of streamflow time series before detrending based on the types of runoff generation mechanisms the hydrological process was divided into two spring irrigation si and winter irrigation wi periods separate models were built for these two periods the si spans from april to september while wi spans from october to march fig 3 illustrates the stationarity analysis for the drainage streamflow derived from the two sided seasonal mk test which ran a separate mk trend test for each of m seasons i e si and wi in our case as shown in fig 3 the issue of non stationarity exists in the streamflow time series of second fourth and fifth drainages at the significance level of 0 05 in particular the second drainage indicates a significant monotonic decreasing trend for the si periods the fourth and fifth drainages show a significant monotonic increasing trend for the wi periods to address the issue of non stationarity the interwoven drainages with strong hydrological connections were counted as one single drainage specifically the time series for the sum of second and fourth drainage flows suggest an increased stationarity for both si and wi periods the increased stationarity is also found for the sum of third and fifth drainage flows therefore streamflow time series representing three drainage basins will be modeled as shown in fig 2 the first drainage basin includes one drainage the second drainage basin consists of the second and the fourth drainages and the third drainage basin consists of the third and the fifth drainages the summary of basin properties is provided in table 2 the combined streamflow time series for each basin are further detrended using a linear model specifically daily time series were divided into two subsets including one from 01 01 2003 to 31 12 2011 for model training and the other from 01 01 2012 to 31 12 2015 for testing the streamflow time series over the training period were then used to calculate a regression line after that the deviations from the least squares fit line were subtracted from the streamflow time series for both training and testing the generated time series were used for the modeling process the daily averaged pressure head for each drainage basin was calculated as the mean value from all the monitoring wells in the basin the lag time between the rainfall irrigation events and groundwater table responses for each basin was determined through correlation analysis as shown in table 3 this table indicates that the lag time for all the basins is less than one day i e lag 0 has the highest absolute correlation coefficient the lag time agrees with previous studies by meshgi et al 2014 who found that shallower groundwater tables had shorter lag times with rainfall events the input structure of the sce was determined in consideration of antecedent watershed conditions which are critical to streamflow predictions li et al 2022 woodhouse et al 2016 in this study the moving sum temperature precipitation and irrigation ranging up to 30 days before the date of predictions represent the antecedent watershed conditions for each of the three drainage basins such a preprocessing method hypothesizes that the different window lengths of moving sums can act as surrogates representing different dynamics of watershed conditions such as soil moisture dryness of the soil as well as the water content in the unsaturated and saturated zones the generalized expression for such an sce can be written as 3 q f p i 1 p i 3 p i 5 i j 1 i j 3 i j 5 i j 7 i 15 i 30 t k 3 t k 5 where q denotes the daily streamflow at time t p i and t denote precipitation irrigation and temperature respectively pi1 denotes the precipitation for time t at the ith rain station pi3 denotes the mean precipitation for time t 2 t 1 and t at the ith rain station the number 3 indicate the length of moving window the same denotation applies to other predictor variables i15 and i30 denote the mean daily irrigation flow rate for the past 15 and 30 days respectively subscripts i j and k denote the rain station irrigation canal and climate station index respectively table 4 lists the forcing data of bfsce selected for each of the drainage basins 3 3 connecting importance rankings with physical effects once the importance rankings are obtained using the wfi method they can be associated with the physical effect of hydrological processes in general the importance score for a predictor indicates to what extent the predictor may affect the flow simulation given the physics we know that the longer the water is retained in the soil the more likely it could reach the saturated zone on the contrary the shorter the water is retained in the soil the more likely it could evaporate or release as interflow thus the importance score can tell which soil layer saturated and unsaturated the associated predictor is more likely to contribute to suppose the importance score for i15 i e irrigation volume with a 15 day moving window is higher for o i flow simulation than baseflow it indicates that the water in unsaturated zone is more likely to reach a dynamic equilibrium state i e released water is a function of irrigation water with a 15 day irrigation window such a dynamic equilibrium state provides stronger signals to facilitate the model capture the o i flow dynamics in contrast the water released from the saturated zone is less helpful in capturing the baseflow dynamics 3 4 evaluation of the bfsce model performance before investigating the interpretability of bfsce we first evaluate model performance various performance metrics were used to provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance these metrics include the coefficient of determination r2 mean absolute error mae root mean squared error rmse kling gupta efficiency kge gupta et al 2009 nash sutcliffe efficiency nse nash and sutcliffe 1970 and volumetric efficiency ve criss and winston 2008 these indices have been widely used in hydrological studies since they are reliable and easily interpretable tongal and booij 2018 song et al 2022 the proposed bfsce was benchmarked against sce and random forest rf breiman 2001 table 5 shows the features of bfsce model and benchmark models in the presence of baseflow separation bfsce generally outperformed sce and rf for the testing period table 6 the results suggest that the subtraction of baseflow enables data driven models to identify the critical information reflecting the overland runoff process and thus improve model performance even though in many cases the improvement is limited with the mae differences being around 0 01 notably slightly lower performances were observed for the si period compared to the wi period in the first and third drainages one reason is that the irrigation scheduling for si period is more complicated than for wi period due to flood control and optimal irrigation water allocation such complex irrigation scheduling in si period was further compounded by precipitation as a result the training data for the si period would be less representative than for the wi period leading to a weaker model than the one built for the wi period in the second drainage basin the model complexity was elevated due to non stationarity leading to lower performance in the wi period figs 4 to 6 illustrate the bfsce hydrographs for the three drainage basins in the testing period the training and validation hydrographs are shown in figures s1 to s3 the simulated streamflows generally agreed with daily runoff observations specifically the nse r2 and kge values ranged from 0 7 to 0 9 for all three basins however some peak flows were underestimated by the model one of the reasons is that the sce is a rule based nonparametric simulation approach implying that the model prediction cannot extrapolate beyond the range of the training dataset as a result the bfsce might underestimate the flow records higher than the highest values in the training dataset for instance the highest o i flow over the training period was mainly caused by the compounded effect of irrigation and precipitation in the first drainage basin the model thus considers both irrigation and precipitation e g x1 70 m3 s and x2 20 mm day x1 and x2 represent the 5 day average irrigation flow rate and precipitation respectively to classify the flow as the highest one however the o i flow of a similar magnitude was outside the intensive irrigation season with x1 30 m3 s and was mainly caused by a rare precipitation event with x2 40 mm day in the testing period in such case even though the precipitation rate is the highest among the historical records the model may not consider the resulting flow rate as high as the highest record over the training period such an underestimation is also occurred for the baseflow simulation suggesting that rare and unseen events including the compounded ones could be a challenge to such models in terms of predictive accuracy the second drainage basin however experienced a non stationary change during the testing period leading to increased groundwater levels fig 7 the non stationarity was primarily due to more irrigation water being infiltrated into the unsaturated zone rather than turning into streamflow since the model was built based on the training dataset it led to an overestimation of streamflow 3 5 hydrological inference for sub hydrological processes the importance scores of predictors used for simulating the two sub hydrological processes i e baseflow and the o i flows were investigated as shown in fig 8 si and fig 9 wi in general the importance scores for the two sub hydrological processes showed significant differences for the si period in the first drainage basin the predictors associated with 7 day and 5 day averaged irrigation water of c2 canal were ranked as the highest two predictors for simulating the o i flows in comparison these two predictors were considered non critical for baseflow simulation instead the 30 day averaged irrigation water i30 was considered the most important predictor for baseflow simulation on the contrary o i flows had a more acute response to rainfall and irrigation this is can also be demonstrated by the fact that precipitation related predictors e g r1 3 r1 5 r2 3 and r6 5 achieved higher importance scores for o i flow simulation than the baseflow one the predictors tw15 and tw25 were evidenced as the second most important predictor for the baseflow simulation of the si period in the first and second drainage basins respectively this was because the intensive evaporation coupled with a shallow groundwater table and high permeable soil enabled water in the saturated zone to transport quickly to the unsaturated zone due to the capillary action and thus affected baseflow the results also show that importance score for the si period is higher than the wi the median values of importance scores for simulating overland and interflows in si periods were 3 6 2 6 and 3 1 for the first second and third drainage basins respectively whilst the values in wi were 3 2 1 7 and 1 7 respectively this was because the irrigation practices in the si period were often compounded with rainfall and intensive evapotranspiration which increased the system complexity in addition we found that i30 achieved higher importance rankings for simulating o i flows in the si period than the wi such a difference could be caused by a high daily irrigation flow rate for the wi period allowing more water discharged from interflow rather than baseflow owing to the retention effect of the porous soil i30 always achieved the highest importance score for the baseflow simulation 3 6 tracing the origin of streamflow fig 10 shows that the importance scores representing different stations canals were aggregated i e summed which allowed a direct comparison among three basins the red bars indicate the importance scores from streamflow simulation while the blue and black bars represent those from o i flow and baseflow simulation respectively the results showed that compared with hydrological inference from the entire streamflow process the inference from sub processes provided more physics based insights into the role a predictor plays in streamflow generation for example weekly 7 day averaged irrigation water was considered the most important predictor of streamflow simulation during the si period of the first drainage basin this was mainly due to the substantial contribution of o i flows i e the highest blue bar monthly 30 day averaged irrigation was ranked as the second highest important predictor of streamflow simulation such a model decision was associated with the substantial baseflow contribution i e the highest black bar the above inference suggested that weekly averaged irrigation water mainly facilitated the model to capture the dynamics of o i flows while monthly averaged irrigation water facilitated the model to capture the groundwater dynamics this was because the unsaturated zone reached a dynamic equilibrium state with weekly irrigation leading to a constant water release that facilitated the model to capture the dynamics of o i flows since the unsaturated zone was not uniform due to the variations in landscape irrigation and climatic factors the dynamic equilibrium state also varied correspondingly consequently irrigation with different window lengths suggested varying importance scores in capturing the dynamics of o i flows in the third drainage basin the 5 day averaged precipitation was responsible for capturing the dynamics of o i flows while monthly irrigation water facilitated the model to capture the groundwater dynamics these findings agreed with our field investigation that the third drainage in recent years had been reinforced as floodways connected to flood storage and lakes to embrace the floods from the mountains on the west fig 2 even though the monthly averaged irrigation showed significant importance for baseflow simulation during the wi period it did not contribute much to streamflow simulation meanwhile 3 day 7 day and 15 day averaged irrigation had the highest contributions to o i flows and streamflow simulation for the first second and third drainages respectively these results suggested that o i flows were the dominant flow components during the wi period while baseflow had a minimal contribution to streamflow these results agreed with our investigation of winter irrigation schedules the high volume of irrigation water flushes over the irrigation field bare ground in a short period to freeze the topsoil therefore the irrigation water quickly percolates into the saturated zone without being uptook by crops thereby leading to substantial o i flows 4 discussions 4 1 does the importance score lead to physically consistent results traditionally importance scores mainly reflect the relative contribution of predictors to model predictive accuracy rather than physically influence the model predictand e g volume of streamflow molnar 2020 rajbahadur et al 2021 a frequently asked question in statistical based hydrological inference is whether the importance scores can lead to physically consistent results in this study even though the physical knowledge suggested that the obtained inferences were reasonable we still need more rigorous evidence to test whether the relative importance of predictors achieved from bfsce also reflects their relative significance on the changes of streamflow to this end a multilevel factorial analysis mfa was performed as follows 1 reprocess the testing dataset of si period by multiplying its irrigation and precipitation associated time series by vectors of 1 1 0 9 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 9 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 9 0 9 0 9 1 0 and 0 9 1 1 separately 2 train 10 sets of bfsce and sce models for the si period of the training dataset with different random seeds 3 feed each of the trained models with the reprocessed testing datasets 4 calculate the mean daily streamflow baseflow and o i flow volumes m3 based on the results obtained from each model 5 use flow volumes as response variables to calculate the main effects of individual factors i e irrigation and precipitation their interactions and model error 6 the contribution of each factor can be calculated using its sum of squares divided by the total sum of squares montgomery 2017 fig 11 presents the main effects of irrigation and precipitation on streamflow o i flow and baseflow with detailed information shown in tables s1 to s3 the results suggested that precipitation for the first drainage in the red box of fig 11 had little contribution to the streamflow volume during the si period in addition precipitation contributed little to baseflow volume for all three basins shown in the blue box the differences between the relative contributions importance score obtained from wfi hereinafter shown as rc wfi and those obtained from mfa hereinafter shown as rc mfa are shown in fig 12 the rc wfi of irrigation or precipitation for simulating streamflow or its sub processes was calculated as the mean value of the three highest importance scores as indicated in fig 10 associated with the corresponding factor rc wfi reflects the relative contribution of precipitation and irrigation in describing the flow dynamics i e model performance while rc mfa reflects the sensitivity of flow volume change m3 in response to precipitation and irrigation the hypothesis is that if a predictor is more important in the modeling process it will be more influential to the changes on streamflow or its sub processes fig 12 showed that the rc wfi the top panel agreed with the rc mfa the bottom panel precipitation accounted for the highest rc mfa to streamflow generation in the third drainage basin and it also had the highest rc wfi in the modeling process the results suggested that compared with the first and second drainage basins precipitation in the third drainage basin showed higher importance in both flow simulation from the model performance perspective and formulation from the physics perspective this is because the streamflow in the third basin contains flash floods from the mountains shown in fig 2 during the rainy season making precipitation a dominant factor influencing the streamflow compared with the second and the third drainage basins precipitation in the first drainage basin achieved the lowest rc mfa to streamflow generation corresponding to the lowest rc wfi among the three basins this is because the unit area irrigation volume in the first drainage basin is the highest among all three basins leading to lower importance in precipitation precipitation showed higher rc mfa for the o i flow generation and the same pattern could also be achieved from the results of rc wfi this is because precipitation had a higher rate mm hour than irrigation in general and was more likely to generate infiltration excess flow contributing to the o i flows on the contrary irrigation water was more likely to percolate and become interflows and baseflows leading to a lower contribution to o i flow generation these findings proved our hypothesis and suggested that model inference from sce could explain the hydrological process using the knowledge from process based models it should be noted that precipitation in the first drainage basin barely influenced the flow volume nevertheless its contribution still accounted for 7 6 over half of the contribution for irrigation in the modeling process the results indicated that precipitation might not significantly change flow volume but influence other the flow characteristics such as timing of flow peaks 4 2 what role does relative importance of driving forces play in understanding hydrological processes one may wonder what role relative importance of driving forces plays in gaining insights into hydrological processes which was associated with process based models even though the process based hydrological models have been studied for more than a century mulvany 1850 hydrological processes under some complicated conditions such as in coastal basins where the hydrological processes are influenced by tide and current fluxes armenio et al 2017 bevacqua et al 2017 as well as watersheds with intensive human activities dewandel et al 2008 gosain et al 2005 are still less studied and need additional knowledge to gain a thorough understanding even for the most commonly studied watersheds a process based model may not consider every aspect of its driving forces such as large scale climatic indices e g el niño li et al 2021a in bfsce complex relationships between streamflow or its sub components and its driving forces can be examined without an assumption of any linear or non linear functions with the provision of the state of the art dataset e g soil moisture data o neill et al 2019 surface mass change data for the estimation of groundwater change landerer and swenson 2012 vegetation growth data myneni et al 2015 and snowmelt data hersbach et al 2018 the resulting relative contribution thus carries the critical information that may be neglected by a process based model such information can help us gain a more in depth understanding of hydrological sub processes in terms of the irrigated watersheds it is difficult for a conventional data driven model to achieve a robust quantification of how irrigation and precipitation influence the sub hydrological processes the cutting edge feature importance method in the bfsce model suggested that the hydrological inferences were valid for both the entire hydrological process and its sub processes the modular models specialized for sub hydrological processes can help identify the dominant factor in the saturated and unsaturated zones such an understanding can further help decision makers implement the best management practices for mitigating the risks of flooding and salinization 4 3 challenges and opportunities the proposed bfsce model has some limitations since it cannot extrapolate beyond the historical observations it may face difficulties in evaluating the impact of changing climate or other non stationary dynamics in this study the non stationary dynamics in the second drainage basins led to a significant overestimation of baseflow a possible way to improve the simulation is to extend the coverage of training data such approaches include but are not limited to using process based models as an emulator of the real system to generate synthetic data in parts of the problem space where actual data is sparse or unavailable razavi 2021 and training one model with big data covering hundreds of basins with the assumption that data from one basin can inform inference in other basins kratzert et al 2019b the selection of predictors is another challenge to the proposed bfsce model in this study we used irrigation and precipitation of various moving windows as surrogates to the basin antecedent conditions the length of these moving windows was designed in accordance with the basin characteristics nevertheless it is challenging to fully characterize the basin conditions therefore this is of particular importance to know that the robustness of the proposed bfsce is expected to improve with additional sources of data such as soil moisture and snowmelt as well as more data samples the baseflow simulation module embedded in bfsce uses constant coefficients which may face difficulties addressing uncertainties in complex hydrological systems balogun et al 2020 yang et al 2020 for the proposed bfsce model empirical equations proposed by meshgi et al 2014 were used to estimate the baseflow however previous studies suggested that the coefficients in the empirical equations optimized globally to work across many watersheds might not be optimal for any specific watershed future studies should take into account the uncertainties of process based modules such that more physically reliable results can be expected 5 conclusions this study proposed a bfsce for improving the capacity of hydrological inference with the aid of a process based baseflow separation method it is the first attempt to incorporate a feature importance method and a process based baseflow separation method for quantifying the relative contributions of associated model predictors to sub hydrological processes i e baseflow and o i flows the results revealed that the predictors associated with air temperature and long term i e monthly irrigation mainly characterized baseflow dynamics while precipitation and short term i e weekly or semi weekly irrigation mainly captured overland flow and interflow dynamics such information could help determine whether the watershed is precipitation or irrigation dominated such a better understanding could further facilitate the conjunctive operation of surface water and groundwater resources thereby reducing the risks of flooding and salinization the fidelity of hydrological inference through the feature importance method was further demonstrated through mfa the results revealed that the relative importance of predictors reflected their significance on model performance and their influence on explaining the changes of streamflow in general the higher importance of a predictor the more changes on streamflow can be explained by this predictor the proposed bfsce model is a step closer to understanding sub hydrological processes through data driven models as physics informed data driven models continue to develop in the future the improved hydrological inference through data driven

2898,under climate warming the frequency of dry wet abrupt alternation dwaa events was largely increased at the global scale in this study we identified dwaa events including dry wet d w alternation events and wet dry w d alternation events based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei for the great lakes region of central asia glrca and analyzed temporal and spatial variation of dwaa during the period 1976 2015 over the entire study period glrca experienced an overall wetting trend and a heavy dry trend was mainly distributed in the southwest although both d w alternation events and w d alternation events showed a slight decrease at the regional scale there were two clearly opposite trends between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 with a decrease in 1976 1995 and an increase in 1996 2015 spatially the variation in the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events exhibited a large heterogeneity a significant increase in the frequency of d w alternation events and w d alternation events was observed in the southwest of arid climate zone which may be attributed to the increased frequency of dry months and wet months in the region this study in dwaa events is of importance to the implementation of water resources management disaster prevention and mitigation policies in the glrca under the challenge of future climate change keywords climate change spei dry wet abrupt alternation great lakes region of central asia data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction under global warming the frequency intensity spatial extent duration and timing of extreme weather and climate events have been changed du et al 2019 du et al 2022 ipcc 2012 extreme weather and climate events such as droughts floods blizzards extreme cold and dust storms are characterized by suddenness unpredictability and strong destructiveness and their impact on natural ecosystems and socio economic systems is much higher than the changes in mean climate anderegg et al 2013 ma et al 2015 due to the limited adaptive capacity of terrestrial ecosystems and socio economic systems extreme weather and climate events have led to irreversible damage such as the mega flood over china in 1998 zong and chen 2000 the heat waves in europe during 2003 and 2010 barriopedro et al 2011 ciais et al 2005 the extreme droughts across the amazon basin in 2005 2010 and 2015 panisset et al 2018 and the forest fires in australia in late 2019 bradstock et al 2020 the frequentable extreme weather and climate events enhanced the vulnerability of ecosystems the european heatwave and drought in 2003 caused a 30 reduction in gross primary productivity ciais et al 2005 therefore understanding changes in extreme weather and climate events is of great significance for mitigating natural disasters guiding agricultural production and supporting policy making dry wet abrupt alternation dwaa including dry wet d w alternation and wet dry w d alternation are typical precipitation and temperature anomaly events that combine the effects of drought and heavy rainfall chen et al 2020a shan et al 2018 numerous evidence suggests that dwaa events have a greater impact on agricultural production and economic system than individual drought and heavy rainfall events huang et al 2019 pires et al 2008 shi et al 2021a d w alternation events can directly affect the migration transformation and accumulation process of pollutants in surface water especially the pollution of nitrogen and phosphorus leading to water quality deterioration bi et al 2019 d w alternation events can also increase the frequency and magnitude of geohazards such as landslides inducing loss of life and infrastructure handwerger et al 2019 in contrast w d alternating events could reduce vegetation respiration trigger ecosystem degradation and grain losses due to soil water deficit shi et al 2021a huang et al 2019 found that dwaa caused a great change to the root morphology of rice and yield losses caused by flooding were greater than those caused by drought under dwaa conditions with climate warming drought and heavy rainfall events are occurring with increasing frequency and intensity across the globe which may lead to more frequent dwaa events han et al 2019 in recent years many studies have been devoted to identifying and quantifying dwaa events chen et al 2020b li and ye 2015 shan et al 2018 chen et al 2020b defined dwaa events using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and explicitly revealed a strong positive between dwaa events and heavy rainfall across china shan et al 2018 calculated the dwaa index based on precipitation to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of dwaa events in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin however these studies on dwaa mainly focused on the monsoon rainfall zone and few have been conducted in the dryland zone chen et al 2020b li and ye 2015 shan et al 2018 gregory et al 1997 concluded that drought events in drought prone regions may last longer and more severe due to enhanced evaporation meanwhile the climate in some arid zones has been observed to exhibit a warm and humid trend in recent years li et al 2015b wang et al 2021d trenberth et al 2003 found an increase in heavy rain events and a decrease in light rain events globally with increased precipitation however it remained uncertain whether dwaa events occur to increase with increased drought and heavy rainfall events in arid zones the great lakes region of central asia glrca is located in the hinterland of eurasia and is the largest arid zone in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere gao and zhao 2022 li et al 2015a yao et al 2017 over the past 33 years the glrca has experienced rapid warming of approximately 0 36 c 0 42 c which was stronger than the rate of the global average temperature hu et al 2014 precipitation in the glrca is controlled by westerly and monsoon and the differences of moisture sources further affect precipitation patterns and significantly increase precipitation variability bothe et al 2012 shi et al 2021b trenberth et al 2003 different from the drylands of north africa and mongolia plateau where precipitation is concentrated in the summer precipitation in the glrca is mainly concentrated in the spring developing a unique dryland ecosystem that is highly sensitive to extreme weather and climate events chen et al 2018 xu et al 2016 the uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall is also prone to trigger dwaa events meanwhile given that spring is a key period for most vegetation growth and bud and bloom formation dwaa events in spring can have major effects on the annual growth of vegetation ganjurjav et al 2020 additionally precipitation in the glrca showed a slightly increasing trend at the regional scale over the last half century with a large spatial heterogeneity jiang et al 2017 li et al 2015b several studies have found that annual precipitation in the glrca can be divided into two distinct periods at the regional scale with an increase in the 1980 s and early 1990 s and a reversal in the late 1990 s hu et al 2016 li et al 2015b although the glrca has experienced an overall wetting trend for the last half century dwaa events might increase with more frequent drought and heavy rainfall events guo et al 2018 liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions are more fragile due to harsh environmental conditions and the increase in dwaa events could weaken the benefit of increased precipitation and adversely affect vegetation growth and agricultural production fan et al 2021 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 for example frequent dwaa events may exacerbate soil salinization and cause severe land degradation hamidov et al 2016 a sudden shift from drought to heavy rainfall may induce heavy flooding intensify soil erosion and reduce land productivity li et al 2020 however previous studies mostly focused on changes in drought or heavy rainfall events individually over the glrca and the identification and quantification of dwaa events have received little attention liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 in this study we investigate the spatial and temporal variations of dwaa events in the glrca from 1976 to 2015 given the turning point of precipitation around the 1990 s we divided the whole study period into two periods and further analyzed the spatial pattern of the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 this study would help predict future climate change and decision making for the prevention and mitigation of disaster in the glrca 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the glrca 35 1 55 5 n 46 4 87 4 e consists of five central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan turkmenistan tajikistan and uzbekistan yao et al 2017 the region is located deep inside the eurasian continent far from the ocean and is the largest dryland area in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere li et al 2015a meanwhile the region has a relatively concentrated distribution of lakes bai et al 2012 li et al 2015a yao et al 2017 there are more than 3 000 lakes greater than 1 km2 and about 60 lakes greater than 100 km2 with a total lake area of more than 100 000 km2 and the majority of them are endorheic lakes information for lakes available at the hydrosheds website https www hydrosheds org page hydrolakes the larger water bodies include the aral sea lake issyk kul and lake balkhash table 1 fig 1 therefore the whole of arid central asia is called the glrca yao et al 2017 the terrain in the glrca is generally high in the southeast and low in the northwest fig 1 a the glrca is dominated by typically continental climate characterized by scarce precipitation strong evapotranspiration and highly fluctuating temperature zhang et al 2018 according to koppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 glrca can be divided into eight climate zones table 2 fig 1 b these are arid climate zone with cold and desert bwk arid climate zone with cold and steppe bsk temperature climate zone with hot summer and dry summer csa cold climate zone with dry summer and hot summer dsa cold climate zone with dry summer and warm summer dsb cold climate zone with dry winter and hot summer dwa cold climate zone with hot summer and without dry season dfa and cold climate zone with warm summer and without dry season dfb based on these climates glrca has developed arid and semi arid ecosystems including desert semi desert and grassland which are sensitive to climate change 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate data the monthly precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 were obtained from the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia and are available online https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 4 02 in this study the data cover the period 1976 2015 cru ts v4 02 climate dataset derived from the interpolation of observations at meteorological stations and has been widely used in climate change research mitchell and jones 2005 zhang et al 2018 2 2 2 spei dataset spei is commonly used as drought indexes chen et al 2020a zhong et al 2021 which is calculated based on the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and reflects the water deficit or excess in a region within a certain period the parameter potential evapotranspiration is derived by the fao 56 penman monteith method positive spei values represent wetter conditions while negative values represent drier conditions the classification of dry and wet conditions based on spei is shown in table 3 chen et al 2020b xu et al 2015 in this study we used a global monthly spei product provided by begueria et al 2010 which is available online https hdl handle net 10261 153475 this spei dataset was calculated based on the cru ts 3 24 01 climate data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and we selected the data covering the period 1976 2015 2 3 methods 2 3 1 dwaa chen et al 2020b quantified dwaa events of china by defining the dry month and the wet month based on spei given that spei 1 and spei 1 are the thresholds between dry wet and normal conditions respectively and that choosing 1 as the thresholds could yield a suitable sample size table 3 table 4 the dry month was indicated by spei value less than or equal to 1 while the wet month was expressed by spei value greater than or equal to 1 in this study chen et al 2020b therefore dwaa events represented the abrupt alternation between dry and wet conditions in adjacent months dwaa events included two types d w alternation events and w d alternation events fig 2 adjacent months a dry month turning into a wet month is a d w alternation event while a wet month shifting to a dry month is a w d alternation event in addition given the turning point of precipitation around the 1990 s hu et al 2016 li et al 2015b we divided the whole study period into two periods and then analyzed the spatial and temporal variability in dwaa events between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 2 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall test was adopted to detect time series trends of climate variables kendall 1990 mann 1945 this method is a non parametric test which is suitable for data that do not follow the standard distribution pattern and is less sensitive to sporadic outliers sneyers 1990 it has been widely used and recommended by the world meteorological organization to examine trends in hydrological and meteorological data li and ye 2015 shan et al 2018 xu and tang 2021 in this study a p value 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 spatial variations of precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and spei fig 3 illustrates the spatial patterns of trends in precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and average spei over the glrca during the period 1976 2015 over the entire study period variation in precipitation had large spatial heterogeneity approximately 64 5 of the study area exhibited a trend of increase in precipitation primarily in the cold climate zone a decrease in precipitation mainly occurred in the arid climate zone of the west accounting for 35 5 of the study area furthermore all regions showed an obvious warming trend and all passed the significance test at 0 05 the greater increase in temperature greater than0 040 c yr mainly occurred in the west there was a similar spatial pattern of temperature and potential evapotranspiration during 1976 2015 the entire study area was subject to increasing potential evapotranspiration with 75 2 of the area being significant p 0 05 a greater increase greater than0 073 mm yr was observed predominantly in the arid climate zone for the entire period 1976 2015 approximately 58 0 of the study area was subject to an increasing trend in average spei with 24 7 being significant at 0 05 which further indicated a tendency to wetter in most of the glrca then approximately 42 0 of the study area showed a decreasing trend in average spei and the greater decrease 0 008 yr occurred primarily in the southwest 3 2 spatial variations of the maximum spei and minimum spei to investigate the interannual trends of the driest and wettest months of the year we analyzed the spatial distribution of trends in maximum spei and minimum spei over the glrca during 1976 2015 fig 4 from 1976 to 2015 approximately 49 2 of the study area showed an increasing trend in maximum spei with 19 5 being significant p 0 05 approximately 50 8 of the study area showed a decreasing trend in maximum spei with 22 4 being significant p 0 05 by contrast minimum spei generally increased across most 56 8 of the study area during the period 1976 2015 the most pronounced increase greater than0 004 yr in minimum spei was primarily observed in the east of the study area while the greater decrease 0 008 yr in minimum spei occurred mainly in the bwk climate zone 3 3 spatial distribution of the number of wet months and dry months to examine the relative change in wet months and dry months over the glrca we compared the change in the number of wet months and drought months between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 fig 5 over the period 1976 1995 the frequency of wet months greater than 60 months accounted for 10 2 of the study area mainly in the bwk climate zone in comparison during the period 1996 2015 the regions with wet months frequency greater than 60 months represented 10 1 and were more scattered however for the number of wet months 40 months the percentage was 13 1 and 20 6 for the periods 1976 1995 and 1996 2015 respectively greater frequency of drought months more than 55 occupied 4 0 of the study area for the periods 1976 1995 mainly distributed in the northeast while during 1996 2015 approximately 9 7 of the study area experienced greater than 55 months primarily in the southwest of the arid climate zone an obviously increasing trend of dry months was examined in the southwest of the glrca during 1976 1995 16 9 of the study area experienced 35 dry months predominantly in the south meanwhile 23 3 of the study area occurred with 35 dry months over the period 1996 2015 3 4 spatial and temporal variation of the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events fig 6 shows the changes in spatial distribution of the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events over the glrca during 1976 1995 and 1996 2015 for the period 1976 1995 a greater frequency of d w alternation events more than 11 was observed in 12 0 of the study area and was more widely distributed in contrast only 4 9 of the study area experienced greater than 11 d w alternation events from 1996 to 2015 and was mainly distributed in the in small regions of the southwest and north overall the frequency of d w alternation events was decreased in 1996 2015 compared to 1976 1995 in contrast for the number of w d alternation events greater than 11 months 4 5 and 6 9 of the study area were covered during 1976 1995 and 1996 2015 respectively furthermore the regions where more frequent w d alternation events occurred have clearly changed spatially for 1996 2015 the regions with more than 11 w d alternation events were mainly located in the bwk climate zone to examine interannual variation in dwaa events we further analyzed the relative changes in the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events based on pixels fig 7 at the regional scale d w alternation events showed a decreasing trend at a rate of 4 671 yr over the entire study period with opposite trends in 1976 1995 and 1996 2015 during 1976 1995 d w alternation events decreased at a rate of 4 938 yr whereas they were increased at a rate of 16 324 yr from 1996 to 2015 for w d alternation events their trends were relatively consistent with the trends of d w alternation events at a regional scale w d alternation events exhibited a slight decreasing trend at a rate of 1 876 yr in the entire study period with two opposite trends between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 for the period 1976 1995 w d alternation events decreased at a rate of 10 396 yr at a regional scale then after 1995 w d alternation events showed an increasing trend at a rate of 6 907 yr 3 5 month of the occurrence of d w alternation events and w d alternation events to understand the timing of the occurrence of d w alternation events and w d alternation events in the glrca we counted the percentage frequency of months in which d w alternation events and w d alternation events occurred between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 respectively fig 8 over the period 1976 1995 d w alternation events concentrated in march april october november and november december accounting for 12 4 14 3 and 11 6 respectively however w d alternation events appeared mainly in february march september october and november december accounting for 10 1 13 1 and 12 3 respectively compared to 1976 1995 there was also a noticeable change in the months of occurrence of d w alternation events and w d alternation events in 1996 2015 during 1996 2015 d w alternation events mostly occurred in january february june july and august september representing 12 3 13 0 and 10 4 respectively while w d alternation events were mainly found in july august august september and november december with a percentage of 11 4 12 3 and 13 2 respectively as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 dwaa events showed a decreasing trend over the entire study period especially for w d alternation events of september october and d w alternation events of october november to further understand the reasons for the changes in dwaa events we analyzed the variations of wet and dry conditions in september october and november based on spei fig 9 in september and october most regions exhibited a decreasing trend in spei accounting for 78 9 and 72 2 of the study area respectively and the greater decrease 0 015 yr was observed mostly in the central region of kazakhstan however approximately 63 7 of the study area was subject to a positive trend for spei in november and 20 7 passed the significance test at the 0 05 level in november the greater increase greater than0 015 yr in spei was primarily in the south and northeast of the study area 4 discussion in this study we investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of dwaa events based on spei in the glrca during the period 1976 2015 given that drought is a major factor affecting vegetation productivity and ecosystem carbon cycling at regional and global scales wang et al 2021b we first analyzed the dry and wet variability in the glrca using spei during the entire study period most of the study area was observed an increasing spei indicating a wetting trend meanwhile many studies revealed that total precipitation in the glrca has increased in recent decades and increased precipitation provided favorable conditions for vegetation growth jiang et al 2017 li et al 2015b yao et al 2021 the significant trend of drying occurred mainly in the southwest especially around the aral sea jiang et al 2019 suggested that drought caused by decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature was the major driver of desertification expansion in the southwest of the glrca with climate change short term droughts or heavy rainfalls with extreme spei values are often considered as extreme weather and climate events and their variability can lead to greater damage than the average spei variability ta et al 2018 wang et al 2021c therefore we further analyzed the interannual trend in maximum spei and minimum spei given the limitations of the average spei the maximum spei and the minimum spei are closely related to the growth and distribution of vegetation and changes in these values may indicate changes in ecosystem structure and function deng et al 2021 pei et al 2021 during the entire study period maximum spei and minimum spei all showed large spatial heterogeneity in the glrca for example in the central region of kazakhstan the driest months showed a trend towards wetting while the wettest months indicated a trend towards drying the observed increase in the minimum spei may alleviate the drought limitation of plant growth deng et al 2020 to further examine the climate change in the glrca we used spei to characterize dry months wet months and dwaa events an increase in the number of wet months was mainly observed in the north and southeast and the number of dry months increased mainly in the southwest liu et al 2021 found that meteorological drought risk was highest in the southwest glrca and flood risk was highest in the southeast glrca over the last decades which further confirms the results of this study in addition the increase in wet months and decrease in dry months over the eastern of the study area might be closely related to the increase in total precipitation in the region yao et al 2021 the increase in wet months may be accompanied by an increase in extreme precipitation which in turn not only may increase risk of flooding but also has a greater effect on terrestrial ecosystems in the glrca liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 yao et al 2021 luo et al 2020 found a significant positive correlation between ndvi and extreme precipitation in the glrca at the monthly scale during the entire study period both d w alternation events and w d alternation events exhibited a decrease in 1976 1995 and an increase in 1996 2015 at the regional scale which was opposite to the interannual trend in precipitation hu et al 2016 li et al 2015b dwaa is a compound event of heavy rainfall and drought and increased precipitation in the glrca not only triggered more heavy rainfall events but also reduced drought events liu et al 2021 yang et al 2020 moreover precipitation in the glrca is mainly distributed in spring and the irregularity of precipitation could highly cause the variability in dwaa events chen et al 2018 xu et al 2016 spatially d w alternation events decreased significantly in the east of kazakhstan while dry months increased in the region wet months decreased thus resulting in a decrease in d w alternation events w d alternation events were observed to increase noticeably in the southwestern bwk climate zone which was mainly attributed to an increase in dry months meanwhile we found a greater decrease in w d alternation events occurring mainly in september october meanwhile we found that the decrease in w d alternation events occurred mainly in september october the drought trend in september and october contribute to the increased dry months of september and the decreased wet months of october respectively which in turn explains the decrease in w d alternation events frequent dwaa events could have substantial adverse effects on agricultural production and economic development gao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 tian et al 2016 wang et al 2021a dwaa events in the glrca occurred mainly in spring and autumn which are critical periods for most vegetation growth and crop harvest yuan et al 2021 several studies revealed that vegetation growth in dwaa differs from those in drought and heavy rainfall stress alone because vegetation has different patterns of adaptation to soil water deficit or soil water excess respectively huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 to a certain extent a heavy rainfall during a drought can stimulate ecosystem processes and promote vegetation growth in arid and semi arid regions hoover et al 2022 however severe d w alternation events may leave vegetation in a flooded condition and result in a significant reduction in vegetation productivity due to root hypoxia and reduced respiration kramer et al 2008 for example yields of those crops maize with less tolerance to flood will be largely decreased bi et al 2020 meanwhile a sudden shift from drought to heavy rainfall may induce heavy flooding and intensify soil erosion causing landslides and massive house collapses especially in the eastern mountainous regions wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2015 w d alternating events are usually accompanied by a sudden deficit of soil water which could reduce vegetation respiration and thus trigger ecosystem degradation and grain losses shi et al 2021a over the entire study period w d alternating events occurred mainly in the west of the study area which is primarily an arid climate zone frequent w d alternating events increased the vulnerability of the region s ecosystems and contributed to the significant degradation of the region s vegetation during recent years dwaa is a comprehensive effect of climate change and many factors cause dwaa events including meteorological factors and atmospheric circulation chen et al 2020b fang et al 2019 shan et al 2018 yang et al 2013 several studies have confirmed a strong correlation between dwaa events and the precipitation chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b shi et al 2021a precipitation in the glrca is mainly derived from the westerly circulation and indian monsoon bothe et al 2012 in recent years dynamic and thermodynamic climate changes have triggered significant variations in glrca precipitation emori and brown 2005 li et al 2015b the anomalous cyclone associated with enhanced horizontal vorticity increased the water vapor flux of westerly thereby contributing to the increased precipitation in northern kazakhstan emori and brown 2005 peng and zhou 2017 rising sst in the western pacific ocean caused negative pressure anomalies over the indian ocean and reduced water vapor transport which may be the main driver of decreased precipitation in the southern glrca yang et al 2020 precipitation variability induced frequent heavy rainfall and drought events especially near the aral sea liu et al 2021 yang et al 2020 consequently contributing to an increase in dwaa events across the southwest glrca under global warming a comprehensive assessment of variations in dwaa events is important for predicting future climate change and will be helpful for decision making in implementing ecological restoration and conservation in arid and semi arid regions 5 conclusions this study investigated the temporal and spatial characteristics of the dwaa events over the glrca based spei 1 during 1976 2015 the increase in precipitation over the glrca mainly occurred in the east while the decrease in precipitation mainly occurred in the west all regions showed an obvious increasing trend in temperature and potential evapotranspiration additionally the study area exhibited an overall wet trend and an intense drought trend was mainly in the southwest 2 the frequency of wet months increased in the west and southeast regions and decreased in the central region for 1996 2015 compared to 1976 1995 in addition a noticeable increase in dry months was observed in the southwest while a decrease was observed in the southeast during 1996 2015 compared to 1976 1995 3 although both d w alternation events and w d alternation events showed a slightly decreasing trend at the regional scale there are two clearly opposite trends between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 with a decrease in 1976 1995 and an increase in 1996 2015 spatially a significant increase in the frequency of d w alternation events and w d alternation events was observed in the southwest of the study area 4 for 1976 1995 d w alternation events occurred mainly in march april and october november while w d alternation events appeared mainly in february march and september october during 1996 2015 d w alternation events mostly occurred in january february and june july while w d alternation events were mainly found in july august and august september declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

2898,under climate warming the frequency of dry wet abrupt alternation dwaa events was largely increased at the global scale in this study we identified dwaa events including dry wet d w alternation events and wet dry w d alternation events based on the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei for the great lakes region of central asia glrca and analyzed temporal and spatial variation of dwaa during the period 1976 2015 over the entire study period glrca experienced an overall wetting trend and a heavy dry trend was mainly distributed in the southwest although both d w alternation events and w d alternation events showed a slight decrease at the regional scale there were two clearly opposite trends between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 with a decrease in 1976 1995 and an increase in 1996 2015 spatially the variation in the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events exhibited a large heterogeneity a significant increase in the frequency of d w alternation events and w d alternation events was observed in the southwest of arid climate zone which may be attributed to the increased frequency of dry months and wet months in the region this study in dwaa events is of importance to the implementation of water resources management disaster prevention and mitigation policies in the glrca under the challenge of future climate change keywords

spatial extent duration and timing of extreme weather and climate events have been changed du et al 2019 du et al 2022 ipcc 2012 extreme weather and climate events such as droughts floods blizzards extreme cold and dust storms are characterized by suddenness unpredictability and strong destructiveness and their impact on natural ecosystems and socio economic systems is much higher than the changes in mean climate anderegg et al 2013 ma et al 2015 due to the limited adaptive capacity of terrestrial ecosystems and socio economic systems extreme weather and climate events have led to irreversible damage such as the mega flood over china in 1998 zong and chen 2000 the heat waves in europe during 2003 and 2010 barriopedro et al 2011 ciais et al 2005 the extreme droughts across the amazon basin in 2005 2010 and 2015 panisset et al 2018 and the forest fires in australia in late 2019 bradstock et al 2020 the frequentable extreme weather and climate events enhanced the vulnerability of ecosystems the european heatwave and drought in 2003 caused a 30 reduction in gross primary productivity ciais et al 2005 therefore understanding changes in extreme weather and climate events is of great significance for mitigating natural disasters guiding agricultural production and supporting policy making dry wet abrupt alternation dwaa including dry wet d w alternation and wet dry w d alternation are typical precipitation and temperature anomaly events that combine the effects of drought and heavy rainfall chen et al 2020a shan et al 2018 numerous evidence suggests that dwaa events have a greater impact on agricultural production and economic system than individual drought and heavy rainfall events huang et al 2019 pires et al 2008 shi et al 2021a d w alternation events can directly affect the migration transformation and accumulation process of pollutants in surface water especially the pollution of nitrogen and phosphorus leading to water quality deterioration bi et al 2019 d w alternation events can also increase the frequency and magnitude of geohazards such as landslides inducing loss of life and infrastructure handwerger et al 2019 in contrast w d alternating events could reduce vegetation respiration trigger ecosystem degradation and grain losses due to soil water deficit shi et al 2021a huang et al 2019 found that dwaa caused a great change to the root morphology of rice and yield losses caused by flooding were greater than those caused by drought under dwaa conditions with climate warming drought and heavy rainfall events are occurring with increasing frequency and intensity across the globe which may lead to more frequent dwaa events han et al 2019 in recent years many studies have been devoted to identifying and quantifying dwaa events chen et al 2020b li and ye 2015 shan et al 2018 chen et al 2020b defined dwaa events using the standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei and explicitly revealed a strong positive between dwaa events and heavy rainfall across china shan et al 2018 calculated the dwaa index based on precipitation to analyze the spatial and temporal evolution of dwaa events in the middle and lower reaches of the yangtze river basin however these studies on dwaa mainly focused on the monsoon rainfall zone and few have been conducted in the dryland zone chen et al 2020b li and ye 2015 shan et al 2018 gregory et al 1997 concluded that drought events in drought prone regions may last longer and more severe due to enhanced evaporation meanwhile the climate in some arid zones has been observed to exhibit a warm and humid trend in recent years li et al 2015b wang et al 2021d trenberth et al 2003 found an increase in heavy rain events and a decrease in light rain events globally with increased precipitation however it remained uncertain whether dwaa events occur to increase with increased drought and heavy rainfall events in arid zones the great lakes region of central asia glrca is located in the hinterland of eurasia and is the largest arid zone in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere gao and zhao 2022 li et al 2015a yao et al 2017 over the past 33 years the glrca has experienced rapid warming of approximately 0 36 c 0 42 c which was stronger than the rate of the global average temperature hu et al 2014 precipitation in the glrca is controlled by westerly and monsoon and the differences of moisture sources further affect precipitation patterns and significantly increase precipitation variability bothe et al 2012 shi et al 2021b trenberth et al 2003 different from the drylands of north africa and mongolia plateau where precipitation is concentrated in the summer precipitation in the glrca is mainly concentrated in the spring developing a unique dryland ecosystem that is highly sensitive to extreme weather and climate events chen et al 2018 xu et al 2016 the uneven seasonal distribution of rainfall is also prone to trigger dwaa events meanwhile given that spring is a key period for most vegetation growth and bud and bloom formation dwaa events in spring can have major effects on the annual growth of vegetation ganjurjav et al 2020 additionally precipitation in the glrca showed a slightly increasing trend at the regional scale over the last half century with a large spatial heterogeneity jiang et al 2017 li et al 2015b several studies have found that annual precipitation in the glrca can be divided into two distinct periods at the regional scale with an increase in the 1980 s and early 1990 s and a reversal in the late 1990 s hu et al 2016 li et al 2015b although the glrca has experienced an overall wetting trend for the last half century dwaa events might increase with more frequent drought and heavy rainfall events guo et al 2018 liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 ecosystems in arid and semi arid regions are more fragile due to harsh environmental conditions and the increase in dwaa events could weaken the benefit of increased precipitation and adversely affect vegetation growth and agricultural production fan et al 2021 lioubimtseva and henebry 2009 for example frequent dwaa events may exacerbate soil salinization and cause severe land degradation hamidov et al 2016 a sudden shift from drought to heavy rainfall may induce heavy flooding intensify soil erosion and reduce land productivity li et al 2020 however previous studies mostly focused on changes in drought or heavy rainfall events individually over the glrca and the identification and quantification of dwaa events have received little attention liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 in this study we investigate the spatial and temporal variations of dwaa events in the glrca from 1976 to 2015 given the turning point of precipitation around the 1990 s we divided the whole study period into two periods and further analyzed the spatial pattern of the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 this study would help predict future climate change and decision making for the prevention and mitigation of disaster in the glrca 2 data and methods 2 1 study area the glrca 35 1 55 5 n 46 4 87 4 e consists of five central asian countries kazakhstan kyrgyzstan turkmenistan tajikistan and uzbekistan yao et al 2017 the region is located deep inside the eurasian continent far from the ocean and is the largest dryland area in the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere li et al 2015a meanwhile the region has a relatively concentrated distribution of lakes bai et al 2012 li et al 2015a yao et al 2017 there are more than 3 000 lakes greater than 1 km2 and about 60 lakes greater than 100 km2 with a total lake area of more than 100 000 km2 and the majority of them are endorheic lakes information for lakes available at the hydrosheds website https www hydrosheds org page hydrolakes the larger water bodies include the aral sea lake issyk kul and lake balkhash table 1 fig 1 therefore the whole of arid central asia is called the glrca yao et al 2017 the terrain in the glrca is generally high in the southeast and low in the northwest fig 1 a the glrca is dominated by typically continental climate characterized by scarce precipitation strong evapotranspiration and highly fluctuating temperature zhang et al 2018 according to koppen geiger climate classification peel et al 2007 glrca can be divided into eight climate zones table 2 fig 1 b these are arid climate zone with cold and desert bwk arid climate zone with cold and steppe bsk temperature climate zone with hot summer and dry summer csa cold climate zone with dry summer and hot summer dsa cold climate zone with dry summer and warm summer dsb cold climate zone with dry winter and hot summer dwa cold climate zone with hot summer and without dry season dfa and cold climate zone with warm summer and without dry season dfb based on these climates glrca has developed arid and semi arid ecosystems including desert semi desert and grassland which are sensitive to climate change 2 2 data 2 2 1 climate data the monthly precipitation temperature and potential evapotranspiration data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 were obtained from the climatic research unit cru of the university of east anglia and are available online https crudata uea ac uk cru data hrg cru ts 4 02 in this study the data cover the period 1976 2015 cru ts v4 02 climate dataset derived from the interpolation of observations at meteorological stations and has been widely used in climate change research mitchell and jones 2005 zhang et al 2018 2 2 2 spei dataset spei is commonly used as drought indexes chen et al 2020a zhong et al 2021 which is calculated based on the difference between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration and reflects the water deficit or excess in a region within a certain period the parameter potential evapotranspiration is derived by the fao 56 penman monteith method positive spei values represent wetter conditions while negative values represent drier conditions the classification of dry and wet conditions based on spei is shown in table 3 chen et al 2020b xu et al 2015 in this study we used a global monthly spei product provided by begueria et al 2010 which is available online https hdl handle net 10261 153475 this spei dataset was calculated based on the cru ts 3 24 01 climate data with a spatial resolution of 0 5 0 5 and we selected the data covering the period 1976 2015 2 3 methods 2 3 1 dwaa chen et al 2020b quantified dwaa events of china by defining the dry month and the wet month based on spei given that spei 1 and spei 1 are the thresholds between dry wet and normal conditions respectively and that choosing 1 as the thresholds could yield a suitable sample size table 3 table 4 the dry month was indicated by spei value less than or equal to 1 while the wet month was expressed by spei value greater than or equal to 1 in this study chen et al 2020b therefore dwaa events represented the abrupt alternation between dry and wet conditions in adjacent months dwaa events included two types d w alternation events and w d alternation events fig 2 adjacent months a dry month turning into a wet month is a d w alternation event while a wet month shifting to a dry month is a w d alternation event in addition given the turning point of precipitation around the 1990 s hu et al 2016 li et al 2015b we divided the whole study period into two periods and then analyzed the spatial and temporal variability in dwaa events between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 2 3 2 mann kendall test the mann kendall test was adopted to detect time series trends of climate variables kendall 1990 mann 1945 this method is a non parametric test which is suitable for data that do not follow the standard distribution pattern and is less sensitive to sporadic outliers sneyers 1990 it has been widely used and recommended by the world meteorological organization to examine trends in hydrological and meteorological data li and ye 2015 shan et al 2018 xu and tang 2021 in this study a p value 0 05 was considered to be statistically significant 3 results 3 1 spatial variations of precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and spei fig 3 illustrates the spatial patterns of trends in precipitation temperature potential evapotranspiration and average spei over the glrca during the period 1976 2015 over the entire study period variation in precipitation had large spatial heterogeneity approximately 64 5 of the study area exhibited a trend of increase in precipitation primarily in the cold climate zone a decrease in precipitation mainly occurred in the arid climate zone of the west accounting for 35 5 of the study area furthermore all regions showed an obvious warming trend and all passed the significance test at 0 05 the greater increase in temperature greater than0 040 c yr mainly occurred in the west there was a similar spatial pattern of temperature and potential evapotranspiration during 1976 2015 the entire study area was subject to increasing potential evapotranspiration with 75 2 of the area being significant p 0 05 a greater increase greater than0 073 mm yr was observed predominantly in the arid climate zone for the entire period 1976 2015 approximately 58 0 of the study area was subject to an increasing trend in average spei with 24 7 being significant at 0 05 which further indicated a tendency to wetter in most of the glrca then approximately 42 0 of the study area showed a decreasing trend in average spei and the greater decrease 0 008 yr occurred primarily in the southwest 3 2 spatial variations of the maximum spei and minimum spei to investigate the interannual trends of the driest and wettest months of the year we analyzed the spatial distribution of trends in maximum spei and minimum spei over the glrca during 1976 2015 fig 4 from 1976 to 2015 approximately 49 2 of the study area showed an increasing trend in maximum spei with 19 5 being significant p 0 05 approximately 50 8 of the study area showed a decreasing trend in maximum spei with 22 4 being significant p 0 05 by contrast minimum spei generally increased across most 56 8 of the study area during the period 1976 2015 the most pronounced increase greater than0 004 yr in minimum spei was primarily observed in the east of the study area while the greater decrease 0 008 yr in minimum spei occurred mainly in the bwk climate zone 3 3 spatial distribution of the number of wet months and dry months to examine the relative change in wet months and dry months over the glrca we compared the change in the number of wet months and drought months between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 fig 5 over the period 1976 1995 the frequency of wet months greater than 60 months accounted for 10 2 of the study area mainly in the bwk climate zone in comparison during the period 1996 2015 the regions with wet months frequency greater than 60 months represented 10 1 and were more scattered however for the number of wet months 40 months the percentage was 13 1 and 20 6 for the periods 1976 1995 and 1996 2015 respectively greater frequency of drought months more than 55 occupied 4 0 of the study area for the periods 1976 1995 mainly distributed in the northeast while during 1996 2015 approximately 9 7 of the study area experienced greater than 55 months primarily in the southwest of the arid climate zone an obviously increasing trend of dry months was examined in the southwest of the glrca during 1976 1995 16 9 of the study area experienced 35 dry months predominantly in the south meanwhile 23 3 of the study area occurred with 35 dry months over the period 1996 2015 3 4 spatial and temporal variation of the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events fig 6 shows the changes in spatial distribution of the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events over the glrca during 1976 1995 and 1996 2015 for the period 1976 1995 a greater frequency of d w alternation events more than 11 was observed in 12 0 of the study area and was more widely distributed in contrast only 4 9 of the study area experienced greater than 11 d w alternation events from 1996 to 2015 and was mainly distributed in the in small regions of the southwest and north overall the frequency of d w alternation events was decreased in 1996 2015 compared to 1976 1995 in contrast for the number of w d alternation events greater than 11 months 4 5 and 6 9 of the study area were covered during 1976 1995 and 1996 2015 respectively furthermore the regions where more frequent w d alternation events occurred have clearly changed spatially for 1996 2015 the regions with more than 11 w d alternation events were mainly located in the bwk climate zone to examine interannual variation in dwaa events we further analyzed the relative changes in the number of d w alternation events and w d alternation events based on pixels fig 7 at the regional scale d w alternation events showed a decreasing trend at a rate of 4 671 yr over the entire study period with opposite trends in 1976 1995 and 1996 2015 during 1976 1995 d w alternation events decreased at a rate of 4 938 yr whereas they were increased at a rate of 16 324 yr from 1996 to 2015 for w d alternation events their trends were relatively consistent with the trends of d w alternation events at a regional scale w d alternation events exhibited a slight decreasing trend at a rate of 1 876 yr in the entire study period with two opposite trends between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 for the period 1976 1995 w d alternation events decreased at a rate of 10 396 yr at a regional scale then after 1995 w d alternation events showed an increasing trend at a rate of 6 907 yr 3 5 month of the occurrence of d w alternation events and w d alternation events to understand the timing of the occurrence of d w alternation events and w d alternation events in the glrca we counted the percentage frequency of months in which d w alternation events and w d alternation events occurred between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 respectively fig 8 over the period 1976 1995 d w alternation events concentrated in march april october november and november december accounting for 12 4 14 3 and 11 6 respectively however w d alternation events appeared mainly in february march september october and november december accounting for 10 1 13 1 and 12 3 respectively compared to 1976 1995 there was also a noticeable change in the months of occurrence of d w alternation events and w d alternation events in 1996 2015 during 1996 2015 d w alternation events mostly occurred in january february june july and august september representing 12 3 13 0 and 10 4 respectively while w d alternation events were mainly found in july august august september and november december with a percentage of 11 4 12 3 and 13 2 respectively as shown in fig 7 and fig 8 dwaa events showed a decreasing trend over the entire study period especially for w d alternation events of september october and d w alternation events of october november to further understand the reasons for the changes in dwaa events we analyzed the variations of wet and dry conditions in september october and november based on spei fig 9 in september and october most regions exhibited a decreasing trend in spei accounting for 78 9 and 72 2 of the study area respectively and the greater decrease 0 015 yr was observed mostly in the central region of kazakhstan however approximately 63 7 of the study area was subject to a positive trend for spei in november and 20 7 passed the significance test at the 0 05 level in november the greater increase greater than0 015 yr in spei was primarily in the south and northeast of the study area 4 discussion in this study we investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of dwaa events based on spei in the glrca during the period 1976 2015 given that drought is a major factor affecting vegetation productivity and ecosystem carbon cycling at regional and global scales wang et al 2021b we first analyzed the dry and wet variability in the glrca using spei during the entire study period most of the study area was observed an increasing spei indicating a wetting trend meanwhile many studies revealed that total precipitation in the glrca has increased in recent decades and increased precipitation provided favorable conditions for vegetation growth jiang et al 2017 li et al 2015b yao et al 2021 the significant trend of drying occurred mainly in the southwest especially around the aral sea jiang et al 2019 suggested that drought caused by decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature was the major driver of desertification expansion in the southwest of the glrca with climate change short term droughts or heavy rainfalls with extreme spei values are often considered as extreme weather and climate events and their variability can lead to greater damage than the average spei variability ta et al 2018 wang et al 2021c therefore we further analyzed the interannual trend in maximum spei and minimum spei given the limitations of the average spei the maximum spei and the minimum spei are closely related to the growth and distribution of vegetation and changes in these values may indicate changes in ecosystem structure and function deng et al 2021 pei et al 2021 during the entire study period maximum spei and minimum spei all showed large spatial heterogeneity in the glrca for example in the central region of kazakhstan the driest months showed a trend towards wetting while the wettest months indicated a trend towards drying the observed increase in the minimum spei may alleviate the drought limitation of plant growth deng et al 2020 to further examine the climate change in the glrca we used spei to characterize dry months wet months and dwaa events an increase in the number of wet months was mainly observed in the north and southeast and the number of dry months increased mainly in the southwest liu et al 2021 found that meteorological drought risk was highest in the southwest glrca and flood risk was highest in the southeast glrca over the last decades which further confirms the results of this study in addition the increase in wet months and decrease in dry months over the eastern of the study area might be closely related to the increase in total precipitation in the region yao et al 2021 the increase in wet months may be accompanied by an increase in extreme precipitation which in turn not only may increase risk of flooding but also has a greater effect on terrestrial ecosystems in the glrca liu et al 2021 luo et al 2020 yao et al 2021 luo et al 2020 found a significant positive correlation between ndvi and extreme precipitation in the glrca at the monthly scale during the entire study period both d w alternation events and w d alternation events exhibited a decrease in 1976 1995 and an increase in 1996 2015 at the regional scale which was opposite to the interannual trend in precipitation hu et al 2016 li et al 2015b dwaa is a compound event of heavy rainfall and drought and increased precipitation in the glrca not only triggered more heavy rainfall events but also reduced drought events liu et al 2021 yang et al 2020 moreover precipitation in the glrca is mainly distributed in spring and the irregularity of precipitation could highly cause the variability in dwaa events chen et al 2018 xu et al 2016 spatially d w alternation events decreased significantly in the east of kazakhstan while dry months increased in the region wet months decreased thus resulting in a decrease in d w alternation events w d alternation events were observed to increase noticeably in the southwestern bwk climate zone which was mainly attributed to an increase in dry months meanwhile we found a greater decrease in w d alternation events occurring mainly in september october meanwhile we found that the decrease in w d alternation events occurred mainly in september october the drought trend in september and october contribute to the increased dry months of september and the decreased wet months of october respectively which in turn explains the decrease in w d alternation events frequent dwaa events could have substantial adverse effects on agricultural production and economic development gao et al 2019 huang et al 2019 tian et al 2016 wang et al 2021a dwaa events in the glrca occurred mainly in spring and autumn which are critical periods for most vegetation growth and crop harvest yuan et al 2021 several studies revealed that vegetation growth in dwaa differs from those in drought and heavy rainfall stress alone because vegetation has different patterns of adaptation to soil water deficit or soil water excess respectively huang et al 2019 zhang et al 2021 to a certain extent a heavy rainfall during a drought can stimulate ecosystem processes and promote vegetation growth in arid and semi arid regions hoover et al 2022 however severe d w alternation events may leave vegetation in a flooded condition and result in a significant reduction in vegetation productivity due to root hypoxia and reduced respiration kramer et al 2008 for example yields of those crops maize with less tolerance to flood will be largely decreased bi et al 2020 meanwhile a sudden shift from drought to heavy rainfall may induce heavy flooding and intensify soil erosion causing landslides and massive house collapses especially in the eastern mountainous regions wang et al 2021a zhang et al 2015 w d alternating events are usually accompanied by a sudden deficit of soil water which could reduce vegetation respiration and thus trigger ecosystem degradation and grain losses shi et al 2021a over the entire study period w d alternating events occurred mainly in the west of the study area which is primarily an arid climate zone frequent w d alternating events increased the vulnerability of the region s ecosystems and contributed to the significant degradation of the region s vegetation during recent years dwaa is a comprehensive effect of climate change and many factors cause dwaa events including meteorological factors and atmospheric circulation chen et al 2020b fang et al 2019 shan et al 2018 yang et al 2013 several studies have confirmed a strong correlation between dwaa events and the precipitation chen et al 2020a chen et al 2020b shi et al 2021a precipitation in the glrca is mainly derived from the westerly circulation and indian monsoon bothe et al 2012 in recent years dynamic and thermodynamic climate changes have triggered significant variations in glrca precipitation emori and brown 2005 li et al 2015b the anomalous cyclone associated with enhanced horizontal vorticity increased the water vapor flux of westerly thereby contributing to the increased precipitation in northern kazakhstan emori and brown 2005 peng and zhou 2017 rising sst in the western pacific ocean caused negative pressure anomalies over the indian ocean and reduced water vapor transport which may be the main driver of decreased precipitation in the southern glrca yang et al 2020 precipitation variability induced frequent heavy rainfall and drought events especially near the aral sea liu et al 2021 yang et al 2020 consequently contributing to an increase in dwaa events across the southwest glrca under global warming a comprehensive assessment of variations in dwaa events is important for predicting future climate change and will be helpful for decision making in implementing ecological restoration and conservation in arid and semi arid regions 5 conclusions this study investigated the temporal and spatial characteristics of the dwaa events over the glrca based spei 1 during 1976 2015 the increase in precipitation over the glrca mainly occurred in the east while the decrease in precipitation mainly occurred in the west all regions showed an obvious increasing trend in temperature and potential evapotranspiration additionally the study area exhibited an overall wet trend and an intense drought trend was mainly in the southwest 2 the frequency of wet months increased in the west and southeast regions and decreased in the central region for 1996 2015 compared to 1976 1995 in addition a noticeable increase in dry months was observed in the southwest while a decrease was observed in the southeast during 1996 2015 compared to 1976 1995 3 although both d w alternation events and w d alternation events showed a slightly decreasing trend at the regional scale there are two clearly opposite trends between 1976 and 1995 and 1996 2015 with a decrease in 1976 1995 and an increase in 1996 2015 spatially a significant increase in the frequency of d w alternation events and w d alternation events was observed in the southwest of the study area 4 for 1976 1995 d w alternation events occurred mainly in march april and october november while w d alternation events appeared mainly in february march and september october during 1996 2015 d w alternation events mostly occurred in january february and june july while w d alternation events were mainly found in july august and august september declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they

2899,runoff prediction in ungauged catchments is an important and challenging research topic in the field of hydrology however traditional parameter regionalization methods may not be applicable in regions with sparsely distributed hydrological stations remote sensing rs evapotranspiration et products provide valuable information for model parameter estimations this study aimed to improve the accuracy of hydrological modeling in ungauged catchments by combining the traditional spatial proximity sp method with the rs et based parameter calibration method to form a two step calibration based regionalization method sp bcet method using bias corrected rs et data and sp rawet method using raw rs et data the proposed regionalization scheme is demonstrated by using the variable infiltration capacity model in the yangtze river basin china and its performance was evaluated and compared with the sp method and two rs et based parameter calibration schemes bcet method using bias corrected rs et data and rawet method using raw rs et data the results indicate that the bcet method performs better than the rawet method the sp method outperforms the rs et based parameter calibration method and the sp bcet and sp rawet methods achieve the best overall performance among the five methods taking the simulated streamflow at a daily scale in the calibration period as an example the average nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency for the sp bcet rawet sp bcet and sp rawet methods were 0 69 0 61 0 56 0 71 and 0 71 respectively moreover the sp bcet and sp rawet methods improved the simulation of the temporal dynamics and spatial variability of soil moisture anomalies the accuracy of the rs et data was one of the most dominant factors affecting the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme the sp bcet method is expected to perform better than the sp method in warmer catchments or when gauged catchments are sparely distributed the findings demonstrate the great potential of combining the traditional parameter regionalization and rs et based parameter calibration methods in hydrological simulations in ungauged catchments keywords parameter regionalization

hydrological models are the most efficient tools for understanding hydrological processes from the basin to the global scale playing important roles in many fields such as water resource management flood forecasting and drought monitoring kittel et al 2020 mizukami et al 2017 xiong and zeng 2019 yang et al 2019b generally all hydrological models must be calibrated to obtain reliable simulation results beck et al 2020 kittel et al 2020 yang et al 2019b given the better availability of streamflow than other hydrological variables hydrological models are generally calibrated by improving the consistency between the simulated and observed streamflow at the outlet of the target catchment beck et al 2020 yang et al 2019b however hydrological stations are sparsely distributed and there are many ungauged catchments worldwide causing the inapplicability of this parameter calibration method to large contiguous domains mizukami et al 2017 currently the estimation of hydrological model parameters in ungauged catchments remains one of the most important and challenging tasks in hydrological science guo et al 2021 he et al 2011 mizukami et al 2017 to address this issue parameter regionalization methods have been discussed and used in many studies to estimate spatially distributed hydrological parameters in ungauged catchments arsenault et al 2019 beck et al 2020 beck et al 2016 kittel et al 2020 oudin et al 2008 rojas serna et al 2016 samaniego et al 2010 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2019a parameter regionalization methods are designed to transfer hydrological parameters calibrated in gauged donor catchments to ungauged target catchments and then predict runoff in ungauged ones arsenault et al 2019 beck et al 2020 guo et al 2021 kittel et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the most widely used parameter regionalization methods in the literature are the spatial proximity sp physical similarity ps and multiple regression based mr methods arsenault et al 2019 guo et al 2021 he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 rojas serna et al 2016 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2019a the sp method assumes that geographically adjacent catchments have similar rainfall runoff characteristics the basic idea behind the ps method is that catchments with similar attributes have similar hydrological responses the sp and ps methods directly transfer complete parameter sets from geographically adjacent or physically similar gauged catchments to ungauged catchments the mr method assumes that a good relationship exists between the catchment attributes and model parameters the regression functions between catchment descriptors and calibrated model parameters from gauged catchments are transferred to ungauged ones and then used to estimate their model parameters many comparative studies have been conducted on these three regionalization approaches in recent years for example oudin et al 2008 compared the regionalization methods based on 913 french catchments bao et al 2012 compared regression based and similarity based approaches ps and sp methods in 55 catchments with multiple hydro climatic conditions in china arsenault et al 2019 investigated the performance of these three methods on 30 diverse catchments in mexico using three hydrological models yang et al 2020 evaluated these methods or their modified forms using four hydrological models in 86 catchments in norway under different climatic conditions there is still no clear conclusion regarding the comparative performance of these regionalization methods because of the large differences in climatic conditions hydrological models and density of gauged catchments among different studies parajka et al 2013 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2019a however in most cases the sp method performs better than or comparable to other regionalization methods particularly when a dense network of donor catchments is available guo et al 2021 kittel et al 2020 li et al 2014 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2013 yang et al 2020 with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing rs technology rs based data have become available and have been gradually used in hydrological model parameter estimation in ungauged catchments because of their advantages of large scale coverage and easy access dembélé et al 2020b demirel et al 2018 herman et al 2018 huang et al 2020 jiang and wang 2019 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 compared to the traditional streamflow based parameter calibration method the rs data based parameter calibration method may reduce the uncertainty associated with lumped calibration through parameterization for each grid huang et al 2020 as one of the most critical components of the hydrological cycle evapotranspiration et plays an important role in the water and energy balance and can be added to the calibration process because accurate et estimation in a hydrological model can lead to better simulation of other hydrological components such as runoff and soil moisture herman et al 2018 jiang and wang 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore the performance of rs et data in hydrological parameter calibration has gained significant attention in recent literature for example kunnath poovakka et al 2016 examined the capability of rs et and soil moisture data in hydrological model calibration and concluded that calibration with accurate et attributes accurately predicted streamflow zhang et al 2020 explored the potential of model parameters calibrated against rs et data for runoff prediction and found that this approach can reasonably predict monthly runoff in wetter catchments huang et al 2020 proposed a comprehensive framework with seven rs et based calibration schemes to predict runoff in 30 catchments in the yalong river basin and their results showed that bias corrected rs et data have great potential in hydrological model parameter estimation dembélé et al 2020a evaluated 12 et datasets for their potential to improve the performance of hydrological modeling using four distinct multivariate calibration strategies and found that et datasets help improve model calibration based on the calibration strategy the findings of these studies add to the growing evidence that rs et data have broad prospects in model parameter calibration for hydrological parameter calibration rs et products can be used in combination with the observed streamflow dembélé et al 2020b herman et al 2018 hulsman et al 2021 kunnath poovakka et al 2018 sirisena et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 or used alone dembélé et al 2020a huang et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the former method is inapplicable to ungauged catchments because the observed streamflow is unavailable the latter method is more suitable for parameter estimation in ungauged catchments however this method is still limited in practice first the applicability of model parameters calibrated against rs et is closely related to the accuracy of the data dembélé et al 2020a jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 however the quality of rs et data is not always guaranteed as et cannot be measured directly by satellites demirel et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 and the parameters calibrated solely against rs et may have great uncertainty moreover there may be some hydrological parameters that are not sensitive to et but are essential for accurate streamflow simulations kunnath poovakka et al 2016 kunnath poovakka et al 2018 for example kunnath poovakka et al 2016 conducted a parameter sensitivity procedure and found nine parameters with higher sensitivity to three target hydrological variables however only five were calibrated against et and soil moisture for streamflow prediction herman et al 2018 identified ten soil and water assessment tool swat model parameters that influence et calculations and changed only four parameters during the et calibration process in the study by jiang et al 2020 all six parameters of the variable infiltration capacity vic model were calibrated using the observed streamflow but only four parameters that showed significant influence on et were calibrated using et data in the study by zhang et al 2021 the et related and streamflow related parameters were calibrated separately based on et and streamflow data in summary for a specific hydrological model not all hydrological parameters can be calibrated solely against rs et data making this method inapplicable to ungauged catchments as several parameters have little sensitivity to et simulation and cannot be determined accurately thus traditional parameter regionalization methods may not obtain satisfactory results in areas with very limited or sparsely distributed streamflow stations but spatially and temporally explicit rs et data can potentially help in these regions however the rs et based parameter calibration method is still significantly limited in ungauged catchments at present researchers are confined to comparing the performance of the rs et based parameter calibration method with traditional parameter regionalization methods e g huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge no studies have been designed to investigate the benefits of combining the two methods which may further improve the accuracy of model parameter estimation or runoff prediction in ungauged catchments this study aimed to improve the accuracy of hydrological modeling in ungauged catchments by combining the rs et based parameter calibration method with the traditional parameter regionalization approach specifically we proposed a two step parameter calibration framework based on streamflow and rs et by first calibrating parameters based on observed streamflow and then adjusting parameters derived from the sp method using rs et data the sp method was selected as a representative of the traditional parameter regionalization approach in this study because of its good performance among the three widely used parameter regionalization methods arsenault et al 2019 li et al 2014 oudin et al 2008 qi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 to demonstrate this framework we applied the proposed parameter regionalization method to the yangtze river basin yrb in china using the vic model this study includes the following i a comparison of the relative performance of the rs et based parameter calibration and traditional parameter regionalization methods i e sp method in this study for hydrological simulation in ungauged catchments ii comparison of the performance of the bias corrected and raw rs et data in parameter calibration regionalization iii evaluation of the added values through combining the rs et based parameter calibration and sp methods in hydrological simulations of ungauged catchments 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yrb fig 1 originates from the tanggula range in the qinghai tibet plateau and is the longest river in asia and the third longest river in the world with a length of approximately 6300 km the yrb traverses 11 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government from west to east with a drainage of approximately 1 8 106 km2 which accounts for 18 8 of the area in china https www cjw gov cn zjzx lypgk zjly most parts of the yrb are dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate except for several areas of the tibetan plateau with an average annual air temperature of approximately 14 c and precipitation of approximately 1100 mm zhang et al 2016 et is an important component of water balance in the yrb as approximately half of the precipitation returns to the atmosphere via evaporation processes zhang et al 2016 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data required to force the vic hydrological model and calculate potential et included precipitation air temperature sunshine duration pressure specific humidity and wind speed precipitation air temperature and sunshine duration from 322 meteorological stations fig 1 a within and around the yrb provided by the national meteorological science data center nmsdc https data cma cn were interpolated into a 5 5 km spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighted idw method this is one of the best methods for interpolating data from the nmsdc wu et al 2007 the influence of elevation on precipitation was not considered however the influence of elevation on air temperature was considered using the relationship of a 0 65 c temperature decrease per elevation increase of 100 m xu et al 2021 pressure specific humidity and wind speed were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd which is a gridded meteorological dataset with a temporal resolution of three hours and a spatial resolution of 0 1 he et al 2020 the raw cmfd was downscaled from the original spatial resolution to 5 5 km to match the hydrological model resolution using bilinear interpolation 2 2 2 observed streamflow and soil moisture daily streamflow and in situ soil moisture datasets were obtained from the information center hydrological monitor and forecast center ministry of water resources p r china we collected streamflow data for 50 hydrological stations in the yrb and their corresponding catchment areas ranging from 562 km2 to 14484 km2 with an average drainage area of 5157 2 km2 in total 823 soil moisture stations within the yrb were selected for this study the length of the records of soil moisture observations ranged from 106 to 4128 with an average of 1314 observational values for each station from january 2008 to november 2020 the soil moisture was measured at three different depths 10 20 and 40 cm for comparison with the vic simulated soil moisture the observed values at the three depths were integrated to 0 40 cm and then translated to volumetric water content using the soil bulk density of each 5 km grid the data quality of the in situ soil moisture observations was reliable and has been used in previous studies to validate simulated and satellite based soil moisture wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 2 2 3 remote sensing evapotranspiration data the daily surface energy balance based global land et hereafter referred to as eb et with a spatial resolution of 0 05 was obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center ntpdc https data tpdc ac cn the newly improved surface energy balance system sebs algorithm by chen et al 2013 and chen et al 2019 was used to generate the data moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land surface temperature normalized difference vegetation index global forest height and globalbedo data were used in the et calculation the eb et dataset is a global dataset spanning from 2000 to 2017 and the eb et data have been evaluated using ground based observations chen et al 2021 water balance based et values and the performance in hydrological model parameter estimation guo et al 2022 both studies confirmed that the eb et dataset has high accuracy and good potential for parameter calibration moreover compared with other rs et products the eb et data have a relatively high spatiotemporal resolution which helps to reduce the impact of spatial scale mismatch between rs et and simulated et on parameter regionalization et data from january 1 2001 to december 31 2010 were used in this study 3 methodology 3 1 bias correction of remote sensing evapotranspiration given that rs et data may have a systematic bias to improve their applicability in parameter regionalization rs et was bias corrected using the method proposed by huang et al 2020 fu s equation fu 1981 based on the budyko hypothesis was adopted to calculate the mean annual actual et according to fu s equation the relationship between mean annual actual et mm yr potential et pet mm yr and precipitation p mm yr can be expressed as follows 1 et p p e t p 1 pet p α 1 α where α is an empirical parameter that can reflect climate and catchment characteristics huang et al 2017 shao et al 2012 pet is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and is estimated using the penman monteith method further details on the calculation of the pet can be found in huang et al 2020 for a closed catchment the change in water storage is negligible and the mean annual et is equal to the difference between the mean annual precipitation and streamflow over a long period therefore the mean annual streamflow based on fu s equation is expressed as follows 2 q fu p 1 pet p α 1 α p e t where qfu is the mean annual streamflow mm yr parameter α was estimated by fitting the mean annual observed streamflow potential evapotranspiration and precipitation from 50 catchments using the least squares method following the study of huang et al 2020 the procedure of the rs et bias correction is as follows first the fitted α is used for each 5 km 5 km grid that is fu s equation estimated mean annual et at each grid from 2001 to 2010 is calculated by substituting the fitted α grid mean annual precipitation and pet into eq 1 then the daily bias corrected eb et at each grid is obtained by multiplying the raw eb et by the ratio between the mean annual et calculated using fu s equation and the mean annual raw eb et at each grid 3 2 the vic hydrological model the vic model developed by liang et al 1994 1996 is a large scale distributed hydrological model that simultaneously solves the water and energy balances within each grid cell the key characteristics of the vic model are the representation of multiple land cover types and the spatial variability of the soil moisture capacity in the vic model each cell is modeled separately and the grid cells do not interact with each other which makes it possible to calibrate the parameters of the model using grid based data moreover each grid cell is subdivided into spatial fractions that represent different land cover types it uses a spatial probability distribution function to represent the subgrid variability of soil moisture storage capacity and provide a more realistic representation of hydrological processes the vic model estimates et as the sum of three components evaporation from the canopy storage transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from the bare soil surface a schematic of the three layer structure used in the vic model is shown in fig 2 in this study the vic model was run on a daily scale with a spatial resolution of 5 5 km four parameter categories must be determined before running the vic model geographical parameters were determined using meteorological data provided by the nmsdc the location of each grid cell and the shuttle radar topography mission srtm global elevation data https earthexplorer usgs gov for each grid vegetation parameters were derived from the modis land cover classification and leaf area index datasets https modis gsfc nasa gov data the dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling over china dai et al 2013 from the ntpdc was used to define soil parameters the vic model includes eight hydrological parameters with the exception of the exponent used in baseflow curve c normally set to 2 n a and the thickness of the first soil moisture layer d1 normally set to 0 1 m the other six hydrological parameters are difficult to directly determine and must be calibrated using observed streamflow or estimated using regionalization methods these parameters include the variable infiltration curve parameter infilt n a maximum velocity of the baseflow dsmax mm day fraction of dsmax where nonlinear baseflow begins ds fraction fraction of maximum soil moisture where nonlinear baseflow occurs ws fraction and the thickness of the second and third soil moisture layers d2 and d3 m to calibrate hydrological parameters based on observed streamflow and evaluate the performance of the parameter regionalization method against observed streamflow the vic model modeled grid based runoff and baseflow were routed to the outlet of the basin using the large scale routing model lrm developed by lu et al 2015 lu et al 2015 demonstrated that the lrm has satisfactory performance both in simulating the streamflow at the outlet and its spatial distribution in the yrb to initiate the model state the vic and routing models were pre run for two years before the calibration period the length of the calibration period ranged from 8 to 11 years with an average of 9 6 years and that of the validation period ranged from 2 to 9 years with an average of 4 6 years in the following sections the performances of different parameter calibration regionalization methods in runoff prediction are compared in the calibration and validation periods respectively 3 3 parameter calibration and regionalization scheme in this study we proposed a two step calibration based parameter regionalization scheme that combines the sp and rs et based parameter calibration methods and its performance was evaluated and compared with those methods therefore the aforementioned three types of parameter regionalization methods are introduced in this section the workflow of this study is shown in fig 3 3 3 1 spatial proximity method the first step of the traditional parameter regionalization method is to calibrate the model parameters in selected gauged catchments independently using the observed streamflow at the outlet in this study the six hydrological parameters in each of the selected gauged catchments were optimized using the rosenbrock algorithm rosenbrock 1960 by improving the consistency between the simulated and observed streamflow consistency was measured using the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse and relative error re 3 nse 1 i 1 n si m i o b s i 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 4 re i 1 n si m i o b s i i 1 n ob s i 100 where simi and obsi are the simulated and observed values sim and obs are the mean values of simi and obsi and n is the number of samples first we produced parameter values for each grid cell using the sp method five nearest donor catchments were selected based on the findings of previous studies arsenault et al 2019 guo et al 2021 qi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 we used the distances between the catchment and grid centroids to determine the five nearest donor catchments for each grid cell the parameters for each grid were estimated as follows 5 p a k j g 1 5 p a k g 1 d j g 2 g 1 5 1 d j g 2 where pak j is the value of hydrological parameter k in grid j from sp method pak g is the value of hydrological parameter k in gauged catchment g and dj g is the distance between grid j and gauged catchment g grid based hydrological parameters calculated using the sp method have two primary roles first the simulated results based on these parameters were used as the baseline to test whether the proposed parameter regionalization method performs better than the traditional regionalization method second the grid based hydrological parameters from the sp method were used as the initial parameter field in our proposed method and these parameters were subsequently adjusted by the rs et data grid by grid 3 3 2 rs et based parameter calibration method in contrast to the streamflow based parameter calibration method in which all the grids in the catchment have the same set of parameter values the rs et based parameter calibration method is conducted at each grid that is each grid has its own set of parameter values in this study two separate calibration schemes were considered the first calibration scheme uses bias corrected eb et data for parameter calibration whereas the second calibration scheme uses raw eb et data for parameter calibration the objective functions of the two separate calibration schemes are expressed as follows 6 f j 1 1 n i 1 n e t i j vic e t i j bias c o r r e c t e d e t 2 7 f j 2 1 n i 1 n e t i j vic e t j vic e t i j raw e t e t j raw e t 2 where n is the total number of data e t i j vic and e t i j bias c o r r e c t e d e t represent the vic simulated et and bias corrected eb et for grid j at time i respectively e t i j raw e t is raw eb et data e t j vic and e t j raw e t represent the mean values of the vic estimates and raw eb et for grid j respectively the objective function in eq 6 is the root mean square error rmse between the vic simulated et and bias corrected eb et the rmse and its transformation have been widely used as a component of the objective function in previous studies on rs et based hydrological parameter calibration kunnath poovakka et al 2016 kunnath poovakka et al 2018 yang et al 2021 the objective function in eq 6 reflects the calibration of the temporal dynamics and magnitude of the vic simulated et the objective function in eq 7 is the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse between the vic simulated et and raw eb et the ubrmse removes the bias from the rmse and is more suitable for describing the random error of the target variable wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 i e et in this study therefore the objective function in eq 7 also contributes to overcoming the influence of potential systematic errors in raw eb et on parameter calibration to a certain extent before parameter calibration using eb et data a simple sensitivity analysis method proposed by zhou et al 2020 was adopted to identify the sensitivity of the vic et to variations in the six hydrological parameters as shown in fig 4 parameters dsmax and d2 have the most significant influence on the simulated et followed by the parameters ds and ws and the simulated et has little sensitivity to parameters infilt and d3 in this study six hydrological parameters of the vic model are calibrated by the abovementioned rs et based parameter calibration schemes as the variations of these parameters affect the simulated et to varying extents and only in this way can the et based parameter calibration method be compared with other parameter regionalization methods 3 3 3 two step calibration based parameter regionalization method in this study the proposed two step calibration based parameter regionalization scheme can be summarized in the following three steps 1 parameter calibration based on observed streamflow at the catchment scale 2 parameter regionalization from the catchment scale to the grid scale based on the sp method and 3 correction of the parameter from the sp method based on et data at the grid scale the first two steps are described in section 3 3 1 in the process of parameter regionalization from the catchment scale to the grid scale based on the sp method we also calculated the standard deviation of each hydrological parameter in each grid based on the corresponding hydrological parameter values from the five nearest gauged catchments as follows 8 st d k j g 1 5 p a k g p a k 5 where stdk j is the standard deviation of the hydrological parameter k in grid j based on the corresponding hydrological parameter values from the five nearest gauged catchments pak g is the value of hydrological parameter k in gauged catchment g and p a k is the mean value of pak g for a specific hydrological parameter a higher standard deviation may indicate that this parameter has larger spatial heterogeneity during the parameter correction based on the eb et data the variation for hydrological parameter k in grid j ranges from p a min k j to p a max k j and can be expressed as follows 9 p a min k j maximum p a k j a s t d k j p a min k 10 p a max k j minimum p a k j a s t d k j p a max k where p a min k j and p a max k j are the lower and upper bounds for hydrological parameter k in grid j for the two step calibration scheme a is the coefficient of the standard deviation and the influence of a on the results of parameter regionalization is discussed further in section 4 2 2 p a min k and p a max k are the initial lower and upper bounds for hydrological parameter k that is the lower and upper bounds of hydrological parameter k for parameter calibration based on the observed streamflow at the catchment scale or eb et at the grid scale similar to the rs et based parameter calibration method two separate correction schemes were considered based on the rs et data for both schemes the six hydrological parameters in each grid j were automatically optimized using the rosenbrock algorithm by minimizing f j 3 or f j 4 which are the objective functions of the proposed regionalization method and are given by 11 f j 3 1 n i 1 n e t i j vic e t i j bias c o r r e c t e d e t 2 r c j r c j ini and 12 f j 4 1 n i 1 n e t i j vic e t j vic e t i j raw e t e t j raw e t 2 r c j r c j ini r c j and r c j ini are the runoff coefficients simulated by the vic model using the parameters from the parameter correction and sp methods prior to the correction the first term in eqs 11 and 12 is the same as that in eqs 6 and 7 because the parameter correction procedure in this study is based on the parameters from the sp method we assumed that the magnitude of the simulated streamflow using parameters from the sp method is reliable therefore the second term in eqs 11 and 12 attempts to reduce the potential bias in the modeled runoff caused by the parameter correction procedure all parameter regionalization methods compared in this study are summarized in table 1 3 4 evaluation of the parameter calibration and regionalization schemes the performance of five parameter calibration regionalization schemes in hydrological simulations was compared and validated based on observed streamflow and soil moisture leave one out cross validation technology was used in the assessment arsenault et al 2019 razavi and coulibaly 2013 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2019a and performed as follows during the validation each catchment was considered as a pseudo ungauged catchment and the proposed regionalization or sp methods were subsequently applied to this catchment the simulated streamflow was evaluated using nse and re for soil moisture the standardized values reflect anomaly characteristics of soil moisture and have been widely used in soil moisture evaluation jung et al 2019 drought analysis xu et al 2018 and soil moisture merging zhou et al 2021 therefore the standardized soil moisture values calculated on a grid by grid station by station basis rather than their absolute values were used to compare the performance of the five parameter calibration regionalization schemes the correlation coefficient cc and rmse between the standardized values of the simulated and observed soil moistures were computed at both temporal and spatial scales in this study because the length of records of observed soil moisture at different stations may vary significantly the evaluation at the spatial scale was conducted only for days with at least 400 data points approximately 50 0 of the stations available cc and rmse are defined as follows 13 cc i 1 n si m i sim ob s i obs i 1 n si m i sim 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n si m i o b s 2 where simi and obsi are the standardized values of the simulated and observed soil moistures sim and obs are the mean values of simi and obsi respectively and n is the number of samples 4 results 4 1 estimation and validation of the parameter in fu s equation in this study the mean annual streamflow during the calibration period of each typical catchment was used to determine the parameter α in fu s equation α 1 58 the rationality of the parameter α was analyzed using the mean annual streamflow in the validation period of each typical catchment as shown in fig 5 the estimated annual streamflow using fu s equation is in agreement with the observed annual streamflow with r2 values of 0 81 and 0 89 for the calibration and validation periods respectively this result demonstrates that the estimated parameter α is reasonable and can be used to calculate the actual et value in each grid 4 2 parameter calibration and regionalization 4 2 1 parameter calibration based on observed streamflow the first step of the sp sp bcet and sp rawet methods is to calibrate the hydrological parameters of the vic model against the observed streamflow at the catchment scale box plots of nse and re for the simulated streamflow over the calibration and validation periods are presented in fig 6 simulation results show that the average nse for the calibration and validation periods are 0 76 and 0 74 respectively approximately 82 0 and 68 0 of the total catchments with the nse values are greater than 0 70 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the vic simulations underestimated the streamflow with an average re of 2 8 ranging from 14 5 to 19 8 and 1 6 ranging from 18 5 to 20 8 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the results indicate that the vic model is applicable to the yrb for streamflow simulation and hydrological parameters calibrated against the observed streamflow at the catchment scale are reasonable and therefore can be used in further parameter regionalization 4 2 2 determination of variation range of hydrological parameter as mentioned in section 3 3 3 the variation range for hydrological parameter k in grid j which is determined by the parameter value calculated using the sp method the standard deviation of the parameter values from the five nearest donor catchments and the coefficient of the standard deviation csd must be determined before the parameter correction procedure in this study the csd was set as 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 and that corresponding to the best model performance was used for further analysis fig 7 shows box plots of the nse and re for the simulated streamflow in the calibration period fig 7 a and b and validation period fig 7 c and d with different csds under the two regionalization schemes from which there is no significant difference in terms of nse and re between the sp bcet sp rawet method under different csds indicating that the csd may not be the major factor affecting the applicability of the proposed sp bcet sp rawet method however for the sp bcet method the average nse of the simulated streamflow in 50 typical catchments increased with csd in the calibration and validation periods except for csd 3 0 the sp bcet method performed the best at csd 2 5 with an average nse of 0 71 and 0 70 and an re of 3 1 and 1 7 in the calibration and validation periods respectively for the sp rawet method the absolute value of the average re increased with csd and performed the best at csd 0 5 in terms of re with an average re of 4 0 and 2 4 in the calibration and validation periods respectively but the worst in terms of nse with the lowest average nse of 0 70 and 0 69 in the calibration and validation periods respectively for other csds the average nse are 0 71 and 0 70 in the calibration and validation periods respectively therefore the csd of the sp rawet method was set as 1 0 the overall performance of the sp rawet method was similar to that of the sp bcet method in terms of the average nse however the sp bcet method approximately 3 2 to 3 1 and 1 9 to 1 7 in the calibration and validation periods respectively performed slightly better than the sp rawet method approximately 4 8 to 4 0 and 3 3 to 2 4 in the calibration and validation periods respectively in terms of the average re of the simulated streamflow 4 3 comparison of the five parameter regionalization methods in runoff prediction fig 8 presents the box plots of the nse daily scale a and monthly scale c and re b for the simulated streamflow in the calibration and validation periods using the parameters from the five parameter calibration regionalization methods the simulated monthly streamflow was accumulated from the daily streamflow and the monthly streamflow simulations were generally better than the daily ones the performances of the annual streamflow simulations were not compared because of the relatively short data records before comparing the overall performance of the five regionalization methods we selected three typical catchments the hydrological stations are wudu daoxian and dxitan the locations of these three stations are presented in fig 1 and plotted the time series of the observed and simulated streamflow to determine how the model simulation captured the dynamics and magnitude of the daily or monthly streamflow as shown in fig 9 the simulated streamflow can reflect the dynamics of the observed one in most cases but all the simulated streamflow underestimates the observed one especially for the rawet method at the wudu station the relative performance of different regionalization methods may vary with catchments and timescales for example for nse at wudu station the sp bcet sp rawet sp bcet and rawet methods are the sequences of their performances at daoxian station the sp method performed best on a daily scale whereas the sp bcet method performed best on a monthly scale however at the daxitan station the sp rawet method performed better than the sp bcet method which in turn was better than the rawet method at the daily scale in contrast the sp bcet method performed slightly better than the other four regionalization methods at the monthly scale 4 3 1 comparison between raw et and bias corrected et in parameter calibration as shown in fig 8 the overall performance of the bcet method in runoff prediction was significantly improved compared to the results of the rawet method at the daily scale the average nse for the bcet method in the calibration and validation periods were both 0 61 and the average re were 2 9 and 1 9 respectively however the average nse for the rawet method in the calibration and validation periods was approximately 0 56 and the method also significantly underestimated the streamflow with an average re of 14 4 and 14 7 respectively the bcet method outperformed the rawet method in runoff prediction in approximately 78 64 of the total catchments for nse during the calibration validation period and the absolute value of re in approximately 78 of the total catchments for the bcet method was less than that of the rawet method in both the calibration and validation periods at monthly scale the average nse for the bcet method for the calibration and validation periods were 0 83 and 0 82 and the average nse for the rawet method in both periods were approximately 0 76 respectively these results indicate that systematic bias in the raw rs et data may affect its usability for hydrological parameter estimation and a proper bias correction procedure for the raw rs et data before parameter calibration may be necessary the method of correcting the bias of the rs et data before calibration outperforms the method of removing the influence of the systematic bias in the raw rs et data through a proper objective function 4 3 2 comparison between the sp and rs et based parameter calibration methods as shown in fig 8 the average nse 0 69 for both periods at daily scale 0 87 and 0 85 for the calibration and validation periods at monthly scale of the sp method was larger than those of the bcet and rawet methods the sp method performed slightly better than the bcet method regarding re with an average re of 2 7 and 1 2 in the calibration and validation periods respectively in some catchments for example in approximately 18 0 14 0 of the total catchments in the calibration period on a daily scale the bcet rawet method performed better than the sp method in terms of nse indicating that the rs et based parameter calibration method can perform as well as or even better than the traditional regionalization method for runoff prediction in ungauged catchments in certain regions however the performance of the rs et based parameter calibration method varies significantly across different catchments because of the great uncertainty in its application to runoff prediction in ungauged catchments 4 3 3 the advantages of the two step calibration scheme over the sp and rs et based calibration methods in this section the performance of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods for runoff prediction was compared with the results of the sp and rs et based parameter calibration methods encouragingly the sp bcet and sp rawet methods achieved the best overall performance in terms of nse compared with the other three methods at daily scale fig 8 a at monthly scale the sp bcet method the average nse in the calibration and validation periods were 0 88 and 0 86 performed best among the five regionalization methods followed by the sp rawet and sp methods the average nse in the calibration and validation periods were 0 87 and 0 85 these results indicated that the combination of the traditional parameter regionalization method with the rs et based parameter calibration method has great potential for runoff prediction in ungauged catchments particularly for the sp bcet method the average re of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods was similar to that of the sp method possibly because the runoff coefficient in each grid remained nearly constant during parameter correction based on the rs et data eqs 11 and 12 to better understand the advantages of the parameter regionalization scheme proposed in this study the relationship between the variation of nse values in the sp bcet method or sp rawet method relative to that in the sp method or bcet and rawet methods and the nse values in the sp method or bcet and rawet methods on a daily scale are presented in fig 10 for sp bcet method sp rawet method versus sp method fig 10 a and fig 10 b the variation of nse ranges from 0 07 to 0 16 0 05 to 0 11 for the calibration period and from 0 08 to 0 11 0 07 to 0 09 for the validation period the nse values of the sp bcet method sp rawet method were similar to or better than those of the sp method in approximately 80 0 86 0 and 82 0 78 0 of the total catchments in the calibration and validation periods respectively as shown in fig 10 a and b the variation in nse decreases with the nse values of the sp method and this relationship was strengthened in the bcet method rawet method which indicates that the proposed parameter regionalization scheme is more effective when the sp method or rs et based parameter calibration method has a poor performance to further verify this conclusion the 50 catchments were classified into four categories according to the nse values of the sp method at daily scale nse 0 60 0 60 nse 0 70 0 70 nse 0 80 and nse 0 80 in the calibration period and the performance of the five parameter regionalization methods under each category were compared in table 2 for all catchments the sp bcet method sp rawet method performed slightly better than the sp method and significantly better than the bcet method rawet method however the advantages of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods were more evident when the nse values of the sp method are less than 0 60 for catchments with nse values between 0 60 and 0 70 the sp bcet and sp rawet methods performed slightly better than the sp method in catchments with nse values greater than 0 70 in the sp method the overall performance of the sp bcet method sp rawet method was similar to that of the sp method for the sp bcet sp rawet versus bcet method fig 10 c and d the variation of nse ranges from 0 03 to 0 31 0 08 to 0 32 for the calibration period and from 0 06 to 0 37 0 08 to 0 37 for the validation period the nse values of the sp bcet method sp rawet method were greater than those of the bcet method for approximately 90 0 88 0 and 94 0 92 0 of the total catchments during the calibration and validation periods respectively similarly for sp bcet sp rawet versus rawet method fig 10 e and f the variation of nse ranges from 0 02 to 0 60 0 07 to 0 60 for the calibration period and from 0 07 to 0 64 0 10 to 0 62 for the validation period the nse values of the sp bcet method sp rawet method were greater than those of the rawet method at approximately 90 0 92 0 and 88 0 86 0 of the total catchments in the calibration and validation periods respectively 4 3 4 the influence of rs et data accuracy on the performance of the proposed regionalization method owing to the limited availability of gauge observations it is challenging to evaluate the accuracy of et estimations directly on a large scale determining the ability of et data in parameter calibration is one of the most frequently used approaches for evaluating et products dembélé et al 2020a in this study the added values of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods for runoff prediction were closely related to the accuracy of the rs et product to analyze the influence of rs et accuracy on the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme the relationship between the variation in the nse value in the sp bcet method sp rawet method relative to that in the sp method and the nse value in the bcet method rawet method at daily scale is presented in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 for catchments with nse values of the bcet and rawet methods less than 0 40 the sp bcet fig 11 a and sp rawet methods fig 11 b achieved worse streamflow simulation accuracy than the sp method however for catchments with nse values of the bcet and rawet methods ranging from 0 40 to 0 70 rs et data play an overall positive role in improving the capability of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme in runoff prediction that is the sp bcet and sp rawet methods achieved overall more satisfactory streamflow simulations than the sp method moreover for catchments with the nse values of bcet and rawet methods greater than 0 70 the sp bcet and sp rawet methods have a better model performance than the sp method in almost all catchments these results indicate that the accuracy of the rs et data is one of the most dominant factors affecting the performance of our proposed parameter regionalization scheme and accurate et data are helpful for improving the runoff prediction ability of the proposed scheme 4 3 5 relationship between nse values and catchment attributes fig 12 presents the scatterplots between nse or variations in nse at the daily scale in the calibration period and catchment attributes seven attributes included mean annual precipitation pre mean annual temperature tem mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet aridity index ai mean elevation me catchment area ca and the mean value of the distance between the grid centroids and those of the nearest catchment md were adopted in this study the background of each subgraph represents the significance of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between two target variables for the sp method the ca had a strong positive relationship with the nse values 0 001 p 0 01 the md had a negative relationship 0 05 p 0 10 with the nse values of the sp method indicating that the density of gauged catchments is one of the factors affecting its performance the tem and ca had positive relationships 0 05 p 0 10 with the nse values of the bcet method the pre tem and me had strong relationships 0 001 p 0 01 with the nse values of the rawet method the pet and ai had good relationships 0 01 p 0 05 with the nse values of the rawet method among seven catchment attributes the nse values of the sp bcet method 0 001 p 0 01 and the sp rawet method 0 01 p 0 05 had the best relationship with the ca the variation of nse values in the sp bcet method relative to that in the sp method had good relationships 0 01 p 0 05 with tem and the md and the variation of nse values had a weak relationship 0 05 p 0 10 with pet and me these results indicate that the proposed sp bcet method performs better than the sp method in warmer catchments meanwhile the sp bcet method can compensate for the poor performance of the sp method when the gauged catchments are sparely distributed but the performance of the sp bcet method may not be as good as that of the sp method when densely gauged catchments are available all catchment characteristics had no significant relationship with the variation of nse values in the sp rawet method relative to that in the sp method the variation of nse values in the sp bcet sp rawet method relative to that in the bcet rawet method was closely related to most climate characteristics but the variation of nse values had no significant relationships with the ca and md 4 4 comparison of five parameter regionalization methods in soil moisture simulation this section validates and compares the performance of the five parameter regionalization methods in the soil moisture anomaly simulation to compare the capability of the five parameter regionalization methods in capturing the temporal variation of soil moisture anomalies fig 13 presents the cc and rmse between the standardized values of the simulated and observed soil moisture at each station for comparison the soil moisture stations were numbered according to the cc rmse values of the sp method in fig 13 a d as shown in fig 13 a and c the sp method achieves a slightly better performance in capturing the temporal variation of soil moisture anomalies than the bcet and rawet methods indicating that the traditional parameter regionalization method may be more suitable for simulating the temporal dynamic changes in soil moisture anomalies than the rs et based parameter calibration method the performance of the sp and bcet methods rawet method may be quite different for a specific grid but generally in grids where the sp method can reasonably reproduce the temporal variation in soil moisture anomalies the rs et based calibration method also provided satisfactory results and vice versa surprisingly the performance of the bcet method was slightly worse than that of the rawet method which is inconsistent with the results of the streamflow simulation for a specific grid the difference between the performance of the sp bcet sp rawet and sp methods is smaller than that between the bcet rawet and sp methods it is clear that in grids where the sp method performs poorly for example with cc values less than 0 45 or rmse values greater than 0 90 the sp bcet and sp rawet methods perform better than the sp method fig 13 b and d overall the sp bcet and sp rawet methods achieved the best model performance among the five schemes in reproducing temporal variations in soil moisture anomalies compared to the sp method the average cc of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods increased by approximately 0 01 and the average rmse of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods decreased by approximately 0 01 fig 14 presents the daily spatial cc and rmse between the standardized values of simulated and observed soil moisture to compare the ability of the five parameter regionalization methods to capture the spatial variation in soil moisture anomalies as shown in fig 14 the sp method was superior to the bcet and rawet methods in this regard especially for the cc results similar to the results shown in fig 13 the performance of the bcet method was slightly worse than that of the rawet method in terms of spatial cc and rmse which may be due to the use of the unique α value during the rs et correction procedure in the bcet method and the reliable feature of raw rs et in reproducing spatial patterns of actual et was weakened to a certain extent the overall performance of the sp rawet method in terms of spatial cc is similar to that of the sp method however both the sp bcet and sp rawet methods are superior to the sp method with respect to the rmse results which indicates that the proposed parameter regionalization scheme has certain advantages in reproducing the spatial pattern of soil moisture anomalies 5 discussion in this study we proposed a two step calibration based parameter regionalization scheme sp bcet and sp rawet methods which combines the traditional sp method and rs et based parameter calibration method the results show that for runoff prediction the overall performance of our proposed method is slightly better than that of the sp method and significantly better than that of the rs et based parameter calibration method moreover the sp bcet and sp rawet methods improved the simulation of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of soil moisture anomalies to varying degrees despite the influence of several factors the improvements in the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization method for runoff prediction and soil moisture anomaly reproduction compared with that of the sp method are not very significant however we demonstrated that the combining of the traditional parameter regionalization method and the rs et based parameter calibration method has extensive application prospects in improving the accuracy of hydrological simulations in ungauged or poorly gauged catchments moreover we identified potential factors affecting the performance of the proposed regionalization method which may help improve the parameter regionalization method in future studies the quality of the rs et data is probably the dominant factor affecting the performance of our proposed parameter regionalization scheme as shown in fig 11 as et cannot be measured directly by satellite the quality of rs et data is not always guaranteed and the magnitude and characteristics of the error in the rs et product may vary considerably across regions demirel et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 to reduce the potential influence of inherent systematic bias in the raw et data on parameter calibration regionalization bias corrected rs et data were used in the sp bcet and bcet methods the results of this study and those of huang et al 2020 demonstrated that bias corrected et data provided a more reliable runoff simulation however although this bias correction method is beneficial in reducing the systematic bias in raw rs et it may be ineffective in reducing the random error which causes insufficient accuracy in the use of the bias corrected et data and produces less significant improvement using the sp bcet method compared to the sp method the uncertainty of the parameter α in fu s equation may be another factor that affects the performance of the sp bcet method the parameter α is a comprehensive variable that fully reflects the underlying surface characteristics e g topographic characteristics climate types land use and soil properties huang et al 2017 shao et al 2012 and therefore may vary significantly in regions with different climate and catchment characteristics thus the use of a uniform α in each grid may be unreasonable in addition it is challenging to estimate spatially distributed α values for large scale applications under these circumstances the sp rawet method is a better choice than the sp bcet method et simulation uncertainties in hydrological modeling may also affect the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme in general in addition to hydrological parameters how the model simulates et model structures and vegetation and soil related parameters may have a large impact on the accuracy of the et estimates from hydrological models sun et al 2021 which will further influence the performance of et based parameter estimation zhang et al 2020 overcoming the deficiencies of the hydrological model in et modeling is an interesting research question but is outside the scope of this study in summary a major limitation of using rs et data for model parameter estimation is its accuracy as there are potentially large uncertainties therefore in the future more effort should be made to produce an accurate et product and improve its applicability for model parameter estimation in ungauged catchments once a more accurate et product is available the weights of the two components in the objective function eqs 11 and 12 can be adjusted according to the density of the gauged catchments and the accuracy of the et data which is expected to improve the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme 6 conclusions runoff prediction in ungauged catchments is an important and challenging task in the field of hydrology to improve the accuracy of hydrological modeling in ungauged catchments this study proposed a new parameter regionalization scheme that combines the sp method and rs et based parameter calibration method the proposed regionalization scheme was demonstrated using the vic model in the yrb the results show that the performance of the et based parameter calibration varies significantly across different catchments because of the great uncertainty in its application in runoff prediction in ungauged catchments the bias corrected eb et data performed better than the raw eb et data for parameter estimation the traditional sp method outperformed the rs et based parameter calibration method in runoff prediction and soil moisture anomaly simulations the proposed parameter regionalization scheme achieved the best overall model performance in terms of streamflow simulation and soil moisture anomaly reproduction in comparison with the sp method and rs et based parameter calibration method the results also indicate that the accuracy of the rs et data is one of the most dominant factors affecting the performance of the proposed scheme and accurate et data are helpful in improving its ability to predict runoff accurately moreover the proposed regionalization method is expected to perform better

2899,runoff prediction in ungauged catchments is an important and challenging research topic in the field of hydrology however traditional parameter regionalization methods may not be applicable in regions with sparsely distributed hydrological stations remote sensing rs evapotranspiration et products provide valuable information for model parameter estimations this study aimed to improve the accuracy of hydrological modeling in ungauged catchments by combining the traditional spatial proximity sp method with the rs et based parameter calibration method to form a two step calibration based regionalization method sp bcet method using bias corrected rs et data and sp rawet method using raw rs et data the proposed regionalization scheme is demonstrated by using the variable infiltration capacity model in the yangtze river basin china and its performance was evaluated and compared with the sp method and two rs et based parameter calibration schemes bcet method using bias corrected rs et data and rawet method using raw rs et data the results indicate that the bcet method performs better than the rawet method the sp method outperforms the rs et based parameter calibration method and the sp bcet and sp rawet methods achieve the best overall performance among the five methods taking the simulated streamflow at a daily scale in the calibration period as an example the average nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency for the sp bcet rawet sp bcet and sp rawet methods were 0 69 0 61 0 56 0 71 and 0 71 respectively moreover the sp bcet and sp rawet methods improved the simulation of the temporal dynamics and spatial variability of soil moisture anomalies the accuracy of the rs et data was one of the most dominant factors affecting the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme the sp bcet method is expected to perform better than the sp method in warmer catchments or when gauged catchments are sparely distributed the findings demonstrate the great

hydrological models are the most efficient tools for understanding hydrological processes from the basin to the global scale playing important roles in many fields such as water resource management flood forecasting and drought monitoring kittel et al 2020 mizukami et al 2017 xiong and zeng 2019 yang et al 2019b generally all hydrological models must be calibrated to obtain reliable simulation results beck et al 2020 kittel et al 2020 yang et al 2019b given the better availability of streamflow than other hydrological variables hydrological models are generally calibrated by improving the consistency between the simulated and observed streamflow at the outlet of the target catchment beck et al 2020 yang et al 2019b however hydrological stations are sparsely distributed and there are many ungauged catchments worldwide causing the inapplicability of this parameter calibration method to large contiguous domains mizukami et al 2017 currently the estimation of hydrological model parameters in ungauged catchments remains one of the most important and challenging tasks in hydrological science guo et al 2021 he et al 2011 mizukami et al 2017 to address this issue parameter regionalization methods have been discussed and used in many studies to estimate spatially distributed hydrological parameters in ungauged catchments arsenault et al 2019 beck et al 2020 beck et al 2016 kittel et al 2020 oudin et al 2008 rojas serna et al 2016 samaniego et al 2010 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2019a parameter regionalization methods are designed to transfer hydrological parameters calibrated in gauged donor catchments to ungauged target catchments and then predict runoff in ungauged ones arsenault et al 2019 beck et al 2020 guo et al 2021 kittel et al 2020 yang et al 2020 the most widely used parameter regionalization methods in the literature are the spatial proximity sp physical similarity ps and multiple regression based mr methods arsenault et al 2019 guo et al 2021 he et al 2011 oudin et al 2008 rojas serna et al 2016 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2019a the sp method assumes that geographically adjacent catchments have similar rainfall runoff characteristics the basic idea behind the ps method is that catchments with similar attributes have similar hydrological responses the sp and ps methods directly transfer complete parameter sets from geographically adjacent or physically similar gauged catchments to ungauged catchments the mr method assumes that a good relationship exists between the catchment attributes and model parameters the regression functions between catchment descriptors and calibrated model parameters from gauged catchments are transferred to ungauged ones and then used to estimate their model parameters many comparative studies have been conducted on these three regionalization approaches in recent years for example oudin et al 2008 compared the regionalization methods based on 913 french catchments bao et al 2012 compared regression based and similarity based approaches ps and sp methods in 55 catchments with multiple hydro climatic conditions in china arsenault et al 2019 investigated the performance of these three methods on 30 diverse catchments in mexico using three hydrological models yang et al 2020 evaluated these methods or their modified forms using four hydrological models in 86 catchments in norway under different climatic conditions there is still no clear conclusion regarding the comparative performance of these regionalization methods because of the large differences in climatic conditions hydrological models and density of gauged catchments among different studies parajka et al 2013 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2019a however in most cases the sp method performs better than or comparable to other regionalization methods particularly when a dense network of donor catchments is available guo et al 2021 kittel et al 2020 li et al 2014 oudin et al 2008 parajka et al 2013 yang et al 2020 with the rapid development of satellite remote sensing rs technology rs based data have become available and have been gradually used in hydrological model parameter estimation in ungauged catchments because of their advantages of large scale coverage and easy access dembélé et al 2020b demirel et al 2018 herman et al 2018 huang et al 2020 jiang and wang 2019 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 zhang et al 2020 compared to the traditional streamflow based parameter calibration method the rs data based parameter calibration method may reduce the uncertainty associated with lumped calibration through parameterization for each grid huang et al 2020 as one of the most critical components of the hydrological cycle evapotranspiration et plays an important role in the water and energy balance and can be added to the calibration process because accurate et estimation in a hydrological model can lead to better simulation of other hydrological components such as runoff and soil moisture herman et al 2018 jiang and wang 2019 zhang et al 2020 therefore the performance of rs et data in hydrological parameter calibration has gained significant attention in recent literature for example kunnath poovakka et al 2016 examined the capability of rs et and soil moisture data in hydrological model calibration and concluded that calibration with accurate et attributes accurately predicted streamflow zhang et al 2020 explored the potential of model parameters calibrated against rs et data for runoff prediction and found that this approach can reasonably predict monthly runoff in wetter catchments huang et al 2020 proposed a comprehensive framework with seven rs et based calibration schemes to predict runoff in 30 catchments in the yalong river basin and their results showed that bias corrected rs et data have great potential in hydrological model parameter estimation dembélé et al 2020a evaluated 12 et datasets for their potential to improve the performance of hydrological modeling using four distinct multivariate calibration strategies and found that et datasets help improve model calibration based on the calibration strategy the findings of these studies add to the growing evidence that rs et data have broad prospects in model parameter calibration for hydrological parameter calibration rs et products can be used in combination with the observed streamflow dembélé et al 2020b herman et al 2018 hulsman et al 2021 kunnath poovakka et al 2018 sirisena et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 or used alone dembélé et al 2020a huang et al 2020 jiang et al 2020 kunnath poovakka et al 2016 lopez et al 2017 yang et al 2021 zhang et al 2020 the former method is inapplicable to ungauged catchments because the observed streamflow is unavailable the latter method is more suitable for parameter estimation in ungauged catchments however this method is still limited in practice first the applicability of model parameters calibrated against rs et is closely related to the accuracy of the data dembélé et al 2020a jiang et al 2020 yang et al 2021 however the quality of rs et data is not always guaranteed as et cannot be measured directly by satellites demirel et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 and the parameters calibrated solely against rs et may have great uncertainty moreover there may be some hydrological parameters that are not sensitive to et but are essential for accurate streamflow simulations kunnath poovakka et al 2016 kunnath poovakka et al 2018 for example kunnath poovakka et al 2016 conducted a parameter sensitivity procedure and found nine parameters with higher sensitivity to three target hydrological variables however only five were calibrated against et and soil moisture for streamflow prediction herman et al 2018 identified ten soil and water assessment tool swat model parameters that influence et calculations and changed only four parameters during the et calibration process in the study by jiang et al 2020 all six parameters of the variable infiltration capacity vic model were calibrated using the observed streamflow but only four parameters that showed significant influence on et were calibrated using et data in the study by zhang et al 2021 the et related and streamflow related parameters were calibrated separately based on et and streamflow data in summary for a specific hydrological model not all hydrological parameters can be calibrated solely against rs et data making this method inapplicable to ungauged catchments as several parameters have little sensitivity to et simulation and cannot be determined accurately thus traditional parameter regionalization methods may not obtain satisfactory results in areas with very limited or sparsely distributed streamflow stations but spatially and temporally explicit rs et data can potentially help in these regions however the rs et based parameter calibration method is still significantly limited in ungauged catchments at present researchers are confined to comparing the performance of the rs et based parameter calibration method with traditional parameter regionalization methods e g huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2020 however to the best of our knowledge no studies have been designed to investigate the benefits of combining the two methods which may further improve the accuracy of model parameter estimation or runoff prediction in ungauged catchments this study aimed to improve the accuracy of hydrological modeling in ungauged catchments by combining the rs et based parameter calibration method with the traditional parameter regionalization approach specifically we proposed a two step parameter calibration framework based on streamflow and rs et by first calibrating parameters based on observed streamflow and then adjusting parameters derived from the sp method using rs et data the sp method was selected as a representative of the traditional parameter regionalization approach in this study because of its good performance among the three widely used parameter regionalization methods arsenault et al 2019 li et al 2014 oudin et al 2008 qi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 to demonstrate this framework we applied the proposed parameter regionalization method to the yangtze river basin yrb in china using the vic model this study includes the following i a comparison of the relative performance of the rs et based parameter calibration and traditional parameter regionalization methods i e sp method in this study for hydrological simulation in ungauged catchments ii comparison of the performance of the bias corrected and raw rs et data in parameter calibration regionalization iii evaluation of the added values through combining the rs et based parameter calibration and sp methods in hydrological simulations of ungauged catchments 2 study area and data 2 1 study area the yrb fig 1 originates from the tanggula range in the qinghai tibet plateau and is the longest river in asia and the third longest river in the world with a length of approximately 6300 km the yrb traverses 11 provinces autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the central government from west to east with a drainage of approximately 1 8 106 km2 which accounts for 18 8 of the area in china https www cjw gov cn zjzx lypgk zjly most parts of the yrb are dominated by a subtropical monsoon climate except for several areas of the tibetan plateau with an average annual air temperature of approximately 14 c and precipitation of approximately 1100 mm zhang et al 2016 et is an important component of water balance in the yrb as approximately half of the precipitation returns to the atmosphere via evaporation processes zhang et al 2016 2 2 datasets 2 2 1 meteorological data the meteorological data required to force the vic hydrological model and calculate potential et included precipitation air temperature sunshine duration pressure specific humidity and wind speed precipitation air temperature and sunshine duration from 322 meteorological stations fig 1 a within and around the yrb provided by the national meteorological science data center nmsdc https data cma cn were interpolated into a 5 5 km spatial resolution using the inverse distance weighted idw method this is one of the best methods for interpolating data from the nmsdc wu et al 2007 the influence of elevation on precipitation was not considered however the influence of elevation on air temperature was considered using the relationship of a 0 65 c temperature decrease per elevation increase of 100 m xu et al 2021 pressure specific humidity and wind speed were obtained from the china meteorological forcing dataset cmfd which is a gridded meteorological dataset with a temporal resolution of three hours and a spatial resolution of 0 1 he et al 2020 the raw cmfd was downscaled from the original spatial resolution to 5 5 km to match the hydrological model resolution using bilinear interpolation 2 2 2 observed streamflow and soil moisture daily streamflow and in situ soil moisture datasets were obtained from the information center hydrological monitor and forecast center ministry of water resources p r china we collected streamflow data for 50 hydrological stations in the yrb and their corresponding catchment areas ranging from 562 km2 to 14484 km2 with an average drainage area of 5157 2 km2 in total 823 soil moisture stations within the yrb were selected for this study the length of the records of soil moisture observations ranged from 106 to 4128 with an average of 1314 observational values for each station from january 2008 to november 2020 the soil moisture was measured at three different depths 10 20 and 40 cm for comparison with the vic simulated soil moisture the observed values at the three depths were integrated to 0 40 cm and then translated to volumetric water content using the soil bulk density of each 5 km grid the data quality of the in situ soil moisture observations was reliable and has been used in previous studies to validate simulated and satellite based soil moisture wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2020 zhou et al 2019 2 2 3 remote sensing evapotranspiration data the daily surface energy balance based global land et hereafter referred to as eb et with a spatial resolution of 0 05 was obtained from the national tibetan plateau data center ntpdc https data tpdc ac cn the newly improved surface energy balance system sebs algorithm by chen et al 2013 and chen et al 2019 was used to generate the data moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis land surface temperature normalized difference vegetation index global forest height and globalbedo data were used in the et calculation the eb et dataset is a global dataset spanning from 2000 to 2017 and the eb et data have been evaluated using ground based observations chen et al 2021 water balance based et values and the performance in hydrological model parameter estimation guo et al 2022 both studies confirmed that the eb et dataset has high accuracy and good potential for parameter calibration moreover compared with other rs et products the eb et data have a relatively high spatiotemporal resolution which helps to reduce the impact of spatial scale mismatch between rs et and simulated et on parameter regionalization et data from january 1 2001 to december 31 2010 were used in this study 3 methodology 3 1 bias correction of remote sensing evapotranspiration given that rs et data may have a systematic bias to improve their applicability in parameter regionalization rs et was bias corrected using the method proposed by huang et al 2020 fu s equation fu 1981 based on the budyko hypothesis was adopted to calculate the mean annual actual et according to fu s equation the relationship between mean annual actual et mm yr potential et pet mm yr and precipitation p mm yr can be expressed as follows 1 et p p e t p 1 pet p α 1 α where α is an empirical parameter that can reflect climate and catchment characteristics huang et al 2017 shao et al 2012 pet is the mean annual potential evapotranspiration and is estimated using the penman monteith method further details on the calculation of the pet can be found in huang et al 2020 for a closed catchment the change in water storage is negligible and the mean annual et is equal to the difference between the mean annual precipitation and streamflow over a long period therefore the mean annual streamflow based on fu s equation is expressed as follows 2 q fu p 1 pet p α 1 α p e t where qfu is the mean annual streamflow mm yr parameter α was estimated by fitting the mean annual observed streamflow potential evapotranspiration and precipitation from 50 catchments using the least squares method following the study of huang et al 2020 the procedure of the rs et bias correction is as follows first the fitted α is used for each 5 km 5 km grid that is fu s equation estimated mean annual et at each grid from 2001 to 2010 is calculated by substituting the fitted α grid mean annual precipitation and pet into eq 1 then the daily bias corrected eb et at each grid is obtained by multiplying the raw eb et by the ratio between the mean annual et calculated using fu s equation and the mean annual raw eb et at each grid 3 2 the vic hydrological model the vic model developed by liang et al 1994 1996 is a large scale distributed hydrological model that simultaneously solves the water and energy balances within each grid cell the key characteristics of the vic model are the representation of multiple land cover types and the spatial variability of the soil moisture capacity in the vic model each cell is modeled separately and the grid cells do not interact with each other which makes it possible to calibrate the parameters of the model using grid based data moreover each grid cell is subdivided into spatial fractions that represent different land cover types it uses a spatial probability distribution function to represent the subgrid variability of soil moisture storage capacity and provide a more realistic representation of hydrological processes the vic model estimates et as the sum of three components evaporation from the canopy storage transpiration from vegetation and evaporation from the bare soil surface a schematic of the three layer structure used in the vic model is shown in fig 2 in this study the vic model was run on a daily scale with a spatial resolution of 5 5 km four parameter categories must be determined before running the vic model geographical parameters were determined using meteorological data provided by the nmsdc the location of each grid cell and the shuttle radar topography mission srtm global elevation data https earthexplorer usgs gov for each grid vegetation parameters were derived from the modis land cover classification and leaf area index datasets https modis gsfc nasa gov data the dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling over china dai et al 2013 from the ntpdc was used to define soil parameters the vic model includes eight hydrological parameters with the exception of the exponent used in baseflow curve c normally set to 2 n a and the thickness of the first soil moisture layer d1 normally set to 0 1 m the other six hydrological parameters are difficult to directly determine and must be calibrated using observed streamflow or estimated using regionalization methods these parameters include the variable infiltration curve parameter infilt n a maximum velocity of the baseflow dsmax mm day fraction of dsmax where nonlinear baseflow begins ds fraction fraction of maximum soil moisture where nonlinear baseflow occurs ws fraction and the thickness of the second and third soil moisture layers d2 and d3 m to calibrate hydrological parameters based on observed streamflow and evaluate the performance of the parameter regionalization method against observed streamflow the vic model modeled grid based runoff and baseflow were routed to the outlet of the basin using the large scale routing model lrm developed by lu et al 2015 lu et al 2015 demonstrated that the lrm has satisfactory performance both in simulating the streamflow at the outlet and its spatial distribution in the yrb to initiate the model state the vic and routing models were pre run for two years before the calibration period the length of the calibration period ranged from 8 to 11 years with an average of 9 6 years and that of the validation period ranged from 2 to 9 years with an average of 4 6 years in the following sections the performances of different parameter calibration regionalization methods in runoff prediction are compared in the calibration and validation periods respectively 3 3 parameter calibration and regionalization scheme in this study we proposed a two step calibration based parameter regionalization scheme that combines the sp and rs et based parameter calibration methods and its performance was evaluated and compared with those methods therefore the aforementioned three types of parameter regionalization methods are introduced in this section the workflow of this study is shown in fig 3 3 3 1 spatial proximity method the first step of the traditional parameter regionalization method is to calibrate the model parameters in selected gauged catchments independently using the observed streamflow at the outlet in this study the six hydrological parameters in each of the selected gauged catchments were optimized using the rosenbrock algorithm rosenbrock 1960 by improving the consistency between the simulated and observed streamflow consistency was measured using the nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse and relative error re 3 nse 1 i 1 n si m i o b s i 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 4 re i 1 n si m i o b s i i 1 n ob s i 100 where simi and obsi are the simulated and observed values sim and obs are the mean values of simi and obsi and n is the number of samples first we produced parameter values for each grid cell using the sp method five nearest donor catchments were selected based on the findings of previous studies arsenault et al 2019 guo et al 2021 qi et al 2020 yang et al 2020 we used the distances between the catchment and grid centroids to determine the five nearest donor catchments for each grid cell the parameters for each grid were estimated as follows 5 p a k j g 1 5 p a k g 1 d j g 2 g 1 5 1 d j g 2 where pak j is the value of hydrological parameter k in grid j from sp method pak g is the value of hydrological parameter k in gauged catchment g and dj g is the distance between grid j and gauged catchment g grid based hydrological parameters calculated using the sp method have two primary roles first the simulated results based on these parameters were used as the baseline to test whether the proposed parameter regionalization method performs better than the traditional regionalization method second the grid based hydrological parameters from the sp method were used as the initial parameter field in our proposed method and these parameters were subsequently adjusted by the rs et data grid by grid 3 3 2 rs et based parameter calibration method in contrast to the streamflow based parameter calibration method in which all the grids in the catchment have the same set of parameter values the rs et based parameter calibration method is conducted at each grid that is each grid has its own set of parameter values in this study two separate calibration schemes were considered the first calibration scheme uses bias corrected eb et data for parameter calibration whereas the second calibration scheme uses raw eb et data for parameter calibration the objective functions of the two separate calibration schemes are expressed as follows 6 f j 1 1 n i 1 n e t i j vic e t i j bias c o r r e c t e d e t 2 7 f j 2 1 n i 1 n e t i j vic e t j vic e t i j raw e t e t j raw e t 2 where n is the total number of data e t i j vic and e t i j bias c o r r e c t e d e t represent the vic simulated et and bias corrected eb et for grid j at time i respectively e t i j raw e t is raw eb et data e t j vic and e t j raw e t represent the mean values of the vic estimates and raw eb et for grid j respectively the objective function in eq 6 is the root mean square error rmse between the vic simulated et and bias corrected eb et the rmse and its transformation have been widely used as a component of the objective function in previous studies on rs et based hydrological parameter calibration kunnath poovakka et al 2016 kunnath poovakka et al 2018 yang et al 2021 the objective function in eq 6 reflects the calibration of the temporal dynamics and magnitude of the vic simulated et the objective function in eq 7 is the unbiased root mean square error ubrmse between the vic simulated et and raw eb et the ubrmse removes the bias from the rmse and is more suitable for describing the random error of the target variable wu et al 2018 zhou et al 2019 i e et in this study therefore the objective function in eq 7 also contributes to overcoming the influence of potential systematic errors in raw eb et on parameter calibration to a certain extent before parameter calibration using eb et data a simple sensitivity analysis method proposed by zhou et al 2020 was adopted to identify the sensitivity of the vic et to variations in the six hydrological parameters as shown in fig 4 parameters dsmax and d2 have the most significant influence on the simulated et followed by the parameters ds and ws and the simulated et has little sensitivity to parameters infilt and d3 in this study six hydrological parameters of the vic model are calibrated by the abovementioned rs et based parameter calibration schemes as the variations of these parameters affect the simulated et to varying extents and only in this way can the et based parameter calibration method be compared with other parameter regionalization methods 3 3 3 two step calibration based parameter regionalization method in this study the proposed two step calibration based parameter regionalization scheme can be summarized in the following three steps 1 parameter calibration based on observed streamflow at the catchment scale 2 parameter regionalization from the catchment scale to the grid scale based on the sp method and 3 correction of the parameter from the sp method based on et data at the grid scale the first two steps are described in section 3 3 1 in the process of parameter regionalization from the catchment scale to the grid scale based on the sp method we also calculated the standard deviation of each hydrological parameter in each grid based on the corresponding hydrological parameter values from the five nearest gauged catchments as follows 8 st d k j g 1 5 p a k g p a k 5 where stdk j is the standard deviation of the hydrological parameter k in grid j based on the corresponding hydrological parameter values from the five nearest gauged catchments pak g is the value of hydrological parameter k in gauged catchment g and p a k is the mean value of pak g for a specific hydrological parameter a higher standard deviation may indicate that this parameter has larger spatial heterogeneity during the parameter correction based on the eb et data the variation for hydrological parameter k in grid j ranges from p a min k j to p a max k j and can be expressed as follows 9 p a min k j maximum p a k j a s t d k j p a min k 10 p a max k j minimum p a k j a s t d k j p a max k where p a min k j and p a max k j are the lower and upper bounds for hydrological parameter k in grid j for the two step calibration scheme a is the coefficient of the standard deviation and the influence of a on the results of parameter regionalization is discussed further in section 4 2 2 p a min k and p a max k are the initial lower and upper bounds for hydrological parameter k that is the lower and upper bounds of hydrological parameter k for parameter calibration based on the observed streamflow at the catchment scale or eb et at the grid scale similar to the rs et based parameter calibration method two separate correction schemes were considered based on the rs et data for both schemes the six hydrological parameters in each grid j were automatically optimized using the rosenbrock algorithm by minimizing f j 3 or f j 4 which are the objective functions of the proposed regionalization method and are given by 11 f j 3 1 n i 1 n e t i j vic e t i j bias c o r r e c t e d e t 2 r c j r c j ini and 12 f j 4 1 n i 1 n e t i j vic e t j vic e t i j raw e t e t j raw e t 2 r c j r c j ini r c j and r c j ini are the runoff coefficients simulated by the vic model using the parameters from the parameter correction and sp methods prior to the correction the first term in eqs 11 and 12 is the same as that in eqs 6 and 7 because the parameter correction procedure in this study is based on the parameters from the sp method we assumed that the magnitude of the simulated streamflow using parameters from the sp method is reliable therefore the second term in eqs 11 and 12 attempts to reduce the potential bias in the modeled runoff caused by the parameter correction procedure all parameter regionalization methods compared in this study are summarized in table 1 3 4 evaluation of the parameter calibration and regionalization schemes the performance of five parameter calibration regionalization schemes in hydrological simulations was compared and validated based on observed streamflow and soil moisture leave one out cross validation technology was used in the assessment arsenault et al 2019 razavi and coulibaly 2013 yang et al 2020 yang et al 2019a and performed as follows during the validation each catchment was considered as a pseudo ungauged catchment and the proposed regionalization or sp methods were subsequently applied to this catchment the simulated streamflow was evaluated using nse and re for soil moisture the standardized values reflect anomaly characteristics of soil moisture and have been widely used in soil moisture evaluation jung et al 2019 drought analysis xu et al 2018 and soil moisture merging zhou et al 2021 therefore the standardized soil moisture values calculated on a grid by grid station by station basis rather than their absolute values were used to compare the performance of the five parameter calibration regionalization schemes the correlation coefficient cc and rmse between the standardized values of the simulated and observed soil moistures were computed at both temporal and spatial scales in this study because the length of records of observed soil moisture at different stations may vary significantly the evaluation at the spatial scale was conducted only for days with at least 400 data points approximately 50 0 of the stations available cc and rmse are defined as follows 13 cc i 1 n si m i sim ob s i obs i 1 n si m i sim 2 i 1 n ob s i obs 2 14 rmse 1 n i 1 n si m i o b s 2 where simi and obsi are the standardized values of the simulated and observed soil moistures sim and obs are the mean values of simi and obsi respectively and n is the number of samples 4 results 4 1 estimation and validation of the parameter in fu s equation in this study the mean annual streamflow during the calibration period of each typical catchment was used to determine the parameter α in fu s equation α 1 58 the rationality of the parameter α was analyzed using the mean annual streamflow in the validation period of each typical catchment as shown in fig 5 the estimated annual streamflow using fu s equation is in agreement with the observed annual streamflow with r2 values of 0 81 and 0 89 for the calibration and validation periods respectively this result demonstrates that the estimated parameter α is reasonable and can be used to calculate the actual et value in each grid 4 2 parameter calibration and regionalization 4 2 1 parameter calibration based on observed streamflow the first step of the sp sp bcet and sp rawet methods is to calibrate the hydrological parameters of the vic model against the observed streamflow at the catchment scale box plots of nse and re for the simulated streamflow over the calibration and validation periods are presented in fig 6 simulation results show that the average nse for the calibration and validation periods are 0 76 and 0 74 respectively approximately 82 0 and 68 0 of the total catchments with the nse values are greater than 0 70 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the vic simulations underestimated the streamflow with an average re of 2 8 ranging from 14 5 to 19 8 and 1 6 ranging from 18 5 to 20 8 for the calibration and validation periods respectively the results indicate that the vic model is applicable to the yrb for streamflow simulation and hydrological parameters calibrated against the observed streamflow at the catchment scale are reasonable and therefore can be used in further parameter regionalization 4 2 2 determination of variation range of hydrological parameter as mentioned in section 3 3 3 the variation range for hydrological parameter k in grid j which is determined by the parameter value calculated using the sp method the standard deviation of the parameter values from the five nearest donor catchments and the coefficient of the standard deviation csd must be determined before the parameter correction procedure in this study the csd was set as 0 5 1 0 1 5 2 0 2 5 and 3 0 and that corresponding to the best model performance was used for further analysis fig 7 shows box plots of the nse and re for the simulated streamflow in the calibration period fig 7 a and b and validation period fig 7 c and d with different csds under the two regionalization schemes from which there is no significant difference in terms of nse and re between the sp bcet sp rawet method under different csds indicating that the csd may not be the major factor affecting the applicability of the proposed sp bcet sp rawet method however for the sp bcet method the average nse of the simulated streamflow in 50 typical catchments increased with csd in the calibration and validation periods except for csd 3 0 the sp bcet method performed the best at csd 2 5 with an average nse of 0 71 and 0 70 and an re of 3 1 and 1 7 in the calibration and validation periods respectively for the sp rawet method the absolute value of the average re increased with csd and performed the best at csd 0 5 in terms of re with an average re of 4 0 and 2 4 in the calibration and validation periods respectively but the worst in terms of nse with the lowest average nse of 0 70 and 0 69 in the calibration and validation periods respectively for other csds the average nse are 0 71 and 0 70 in the calibration and validation periods respectively therefore the csd of the sp rawet method was set as 1 0 the overall performance of the sp rawet method was similar to that of the sp bcet method in terms of the average nse however the sp bcet method approximately 3 2 to 3 1 and 1 9 to 1 7 in the calibration and validation periods respectively performed slightly better than the sp rawet method approximately 4 8 to 4 0 and 3 3 to 2 4 in the calibration and validation periods respectively in terms of the average re of the simulated streamflow 4 3 comparison of the five parameter regionalization methods in runoff prediction fig 8 presents the box plots of the nse daily scale a and monthly scale c and re b for the simulated streamflow in the calibration and validation periods using the parameters from the five parameter calibration regionalization methods the simulated monthly streamflow was accumulated from the daily streamflow and the monthly streamflow simulations were generally better than the daily ones the performances of the annual streamflow simulations were not compared because of the relatively short data records before comparing the overall performance of the five regionalization methods we selected three typical catchments the hydrological stations are wudu daoxian and dxitan the locations of these three stations are presented in fig 1 and plotted the time series of the observed and simulated streamflow to determine how the model simulation captured the dynamics and magnitude of the daily or monthly streamflow as shown in fig 9 the simulated streamflow can reflect the dynamics of the observed one in most cases but all the simulated streamflow underestimates the observed one especially for the rawet method at the wudu station the relative performance of different regionalization methods may vary with catchments and timescales for example for nse at wudu station the sp bcet sp rawet sp bcet and rawet methods are the sequences of their performances at daoxian station the sp method performed best on a daily scale whereas the sp bcet method performed best on a monthly scale however at the daxitan station the sp rawet method performed better than the sp bcet method which in turn was better than the rawet method at the daily scale in contrast the sp bcet method performed slightly better than the other four regionalization methods at the monthly scale 4 3 1 comparison between raw et and bias corrected et in parameter calibration as shown in fig 8 the overall performance of the bcet method in runoff prediction was significantly improved compared to the results of the rawet method at the daily scale the average nse for the bcet method in the calibration and validation periods were both 0 61 and the average re were 2 9 and 1 9 respectively however the average nse for the rawet method in the calibration and validation periods was approximately 0 56 and the method also significantly underestimated the streamflow with an average re of 14 4 and 14 7 respectively the bcet method outperformed the rawet method in runoff prediction in approximately 78 64 of the total catchments for nse during the calibration validation period and the absolute value of re in approximately 78 of the total catchments for the bcet method was less than that of the rawet method in both the calibration and validation periods at monthly scale the average nse for the bcet method for the calibration and validation periods were 0 83 and 0 82 and the average nse for the rawet method in both periods were approximately 0 76 respectively these results indicate that systematic bias in the raw rs et data may affect its usability for hydrological parameter estimation and a proper bias correction procedure for the raw rs et data before parameter calibration may be necessary the method of correcting the bias of the rs et data before calibration outperforms the method of removing the influence of the systematic bias in the raw rs et data through a proper objective function 4 3 2 comparison between the sp and rs et based parameter calibration methods as shown in fig 8 the average nse 0 69 for both periods at daily scale 0 87 and 0 85 for the calibration and validation periods at monthly scale of the sp method was larger than those of the bcet and rawet methods the sp method performed slightly better than the bcet method regarding re with an average re of 2 7 and 1 2 in the calibration and validation periods respectively in some catchments for example in approximately 18 0 14 0 of the total catchments in the calibration period on a daily scale the bcet rawet method performed better than the sp method in terms of nse indicating that the rs et based parameter calibration method can perform as well as or even better than the traditional regionalization method for runoff prediction in ungauged catchments in certain regions however the performance of the rs et based parameter calibration method varies significantly across different catchments because of the great uncertainty in its application to runoff prediction in ungauged catchments 4 3 3 the advantages of the two step calibration scheme over the sp and rs et based calibration methods in this section the performance of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods for runoff prediction was compared with the results of the sp and rs et based parameter calibration methods encouragingly the sp bcet and sp rawet methods achieved the best overall performance in terms of nse compared with the other three methods at daily scale fig 8 a at monthly scale the sp bcet method the average nse in the calibration and validation periods were 0 88 and 0 86 performed best among the five regionalization methods followed by the sp rawet and sp methods the average nse in the calibration and validation periods were 0 87 and 0 85 these results indicated that the combination of the traditional parameter regionalization method with the rs et based parameter calibration method has great potential for runoff prediction in ungauged catchments particularly for the sp bcet method the average re of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods was similar to that of the sp method possibly because the runoff coefficient in each grid remained nearly constant during parameter correction based on the rs et data eqs 11 and 12 to better understand the advantages of the parameter regionalization scheme proposed in this study the relationship between the variation of nse values in the sp bcet method or sp rawet method relative to that in the sp method or bcet and rawet methods and the nse values in the sp method or bcet and rawet methods on a daily scale are presented in fig 10 for sp bcet method sp rawet method versus sp method fig 10 a and fig 10 b the variation of nse ranges from 0 07 to 0 16 0 05 to 0 11 for the calibration period and from 0 08 to 0 11 0 07 to 0 09 for the validation period the nse values of the sp bcet method sp rawet method were similar to or better than those of the sp method in approximately 80 0 86 0 and 82 0 78 0 of the total catchments in the calibration and validation periods respectively as shown in fig 10 a and b the variation in nse decreases with the nse values of the sp method and this relationship was strengthened in the bcet method rawet method which indicates that the proposed parameter regionalization scheme is more effective when the sp method or rs et based parameter calibration method has a poor performance to further verify this conclusion the 50 catchments were classified into four categories according to the nse values of the sp method at daily scale nse 0 60 0 60 nse 0 70 0 70 nse 0 80 and nse 0 80 in the calibration period and the performance of the five parameter regionalization methods under each category were compared in table 2 for all catchments the sp bcet method sp rawet method performed slightly better than the sp method and significantly better than the bcet method rawet method however the advantages of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods were more evident when the nse values of the sp method are less than 0 60 for catchments with nse values between 0 60 and 0 70 the sp bcet and sp rawet methods performed slightly better than the sp method in catchments with nse values greater than 0 70 in the sp method the overall performance of the sp bcet method sp rawet method was similar to that of the sp method for the sp bcet sp rawet versus bcet method fig 10 c and d the variation of nse ranges from 0 03 to 0 31 0 08 to 0 32 for the calibration period and from 0 06 to 0 37 0 08 to 0 37 for the validation period the nse values of the sp bcet method sp rawet method were greater than those of the bcet method for approximately 90 0 88 0 and 94 0 92 0 of the total catchments during the calibration and validation periods respectively similarly for sp bcet sp rawet versus rawet method fig 10 e and f the variation of nse ranges from 0 02 to 0 60 0 07 to 0 60 for the calibration period and from 0 07 to 0 64 0 10 to 0 62 for the validation period the nse values of the sp bcet method sp rawet method were greater than those of the rawet method at approximately 90 0 92 0 and 88 0 86 0 of the total catchments in the calibration and validation periods respectively 4 3 4 the influence of rs et data accuracy on the performance of the proposed regionalization method owing to the limited availability of gauge observations it is challenging to evaluate the accuracy of et estimations directly on a large scale determining the ability of et data in parameter calibration is one of the most frequently used approaches for evaluating et products dembélé et al 2020a in this study the added values of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods for runoff prediction were closely related to the accuracy of the rs et product to analyze the influence of rs et accuracy on the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme the relationship between the variation in the nse value in the sp bcet method sp rawet method relative to that in the sp method and the nse value in the bcet method rawet method at daily scale is presented in fig 11 as shown in fig 11 for catchments with nse values of the bcet and rawet methods less than 0 40 the sp bcet fig 11 a and sp rawet methods fig 11 b achieved worse streamflow simulation accuracy than the sp method however for catchments with nse values of the bcet and rawet methods ranging from 0 40 to 0 70 rs et data play an overall positive role in improving the capability of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme in runoff prediction that is the sp bcet and sp rawet methods achieved overall more satisfactory streamflow simulations than the sp method moreover for catchments with the nse values of bcet and rawet methods greater than 0 70 the sp bcet and sp rawet methods have a better model performance than the sp method in almost all catchments these results indicate that the accuracy of the rs et data is one of the most dominant factors affecting the performance of our proposed parameter regionalization scheme and accurate et data are helpful for improving the runoff prediction ability of the proposed scheme 4 3 5 relationship between nse values and catchment attributes fig 12 presents the scatterplots between nse or variations in nse at the daily scale in the calibration period and catchment attributes seven attributes included mean annual precipitation pre mean annual temperature tem mean annual potential evapotranspiration pet aridity index ai mean elevation me catchment area ca and the mean value of the distance between the grid centroids and those of the nearest catchment md were adopted in this study the background of each subgraph represents the significance of the spearman rank correlation coefficient between two target variables for the sp method the ca had a strong positive relationship with the nse values 0 001 p 0 01 the md had a negative relationship 0 05 p 0 10 with the nse values of the sp method indicating that the density of gauged catchments is one of the factors affecting its performance the tem and ca had positive relationships 0 05 p 0 10 with the nse values of the bcet method the pre tem and me had strong relationships 0 001 p 0 01 with the nse values of the rawet method the pet and ai had good relationships 0 01 p 0 05 with the nse values of the rawet method among seven catchment attributes the nse values of the sp bcet method 0 001 p 0 01 and the sp rawet method 0 01 p 0 05 had the best relationship with the ca the variation of nse values in the sp bcet method relative to that in the sp method had good relationships 0 01 p 0 05 with tem and the md and the variation of nse values had a weak relationship 0 05 p 0 10 with pet and me these results indicate that the proposed sp bcet method performs better than the sp method in warmer catchments meanwhile the sp bcet method can compensate for the poor performance of the sp method when the gauged catchments are sparely distributed but the performance of the sp bcet method may not be as good as that of the sp method when densely gauged catchments are available all catchment characteristics had no significant relationship with the variation of nse values in the sp rawet method relative to that in the sp method the variation of nse values in the sp bcet sp rawet method relative to that in the bcet rawet method was closely related to most climate characteristics but the variation of nse values had no significant relationships with the ca and md 4 4 comparison of five parameter regionalization methods in soil moisture simulation this section validates and compares the performance of the five parameter regionalization methods in the soil moisture anomaly simulation to compare the capability of the five parameter regionalization methods in capturing the temporal variation of soil moisture anomalies fig 13 presents the cc and rmse between the standardized values of the simulated and observed soil moisture at each station for comparison the soil moisture stations were numbered according to the cc rmse values of the sp method in fig 13 a d as shown in fig 13 a and c the sp method achieves a slightly better performance in capturing the temporal variation of soil moisture anomalies than the bcet and rawet methods indicating that the traditional parameter regionalization method may be more suitable for simulating the temporal dynamic changes in soil moisture anomalies than the rs et based parameter calibration method the performance of the sp and bcet methods rawet method may be quite different for a specific grid but generally in grids where the sp method can reasonably reproduce the temporal variation in soil moisture anomalies the rs et based calibration method also provided satisfactory results and vice versa surprisingly the performance of the bcet method was slightly worse than that of the rawet method which is inconsistent with the results of the streamflow simulation for a specific grid the difference between the performance of the sp bcet sp rawet and sp methods is smaller than that between the bcet rawet and sp methods it is clear that in grids where the sp method performs poorly for example with cc values less than 0 45 or rmse values greater than 0 90 the sp bcet and sp rawet methods perform better than the sp method fig 13 b and d overall the sp bcet and sp rawet methods achieved the best model performance among the five schemes in reproducing temporal variations in soil moisture anomalies compared to the sp method the average cc of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods increased by approximately 0 01 and the average rmse of the sp bcet and sp rawet methods decreased by approximately 0 01 fig 14 presents the daily spatial cc and rmse between the standardized values of simulated and observed soil moisture to compare the ability of the five parameter regionalization methods to capture the spatial variation in soil moisture anomalies as shown in fig 14 the sp method was superior to the bcet and rawet methods in this regard especially for the cc results similar to the results shown in fig 13 the performance of the bcet method was slightly worse than that of the rawet method in terms of spatial cc and rmse which may be due to the use of the unique α value during the rs et correction procedure in the bcet method and the reliable feature of raw rs et in reproducing spatial patterns of actual et was weakened to a certain extent the overall performance of the sp rawet method in terms of spatial cc is similar to that of the sp method however both the sp bcet and sp rawet methods are superior to the sp method with respect to the rmse results which indicates that the proposed parameter regionalization scheme has certain advantages in reproducing the spatial pattern of soil moisture anomalies 5 discussion in this study we proposed a two step calibration based parameter regionalization scheme sp bcet and sp rawet methods which combines the traditional sp method and rs et based parameter calibration method the results show that for runoff prediction the overall performance of our proposed method is slightly better than that of the sp method and significantly better than that of the rs et based parameter calibration method moreover the sp bcet and sp rawet methods improved the simulation of the temporal dynamics and spatial patterns of soil moisture anomalies to varying degrees despite the influence of several factors the improvements in the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization method for runoff prediction and soil moisture anomaly reproduction compared with that of the sp method are not very significant however we demonstrated that the combining of the traditional parameter regionalization method and the rs et based parameter calibration method has extensive application prospects in improving the accuracy of hydrological simulations in ungauged or poorly gauged catchments moreover we identified potential factors affecting the performance of the proposed regionalization method which may help improve the parameter regionalization method in future studies the quality of the rs et data is probably the dominant factor affecting the performance of our proposed parameter regionalization scheme as shown in fig 11 as et cannot be measured directly by satellite the quality of rs et data is not always guaranteed and the magnitude and characteristics of the error in the rs et product may vary considerably across regions demirel et al 2018 huang et al 2020 zhang et al 2021 to reduce the potential influence of inherent systematic bias in the raw et data on parameter calibration regionalization bias corrected rs et data were used in the sp bcet and bcet methods the results of this study and those of huang et al 2020 demonstrated that bias corrected et data provided a more reliable runoff simulation however although this bias correction method is beneficial in reducing the systematic bias in raw rs et it may be ineffective in reducing the random error which causes insufficient accuracy in the use of the bias corrected et data and produces less significant improvement using the sp bcet method compared to the sp method the uncertainty of the parameter α in fu s equation may be another factor that affects the performance of the sp bcet method the parameter α is a comprehensive variable that fully reflects the underlying surface characteristics e g topographic characteristics climate types land use and soil properties huang et al 2017 shao et al 2012 and therefore may vary significantly in regions with different climate and catchment characteristics thus the use of a uniform α in each grid may be unreasonable in addition it is challenging to estimate spatially distributed α values for large scale applications under these circumstances the sp rawet method is a better choice than the sp bcet method et simulation uncertainties in hydrological modeling may also affect the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme in general in addition to hydrological parameters how the model simulates et model structures and vegetation and soil related parameters may have a large impact on the accuracy of the et estimates from hydrological models sun et al 2021 which will further influence the performance of et based parameter estimation zhang et al 2020 overcoming the deficiencies of the hydrological model in et modeling is an interesting research question but is outside the scope of this study in summary a major limitation of using rs et data for model parameter estimation is its accuracy as there are potentially large uncertainties therefore in the future more effort should be made to produce an accurate et product and improve its applicability for model parameter estimation in ungauged catchments once a more accurate et product is available the weights of the two components in the objective function eqs 11 and 12 can be adjusted according to the density of the gauged catchments and the accuracy of the et data which is expected to improve the performance of the proposed parameter regionalization scheme 6 conclusions runoff prediction in ungauged catchments is an important and challenging task in the field of hydrology to improve the accuracy of hydrological modeling in ungauged catchments this study proposed a new parameter regionalization scheme that combines the sp method and rs et based parameter calibration method the proposed regionalization scheme was demonstrated using the vic model in the yrb the results show that the performance of the et based parameter calibration varies significantly across different catchments because of the great uncertainty in its application in runoff prediction in ungauged catchments the bias corrected eb et data performed better than the raw eb et data for parameter estimation the traditional sp method outperformed the rs et based parameter calibration method in runoff prediction and soil moisture anomaly simulations the proposed parameter regionalization scheme achieved the best overall model performance in terms of streamflow simulation and soil moisture anomaly reproduction in comparison with the sp method and rs et based parameter calibration method the results also indicate that the accuracy of the rs et data is one of the most dominant factors affecting the performance of the proposed scheme and accurate et data are helpful in improving its ability to predict runoff accurately moreover the proposed regionalization method is expected to perform better than the sp method in warmer catchments or when gauged catchments are sparsely distributed declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests
