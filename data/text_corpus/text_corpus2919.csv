lewatit tp 214 and amberlyst a21 commercial anion exchange resins for pd ii recovery and reuse from synthetic electroless plating elp solutions for both resins batch adsorption experiments involved optimality of ph contact time adsorbent dosage followed with concentration effect and kinetic studies equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic models were considered for their fitness with the obtained pd ii batch adsorption characteristics among both resins lewatit tp 214 resin provided better performance in terms of adsorption and desorption characteristics along with optimal combinations of ph 8 equilibrium time 300 min and adsorbent dosage 2 g l 1 overall both resins provided significantly lower pd ii absorption capacity and removal for elp systems in comparison with aqueous solutions this is due to the inhibitory role of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and ammonia during pd ii binding with active sites on the resins the obtained desorption characteristics and associated pd ii adsorption and desorption mechanisms are promising to further commercial application of the said resins keywords palladium adsorption desorption lewatit tp 214 amberlyst a21 electroless plating

palladium recovery from such resources is of industrial and commercial significance 1 2 several conventional chemical precipitation adsorption leaching ion exchange electrolysis and electrochemical

molecular recognition gel technology exist to recover pd ii from waste process streams 3 5 among various outlined techniques very few methods qualify to address cost effective recovery and reuse of pd ii from solutions with concentrations as low as 10 200 g l 1 in addition some processes such as electrocoagulation generate metallic sludge as a by product which needs further treatment 6 needless to convey among the above mentioned technologies research commercialization is an additional challenging task from the perspective of environmental sustainability cost efficacy and recovery 7 among few competent and capable technologies to address research commercialization avenues chelating and ion exchange resins that target reversible chemisorption are most relevant materials to efficiently recover noble metals such as pd from spent streams characterized with low concentrations in addition biopolymers such as chitosan have been suggested to be competitive to synthetic chelating resins given their promising features such as production ease good separation characteristics and affordable cost 8 chemisorption facilitates better desorption characteristics by suitably deploying a reagent to recover pd ii from spent chelated resin and thereby enables simultaneous minimization of waste resin generation resource utility and enhancement in noble metal recovery thereby due to poor desorption characteristics commercial physisorbents such as activated carbon have been proven to be ineffective despite possessing good adsorption characteristics 9 hence commercial resins possessing better desorption characteristics need to be explored for industrial applicability as conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon and biopolymers such as chitosan and modified chitosan polymers have been proven to have poor desorption characteristics in the field of chelating resin applicability for pd ii recovery materials engineering and fitness of resins with complex chemistry solutions have been prominent research themes till date investigations till date explored prominent commercial resins 717 anion exchange lewatit monoplus tp 220 amberlyst a21 a29 lewatit tp 214 and duolite gt 73 etc for pd ii adsorption desorption 10 14 these investigations provided variegated insights firstly cu ii and zn ii did not influence pd ii uptake characteristics of lewatit tp 214 macroporous chelating resin 13 secondly lewatit tp 214 thiourea functional group containing chelating resin possessed better affinity than duolite gt 73 cationic ion exchanger with thiol functional group for pd ii recovery from both mono and binary solutions 14 thirdly amberlyst a21 weak basic resin containing n ch3 2 group and amberlyst a29 strong basic resin having n ch3 2c2h4oh group were analyzed for pd ii recovery from hcl nacl solutions the adsorption of pd ii chloro complex species from acidic chloride solutions was strongly favoured by amberlyst a21 but not with a29 resin 12 in summary it can be seen that commercial resins have been explored for pd ii recovery from chloride and aqueous feed solutions with minimal solution chemistry complexity 15 s n and o functional group containing commercial resins were explored for pd ii adsorption from aqueous solutions but not with solutions possessing stabilizers and surfactants at variant ph that strongly interfere with the pd ii adsorption characteristics the role of ph solute concentration and chloride ion concentration have been targeted for few resins without referring to the relevance or irrelevance of speciation in influencing pd ii adsorption characteristics in other words solution chemistry complexity needs to be given utmost significance in ongoing experimental investigations for commercial resins applicability towards pd ii recovery and reuse such investigations will be effective to promote industrial and commercial applicability of the said resins to mitigate hazard scenario and recover noble metal simultaneously among various solution systems with solution chemistry complex pd ii electroless plating elp solutions have fair complexity due to their constitution of ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid edta as stabilizer and ammonia 16 17 these constituents along with ph variation are reasonably complex to alter speciation mechanism associated to pd ii adsorption and can detrimentally or favorably alter both adsorption and desorption characteristics of pd ii onto commercial resins the literature does not refer to such cases where speciation studies involved easy analysis due to consideration of simpler solutions such as aqueous or chloride solutions also non toxic eluents such as solutions prepared with common bases and acids were not targeted for desorption studies in other words the ongoing research activity in the applicability of commercial resins for pd ii recovery is highly restrictive neither solution chemistry complexity nor simplistic eluent media have been targeted which are all prominent issues to further research commercialization of said resins for pd ii recovery and reuse considering the exploration of solution chemistry complexity role in influencing pd ii adsorption characteristics of commercial resins as a primary objective this work targets the efficacy of amberlyst a21 and lewatit monoplus tp 214 commercial resins as they have been proven to be highly effective for pd ii recovery 12 14 subsequently equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic modeling studies have been conducted further cetrimonium bromide surfactant ctab as an additive in the electroless plating elp solutions was also targeted for its role in influencing pd ii sorption capacity of the commercial resins 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals amberlyst a21 and lewatit monoplus tp 214 resins were purchased from sigma aldrich corporation bangalore india 99 pdcl2 was obtained from srl chemicals pvt ltd india na2edta and 25 nh4oh reagents were purchased from merck india millipore water milliq was used to prepare synthetic elp solutions along with analytical grade hno3 and naoh merck india reagents for both commercial resins physiochemical properties have been summarized in table 1 2 2 instrumentation atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas varian spectra aa 220fs netherland was used to determine initial and final pd ii metal ion concentrations based on absorbance of samples measured at 244 6 nm the pertinent functional groups in raw commercial and pd loaded commercial resins were determined using fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir shimadzu ir affinity1 japan within the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 the presence of pd metal ions on resins samples procured after adsorption studies was ensured using field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive x ray analysis fesem edx zeiss sigma germany ph measurement was carried out using a ph meter vsi 301 vsi electronics pvt limited india 2 3 preparation of edta containing elp solutions elp solutions with edta were prepared as per compositions mentioned in our earlier work 9 16 17 for all cases the na2edta solution concentration is 1 39 g l 1 the stock pd ii solutions were prepared by mixing precise amounts of chemicals in 1000 ml deionized water for 15 min in an orbital shaker at 120 rpm batch adsorption experiments were conducted with 50 300 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentrations 2 4 pd ii batch adsorption characteristics in presence of edta 50 ml pd ii elp solutions of desired initial concentration were taken in 250 ml conical flasks thereafter specific amount of adsorbent was added and the mixture was kept in an orbital shaker at 250 rpm and 298 k ph contact time adsorbent dosage temperature and initial metal ion concentration have been chosen as adsorption process parameters which were optimized based on the conventional methodology to conduct the adsorption experiments this involved varying one of these parameters for fixed choice of all other parameters after completion of set contact time whatman filter paper no 1 pore size 11 μm was deployed for filtration and the filtrate was analysed for final pd ii solution concentration with aas equipment for all experimental investigations sampling involved a minimal of three samples for experiment followed with average value determination the following expressions eqs 1 and 2 were used to determine the removal and adsorption capacity qe of the commercial resins 1 removal c o c e c o 100 2 adsorption capacity c o c e w v mg g 1 where co ce w and v are initial pd ii solution concentration mg l 1 equilibrium pd ii solution concentration mg l 1 adsorbent mass g and solution volume l respectively batch pd ii adsorption data and isotherms were evaluated at optimal solution ph and variant initial pd ii concentrations 50 300 mg l 1 and temperatures with other parameters chosen at their optimal choice kinetic analysis was carried out at 250 rpm and 50 mg l 1 pd ii initial concentration these experiments involved collection of liquid samples at precise time intervals before reaching equilibrium contact time to determine the intermediate pd ii concentrations 2 5 batch desorption study using pd ii adsorbed resins eluents such as naoh koh n ch2ch3 3 and hcl were deployed at desired solution concentrations to determine desorption characteristics the experimentation involved washing of pd ii loaded resin prepared with 50 mg l samples in several cycles using deionized water thereafter specific quantities of resins were kept in stoppered reagent bottles and specific quantity of eluent volume 50 ml was added and the mixture was subjected to mechanical shaking 200 rpm for stipulated time interval at room temperature eventually the final pd ii solution concentration was measured for the determination of desorption based pd ii metal recovery the metal recovery for reuse was evaluated using a mass balance expression of the number of moles of pd ii existent before and after desorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption characteristics fig 1 a and b illustrates the effect of ph on the pd ii adsorptive performance of amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively these experiments were conducted at 720 min contact time 1 g l 1 adsorbent dosage and 50 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration for amberlyst a21 resin and corresponding values of 180 min 0 6 g l 1 and 50 mg l 1 for lewatit tp 214 resin these variations in the range of adsorption process parameters were based on trial and error approaches to achieve appreciable pd ii uptake from the figures it can be observed that the optimal removal efficiency and adsorption capacity were obtained as 75 85 and 37 92 mg g 1 at 2 ph for amberlyst a21 resin and 84 56 and 70 46 mg g 1 at 8 ph for lewatit tp 214 resin in our earlier work 16 17 the speciation effects of ph variation have been presented as follows in synthetic elp solutions pd ii can exist in several forms such as pd edta 2 pdcl4 2 pdcl3 pdcl2 aq pdcl pd nh3 4 2 and pd nh3 3 2 16 however only pd edta 2 exists in lower ph range 1 6 and higher chloride concentrations on the other hand at higher ph basic media pd ii exists as pd nh3 4 2 given pd ii adsorptive capacity being maximum at optimal ph of 8 for the lewatit tp 214 resin at lower ph it is hypothesized that stronger bonding of nh and s groups in the resin with pd nh3 4 2 but not pd edta 2 is responsible for non optimal adsorption capacity also protonation effect additionally contributes to effective anion binding at lower ph 18 20 for amberlyst a21 resin the maximum adsorptive capacity was obtained at 2 ph for this observation it is hypothesized that stronger bonding of nh3 group in the resin with pd edta 2 in the lower ph range 1 6 nh2 groups of the resin undergo protonation and the protonated groups exhibit high affinity towards pd edta 2 species due to this reason the resin exhibits higher adsorption capacities in the lower ph range hence speciation can be visualized as an important tool for the identification of relevant species that either exists in abundance or not at various solution chemistry conditions and their subsequent interaction with the commercial resin functional groups in other words speciation analysis is a very useful tool to deduce adsorption mechanism for complex solution chemistry systems further confirmation of pd ii binding at various sites would be addressed in the characterization section of the article for amberlyst a21 resin adsorbent dosage experiments were conducted at 2 ph 50 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration and 720 min contact time at optimal adsorbent dosage of 1 6 g l 1 the adsorption capacity of 25 62 mg g 1 and 81 98 removal were obtained for the resin fig 1c higher dosage provided higher adsorption capacity due to an increase in active sites available for pd sorption corresponding reduction in metal removal was due to the reduction in metal quantity adsorbed per unit gram of adsorbent at higher adsorbent dosage fig 1d depicts pd ii adsorptive performance of amberlyst a21 resin for a variation in contact time these experiments were conducted at 1 6 g l 1 50 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration and 2 ph for the adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacity 24 62 mg g 1 was obtained at 780 min along with 78 78 metal removal fig 1e shows the variation in removal and adsorption capacity mg g 1 with contact time for the lewatit tp 214 resin these data were obtained at 8 ph 0 6 g l 1 adsorbent dosage and 50 mg l 1 pd ii initial concentration the maximum removal of 85 52 and relevant adsorptive capacity of 71 27 mg g 1 were obtained at an optimal equilibrium time of 300 min for the resin the later experiments involved evaluation of adsorbent dosage effect on pd ii adsorption characteristics for these experiments 8 ph 50 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration and 300 min contact time were chosen these experiments inferred a maximum adsorbent dosage of 2 g l 1 at which 21 21 mg g 1 adsorption capacity and 84 82 removal were obtained for the resin fig 1f reasons associated to these trends are similar to those presented previously for the amberlyst a21 resin fig 2 a and b illustrates the effect of initial pd ii concentration and temperature on the adsorptive performance of amberlyst a21 resin with synthetic elp solution without ctab surfactant these experimental investigations were conducted for 50 300 mg l 1 pd ii solution concentration and 298 333 k temperature and for fixed choice of 2 ph 1 6 g l 1 adsorbent dosage and 780 min contact time at 298 k the pd ii capacity and removal varied from 24 62 83 06 mg g 1 and 78 78 44 3 respectively for lewatit tp 214 resin these trends have been depicted in fig 2c and d respectively these experiments were conducted with 50 300 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration and 298 308 k temperature and fixed choice of ph 8 adsorbent dosage 2 g l 1 and contact time 300 min for the resin the pd ii capacity and removal varied from 21 21 105 46 mg g 1 and 84 82 70 30 respectively thus as affirmed from theoretical insights higher concentrations reduced removal the temperature effect on noble metal adsorptive characteristics for both resins is in agreement with the theoretical insight i e lower removal values have been obtained at higher temperature 60 90 33 48 at 333 k and 60 08 40 75 at 308 k than those obtained at lower temperature 78 78 44 30 at 298 k for amberlyst a21 and 84 82 70 30 at 298 k for lewatit tp 214 resin 3 2 effect of ctab on pd ii uptake experimental investigations were conducted for fixed choice of pd solution concentration 50 300 mg l 1 temperature 298 k ph 8 adsorbent dosage 2 g l 1 and contact time 300 min for 2 cmc critical micelle concentration ctab surfactant concentration for the lewatit tp 214 resin pd ii metal uptake and removal efficiency varied from 22 25 120 79 mg g 1 and 88 98 80 52 respectively for amberlyst a21 resin the experiments were carried out for fixed choice of pd solution concentration 50 300 mg l 1 temperature 298 k ph 2 adsorbent dosage 1 6 g l 1 and contact time 780 min for the said resin pd ii metal uptake and removal efficiency varied from 25 24 92 21 mg g 1 and 80 76 49 18 respectively these values are marginally higher than those obtained with synthetic elp solutions that did not contain ctab surfactant the possible reason for such marginal enhancement is due to the potential role of ctab in altering surface characteristics to favour adsorption 9 16 since there is a marginal enhancement existence of ctab surfactant in the elp solution system is inferred to not detrimentally influence pd ii sorptive characteristics of the said resins 3 3 role of edta on kinetic equilibrium and thermodynamic pd ii uptake parameters pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models were considered to evaluate upon their fitness to represent pertinent kinetics of the pd ii adsorption process the pseudo first order model eq 3 is expressed as 21 3 log q e q t logq e k 1 t 2 303 where qt qe and k1 are time dependent pd ii adsorption capacity mg g 1 equilibrium pd ii adsorption capacity mg g 1 and pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the pseudo second order model eq 4 is expressed as 22 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant the intraparticle diffusion model is expressed as eq 5 5 q t k id t 0 5 where kid is the rate constant evaluated based on intraparticle diffusion model fitness plots for the above kinetic models have been presented in fig 3 a f relevant parameters obtained from the fitness plots are summarized in table 2 fig 3a and b illustrates lack of fitness of pseudo first order model to measured pd ii batch equilibrium adsorption data the best fitness corresponds to pseudo second order model with a regression coefficient greater than 0 95 fig 3c and d further the model based adsorption capacity was in agreement with the adsorption capacity determined from experimental data therefore pseudo second order model has been inferred to be the best fit to represent the kinetics of pd ii adsorption from synthetic elp solutions onto both commercial resins also fig 4 e and f conveys that intraparticle diffusion plot has multi linear plots in distinct phases and the fit plots did not meet the graph at its origin these trends affirm that intraparticle diffusion cannot be rate limiting step for the pd ii sorptive process and several diffusional steps exist to represent pd ii adsorption kinetics the intercept c conveys extent of boundary layer thickness i e the larger the intercept greater the boundary layer effect the batch equilibrium adsorption data was analysed using langmuir isotherm model which hypothesizes monolayer pd ii adsorption onto the adsorbent active sites to evaluate the adsorption process the data was also analysed using freundlich isotherm model which hypothesizes multilayer pd ii adsorption based on the assumption of uniform energy surface heterogeneity the langmuir isotherm model is expressed as eq 6 23 6 c e q e c e q o 1 bq o where qe and ce are equilibrium pd ii adsorption capacity mg g 1 and equilibrium pd ii solution concentration mg l 1 respectively in the above expression qo and b correspond to maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 and langmuir constant respectively using b and initial pd ii solution concentration dimensionless equilibrium parameter r l 1 1 bc o is evaluated to infer favourable or unfavourable adsorption the linearized freundlich isotherm model eq 7 is expressed as 24 7 log q e log k f 1 n logc e where kf and n are freundlich constants and are represent adsorption capacity and intensity respectively the corresponding fitness plots for langmuir and freundlich isotherm are depicted in fig 4a and b respectively table 3 summarizes relevant model parameters and regression coefficient r2 both figure and table confirm best fitness of langmuir model with the measured batch equilibrium data table 3 confirms a rl value of 0 1 and this affirms that the elp commercial resin system is favourable for adsorption based pd ii recovery the thermodynamic behaviour of the adsorption process was evaluated by determining thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy δh kj mol 1 entropy δs kj mol 1 k 1 and gibbs free energy change δg kj mol 1 these were evaluated using following expressions eqs 8 10 25 8 k c c ae c e 9 ln k c δ s o r δ h o rt 10 δ g o δ h o t δ s o where cae ce r and t refer to pd ii equilibrium concentration mg l 1 pd ii solution concentration mg l 1 gas constant and adsorption temperature k respectively fig 4c and d depicts thermodynamic behaviour of the adsorption process table 4 summarizes relevant parameters obtained for the van t hoff s model the table affirms negative δg values to confirm spontaneous pd ii adsorption and negative δh values to confirm exothermic adsorption process a comparative assessment of obtained results with those presented in the relevant literatures is summarized in table 5 as presented significantly lower pd ii adsorption characteristics were obtained for the lewatit resin with elp solutions the literature refers to lewatit tp 214 resin whose adsorptive performance for 195 mg l 1 pd concentration was 171 9 205 6 and 285 45 306 7 mg g 1 for chloride and chloride nitrate model solutions respectively 14 in this work for the synthetic elp solution lower metal uptake values of 21 21 105 46 mg g 1 were obtained for 50 300 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration thus it can be inferred that additives such as disodium edta and nh4oh have a significant effect in altering adsorption characteristics of the lewatit tp 214 resin however it is important to note that the reduction in adsorption capacity is not as significant as that of the commercial activated carbon for ni ii adsorption from synthetic elp solution for the case addressed by our research group the maximum adsorption capacity of 17 75 mg g 1 has been achieved for a solution concentration of 500 mg l 1 which is considerably lower than the adsorption capacity of 98 07 mg g 1 obtained for ni ii aqueous solutions at 300 mg l 1 solution concentration 9 thus it is apparent that the lewatit tp 214 resin is much more effective than the commercial activated carbon adsorbent this is due to the existence of relevant functional groups that facilitate pd adsorption in the presence of additives such as na2edta however this hypothesis needs to be further verified by conducting desorption studies for amberlyst a21 resin better results were obtained in comparison with the literature data the literature refers to adsorption capacities of 0 029 0 012 mg g 1 for 1 0 m nacl with 100 mg l 1 pd ii solutions prepared with 0 1 2 0 m hcl media 12 in this work for the synthetic elp solution higher metal uptake values of 24 62 83 06 mg g 1were obtained for 50 300 mg l 1 pd ii solution concentration thus it can be easily inferred that additives such as disodium edta and nh4oh didn t detrimentally influence the adsorption characteristics of the amberlyst a21 resin this was not the case for lewatit tp 214 resin 3 4 characterization of commercial resins 3 4 1 functional group analysis using ftir spectroscopy fig 5 illustrates the ftir spectral profiles of fresh and pd loaded for amberlyst a21 resin the ch stretching vibrations of alkane was observed at a wavelength range of 3000 2850 cm 1 fig 5a at a frequency of 1360 1080 cm 1 cn stretching vibrations of amine has been observed subsequently at 1680 1620 1600 1400 and 1000 675 cm 1 frequencies cc stretching vibrations of conjugated alkene aromatic stretching vibrations of cc and ch bending vibrations of alkene were observed respectively however for pd ii loaded amberlyst a21 fig 5b significant shift in the spectral peaks were observed in 3000 2850 1680 1620 1600 1400 1360 1080 and 1000 675 cm 1 wavelength range noticeable new peaks were observed at 1945 and 1738 cm 1 and this is due to the affinity or bonding of pd ii with the nh group 26 27 fig 6 illustrates the ftir spectral profiles of fresh and pd loaded lewatit tp 214 resin samples the cc stretching vibration was found at a wavelength of 1545 cm 1 fig 6a a broad peak at 3400 3200 cm 1 confirms asymmetric and symmetric bonds of nh2 groups of thiouronium at a frequency of 2919 cm 1 ch stretching vibrations was observed the bands related to the functional group of lewatit tp 214 do also exist at 1108 cm 1 which is related to the deformation band of nh2groups δ nh2 the cs stretching vibration at 703 cm 1 do exist and the peaks at 1460 1210 cm 1 refer to the combined cn and c s bond ν cn cs 28 however for pd ii loaded lewatit tp 214 fig 6b significant shift in the spectral speaks were observed this may be due of the affinity or bonding of pd ii with both nh2 and s groups 3 4 2 field emission scanning microscopy equipped energy dispersive x ray analysis fig 7 a d depicts the fesem micrograph and edx spectra of fresh and pd loaded amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively the edx spectra of amberlyst a21 fig 7a confirm the presence of c 85 8 atomic weight cl 9 8 atomic weight and n 4 4 atomic weight the edx spectra of lewatit tp 214 fig 7c confirm presence of c 80 5 atomic weight o 14 2 atomic weight s 4 2 atomic weight and n 1 1 atomic weight the edx spectra confirm presence of o s and n elements which according to hsab theory are very important to adsorption of pd ii from waste streams 29 fig 7b and d shows the fesem micrograph and edx spectra of pd loaded amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively based on the edx spectra pd atomic weight was about 2 4 and 9 8 for amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively the edx also confirms upon the existence of other elements such as c 66 7 atomic weight n 14 8 atomic weight o 12 7 atomic weight and cl 3 5 atomic weight for amberlyst a21 resin for the case of lewatit tp 214 resin other elements such as c 69 5 atomic weight o 12 2 atomic weight s 6 0 atomic weight and cl 2 5 atomic weight exist the enhanced atomic weight of pd is probably due to its binding with both amine and sulfur functional groups in lewatit tp 214 which is not the case for the amberlyst a21 resin that possesses only amine groups 3 4 3 mechanisms of pd adsorption fig 8 depicts the pd ii adsorption mechanisms associated to both commercial resins the mechanism has been presented based on functional group chemistry and speciation analysis of pd ii in variant ph conditions 16 17 at low ph ph 2 which was obtained as optimal value amine groups in amberlyst a21 resin undergo protonation and form a complex with oh ions that exist in the prevalent pd edta 2 complex fig 8a lewatit tp 214 consists of keto enol tautomer thiourea functional groups the interactions of thiol form functional group with pd complex at a ph of 8 optimal value based on batch adsorption experiments is presented in fig 8b this involves the release of proton from functional group thiol form in the presence of naoh and subsequent complexation with pd nh3 4 2 species the amine group in the thione functional group also could release the proton in the presence of naoh and forms a complex with pd nh3 4 2 at an optimal ph of 8 fig 8c 3 5 pd ii desorption characteristics and mechanisms desorption experiments were conducted for both resins to recover pd ii using media prepared with various eluents for the amberlyst resin after adsorption experiments an average capacity of 85 94 mg g 1 has been evaluated based on desorption experiments and mass balance maximum desorption was obtained as 66 24 with 0 1n n ch2ch3 3 eluent and 66 95 with 0 1n hcl for amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively table 6 summarizes the pd ii desorption efficiencies for various eluent concentrations reasonable desorption was obtained for other eluent systems prepared with common acids and bases considering solution complexity of elp solutions and deployed eluent systems these desorption values are reasonably satisfactory from the perspective of pd ii recovery and reuse for the case of pd recovery with amberlyst a21 the amine groups in the n ch2ch3 3 triethyl amine eluent exhibit a stronger affinity due to the formation of a complex with pd edta 2 at higher ph fig 9a however naoh can be regarded as a better choice for the desorption of amberlyst a21 resin given the fact that it is highly inexpensive in comparison with n ch2ch3 3 and reasonably acceptable desorption efficiency 59 66 were obtained with naoh eluent both the thiol fig 9 b and thione fig 9c forms of the functional group undergo protonation in an acidic condition and the pd nh3 4 2 thione thiol complex is broken thereby it leads to a better desorption efficiency for lewatit tp 214 4 conclusions this work provided several important and new insights with respect to applicability of commercial resins for pd ii recovery from synthetic elp solutions that are characterized to have moderate solution chemistry complexity firstly for both considered commercial resins lewatit tp 214 and amberlyst a21 synthetic elp solutions provided significantly lower performance in terms of pd ii adsorption characteristics and this is due to the inhibitory role of additives such as na2edta and nh4oh in binding pd ii to the adsorbent active sites secondly among both resins lewatit tp 214 performed superior than amberlyst a21 in terms of optimal ph 8 but not 2 contact time 300 but not 780 min and marginally inferior value of adsorbent dosage 2 but not 1 6 g l 1 thirdly langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model have been inferred to represent pertinent equilibrium and kinetic data of pd ii adsorption fourthly ctab surfactant has been evaluated to marginally enhance pd ii adsorption characteristics for both resins both resins provided satisfactory performance in terms of desorption characteristics however lewatit tp 214 provided better adsorption capacity at higher solution concentration speciation analysis was confirming to hypothesis correlated to optimal ph with reasonable desorption characteristics about 55 66 removal lewatit tp 214 is inferred to be the best adsorbent for commercial application towards pd ii recovery and reuse from spent elp solutions with and without ctab surfactant speciation studies further provided deeper insights into pertinent adsorption and desorption mechanisms at optimal ph values of the adsorbent adsorbate system free amine and sulphur groups prevalent in the resin structure have been evaluated to have potential role in providing better combinations of pd ii adsorption and desorption characteristics this was not the case for the other resin which only had amine groups in summary optimality of moderate ph contact time and adsorbent dosage followed with better performance at higher initial pd ii concentrations and satisfactory desorption performance can be regarded to be important benchmarks for noble metal recovery and reuse with lewatit tp 214 resin from spent elp solutions

14595,deliberating upon the role of solution chemistry complexity protonation speciation and pertinent functional groups on the adsorption desorption characteristics this work targets the efficacy of lewatit tp 214 and amberlyst a21 commercial anion exchange resins for pd ii recovery and reuse from synthetic electroless plating elp solutions for both resins batch adsorption experiments involved optimality of ph contact time adsorbent dosage followed with concentration effect and kinetic studies equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic models were considered for their fitness with the obtained pd ii batch adsorption characteristics among both resins lewatit tp 214 resin provided better performance in terms of adsorption and desorption characteristics along with optimal combinations of ph 8 equilibrium time 300 min and adsorbent dosage 2 g l 1 overall both resins provided significantly lower pd ii absorption capacity and removal for elp systems in comparison with aqueous solutions this is due to the inhibitory role of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid edta and ammonia during pd ii binding with active sites on the resins the obtained desorption characteristics and associated pd ii adsorption and desorption mechanisms are promising to further commercial application of the said resins keywords palladium adsorption desorption lewatit tp 214 amberlyst a21 electroless plating

palladium recovery from such resources is of industrial and commercial significance 1 2 several conventional chemical precipitation adsorption leaching ion exchange electrolysis and electrochemical

convey among the above mentioned technologies research commercialization is an additional challenging task from the perspective of environmental sustainability cost efficacy and recovery 7 among few competent and capable technologies to address research commercialization avenues chelating and ion exchange resins that target reversible chemisorption are most relevant materials to efficiently recover noble metals such as pd from spent streams characterized with low concentrations in addition biopolymers such as chitosan have been suggested to be competitive to synthetic chelating resins given their promising features such as production ease good separation characteristics and affordable cost 8 chemisorption facilitates better desorption characteristics by suitably deploying a reagent to recover pd ii from spent chelated resin and thereby enables simultaneous minimization of waste resin generation resource utility and enhancement in noble metal recovery thereby due to poor desorption characteristics commercial physisorbents such as activated carbon have been proven to be ineffective despite possessing good adsorption characteristics 9 hence commercial resins possessing better desorption characteristics need to be explored for industrial applicability as conventional adsorbents such as activated carbon and biopolymers such as chitosan and modified chitosan polymers have been proven to have poor desorption characteristics in the field of chelating resin applicability for pd ii recovery materials engineering and fitness of resins with complex chemistry solutions have been prominent research themes till date investigations till date explored prominent commercial resins 717 anion exchange lewatit monoplus tp 220 amberlyst a21 a29 lewatit tp 214 and duolite gt 73 etc for pd ii adsorption desorption 10 14 these investigations provided variegated insights firstly cu ii and zn ii did not influence pd ii uptake characteristics of lewatit tp 214 macroporous chelating resin 13 secondly lewatit tp 214 thiourea functional group containing chelating resin possessed better affinity than duolite gt 73 cationic ion exchanger with thiol functional group for pd ii recovery from both mono and binary solutions 14 thirdly amberlyst a21 weak basic resin containing n ch3 2 group and amberlyst a29 strong basic resin having n ch3 2c2h4oh group were analyzed for pd ii recovery from hcl nacl solutions the adsorption of pd ii chloro complex species from acidic chloride solutions was strongly favoured by amberlyst a21 but not with a29 resin 12 in summary it can be seen that commercial resins have been explored for pd ii recovery from chloride and aqueous feed solutions with minimal solution chemistry complexity 15 s n and o functional group containing commercial resins were explored for pd ii adsorption from aqueous solutions but not with solutions possessing stabilizers and surfactants at variant ph that strongly interfere with the pd ii adsorption characteristics the role of ph solute concentration and chloride ion concentration have been targeted for few resins without referring to the relevance or irrelevance of speciation in influencing pd ii adsorption characteristics in other words solution chemistry complexity needs to be given utmost significance in ongoing experimental investigations for commercial resins applicability towards pd ii recovery and reuse such investigations will be effective to promote industrial and commercial applicability of the said resins to mitigate hazard scenario and recover noble metal simultaneously among various solution systems with solution chemistry complex pd ii electroless plating elp solutions have fair complexity due to their constitution of ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid edta as stabilizer and ammonia 16 17 these constituents along with ph variation are reasonably complex to alter speciation mechanism associated to pd ii adsorption and can detrimentally or favorably alter both adsorption and desorption characteristics of pd ii onto commercial resins the literature does not refer to such cases where speciation studies involved easy analysis due to consideration of simpler solutions such as aqueous or chloride solutions also non toxic eluents such as solutions prepared with common bases and acids were not targeted for desorption studies in other words the ongoing research activity in the applicability of commercial resins for pd ii recovery is highly restrictive neither solution chemistry complexity nor simplistic eluent media have been targeted which are all prominent issues to further research commercialization of said resins for pd ii recovery and reuse considering the exploration of solution chemistry complexity role in influencing pd ii adsorption characteristics of commercial resins as a primary objective this work targets the efficacy of amberlyst a21 and lewatit monoplus tp 214 commercial resins as they have been proven to be highly effective for pd ii recovery 12 14 subsequently equilibrium kinetic and thermodynamic modeling studies have been conducted further cetrimonium bromide surfactant ctab as an additive in the electroless plating elp solutions was also targeted for its role in influencing pd ii sorption capacity of the commercial resins 2 materials and methods 2 1 chemicals amberlyst a21 and lewatit monoplus tp 214 resins were purchased from sigma aldrich corporation bangalore india 99 pdcl2 was obtained from srl chemicals pvt ltd india na2edta and 25 nh4oh reagents were purchased from merck india millipore water milliq was used to prepare synthetic elp solutions along with analytical grade hno3 and naoh merck india reagents for both commercial resins physiochemical properties have been summarized in table 1 2 2 instrumentation atomic absorption spectrophotometer aas varian spectra aa 220fs netherland was used to determine initial and final pd ii metal ion concentrations based on absorbance of samples measured at 244 6 nm the pertinent functional groups in raw commercial and pd loaded commercial resins were determined using fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer ftir shimadzu ir affinity1 japan within the wavenumber range of 4000 400 cm 1 the presence of pd metal ions on resins samples procured after adsorption studies was ensured using field emission scanning electron microscope equipped with energy dispersive x ray analysis fesem edx zeiss sigma germany ph measurement was carried out using a ph meter vsi 301 vsi electronics pvt limited india 2 3 preparation of edta containing elp solutions elp solutions with edta were prepared as per compositions mentioned in our earlier work 9 16 17 for all cases the na2edta solution concentration is 1 39 g l 1 the stock pd ii solutions were prepared by mixing precise amounts of chemicals in 1000 ml deionized water for 15 min in an orbital shaker at 120 rpm batch adsorption experiments were conducted with 50 300 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentrations 2 4 pd ii batch adsorption characteristics in presence of edta 50 ml pd ii elp solutions of desired initial concentration were taken in 250 ml conical flasks thereafter specific amount of adsorbent was added and the mixture was kept in an orbital shaker at 250 rpm and 298 k ph contact time adsorbent dosage temperature and initial metal ion concentration have been chosen as adsorption process parameters which were optimized based on the conventional methodology to conduct the adsorption experiments this involved varying one of these parameters for fixed choice of all other parameters after completion of set contact time whatman filter paper no 1 pore size 11 μm was deployed for filtration and the filtrate was analysed for final pd ii solution concentration with aas equipment for all experimental investigations sampling involved a minimal of three samples for experiment followed with average value determination the following expressions eqs 1 and 2 were used to determine the removal and adsorption capacity qe of the commercial resins 1 removal c o c e c o 100 2 adsorption capacity c o c e w v mg g 1 where co ce w and v are initial pd ii solution concentration mg l 1 equilibrium pd ii solution concentration mg l 1 adsorbent mass g and solution volume l respectively batch pd ii adsorption data and isotherms were evaluated at optimal solution ph and variant initial pd ii concentrations 50 300 mg l 1 and temperatures with other parameters chosen at their optimal choice kinetic analysis was carried out at 250 rpm and 50 mg l 1 pd ii initial concentration these experiments involved collection of liquid samples at precise time intervals before reaching equilibrium contact time to determine the intermediate pd ii concentrations 2 5 batch desorption study using pd ii adsorbed resins eluents such as naoh koh n ch2ch3 3 and hcl were deployed at desired solution concentrations to determine desorption characteristics the experimentation involved washing of pd ii loaded resin prepared with 50 mg l samples in several cycles using deionized water thereafter specific quantities of resins were kept in stoppered reagent bottles and specific quantity of eluent volume 50 ml was added and the mixture was subjected to mechanical shaking 200 rpm for stipulated time interval at room temperature eventually the final pd ii solution concentration was measured for the determination of desorption based pd ii metal recovery the metal recovery for reuse was evaluated using a mass balance expression of the number of moles of pd ii existent before and after desorption 3 results and discussion 3 1 adsorption characteristics fig 1 a and b illustrates the effect of ph on the pd ii adsorptive performance of amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively these experiments were conducted at 720 min contact time 1 g l 1 adsorbent dosage and 50 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration for amberlyst a21 resin and corresponding values of 180 min 0 6 g l 1 and 50 mg l 1 for lewatit tp 214 resin these variations in the range of adsorption process parameters were based on trial and error approaches to achieve appreciable pd ii uptake from the figures it can be observed that the optimal removal efficiency and adsorption capacity were obtained as 75 85 and 37 92 mg g 1 at 2 ph for amberlyst a21 resin and 84 56 and 70 46 mg g 1 at 8 ph for lewatit tp 214 resin in our earlier work 16 17 the speciation effects of ph variation have been presented as follows in synthetic elp solutions pd ii can exist in several forms such as pd edta 2 pdcl4 2 pdcl3 pdcl2 aq pdcl pd nh3 4 2 and pd nh3 3 2 16 however only pd edta 2 exists in lower ph range 1 6 and higher chloride concentrations on the other hand at higher ph basic media pd ii exists as pd nh3 4 2 given pd ii adsorptive capacity being maximum at optimal ph of 8 for the lewatit tp 214 resin at lower ph it is hypothesized that stronger bonding of nh and s groups in the resin with pd nh3 4 2 but not pd edta 2 is responsible for non optimal adsorption capacity also protonation effect additionally contributes to effective anion binding at lower ph 18 20 for amberlyst a21 resin the maximum adsorptive capacity was obtained at 2 ph for this observation it is hypothesized that stronger bonding of nh3 group in the resin with pd edta 2 in the lower ph range 1 6 nh2 groups of the resin undergo protonation and the protonated groups exhibit high affinity towards pd edta 2 species due to this reason the resin exhibits higher adsorption capacities in the lower ph range hence speciation can be visualized as an important tool for the identification of relevant species that either exists in abundance or not at various solution chemistry conditions and their subsequent interaction with the commercial resin functional groups in other words speciation analysis is a very useful tool to deduce adsorption mechanism for complex solution chemistry systems further confirmation of pd ii binding at various sites would be addressed in the characterization section of the article for amberlyst a21 resin adsorbent dosage experiments were conducted at 2 ph 50 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration and 720 min contact time at optimal adsorbent dosage of 1 6 g l 1 the adsorption capacity of 25 62 mg g 1 and 81 98 removal were obtained for the resin fig 1c higher dosage provided higher adsorption capacity due to an increase in active sites available for pd sorption corresponding reduction in metal removal was due to the reduction in metal quantity adsorbed per unit gram of adsorbent at higher adsorbent dosage fig 1d depicts pd ii adsorptive performance of amberlyst a21 resin for a variation in contact time these experiments were conducted at 1 6 g l 1 50 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration and 2 ph for the adsorbent the maximum adsorption capacity 24 62 mg g 1 was obtained at 780 min along with 78 78 metal removal fig 1e shows the variation in removal and adsorption capacity mg g 1 with contact time for the lewatit tp 214 resin these data were obtained at 8 ph 0 6 g l 1 adsorbent dosage and 50 mg l 1 pd ii initial concentration the maximum removal of 85 52 and relevant adsorptive capacity of 71 27 mg g 1 were obtained at an optimal equilibrium time of 300 min for the resin the later experiments involved evaluation of adsorbent dosage effect on pd ii adsorption characteristics for these experiments 8 ph 50 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration and 300 min contact time were chosen these experiments inferred a maximum adsorbent dosage of 2 g l 1 at which 21 21 mg g 1 adsorption capacity and 84 82 removal were obtained for the resin fig 1f reasons associated to these trends are similar to those presented previously for the amberlyst a21 resin fig 2 a and b illustrates the effect of initial pd ii concentration and temperature on the adsorptive performance of amberlyst a21 resin with synthetic elp solution without ctab surfactant these experimental investigations were conducted for 50 300 mg l 1 pd ii solution concentration and 298 333 k temperature and for fixed choice of 2 ph 1 6 g l 1 adsorbent dosage and 780 min contact time at 298 k the pd ii capacity and removal varied from 24 62 83 06 mg g 1 and 78 78 44 3 respectively for lewatit tp 214 resin these trends have been depicted in fig 2c and d respectively these experiments were conducted with 50 300 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration and 298 308 k temperature and fixed choice of ph 8 adsorbent dosage 2 g l 1 and contact time 300 min for the resin the pd ii capacity and removal varied from 21 21 105 46 mg g 1 and 84 82 70 30 respectively thus as affirmed from theoretical insights higher concentrations reduced removal the temperature effect on noble metal adsorptive characteristics for both resins is in agreement with the theoretical insight i e lower removal values have been obtained at higher temperature 60 90 33 48 at 333 k and 60 08 40 75 at 308 k than those obtained at lower temperature 78 78 44 30 at 298 k for amberlyst a21 and 84 82 70 30 at 298 k for lewatit tp 214 resin 3 2 effect of ctab on pd ii uptake experimental investigations were conducted for fixed choice of pd solution concentration 50 300 mg l 1 temperature 298 k ph 8 adsorbent dosage 2 g l 1 and contact time 300 min for 2 cmc critical micelle concentration ctab surfactant concentration for the lewatit tp 214 resin pd ii metal uptake and removal efficiency varied from 22 25 120 79 mg g 1 and 88 98 80 52 respectively for amberlyst a21 resin the experiments were carried out for fixed choice of pd solution concentration 50 300 mg l 1 temperature 298 k ph 2 adsorbent dosage 1 6 g l 1 and contact time 780 min for the said resin pd ii metal uptake and removal efficiency varied from 25 24 92 21 mg g 1 and 80 76 49 18 respectively these values are marginally higher than those obtained with synthetic elp solutions that did not contain ctab surfactant the possible reason for such marginal enhancement is due to the potential role of ctab in altering surface characteristics to favour adsorption 9 16 since there is a marginal enhancement existence of ctab surfactant in the elp solution system is inferred to not detrimentally influence pd ii sorptive characteristics of the said resins 3 3 role of edta on kinetic equilibrium and thermodynamic pd ii uptake parameters pseudo first order pseudo second order and intraparticle diffusion models were considered to evaluate upon their fitness to represent pertinent kinetics of the pd ii adsorption process the pseudo first order model eq 3 is expressed as 21 3 log q e q t logq e k 1 t 2 303 where qt qe and k1 are time dependent pd ii adsorption capacity mg g 1 equilibrium pd ii adsorption capacity mg g 1 and pseudo first order rate constant min 1 the pseudo second order model eq 4 is expressed as 22 4 t q t 1 k 2 q e 2 t q e where k2 g mg 1 min 1 is the pseudo second order rate constant the intraparticle diffusion model is expressed as eq 5 5 q t k id t 0 5 where kid is the rate constant evaluated based on intraparticle diffusion model fitness plots for the above kinetic models have been presented in fig 3 a f relevant parameters obtained from the fitness plots are summarized in table 2 fig 3a and b illustrates lack of fitness of pseudo first order model to measured pd ii batch equilibrium adsorption data the best fitness corresponds to pseudo second order model with a regression coefficient greater than 0 95 fig 3c and d further the model based adsorption capacity was in agreement with the adsorption capacity determined from experimental data therefore pseudo second order model has been inferred to be the best fit to represent the kinetics of pd ii adsorption from synthetic elp solutions onto both commercial resins also fig 4 e and f conveys that intraparticle diffusion plot has multi linear plots in distinct phases and the fit plots did not meet the graph at its origin these trends affirm that intraparticle diffusion cannot be rate limiting step for the pd ii sorptive process and several diffusional steps exist to represent pd ii adsorption kinetics the intercept c conveys extent of boundary layer thickness i e the larger the intercept greater the boundary layer effect the batch equilibrium adsorption data was analysed using langmuir isotherm model which hypothesizes monolayer pd ii adsorption onto the adsorbent active sites to evaluate the adsorption process the data was also analysed using freundlich isotherm model which hypothesizes multilayer pd ii adsorption based on the assumption of uniform energy surface heterogeneity the langmuir isotherm model is expressed as eq 6 23 6 c e q e c e q o 1 bq o where qe and ce are equilibrium pd ii adsorption capacity mg g 1 and equilibrium pd ii solution concentration mg l 1 respectively in the above expression qo and b correspond to maximum adsorption capacity mg g 1 and langmuir constant respectively using b and initial pd ii solution concentration dimensionless equilibrium parameter r l 1 1 bc o is evaluated to infer favourable or unfavourable adsorption the linearized freundlich isotherm model eq 7 is expressed as 24 7 log q e log k f 1 n logc e where kf and n are freundlich constants and are represent adsorption capacity and intensity respectively the corresponding fitness plots for langmuir and freundlich isotherm are depicted in fig 4a and b respectively table 3 summarizes relevant model parameters and regression coefficient r2 both figure and table confirm best fitness of langmuir model with the measured batch equilibrium data table 3 confirms a rl value of 0 1 and this affirms that the elp commercial resin system is favourable for adsorption based pd ii recovery the thermodynamic behaviour of the adsorption process was evaluated by determining thermodynamic parameters such as enthalpy δh kj mol 1 entropy δs kj mol 1 k 1 and gibbs free energy change δg kj mol 1 these were evaluated using following expressions eqs 8 10 25 8 k c c ae c e 9 ln k c δ s o r δ h o rt 10 δ g o δ h o t δ s o where cae ce r and t refer to pd ii equilibrium concentration mg l 1 pd ii solution concentration mg l 1 gas constant and adsorption temperature k respectively fig 4c and d depicts thermodynamic behaviour of the adsorption process table 4 summarizes relevant parameters obtained for the van t hoff s model the table affirms negative δg values to confirm spontaneous pd ii adsorption and negative δh values to confirm exothermic adsorption process a comparative assessment of obtained results with those presented in the relevant literatures is summarized in table 5 as presented significantly lower pd ii adsorption characteristics were obtained for the lewatit resin with elp solutions the literature refers to lewatit tp 214 resin whose adsorptive performance for 195 mg l 1 pd concentration was 171 9 205 6 and 285 45 306 7 mg g 1 for chloride and chloride nitrate model solutions respectively 14 in this work for the synthetic elp solution lower metal uptake values of 21 21 105 46 mg g 1 were obtained for 50 300 mg l 1 initial pd ii concentration thus it can be inferred that additives such as disodium edta and nh4oh have a significant effect in altering adsorption characteristics of the lewatit tp 214 resin however it is important to note that the reduction in adsorption capacity is not as significant as that of the commercial activated carbon for ni ii adsorption from synthetic elp solution for the case addressed by our research group the maximum adsorption capacity of 17 75 mg g 1 has been achieved for a solution concentration of 500 mg l 1 which is considerably lower than the adsorption capacity of 98 07 mg g 1 obtained for ni ii aqueous solutions at 300 mg l 1 solution concentration 9 thus it is apparent that the lewatit tp 214 resin is much more effective than the commercial activated carbon adsorbent this is due to the existence of relevant functional groups that facilitate pd adsorption in the presence of additives such as na2edta however this hypothesis needs to be further verified by conducting desorption studies for amberlyst a21 resin better results were obtained in comparison with the literature data the literature refers to adsorption capacities of 0 029 0 012 mg g 1 for 1 0 m nacl with 100 mg l 1 pd ii solutions prepared with 0 1 2 0 m hcl media 12 in this work for the synthetic elp solution higher metal uptake values of 24 62 83 06 mg g 1were obtained for 50 300 mg l 1 pd ii solution concentration thus it can be easily inferred that additives such as disodium edta and nh4oh didn t detrimentally influence the adsorption characteristics of the amberlyst a21 resin this was not the case for lewatit tp 214 resin 3 4 characterization of commercial resins 3 4 1 functional group analysis using ftir spectroscopy fig 5 illustrates the ftir spectral profiles of fresh and pd loaded for amberlyst a21 resin the ch stretching vibrations of alkane was observed at a wavelength range of 3000 2850 cm 1 fig 5a at a frequency of 1360 1080 cm 1 cn stretching vibrations of amine has been observed subsequently at 1680 1620 1600 1400 and 1000 675 cm 1 frequencies cc stretching vibrations of conjugated alkene aromatic stretching vibrations of cc and ch bending vibrations of alkene were observed respectively however for pd ii loaded amberlyst a21 fig 5b significant shift in the spectral peaks were observed in 3000 2850 1680 1620 1600 1400 1360 1080 and 1000 675 cm 1 wavelength range noticeable new peaks were observed at 1945 and 1738 cm 1 and this is due to the affinity or bonding of pd ii with the nh group 26 27 fig 6 illustrates the ftir spectral profiles of fresh and pd loaded lewatit tp 214 resin samples the cc stretching vibration was found at a wavelength of 1545 cm 1 fig 6a a broad peak at 3400 3200 cm 1 confirms asymmetric and symmetric bonds of nh2 groups of thiouronium at a frequency of 2919 cm 1 ch stretching vibrations was observed the bands related to the functional group of lewatit tp 214 do also exist at 1108 cm 1 which is related to the deformation band of nh2groups δ nh2 the cs stretching vibration at 703 cm 1 do exist and the peaks at 1460 1210 cm 1 refer to the combined cn and c s bond ν cn cs 28 however for pd ii loaded lewatit tp 214 fig 6b significant shift in the spectral speaks were observed this may be due of the affinity or bonding of pd ii with both nh2 and s groups 3 4 2 field emission scanning microscopy equipped energy dispersive x ray analysis fig 7 a d depicts the fesem micrograph and edx spectra of fresh and pd loaded amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively the edx spectra of amberlyst a21 fig 7a confirm the presence of c 85 8 atomic weight cl 9 8 atomic weight and n 4 4 atomic weight the edx spectra of lewatit tp 214 fig 7c confirm presence of c 80 5 atomic weight o 14 2 atomic weight s 4 2 atomic weight and n 1 1 atomic weight the edx spectra confirm presence of o s and n elements which according to hsab theory are very important to adsorption of pd ii from waste streams 29 fig 7b and d shows the fesem micrograph and edx spectra of pd loaded amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively based on the edx spectra pd atomic weight was about 2 4 and 9 8 for amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively the edx also confirms upon the existence of other elements such as c 66 7 atomic weight n 14 8 atomic weight o 12 7 atomic weight and cl 3 5 atomic weight for amberlyst a21 resin for the case of lewatit tp 214 resin other elements such as c 69 5 atomic weight o 12 2 atomic weight s 6 0 atomic weight and cl 2 5 atomic weight exist the enhanced atomic weight of pd is probably due to its binding with both amine and sulfur functional groups in lewatit tp 214 which is not the case for the amberlyst a21 resin that possesses only amine groups 3 4 3 mechanisms of pd adsorption fig 8 depicts the pd ii adsorption mechanisms associated to both commercial resins the mechanism has been presented based on functional group chemistry and speciation analysis of pd ii in variant ph conditions 16 17 at low ph ph 2 which was obtained as optimal value amine groups in amberlyst a21 resin undergo protonation and form a complex with oh ions that exist in the prevalent pd edta 2 complex fig 8a lewatit tp 214 consists of keto enol tautomer thiourea functional groups the interactions of thiol form functional group with pd complex at a ph of 8 optimal value based on batch adsorption experiments is presented in fig 8b this involves the release of proton from functional group thiol form in the presence of naoh and subsequent complexation with pd nh3 4 2 species the amine group in the thione functional group also could release the proton in the presence of naoh and forms a complex with pd nh3 4 2 at an optimal ph of 8 fig 8c 3 5 pd ii desorption characteristics and mechanisms desorption experiments were conducted for both resins to recover pd ii using media prepared with various eluents for the amberlyst resin after adsorption experiments an average capacity of 85 94 mg g 1 has been evaluated based on desorption experiments and mass balance maximum desorption was obtained as 66 24 with 0 1n n ch2ch3 3 eluent and 66 95 with 0 1n hcl for amberlyst a21 and lewatit tp 214 resins respectively table 6 summarizes the pd ii desorption efficiencies for various eluent concentrations reasonable desorption was obtained for other eluent systems prepared with common acids and bases considering solution complexity of elp solutions and deployed eluent systems these desorption values are reasonably satisfactory from the perspective of pd ii recovery and reuse for the case of pd recovery with amberlyst a21 the amine groups in the n ch2ch3 3 triethyl amine eluent exhibit a stronger affinity due to the formation of a complex with pd edta 2 at higher ph fig 9a however naoh can be regarded as a better choice for the desorption of amberlyst a21 resin given the fact that it is highly inexpensive in comparison with n ch2ch3 3 and reasonably acceptable desorption efficiency 59 66 were obtained with naoh eluent both the thiol fig 9 b and thione fig 9c forms of the functional group undergo protonation in an acidic condition and the pd nh3 4 2 thione thiol complex is broken thereby it leads to a better desorption efficiency for lewatit tp 214 4 conclusions this work provided several important and new insights with respect to applicability of commercial resins for pd ii recovery from synthetic elp solutions that are characterized to have moderate solution chemistry complexity firstly for both considered commercial resins lewatit tp 214 and amberlyst a21 synthetic elp solutions provided significantly lower performance in terms of pd ii adsorption characteristics and this is due to the inhibitory role of additives such as na2edta and nh4oh in binding pd ii to the adsorbent active sites secondly among both resins lewatit tp 214 performed superior than amberlyst a21 in terms of optimal ph 8 but not 2 contact time 300 but not 780 min and marginally inferior value of adsorbent dosage 2 but not 1 6 g l 1 thirdly langmuir isotherm and pseudo second order kinetic model have been inferred to represent pertinent equilibrium and kinetic data of pd ii adsorption fourthly ctab surfactant has been evaluated to marginally enhance pd ii adsorption characteristics for both resins both resins provided satisfactory performance in terms of desorption characteristics however lewatit tp 214 provided better adsorption capacity at higher solution concentration speciation analysis was confirming to hypothesis correlated to optimal ph with reasonable desorption characteristics about 55 66 removal lewatit tp 214 is inferred to be the best adsorbent for commercial application towards pd ii recovery and reuse from spent elp solutions with and without ctab surfactant speciation studies further provided deeper insights into pertinent adsorption and desorption mechanisms at optimal ph values of the adsorbent adsorbate system free amine and sulphur groups prevalent in the resin structure have been evaluated to have potential role in providing better combinations of pd ii adsorption and desorption characteristics this was not the case for the other resin which only had amine groups in summary optimality of moderate ph contact time and adsorbent dosage followed with better performance at higher initial pd ii concentrations and satisfactory desorption performance can be regarded to be important benchmarks for noble metal recovery and reuse with lewatit tp 214 resin from spent elp solutions

14596,concerns about the preservation of aquatic ecosystems are growing drugs that are recalcitrant to conventional treatments can be accumulated in public water supplies and contaminate groundwater many technologies including the fenton reaction and electrooxidation processes have been evaluated to remove drugs from water in the last years however the association of different approaches can be a suitable solution when only one technology is not enough in this frame this study compares the use of the fenton reaction the electrochemical process and coupled process to treat a synthetic effluent containing a potential pollutant rifampicin regarding the electrode materials studied herein efficiency of rifampicin degradation decreased in the following order boron doped diamond bdd ti pt ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 dsa dimensionally stable anode the better performance of bdd was associated to the species bdd oh which degrades organic compounds more efficiently than the species ruo x 1 and pto x 1 the electrochemical reaction employing bdd was as efficient as the fenton reaction where 80 of chemical oxygen demand cod was removed however the fenton reaction was faster results also clearly showed that when both technologies were associated no significant improvements were achieved nevertheless when hydrogen peroxide was added to the electrochemical process a remarkable enhancement of the reaction efficiency was attained especially in the case of bdd requiring less energy for treatment this kind of effluent keywords eletrooxidation fenton reaction dsa bdd rifampicin 1 introduction the presence of residual drugs in domestic sewage and in natural waters has been reported since the 1970s 1 2 and these residual substances have been classified as emerging pollutants every year the brazilian pharmaceutical industry produces tons of drugs for use in human and veterinary medicine after administration of the drug the organism excretes a significant part of the non metabolized pharmaceutical which reaches the environment through domestic sewage upon contact with the aquatic environment the drug may be biologically degraded however many of these substances persist in nature and remain unaltered for long periods 3 4 among the residual drugs the antibiotics have been shown a great significance because their metabolites in environment could cause chronic toxicity and endocrine disruption to aquatic life and human beings and increased bacterial resistance 5 6 recent studies have indicated that conventional treatment of wastewater and sewage fails to remove residual drugs completely this is a matter of such concern that authoritative publications have putted in evidence the toxicological properties and environmental occurrence of pharmaceuticals as well as with the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in removing these substances from effluents 3 4 7 besides the potential ecotoxicity and deleterious effects of drugs on the quality of human life there is particular concern about pharmaceuticals with antibiotic action low doses of these substances in aquatic environments can generate more resistant microorganism strains 8 10 in this context several technologies have been developed to treat effluents more effectively these can be used alone or these can be associated with wwtps in order to remove satisfactorily the organic pollutants 11 17 giving the insights to be applied for depolluting effluents from pharmaceutical industries preventing contaminants from reaching water resources among the new technologies that are currently being developed to treat wastewater and sewage advanced oxidative processes aops have received great attention because they can cheaply and efficiently degrade compounds that are recalcitrant to conventional treatments 11 12 15 18 fenton reaction is one of the most promising aops because it has high oxidizing power and is easy to operate and maintain which makes it an attractive process to degrade drugs in effluents 19 22 the classic mechanism of the fenton reaction comprises a simple redox reaction in which fe2 ions are oxidized to fe3 and h2o2 is reduced to a hydroxyl ion and to a hydroxyl radical 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho k 76 mol 1 l s 1 0 2 2 on the other hand hydroxyl radicals can also generated by using electrochemical processes according to comninellis and de battisti 23 in this case the organic compound is oxidized through the action of hydroxyl radicals physically m oh or chemically mox 1 adsorbed on the anode surface the production of both species depends on the nature of electrocatalytic material which are classified as non active and active anodes based on the power to produce m oh or mox 1 commonly named higher oxides respectively 24 25 it is important to remark that both species m oh and mox 1 oxidize organic compounds but mox 1 is more selective and favors partial oxidation eq 2 whereas oh is more reactive promoting complete mineralization of the pollutant eq 3 2 mox 1 r h mox r ho 3 m oh r h m mco2 nh2o h e nevertheless the combination of heterogeneous electrochemical and homogenous fenton reactions hydroxyl radicals production has showed to be more efficient to eliminate organic pollutants from water 37 therefore in this study we have evaluated the performance of electrooxidation and fenton approaches in the treatment of a synthetic effluent contaminated with the rifampicin used as model drug ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and ti pt classified as active anodes and bdd a non active electrode were used as electrocatalytic materials by electrooxidation meanwhile fenton reaction was also employed to degrade rifampicin in order to understand its efficacy in terms of organic removal and time of treatment after that the association of both processes fenton reaction electrooxidation was achieved to evaluate the synergic effect as well as to assess the hydrogen peroxide effect on the efficacy of the electrooxidation rifampicin was chosen as model substrate because this drug is widely employed in the treatment of tuberculosis and it is used by the government health program as an adjuvant in the treatment of immunosuppressed patients 26 this is classified in the world health organization s list as an essential medicine because it is considered the most important medications needed in a basic health system rifampicin fig 1 is an antibiotic belonging to the class of rifamycins which act on the β subunit of rna polymerase after its use rifampicin is transformed in the body but the excess is released by the humans via urine and according few studies it was already found in effluents treated in wwtps because treatment systems fail to eliminate this kind of compound 4 27 the rifampicin degradation was recently studied by using aops 28 29 gao and co workers 28 reported that the photocatalytic degradation of five antibiotics including rifampicin using znin2s4 under visible light irradiation was efficiently achieved after 90 min involving the participation of superoxide radical o2 during the treatment meanwhile stets and coworkers 29 investigated the degradation of rifampicin rif by applying tio2 and zno heterogeneous photocatalysis and homogeneous and heterogeneous uv a photo fenton processes by using zno mediated photocatalysis and heterogeneous photo fenton processes lower degradation efficiencies were achieved conversely uv a radiation in tio2 mediated photocatalysis removed approximately 60 of drug while photo fenton process with iron immobilized in chitosan beads promoted 80 of elimination after 60 min in this context the recent results about the degradation of rifampicin 28 29 by using poas encouraged to extend the research for evaluating the efficiency of new technologies in the degradation of this drug such as fenton reaction and electrooxidation approaches 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and materials all the reagents were commercially available hydrogen peroxide h2o2 50 m m ferrous sulfate feso4 7h2o sulfuric acid and sodium chloride were purchased from vetec sodium sulfate na2so4 was acquired from chemcruz all the reagents were analytical grade and were used without

electrodes were used as anodes and the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 4 0 4 0 cm electrode was used as cathode pt supported on ti and ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 electrodes were supplied by industry de nora s p a milan italy and sorocaba sp brazil respectively 2 2 electrochemical experiments the electrochemical oxidation experiments were performed in a 250 ml undivided open cell equipped with magnetic stirring under galvanostatic conditions provided by power supply emg18134 at 30 c to assess the role of the applied current density 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 and of the temperature of the effluent 30 and 60 c on the oxidation degradation of rifampicin an aqueous solution containing 0 2 g l 1 rifampicin synthetic effluent was employed na2so4 0 5 mol l 1 was used as supporting electrolyte the efficiency regarding the association of processes electrooxidation hydrogen peroxide and electrooxidation fenton reaction was evaluated for the three investigated electrode materials all electrochemical experiments were conducted under ph controlled conditions ph 3 by using sulfuric acid 2 3 fenton reaction experiments in this study a batch reactor containing 250 ml of a synthetic effluent with 0 2 g l 1 rifampicin was employed a known amount of fe2 0 1 mmol l 1 was added to the effluent adjusting the ph to 3 0 by adding sulfuric acid h2o2 was also added to the effluent in different concentrations 5 10 or 20 mmol l 1 before to start the reaction the reaction was conducted for 2 h under magnetic stirring at controlled ph of 3 0 0 1 samples were then collected for analysis and the ph was immediately raised to a strongly basic value ph 12 to precipitate iron as iron hydroxide and consequently interrupting the fenton reaction 2 4 instrumentation and analyses samples of the solutions were collected at regular times along the fenton reaction and the electrochemical process to measure the absorbance at 472 nm degradation of the organic compounds was monitored through measurement of cod on a photometer from policontrol by the standard apha awwa method 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical process the applied current is among the most important parameters in an electrochemical process its value is crucial to operational costs and to the efficiency of the process the applied current governs the rate of the electrochemical reaction the rate at which m oh and mox 1 are generated and consequently the rate at which the pollutant is oxidized 25 31 fig 2 shows the influence of current density on the decrease of the absorbance initial related to the concentration of rifampicin as a function of time for the electrocatalytic materials investigated herein initially a rise in current density affects the active electrodes ti pt and mainly ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 to a greater extent than bdd at an applied current density of 90 ma cm 2 the maximum efficiency in the reduction of the absorbance of rifampicin at 3 h of reaction is 74 95 and 95 for the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt and bdd electrodes respectively although the ti pt and bdd electrodes have similar efficiency at 3 h of reaction bdd is a better electrode because it reduces the concentration of the substrate quickly for example at 15 min of reaction pt and bdd electrodes decrease the absorbance by 32 and 63 respectively in fact the kinetic studies of the reaction demonstrated the higher efficiency achieved by using bdd table 1 on the other hand cod decay also confirms the higher efficiency of the bdd electrode fig 2 and it indicates that the drug is eliminated from solution bdd electrode provides the maximal decrease in cod 46 70 and 81 by applying 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively fig 2 by using ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 electrode cod was reduced about 44 49 and 57 at 180 min of reaction at applied current densities of 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively in the case of the ti pt electrode efficiencies are 59 60 and 66 at 180 min of treatment at applied current densities of 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively therefore the rate at which rifampicin is oxidized strongly depends on the applied current density and on the nature of the electrode certainly the influence of current density varies with the experimental conditions electrode material and substrate to be degraded oxidized in their studies on the electrochemical incineration of aqueous solutions of methyl orange mo using tirusno2 bdd or pbo2 electrodes labiadh et al 32 observed that the applied current practically did not affect the rate at which mo was removed also sopaj et al 33 observed that higher applied current increased the efficiency of oxidation and mineralization of amoxicillin in a process that employed ti ruo2 iro2 or bdd as anodes this behavior was due to the mass transport regime which control completely the oxidation of organic pollutants influencing the extent of the treatment 31 at the same time when an increase on the applied current is achieved only the secondary reaction of decomposition of oh to produce oxygen gas eq 4 or hydrogen peroxide eq 5 is favored 25 4 2ho 1 2o2 h2o 5 2ho h2o2 fig 2 shows that the efficiencies of the elimination absorbance decay and degradation in terms of cod of rifampicin are quite similar suggesting that the experimental conditions favor the formation of few intermediates or intermediates that are easy to be oxidized however the electrochemical degradation of rifampicin was more efficient by using bdd anode this behavior clearly indicates that the reactive oxygen species are produced at anode surface promoting a fast elimination of dissolved organic matter 34 for this reason the absorbance is significantly reduced chromophore groups of rifampicin are fragmented and consequently the byproducts are also degraded in short times and the cod decay is also achieved in different levels respect to the behaviors observed at active anodes the above assessments were confirmed by the current efficiencies in terms of total current efficiency tce achieved for each one of the electrocatalytic materials used fig 3 these values were estimated following eq 6 6 tce fv c o d i c o d f 8 i δ t where codt and codt δt are the chemical oxygen demands g dm 3 at times t 0 initial and f final respectively i is the current a f is the faraday constant 96 487c mol 1 v is the volume of electrolyte dm3 and 8 is the oxygen equivalent mass g eq 1 the data in fig 3 indicated that the tce decreases when an increase on the current density applied in all cases similar behavior was observed by menezes and co workers when ti ru0 34ti0 66o2 and ti pt were used for the electrochemical treatment of shrimp farming effluent due to the parallel reactions that are favored by the increase of current density such as the evolution of oxygen 35 another important feature is that the temperature can increase the rate of elimination of pollutants then the electrochemical oxidation of rifampicin was performed at 60 c by using all electrocatalytic materials in order to understand this effect results clearly indicate that the absorbance and cod decays strongly depend on the temperature of the effluent in fact all the electrode materials are more efficient to remove the rifampicin from solution at 60 c by applying 30 ma cm 2 fig 2 table 1 and fig 3 in fact tce values showed a slightly increase in all cases see fig 3 the effect of the temperature demonstrated that ru electrode increased the efficiency by 73 when the temperature is raised from 30 to 60 c whereas the efficiency rises by 20 and 14 for the ti pt and bdd electrodes respectively by estimating the values of apparent rate constant kap by using eq 7 7 ln a 0 a t k a p t where a 0 and a t represents the absorbance of rifampicin solution measured at 472 nm at times zero and t respectively and kap is the first order oxidation rate constant min 1 fitting of the rate data using order higher than one does not produce good correlation coefficients data not shown table 1 reports the values of apparent rate constant kap estimated for all electrocatalytic materials restricting our analysis to the kinetic study kap increased 27 folds for the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 electrode respect to the 4 7 folds and 3 1 folds for the ti pt and bdd electrodes respectively according the behavior of kap values it was possible to understand that the oxidation of rifampicin fits well the first order kinetic model it is important to indicate that all the electrode materials presented two linear regions one at the start of the reaction t 15 min where the concentration of the drug is higher and another at later reaction time where the concentration of rifampicin is lower and where oxidized by products exist as can be seen in fig 4 the oxidation rate slows down along the reaction t 15 min for possibly two reasons because the intermediates compete with the drug during their oxidation in solution via the strong oxidant species produced at bdd anode in 40 min absorbance and cod decayed around 80 and 45 respectively based on these results see table 1 in terms of global efficiency of the electrodes the decrease in the absorbance of rifampicin at 3 h of reaction as a function of the electrocatalytic material follows the order bdd ti pt ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 nevertheless if we analyze the kinetic constant at the beginning of the reaction the order of efficiency changes at higher current densities bdd ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt therefore the concentration of rifampicin influences the oxidation at the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 more significantly than the emerging reaction intermediates can interfere in the kinetics of the reaction however the higher efficiency of the bdd electrode is evident in all conditions this behavior was attributed to higher production of m ho which predominates in this type of electrode 34 the hydroxyl radicals are weakly adsorbed onto the surface of the electrode which facilitates the degradation of rifampicin and its by products these outcomes agree with the figures reported by other authors for removing different organic compounds with higher efficiencies when compared to oxides and pt electrodes for example other drugs 20 amoxicillin 36 methyl orange 32 or sulfamethazine 33 an additional difference between the electrodes is related to the production of oxidants the use of sulfate salt as supporting electrolyte together with the bdd anode can promote the electrogeneration of persulfate eq 8 34 37 this powerful oxidizing agent reacts with the organic matter by a chemical reaction in the solution contributing to the decontamination of effluents at ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and ti pt electrodes no persulfate or only a low amount of persulfate is electrogenerated so these electrodes deplete cod less efficiently conversely the production of persulfates eq 8 contributes to the elimination of rifampicin in solution when bdd is used confirming the enhancement on the cod depletion see fig 2 8 2so4 2 s2o8 2 2e on the other hand ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and ti pt electrodes are considered active so partial oxidation is the predominant mechanism the reaction produces many intermediates and oxidation depends on the adsorption of the pollutant onto the active site of the electrode mox 1 here we found that the efficiency of the electrodes varies as a function of the experimental conditions this difference is probably related to the characteristics of the adsorption ruo oh are more strongly adsorbed onto the surface of the anode than pt oh so the former species is less available for the oxidation of rifampicin 3 2 fenton reactions fig 5 presents the results about the absorbance and cod decays by the fenton reaction the concentration of the drug decreases rapidly achieving 95 of removal at 120 min of reaction under all the studied concentrations of hydrogen peroxide fig 5a however the most important decay of rifampicin absorbance was achieved within the first 30 min of reaction and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide influences the removal of rifampicin an increase on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide favors a slight increase on the oxidation rate the absorbance of rifampicin decays about 84 88 and 91 within 15 min for 5 10 and 20 mmol l 1 h2o2 respectively this behavior is in accordance with the results related to the elimination of dissolved organic matter in terms of cod achieving about 49 70 and 79 for 5 10 and 20 mmol l 1 of h2o2 respectively fig 5b another important feature is that the kinetic of the reaction was also influenced by the concentration of hydrogen peroxide fig 5c because a second order was well fitted by using the kinetic equation 1 a t with a good correlation at all the reaction times the apparent kinetic constants obtained from the decay of the absorbance of rifampicin via fenton reaction also increase slightly as a function of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide comparing fenton reaction with the results obtained by treating synthetic effluent containing rifampicin by electrooxidation approach the fenton reaction demonstrated to be efficient because the absorbance of rifampicin and cod were reduced about 79 with 20 mmol l 1 of h2o2 meanwhile the abs of the drug and cod were removed about 95 and 81 respectively when bdd electrolysis was employed by applying 90 ma cm 2 however short treatment times were required to treat the effluent by fenton reaction 40 min when compared to bdd electrolysis fenton reaction probably generates a higher concentration of hydroxyl radicals which rapidly react with the pollutant in the beginning of the homogeneous catalytic reaction conversely the hydroxyl radicals produced at bdd anode heterogeneous catalytic reaction react very close to the electrode surface reaction cage and these are continuously generated along the entire electrochemical process limiting their efficacy nevertheless persulfates can contribute to the elimination of organic matter by homogeneous catalytic reaction but the concentration of these strong oxidants is limited by the precursor sulfate ions in solution when selecting a methodology to treat effluents it is essential to consider assembly maintenance and operational costs in this sense we can consider that the electrochemical process has the following disadvantages need to add an electrolyte to make the solution conductive which raises costs and high costs of the materials comprising electrodes like bdd in the case of the fenton reaction acidification of the effluent ph 3 0 and its further neutralization before disposal are the drawbacks of the technique another issue is that fe oh x precipitates after the solution is neutralized at the end of the reaction this generates a large amount of residue which demands adequate disposal on the other hand iron hydroxide may participate as a coagulating agent so it may help to treat the effluent via decantation or sedimentation after the fenton reaction 38 39 overall fenton reaction followed by sedimentation is the most efficient way to treat effluents containing particulate material or suspended solids 3 3 combination of advanced oxidation processes neither the electrochemical process nor the fenton reaction mineralizes rifampicin completely in the optimized conditions of electrochemical process and the fenton reaction 19 and 21 of cod remain in solution respectively because recalcitrant intermediates likely emerge during the processes to improve the efficiency of rifampicin removal we decided to associate the processes electrochemical process fenton reaction to depollute the effluent we used current density of 30 ma cm 2 0 1 mmol l 1 fe2 and 5 mmol l 1 h2o2 we also assessed the influence of hydrogen peroxide on the electrochemical process for all the electrode materials as depicted in table 2 fig 6 shows the current efficiency by means of tce values obtained by eq 6 for the electrochemical process by using ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt and bdd electrodes the decay of the organic matter in terms of cod was about 44 59 and 46 respectively however when both technologies are coupled the efficiency of the process remains practically the same there is only a slight drop in the efficiency of the ti pt electrode in this case the use of na2so4 as supporting electrolyte contributed to avoid the buffering ph conditions at 3 0 where the fenton reaction is promoted this behavior limited the efficacy of the process to eliminate the rifampicin from solution generally speaking fenton reagents h2o2 and fe2 can be electrochemically generated during electrochemical processes but specific electrode materials are usually employed carbonaceous cathodes such as carbon ptfe air diffusion 40 carbon felts 41 carbon sponge 42 and graphite 43 which are used to generate the peroxide however ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 plates were used as cathode when fenton reagents and hydrogen peroxide were added to the electrochemical process and consequently the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was limited to the addition while the fe2 was not regenerated during the electrochemical process in an oxidation process a rise in the concentration of the oxidant does not always favor the reaction rate especially for oxidation involving the very reactive hydroxyl radical at high concentrations oh can react with fe2 eq 9 hydrogen peroxide eq 10 or another hydroxyl radical eq 11 to diminish the efficiency of the reaction due to competition with oxidation degradation of the pollutant 9 fe2 ho fe3 oh 10 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 11 ho ho h2o2 by using bdd electrode the production of persulfate ion eq 8 can reduce the efficiency of the reaction because persulfate can react with fe2 eq 12 to decrease the rate at which oh originates from the fenton reaction in fact this behavior was observed by loaiza ambuludi et al 44 during degradation of ibuprofen and during oxidation of aspartame by the electro fenton process by lin et al 45 12 s2o8 2 2fe2 2so4 2 2fe3 but depending on the experimental conditions it is possible to obtain sulfate radical so4 eq 13 which is a stronger oxidant with e0 2 5 3 1 v 46 47 contributing to the degradation of the organic substrate 13 s2o8 2 fe2 so4 2 fe3 so4 conversely the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the electrochemical process enhanced the removal efficiency especially for the bdd electrode from 46 to 70 this procedure is known as anodic oxidation with h2o2 when a one compartment cell is utilized pollutants can be oxidized by added electrogenerated h2o2 oh formed at the anode surface from reaction 14 and the weaker oxidant hydroperoxyl radical ho2 produced during the anodic decomposition of h2o2 48 14 h2o oh ads h e 15 h2o2 ho2 h e 16 ho2 o2 h e 17 oh oh ads e in this case the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was more efficient at anode surface because slight alkaline conditions are generated at the nernst layer favoring the reactions 15 17 it is important to indicate that ho2 specie is very reactive contributing with the oxidation of organic pollutants due to its short lifetime the higher mineralization of rifampicin under these conditions can be mainly due to the generation of a greater oh concentration at the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and ti pt surfaces from reaction 17 conversely at bdd anode the production of ho2 specie is most feasible due to the direct reactions of hydrogen peroxide with anode surface or with hydroxyl radicals generated by reaction 14 34 49 then the oxidation power was improved increasing the removal efficiency of rifampicin which is confirmed by the current efficiency values see fig 6 the mineralization capacity by adding h2o2 in solution was increased in all cases increasing significantly at bdd anode more than 26 3 4 energy consumption energy consumption per unit volume ec in k wh m 3 was estimated by using eq 18 fig 7 depicts the results 18 e c e c e l l i t v s where e cell is the average potential difference of the cell v i is the applied current a t is the time of reaction h and vs is the volume of solution m3 ec increases linearly fig 7 with the applied current density besides presenting the highest catalytic activity for the degradation of rifampicin bdd electrode consumes approximately 40 less of electrical energy when compared to the other anode materials at 90 ma cm 2 the elimination is about 57 66 and 81 of cod while the energy consumption is practically 143 3 158 7 and 83 0 kw h m 3 for ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt and bdd electrodes respectively the efficiency of the bdd is associated to its catalytic activity to produce efficiently strong oxidant species thereby demanding less energy 34 evaluation of the single and associated processes with different temperatures fig 8 shows that higher temperature leads to require lower electrical requirements in all the processes this is to the decrease on the potential of the cell as well as the increase on the reaction rates in solution regarding the associated processes the addition of fenton reagents fig 8 data 3 and hydrogen peroxide fig 8 data 4 leads to an increase on the energy requirements by the electrochemical process this is more evident for active electrodes for the latter electrodes adsorption is the first step of the reaction the presence of any species that might compete with the oxidation of water and the adsorption of hydroxyl radicals it can raise the potential of the electrode and consequently the energy consumption 4 conclusions our results attest to the high performance of electrochemical process and fenton reaction concerning the treatment of solutions containing rifampicin on basis of the electrochemical experiments an increase on the applied current density favors an efficient removal of organic matter achieving higher removals at bdd electrode than those achieved at ti pt and ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 the high production of free hydroxyl radicals by bdd promotes the significant mineralization degradation of the organic substrates when compared to the species pto x 1 and ruo x 1 formed on the ti pt and ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 surfaces additionally persulfate can be electrochemically generated at bdd anode which contributes to oxidation of the pollutant when it comes to oxidizing and mineralizing rifampicin the homogeneous fenton reaction is more efficient than the electrochemical process because a higher amount of hydroxyl radicals arise in the reaction medium even though the fenton reaction and the electrochemical process reduce the concentration of the drug and cod to almost the same extent the fenton reaction is significantly faster the combination of electrochemical process with the fenton reaction does not improve the efficiency of the process excess hydroxyl radicals favor parallel reactions that compete with the oxidation of the pollutant and its intermediates nevertheless when hydrogen peroxide was added to the electrochemical process it improved the efficiency of the treatment by the production of other oxidants like as so4 and o3 49 acknowledgments j l s d gratefully acknowledges the cnpq

14596,concerns about the preservation of aquatic ecosystems are growing drugs that are recalcitrant to conventional treatments can be accumulated in public water supplies and contaminate groundwater many technologies including the fenton reaction and electrooxidation processes have been evaluated to remove drugs from water in the last years however the association of different approaches can be a suitable solution when only one technology is not enough in this frame this study compares the use of the fenton reaction the electrochemical process and coupled process to treat a synthetic effluent containing a potential pollutant rifampicin regarding the electrode materials studied herein efficiency of rifampicin degradation decreased in the following order boron doped diamond bdd ti pt ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 dsa dimensionally stable anode the better performance of bdd was associated to the species bdd oh which degrades organic compounds more efficiently than the species ruo x 1 and pto x 1 the electrochemical reaction employing bdd was as efficient as the fenton reaction where 80 of chemical oxygen demand cod was removed however the fenton reaction was faster results also clearly showed that when both technologies were associated no significant improvements were achieved nevertheless when hydrogen peroxide was added to the electrochemical process a remarkable enhancement of the reaction efficiency was attained especially in the case of bdd requiring less energy for treatment this kind of effluent keywords eletrooxidation fenton reaction dsa bdd rifampicin 1 introduction the presence of residual drugs in domestic sewage and in natural waters has been reported since the 1970s 1 2 and these residual substances have been classified as emerging pollutants every year the brazilian pharmaceutical industry produces tons of drugs for use in human and veterinary medicine after administration of the drug the organism excretes a significant part of the non metabolized pharmaceutical which reaches the environment through domestic sewage upon contact with the aquatic environment the drug may be biologically degraded however many of these substances persist in nature and remain unaltered for long periods 3 4 among the residual drugs the antibiotics have been shown a great significance because their metabolites in environment could cause chronic toxicity and endocrine disruption to aquatic life and human beings and increased bacterial resistance 5 6 recent studies have indicated that conventional treatment of wastewater and sewage fails to remove residual drugs completely this is a matter of such concern that authoritative publications have putted in evidence the toxicological properties and environmental occurrence of pharmaceuticals as well as with the efficiency of wastewater treatment plants wwtps in removing these substances from effluents 3 4 7 besides the potential ecotoxicity and deleterious effects of drugs on the quality of human life there is particular concern about pharmaceuticals with antibiotic action low doses of these substances in aquatic environments can generate more resistant microorganism strains 8 10 in this context several technologies have been developed to treat effluents more effectively these can be used alone or these can be associated with wwtps in order to remove satisfactorily the organic pollutants 11 17 giving the insights to be applied for depolluting effluents from pharmaceutical industries preventing contaminants from reaching water resources among the new technologies that are currently being developed to treat wastewater and sewage advanced oxidative processes aops have received great attention because they can cheaply and efficiently degrade compounds that are recalcitrant to conventional treatments 11 12 15 18 fenton reaction is one of the most promising aops because it has high oxidizing power and is easy to operate and maintain which makes it an attractive process to degrade drugs in effluents 19 22 the classic mechanism of the fenton reaction comprises a simple redox reaction in which fe2 ions are oxidized to fe3 and h2o2 is reduced to a hydroxyl ion and to a hydroxyl radical 1 fe2 h2o2 fe3 ho ho k 76 mol 1 l s 1 0 2 2 on the other hand hydroxyl radicals can also generated by using electrochemical processes according to comninellis and de battisti 23 in this case the organic compound is oxidized through the action of hydroxyl radicals physically m oh or chemically mox 1 adsorbed on the anode surface the production of both species depends on the nature of electrocatalytic material which are classified as non active and active anodes based on the power to produce m oh or mox 1 commonly named higher oxides respectively 24 25 it is important to remark that both species m oh and mox 1 oxidize organic compounds but mox 1 is more selective and favors partial oxidation eq 2 whereas oh is more reactive promoting complete mineralization of the pollutant eq 3 2 mox 1 r h mox r ho 3 m oh r h m mco2 nh2o h e nevertheless the combination of heterogeneous electrochemical and homogenous fenton reactions hydroxyl radicals production has showed to be more efficient to eliminate organic pollutants from water 37 therefore in this study we have evaluated the performance of electrooxidation and fenton approaches in the treatment of a synthetic effluent contaminated with the rifampicin used as model drug ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and ti pt classified as active anodes and bdd a non active electrode were used as electrocatalytic materials by electrooxidation meanwhile fenton reaction was also employed to degrade rifampicin in order to understand its efficacy in terms of organic removal and time of treatment after that the association of both processes fenton reaction electrooxidation was achieved to evaluate the synergic effect as well as to assess the hydrogen peroxide effect on the efficacy of the electrooxidation rifampicin was chosen as model substrate because this drug is widely employed in the treatment of tuberculosis and it is used by the government health program as an adjuvant in the treatment of immunosuppressed patients 26 this is classified in the world health organization s list as an essential medicine because it is considered the most important medications needed in a basic health system rifampicin fig 1 is an antibiotic belonging to the class of rifamycins which act on the β subunit of rna polymerase after its use rifampicin is transformed in the body but the excess is released by the humans via urine and according few studies it was already found in effluents treated in wwtps because treatment systems fail to eliminate this kind of compound 4 27 the rifampicin degradation was recently studied by using aops 28 29 gao and co workers 28 reported that the photocatalytic degradation of five antibiotics including rifampicin using znin2s4 under visible light irradiation was efficiently achieved after 90 min involving the participation of superoxide radical o2 during the treatment meanwhile stets and coworkers 29 investigated the degradation of rifampicin rif by applying tio2 and zno heterogeneous photocatalysis and homogeneous and heterogeneous uv a photo fenton processes by using zno mediated photocatalysis and heterogeneous photo fenton processes lower degradation efficiencies were achieved conversely uv a radiation in tio2 mediated photocatalysis removed approximately 60 of drug while photo fenton process with iron immobilized in chitosan beads promoted 80 of elimination after 60 min in this context the recent results about the degradation of rifampicin 28 29 by using poas encouraged to extend the research for evaluating the efficiency of new technologies in the degradation of this drug such as fenton reaction and electrooxidation approaches 2 experimental 2 1 chemicals and materials all the reagents were commercially available hydrogen peroxide h2o2 50 m m

to a strongly basic value ph 12 to precipitate iron as iron hydroxide and consequently interrupting the fenton reaction 2 4 instrumentation and analyses samples of the solutions were collected at regular times along the fenton reaction and the electrochemical process to measure the absorbance at 472 nm degradation of the organic compounds was monitored through measurement of cod on a photometer from policontrol by the standard apha awwa method 30 3 results and discussion 3 1 electrochemical process the applied current is among the most important parameters in an electrochemical process its value is crucial to operational costs and to the efficiency of the process the applied current governs the rate of the electrochemical reaction the rate at which m oh and mox 1 are generated and consequently the rate at which the pollutant is oxidized 25 31 fig 2 shows the influence of current density on the decrease of the absorbance initial related to the concentration of rifampicin as a function of time for the electrocatalytic materials investigated herein initially a rise in current density affects the active electrodes ti pt and mainly ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 to a greater extent than bdd at an applied current density of 90 ma cm 2 the maximum efficiency in the reduction of the absorbance of rifampicin at 3 h of reaction is 74 95 and 95 for the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt and bdd electrodes respectively although the ti pt and bdd electrodes have similar efficiency at 3 h of reaction bdd is a better electrode because it reduces the concentration of the substrate quickly for example at 15 min of reaction pt and bdd electrodes decrease the absorbance by 32 and 63 respectively in fact the kinetic studies of the reaction demonstrated the higher efficiency achieved by using bdd table 1 on the other hand cod decay also confirms the higher efficiency of the bdd electrode fig 2 and it indicates that the drug is eliminated from solution bdd electrode provides the maximal decrease in cod 46 70 and 81 by applying 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively fig 2 by using ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 electrode cod was reduced about 44 49 and 57 at 180 min of reaction at applied current densities of 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively in the case of the ti pt electrode efficiencies are 59 60 and 66 at 180 min of treatment at applied current densities of 30 60 and 90 ma cm 2 respectively therefore the rate at which rifampicin is oxidized strongly depends on the applied current density and on the nature of the electrode certainly the influence of current density varies with the experimental conditions electrode material and substrate to be degraded oxidized in their studies on the electrochemical incineration of aqueous solutions of methyl orange mo using tirusno2 bdd or pbo2 electrodes labiadh et al 32 observed that the applied current practically did not affect the rate at which mo was removed also sopaj et al 33 observed that higher applied current increased the efficiency of oxidation and mineralization of amoxicillin in a process that employed ti ruo2 iro2 or bdd as anodes this behavior was due to the mass transport regime which control completely the oxidation of organic pollutants influencing the extent of the treatment 31 at the same time when an increase on the applied current is achieved only the secondary reaction of decomposition of oh to produce oxygen gas eq 4 or hydrogen peroxide eq 5 is favored 25 4 2ho 1 2o2 h2o 5 2ho h2o2 fig 2 shows that the efficiencies of the elimination absorbance decay and degradation in terms of cod of rifampicin are quite similar suggesting that the experimental conditions favor the formation of few intermediates or intermediates that are easy to be oxidized however the electrochemical degradation of rifampicin was more efficient by using bdd anode this behavior clearly indicates that the reactive oxygen species are produced at anode surface promoting a fast elimination of dissolved organic matter 34 for this reason the absorbance is significantly reduced chromophore groups of rifampicin are fragmented and consequently the byproducts are also degraded in short times and the cod decay is also achieved in different levels respect to the behaviors observed at active anodes the above assessments were confirmed by the current efficiencies in terms of total current efficiency tce achieved for each one of the electrocatalytic materials used fig 3 these values were estimated following eq 6 6 tce fv c o d i c o d f 8 i δ t where codt and codt δt are the chemical oxygen demands g dm 3 at times t 0 initial and f final respectively i is the current a f is the faraday constant 96 487c mol 1 v is the volume of electrolyte dm3 and 8 is the oxygen equivalent mass g eq 1 the data in fig 3 indicated that the tce decreases when an increase on the current density applied in all cases similar behavior was observed by menezes and co workers when ti ru0 34ti0 66o2 and ti pt were used for the electrochemical treatment of shrimp farming effluent due to the parallel reactions that are favored by the increase of current density such as the evolution of oxygen 35 another important feature is that the temperature can increase the rate of elimination of pollutants then the electrochemical oxidation of rifampicin was performed at 60 c by using all electrocatalytic materials in order to understand this effect results clearly indicate that the absorbance and cod decays strongly depend on the temperature of the effluent in fact all the electrode materials are more efficient to remove the rifampicin from solution at 60 c by applying 30 ma cm 2 fig 2 table 1 and fig 3 in fact tce values showed a slightly increase in all cases see fig 3 the effect of the temperature demonstrated that ru electrode increased the efficiency by 73 when the temperature is raised from 30 to 60 c whereas the efficiency rises by 20 and 14 for the ti pt and bdd electrodes respectively by estimating the values of apparent rate constant kap by using eq 7 7 ln a 0 a t k a p t where a 0 and a t represents the absorbance of rifampicin solution measured at 472 nm at times zero and t respectively and kap is the first order oxidation rate constant min 1 fitting of the rate data using order higher than one does not produce good correlation coefficients data not shown table 1 reports the values of apparent rate constant kap estimated for all electrocatalytic materials restricting our analysis to the kinetic study kap increased 27 folds for the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 electrode respect to the 4 7 folds and 3 1 folds for the ti pt and bdd electrodes respectively according the behavior of kap values it was possible to understand that the oxidation of rifampicin fits well the first order kinetic model it is important to indicate that all the electrode materials presented two linear regions one at the start of the reaction t 15 min where the concentration of the drug is higher and another at later reaction time where the concentration of rifampicin is lower and where oxidized by products exist as can be seen in fig 4 the oxidation rate slows down along the reaction t 15 min for possibly two reasons because the intermediates compete with the drug during their oxidation in solution via the strong oxidant species produced at bdd anode in 40 min absorbance and cod decayed around 80 and 45 respectively based on these results see table 1 in terms of global efficiency of the electrodes the decrease in the absorbance of rifampicin at 3 h of reaction as a function of the electrocatalytic material follows the order bdd ti pt ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 nevertheless if we analyze the kinetic constant at the beginning of the reaction the order of efficiency changes at higher current densities bdd ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt therefore the concentration of rifampicin influences the oxidation at the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 more significantly than the emerging reaction intermediates can interfere in the kinetics of the reaction however the higher efficiency of the bdd electrode is evident in all conditions this behavior was attributed to higher production of m ho which predominates in this type of electrode 34 the hydroxyl radicals are weakly adsorbed onto the surface of the electrode which facilitates the degradation of rifampicin and its by products these outcomes agree with the figures reported by other authors for removing different organic compounds with higher efficiencies when compared to oxides and pt electrodes for example other drugs 20 amoxicillin 36 methyl orange 32 or sulfamethazine 33 an additional difference between the electrodes is related to the production of oxidants the use of sulfate salt as supporting electrolyte together with the bdd anode can promote the electrogeneration of persulfate eq 8 34 37 this powerful oxidizing agent reacts with the organic matter by a chemical reaction in the solution contributing to the decontamination of effluents at ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and ti pt electrodes no persulfate or only a low amount of persulfate is electrogenerated so these electrodes deplete cod less efficiently conversely the production of persulfates eq 8 contributes to the elimination of rifampicin in solution when bdd is used confirming the enhancement on the cod depletion see fig 2 8 2so4 2 s2o8 2 2e on the other hand ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and ti pt electrodes are considered active so partial oxidation is the predominant mechanism the reaction produces many intermediates and oxidation depends on the adsorption of the pollutant onto the active site of the electrode mox 1 here we found that the efficiency of the electrodes varies as a function of the experimental conditions this difference is probably related to the characteristics of the adsorption ruo oh are more strongly adsorbed onto the surface of the anode than pt oh so the former species is less available for the oxidation of rifampicin 3 2 fenton reactions fig 5 presents the results about the absorbance and cod decays by the fenton reaction the concentration of the drug decreases rapidly achieving 95 of removal at 120 min of reaction under all the studied concentrations of hydrogen peroxide fig 5a however the most important decay of rifampicin absorbance was achieved within the first 30 min of reaction and the concentration of hydrogen peroxide influences the removal of rifampicin an increase on the concentration of hydrogen peroxide favors a slight increase on the oxidation rate the absorbance of rifampicin decays about 84 88 and 91 within 15 min for 5 10 and 20 mmol l 1 h2o2 respectively this behavior is in accordance with the results related to the elimination of dissolved organic matter in terms of cod achieving about 49 70 and 79 for 5 10 and 20 mmol l 1 of h2o2 respectively fig 5b another important feature is that the kinetic of the reaction was also influenced by the concentration of hydrogen peroxide fig 5c because a second order was well fitted by using the kinetic equation 1 a t with a good correlation at all the reaction times the apparent kinetic constants obtained from the decay of the absorbance of rifampicin via fenton reaction also increase slightly as a function of the concentration of hydrogen peroxide comparing fenton reaction with the results obtained by treating synthetic effluent containing rifampicin by electrooxidation approach the fenton reaction demonstrated to be efficient because the absorbance of rifampicin and cod were reduced about 79 with 20 mmol l 1 of h2o2 meanwhile the abs of the drug and cod were removed about 95 and 81 respectively when bdd electrolysis was employed by applying 90 ma cm 2 however short treatment times were required to treat the effluent by fenton reaction 40 min when compared to bdd electrolysis fenton reaction probably generates a higher concentration of hydroxyl radicals which rapidly react with the pollutant in the beginning of the homogeneous catalytic reaction conversely the hydroxyl radicals produced at bdd anode heterogeneous catalytic reaction react very close to the electrode surface reaction cage and these are continuously generated along the entire electrochemical process limiting their efficacy nevertheless persulfates can contribute to the elimination of organic matter by homogeneous catalytic reaction but the concentration of these strong oxidants is limited by the precursor sulfate ions in solution when selecting a methodology to treat effluents it is essential to consider assembly maintenance and operational costs in this sense we can consider that the electrochemical process has the following disadvantages need to add an electrolyte to make the solution conductive which raises costs and high costs of the materials comprising electrodes like bdd in the case of the fenton reaction acidification of the effluent ph 3 0 and its further neutralization before disposal are the drawbacks of the technique another issue is that fe oh x precipitates after the solution is neutralized at the end of the reaction this generates a large amount of residue which demands adequate disposal on the other hand iron hydroxide may participate as a coagulating agent so it may help to treat the effluent via decantation or sedimentation after the fenton reaction 38 39 overall fenton reaction followed by sedimentation is the most efficient way to treat effluents containing particulate material or suspended solids 3 3 combination of advanced oxidation processes neither the electrochemical process nor the fenton reaction mineralizes rifampicin completely in the optimized conditions of electrochemical process and the fenton reaction 19 and 21 of cod remain in solution respectively because recalcitrant intermediates likely emerge during the processes to improve the efficiency of rifampicin removal we decided to associate the processes electrochemical process fenton reaction to depollute the effluent we used current density of 30 ma cm 2 0 1 mmol l 1 fe2 and 5 mmol l 1 h2o2 we also assessed the influence of hydrogen peroxide on the electrochemical process for all the electrode materials as depicted in table 2 fig 6 shows the current efficiency by means of tce values obtained by eq 6 for the electrochemical process by using ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt and bdd electrodes the decay of the organic matter in terms of cod was about 44 59 and 46 respectively however when both technologies are coupled the efficiency of the process remains practically the same there is only a slight drop in the efficiency of the ti pt electrode in this case the use of na2so4 as supporting electrolyte contributed to avoid the buffering ph conditions at 3 0 where the fenton reaction is promoted this behavior limited the efficacy of the process to eliminate the rifampicin from solution generally speaking fenton reagents h2o2 and fe2 can be electrochemically generated during electrochemical processes but specific electrode materials are usually employed carbonaceous cathodes such as carbon ptfe air diffusion 40 carbon felts 41 carbon sponge 42 and graphite 43 which are used to generate the peroxide however ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 plates were used as cathode when fenton reagents and hydrogen peroxide were added to the electrochemical process and consequently the concentration of hydrogen peroxide was limited to the addition while the fe2 was not regenerated during the electrochemical process in an oxidation process a rise in the concentration of the oxidant does not always favor the reaction rate especially for oxidation involving the very reactive hydroxyl radical at high concentrations oh can react with fe2 eq 9 hydrogen peroxide eq 10 or another hydroxyl radical eq 11 to diminish the efficiency of the reaction due to competition with oxidation degradation of the pollutant 9 fe2 ho fe3 oh 10 h2o2 ho ho2 h2o 11 ho ho h2o2 by using bdd electrode the production of persulfate ion eq 8 can reduce the efficiency of the reaction because persulfate can react with fe2 eq 12 to decrease the rate at which oh originates from the fenton reaction in fact this behavior was observed by loaiza ambuludi et al 44 during degradation of ibuprofen and during oxidation of aspartame by the electro fenton process by lin et al 45 12 s2o8 2 2fe2 2so4 2 2fe3 but depending on the experimental conditions it is possible to obtain sulfate radical so4 eq 13 which is a stronger oxidant with e0 2 5 3 1 v 46 47 contributing to the degradation of the organic substrate 13 s2o8 2 fe2 so4 2 fe3 so4 conversely the addition of hydrogen peroxide to the electrochemical process enhanced the removal efficiency especially for the bdd electrode from 46 to 70 this procedure is known as anodic oxidation with h2o2 when a one compartment cell is utilized pollutants can be oxidized by added electrogenerated h2o2 oh formed at the anode surface from reaction 14 and the weaker oxidant hydroperoxyl radical ho2 produced during the anodic decomposition of h2o2 48 14 h2o oh ads h e 15 h2o2 ho2 h e 16 ho2 o2 h e 17 oh oh ads e in this case the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide was more efficient at anode surface because slight alkaline conditions are generated at the nernst layer favoring the reactions 15 17 it is important to indicate that ho2 specie is very reactive contributing with the oxidation of organic pollutants due to its short lifetime the higher mineralization of rifampicin under these conditions can be mainly due to the generation of a greater oh concentration at the ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 and ti pt surfaces from reaction 17 conversely at bdd anode the production of ho2 specie is most feasible due to the direct reactions of hydrogen peroxide with anode surface or with hydroxyl radicals generated by reaction 14 34 49 then the oxidation power was improved increasing the removal efficiency of rifampicin which is confirmed by the current efficiency values see fig 6 the mineralization capacity by adding h2o2 in solution was increased in all cases increasing significantly at bdd anode more than 26 3 4 energy consumption energy consumption per unit volume ec in k wh m 3 was estimated by using eq 18 fig 7 depicts the results 18 e c e c e l l i t v s where e cell is the average potential difference of the cell v i is the applied current a t is the time of reaction h and vs is the volume of solution m3 ec increases linearly fig 7 with the applied current density besides presenting the highest catalytic activity for the degradation of rifampicin bdd electrode consumes approximately 40 less of electrical energy when compared to the other anode materials at 90 ma cm 2 the elimination is about 57 66 and 81 of cod while the energy consumption is practically 143 3 158 7 and 83 0 kw h m 3 for ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 ti pt and bdd electrodes respectively the efficiency of the bdd is associated to its catalytic activity to produce efficiently strong oxidant species thereby demanding less energy 34 evaluation of the single and associated processes with different temperatures fig 8 shows that higher temperature leads to require lower electrical requirements in all the processes this is to the decrease on the potential of the cell as well as the increase on the reaction rates in solution regarding the associated processes the addition of fenton reagents fig 8 data 3 and hydrogen peroxide fig 8 data 4 leads to an increase on the energy requirements by the electrochemical process this is more evident for active electrodes for the latter electrodes adsorption is the first step of the reaction the presence of any species that might compete with the oxidation of water and the adsorption of hydroxyl radicals it can raise the potential of the electrode and consequently the energy consumption 4 conclusions our results attest to the high performance of electrochemical process and fenton reaction concerning the treatment of solutions containing rifampicin on basis of the electrochemical experiments an increase on the applied current density favors an efficient removal of organic matter achieving higher removals at bdd electrode than those achieved at ti pt and ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 the high production of free hydroxyl radicals by bdd promotes the significant mineralization degradation of the organic substrates when compared to the species pto x 1 and ruo x 1 formed on the ti pt and ti ru0 3ti0 7o2 surfaces additionally persulfate can be electrochemically generated at bdd anode which contributes to oxidation of the pollutant when it comes to oxidizing and mineralizing rifampicin the homogeneous fenton reaction is more efficient than the electrochemical process because a higher amount of hydroxyl radicals arise in the reaction medium even though the fenton reaction and the electrochemical process reduce the concentration of the drug and cod to almost the same extent the fenton reaction is significantly faster the combination of electrochemical process with the fenton reaction does not improve the efficiency of the process excess hydroxyl radicals favor parallel reactions that compete with the oxidation of the pollutant and its intermediates nevertheless when hydrogen peroxide was added to the electrochemical process it improved the efficiency of the treatment by the production of other oxidants like as so4 and o3 49 acknowledgments j l s d gratefully acknowledges the cnpq

14597,scaling by calcium carbonate precipitation is an important challenge during exploitation of geothermal water or geothermal district heating systems water decarbonation is a promising solution to mitigate calcium carbonate precipitation and reduce the scaling risks in the current work the decarbonation of geothermal water by coupling atmospheric air bubbling with seeding was investigated for that several operating conditions were studied and optimized such as air and water flows hydrodynamics residence time and bubbling rate synthetic and real solutions were tested to reveal the efficiency of the proposed process the addition of chemicals was avoided results showed that using continuously operating reactor and under optimized operating conditions the decarbonation rate of a calcium carbonate solution tested 4 mmol l of caco3 t 50 c can exceed 30 without using chemicals it was also shown that he residence time in the reactor is relatively short 2 5 min and the protection

ω ccm super saturation of the solution regarding the calcium carbonate monohydrated 1 introduction the hydrological system of southern tunisia is mainly based on the waters of underground aquifers which currently constitute the major exploitable resources 1 however the use of these waters has caused scaling problems 2 the formation of undesirable deposition especially calcium carbonate precipitation is mainly influenced by the high temperature and co2 escapement in atmospheric air which is inevitable during cooling process physico chemical studies have shown that these waters are weakly supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate 3 13 consequently spontaneous nucleation in this type of solution is impossible to mitigate scaling problems the traditional solution is to decarbonate water with lime but besides the large and expensive consumption of a reagent that is not readily available in southern tunisia this solution generates large quantities of carbonated sludge thus its implementation requires a complex apparatus using a fluidized bed crystallization support 5 however this process is compromised with the presence of large quantities of magnesium since 1995 tunisian geothermal water has been used in reverse osmosis process for drinkable water production 4 6 13 in this process the conversion rate is the most important factor 6 the conversion rate depends on the salinity and solubility limits of salts that are likely to precipitate the decarbonation of groundwater would have the advantage of avoiding scale deposits in the cooling towers and in the desalination plant s sand filters reducing the hardness of the water and conversion rate of the desalination unit in previous work 7 9 12 13 it has been shown that seeding with aragonite can cause precipitation of calcium carbonate in calco carbonic solutions caco3 co2 h2o weakly supersaturated 13 16 in this work a process to avoid precipitation of calcium carbonate during desalination process of ground water is proposed in fact the suggested process is based on decarbonation of the ground water by coupling seeding by aragonite crystals to water degassing with atmospheric air thus the proposed process was tested using a laboratory reactor that operates continuously the experimental conditions are very close to reality since the water refrigerant uses atmospheric air which facilitates the adaptation to industrial scale in the first part the technique of degassing used with synthetic and real waters to study the different parameters that can influence the profitability of this type of decarbonation was tested in a second part decarbonation of calco carbon water is tested with a process designed to operate continuously 2 theory the calco carbonic system is considered as a multiphase system involving three simultaneous phases that imply the existence of two interfaces where the main transfer resistances are located these resistances control the kinetics of global evolution of the system 2 1 gas liquid interface we speak of equilibrium of adsorption desorption of co2 which will be described by henry s law following this equilibrium relation 10 1 p c o 2 k h c o

are connected by the ionization constant of water 6 k w h o h the ionic concentrations must respect the electric neutrality condition of the solution expressed by the following relation 7 2 ca2 2 h3o oh 2 co3 2 hco3 the partial pressure of co2 at the gas liquid interface is a main parameter in the precipitation process of calcium carbonate 13 16 17 the degassing of a calco carbonic solution by atmospheric air reduces the partial pressure of co2 eqs 1 4 can be combined to calculate this parameter 8 p c o 2 k h c o 2 k h h c o 3 γ h c o 3 10 p k 1 p h eq 8 clearly shows that when the partial

constants they are respectively equal to 0 5393 and 0 3373 at a temperature of 50 c 15 the values of ai and bi for the calcium bicarbonate and carbonate ions are determined by 14 3 experimental study 3 1 decarbonation reactor the seeding of a calco carbonic solution by aragonite crystals has proven effectiveness in instantly triggering the secondary nucleation of calcium carbonate and increasing the kinetics of precipitation in fact three minutes after seeding more than one third of the amount of caco3 is precipitated 3 13 this result which seems to be interesting especially in the absence of chemicals leads us to test this type of experiments in a reactor operating continuously fig 1 the experimental set up consists mainly of a reactor made of plexiglass with a capacity of 3 l composed of 3 parts i a lower part containing the atmospheric air inlet e1 through a diffuser porosity between 10 and 16 μm fixed in the bottom of the conical zone ii a conical zone containing the entry of the working solution e2 and the seed injection e3 this conical portion causes turbulence at the inlet of the reactor to increase the transfer of co2 between water and air it is also the place where germination supported by seed crystals is triggered iii an upper cylindrical part in which the secondary germination continues tests was carried out with synthetic calco carbonic solution ca2 4 mmol l alkalinity alc 8 mmol l equivalent to the geothermal water the parameters followed along the experiments are the ph and the calcium concentration tca at the outlet of the reactor the experiments were carried out with low supersaturated calco carbonic solutions prior to initiating decarbonation the hydrodynamics of the reactor the porosities of the degassing diffusers and the injection conditions of the seeds were evaluated the decarbonation performance of calco carbonic water was monitored according to several parameters and more particularly the ratio of the air flow rate to the flow rate of treated water 3 2 conduct of a typical test after fixing the temperature and the ph of the studied solution the seed crystals aragonites are injected into the reactor just before the simultaneous introduction of water and air at the reactor outlet the ph tca and or alkalinity alc are measured as well as the residence time of the solution to be decarbonated the ph can also be measured at the top of the conical zone each test repeated 3 times represents an experimental point the reactor is cleaned with a weakly acidified solution before resuming another test the parameters studied are water flow air flow and seed quantity the operating conditions are summarized in table 1 it should be noted that 40 f 4 mmol l 1 of caco3 the decarbonation rate dr is calculated as follows 15 d r c a i n l e t c a o u t l e t c a i n l e t 100 where c a i n l e t and c a o u t l e t are the calcium concentration of water on the inlet and outlet of the reactor respectively 3 3 identification of precipitates the precipitates were identified by x ray diffraction x ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy sem the x ray analysis of the obtained precipitates confirmed that the deposits were of aragonitic nature in fact all the peaks present in the diffractogram fig 2 are related to aragonite and like those of injected seeds the photos obtained by scanning electron microscopy confirm the xrd analysis and show that the precipitates obtained are in the form of aragonite needles these are supported by the mother needles as shown in the photo sem of fig 3 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrodynamic study of the reactor 4 1 1 the residence time distribution rtd the hydrodynamic characterization of the reactor is determined by the study of the residence time distribution rtd the residence time is the time required for a molecule to pass through a reactor from the inlet to the outlet to do this a tracer kcl was injected by injection dirac pulse rapid injection of a very small amount of tracer before the injection of the tracer the working solution degassed by atmospheric air flows into the reactor the feed rate of the solution to be treated the flow rate of degassing air and the temperature are set respectively at 1 l min 1 6 l min 1 and 50 c at time t 10 min 2 ml of a 3 m solution of kcl are injected into the reactor inlet the potassium concentration at the reactor outlet is determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy the passage of k ions through the reactor outlet characterizes the distribution of the residence time the results obtained are shown in fig 4 immediately after the injection the potassium concentration at the reactor outlet passes through a maximum value thereafter the working solution continuing to enter the reactor dilutes the potassium concentration to bring it back to its initial value about 14 min after the injection the evolution of the tracer concentration illustrated in fig 4 a shows that the hydrodynamics of the reactor do not exhibit flow defects no peak concentration the baseline returns to 0 all the injected tracer leaves the reactor the curve representing the distribution of the residence time shows a rapid rise and then a pseudo exponential descent to verify the last remark the logarithmic evolution of the k ion concentration at the reactor outlet as a function of time has been presented in the log k as function of time fig 4 b clearly shows that the logarithmic variation of the concentration of potassium ions as a function of time is a straight line with a negative slope in fact the signal of the tracer decreases exponentially as a function of the time this result shows that the reactor is of the perfectly stirred continuous type 4 1 2 influence of diffuser porosity on degassing rate the diffuser porosity np cm 2 is defined by the following relation 16 np cm 2 n u m b e r o f p o r e s s u r f a c e o f t h e d i f f u s e r c m 2 the distribution of atmospheric air through a diffuser allows the creation of fine bubbles in the solution to be treated in fact the interface separating the solution and the atmospheric air increases allowing a better profitability of the transfer of co2 the objectives of this paragraph are to quantify the transfer of co2 and to optimize the parameters allowing it to be carried out the experiments were carried out on pure calcium carbonate solutions of tca 40 f without seeding the partial pressure of co2 pco2 at the gas liquid interface at ph 7 is 7 63 10 2 atm the degassing is carried out by the atmospheric air of which the pco2 is equal to 3 10 4 atm the reactor is supplied with water and air flows respectively equal to 1 and 6 l min 1 three porosity diffusers 2 5 8 5 and 14 5 were tested the ph at the reactor outlet seems to be the most suitable and easiest parameter to evaluate co2 transfer in fact the concentration of carbon dioxide is directly related to the ph value of the solution as shown in eq 17 valid at ph 8 3 the results obtained are shown in fig 5 17 c o 2 h c o 3 10 p k 1 p h the evolution of ph shows that the degassing of the calco carbonic solution is more important with the highest porosities 14 5 np cm 2 the ph of the solution stabilizes after one minute at a value equal to 8 2 which corresponds to a partial pressure of co2 of the order of 4 7 10 3 atm with a porosity of 8 5 np cm 2 the ph at the reactor outlet stabilizes after 2 min at a value of the order of 8 05 whereas with the lowest porosity the ph stability time exceeds the passage time in the reactor 3 min the degassing system can be characterized by a constant k expressed by eq 18 as follows 18 l o g c e l o g c s k h q w ce is the equilibrium co2 concentration at the inlet cs is the co2 concentration of equilibrium at the exit h is height of the reactor and k is a constant depending on the reactor design the ph values measured at the reactor outlet make it possible to evaluate the constant k for a constant value of the ratio qair qw k increases as the porosity of the diffuser increases fig 6 this is because the high porosity produces thinner gas bubbles so the surface separating the two phases exchange interface is larger it will therefore be more efficient to work with the higher porosities 4 2 optimization of operating parameters 4 2 1 effect of degassing rate on ph the degassing co2 evacuation of a given solution is considered as the most important parameter in the breakdown of the calco carbonic equilibrium as long as the water is in contact with atmospheric air degassing takes place in a continuous and spontaneous manner its speed depends essentially on the temperature the exchange surface and the ratio of the volume of gas to that of water vg vw the working temperature being fixed the exchange surface is linked to the hydrodynamics of the reactor thus it is important to evaluate the influence of the vg vw ratio for this type of decarbonation the evaluation of the contribution of the ratio vg vw or rather that of the flows qgas qwater is carried out at fixed values of seed quantity water flow and temperature respectively equal to 1 g l 1 1 l min 1 and 50 c the diffuser porosity was 14 5 the evolution of the ph at the outlet of the reactor was followed for values of air flow rate of between 2 and 8 l min 1 the results are shown in fig 7 the degassing of the calco carbonic solution allows a transfer of co2 from the liquid to atmospheric air thus ensuring an increase of ph and subsequently promoting the conversion of the bicarbonate ions into carbonate ions when the ph value is equal to 7 the percentage of free co2 is about 12 it decreases to 3 when the ph reaches 7 8 the reaction which makes it possible to describe this transformation in solution is as follows 19 h2co3 co2 aq h2o co2 g h2o the increase of ph during degassing of the tested solution is explained by the decrease of the carbonic acid concentration for the various air flows tested the increase in ph is very accentuated at the beginning of degassing stabilizes one minute later and tends towards a critical value relative to the degassing flow rate degassing quality can be assessed by determining co2 transfer efficiency cte which represents the percentage of co2 transferred from the liquid to the gas at different degassing rates the cte is defined by the following equation 20 c t e 100 c o 2 i e q c o 2 f e q c o 2 f e q co2 eq is the equilibrium concentration this concentration represents the co2 of the gas phase which is in co2 desorption equilibrium at the liquid gas interface with respect to the free co2 in solution and which does not involve equilibrium in the liquid phase and at the liquid solid interface the indices i and f are respectively the initial ph 7 and final after degassing states the equilibrium at the gas liquid interface obeys henry s law it is therefore possible to determine the concentration of equilibrium co2 from this equation fig 8 shows the various results obtained when the degassing system reaches the steady state the cte is proportional to the ratio vg vw in fact the desorption of co2 at the gas liquid interface at constant temperature depends essentially on the exchange surface which depends on the ratio between the volume of the gas phase and that of the liquid phase with a ratio vg vw equal to 2 the cte is of the order of 75 the transfer efficiency reaches about 90 when the ratio vg vw is equal to 8 4 2 2 effect of the degassing rate on calcium concentration at the reactor output the degassing rate seems to have a considerable effect on the kinetics of precipitation of calcium carbonate the results concerning the evolution of the calcium concentration as a function of time for different air flow rates are shown in fig 9 starting from 40 f the tca drops considerably within the reactor at the end of the first minute 80 of the total amount precipitated after 3 min the value corresponding to the passage time of the water in the reactor the calcium concentration stabilizes at values inversely proportional to the flow rate of degassing air 4 2 3 optimization of the quantity of injected seed the objective of this section is to determine the optimal amount of seed that should be used as a crystallization medium for this purpose the effect of the agitation speed of the seeds and of the injected mass on the decarbonation reactor was studied to obtain a constant concentration of the seeds in the reactor attempts were made to keep the seeds in suspension both in the seed preparation vessel and in the tubing connected to the reactor the most accessible parameter for this operation is the agitation rate of the solution containing the seeds four stirring rates were tested to determine the suitable speed that allowed the best distribution of the seeds in the reactor it was noticed that from a speed of 600 tr min 1 the seed mass recovered at the reactor outlet throughout the experiment is practically constant and equal to the value sought the optimum seed mass was injected into the reactor by maintaining the water and air flow rate at 1 and 6 l min 1 respectively the initial values of ph and water temperature are set at 7 0 and 50 c respectively the calcium concentration tca and the initial alkalinity concentration alc are 40 f the tested seed concentrations ranged from 0 25 to 3 5 g l 1 the seeds the operating gas and water are introduced simultaneously into the reactor the results concerning the evolution of the ph and the calcium concentration at the outlet of the reactor as a function of the quantity of injected seeds are shown in fig 10 in the presence of the seeds the ph and the calcium concentration at the outlet of the reactor decrease with the quantity of injected seeds in fact the seeding causes caco3 precipitation which is generally followed by a ph drop seed concentrations greater than 1 g l 1 the tca at the reactor exit stabilized at a value close to 31 f indicating that an additional amount of aragonite provided only a very small improvement in decarbonation from 1 3 5 g l 1 of injected seed the decarbonation rate increased by only about 1 in fact a concentration of 1 g l 1 of aragonitic seeds can be considered as the optimum value under these operating conditions the decarbonation rate obtained at the reactor outlet is close to 22 4 2 4 effect of the ratio gas flow water flow on decarbonation the ratio between the air and water flows is an important parameter on an industrial scale it allows the sizing of the installations the air and water flows intervals chosen in this study are respectively equal to 2 8 l min 1 and 0 3 3 l min 1 respectively this corresponds to ratios vg vw varying from 0 66 to 26 66 the evolution of the decarbonation rate and the cte as a function of the ratio vg vw are summarized in fig 11 clearly the cte which illustrates the quality of degassing increases with the ratio vg vw reaching its maximum at vg vw 12 in fact from this value the co2 transfer efficiency stabilized at about 92 similarly the decarbonation rate increased with the ratio vg vw to reach a pseudo plateau from the same value of the ratio vg vw vg vw 12 the maximum decarbonation rate for the degassing system coupled with seeding reaches 30 the ratio vg vw 12 corresponds to an air flow rate of 6 l min 1 and a water flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 when the ratio of air and water flow rates is greater than 12 the equilibrium co2 partial pressure is around 5 45 10 3 atm this value is slightly higher than the equilibrium pco2 in atmospheric air so the equilibrium state is not yet achieved between the tested solution and the atmospheric air in fact the risk of degassing can continue at the water exit consequently the study of the time passage seems to be necessary to determine the optimum time that the solution must remain in the reactor to reach the calco carbonic equilibrium 4 2 5 effect of transit time on decarbonation the passage time represents the time required for the solution to pass through the reactor it is equal to the ratio between the reactor volume and the water flow this parameter is very important on an industrial scale the process of decarbonation is even more profitable as the passage time of the treated water in the reactor is minimal the results showing the evolution of the decarbonation rate as a function of the passage time at different degassing air flow rates are shown in fig 12 the decarbonation rate was improved with the increase of passage time in fact more the water stays in the reactor greater is the quantity of precipitated caco3 this observation is valid regardless the flow of degassing air however decarbonation is not significantly improved beyond a passage time of 6 min water 0 5 l min 1 in the case of qair 8 l min 1 the decarbonation rate is only improved by about 1 5 when changing from a 6 to 10 min transit time about 10 when the passage time increases from 1 to 3 min between 3 and 6 min the growth rate of the decarbonation rate is close to 5 the same phenomenon is observed for other cases of air flow 5 conclusion in the current work the decarbonation of geothermal water by atmospheric air bubbling coupled to secondary nucleation was investigated it was shown that seeding with aragonite crystals has proven to be effective in instantly triggering the nucleation of calcium carbonate and accelerating its precipitation it was also shown that this process help to protect the walls against the deposit of the precipitates since the precipitation is supported by the seed crystals in addition to the agitation of the solution the degassing with air allows the displacement of the calco carbonic equilibrium towards the formation of the co3 2 ions the efficiency of the process is intimately linked to the flow of the treated water in a continuously operating reactor experiments have shown that the decarbonation rate of a calcium carbonate solution 4 mmol l of caco3 50 c can exceed 30 without using chemicals the residence time is relatively short 2 5 min and the protection of the walls of the reactor is ensured it should be pointed out that the proposed process is very reliable for by geothermal water at low enthalpy t less than 20 c because the thermodynamic data of the three forms aragonite calcite and vaterite keeps the same profile from 0 to 90 c 
14597,scaling by calcium carbonate precipitation is an important challenge during exploitation of geothermal water or geothermal district heating systems water decarbonation is a promising solution to mitigate calcium carbonate precipitation and reduce the scaling risks in the current work the decarbonation of geothermal water by coupling atmospheric air bubbling with seeding was investigated for

efficiency of the proposed process the addition of chemicals was avoided results showed that using continuously operating reactor and under optimized operating conditions the decarbonation rate of a calcium carbonate solution tested 4 mmol l of caco3 t 50 c can exceed 30 without using chemicals it was also shown that he residence time in the reactor is relatively short 2 5 min and the protection

which currently constitute the major exploitable resources 1 however the use of these waters has caused scaling problems 2 the formation of undesirable deposition especially calcium carbonate precipitation is mainly influenced by the high temperature and co2 escapement in atmospheric air which is inevitable during cooling process physico chemical studies have shown that these waters are weakly supersaturated with respect to calcium carbonate 3 13 consequently spontaneous nucleation in this type of solution is impossible to mitigate scaling problems the traditional solution is to decarbonate water with lime but besides the large and expensive consumption of a reagent that is not readily available in southern tunisia this solution generates large quantities of carbonated sludge thus its implementation requires a complex apparatus using a fluidized bed crystallization support 5 however this process is compromised with the presence of large quantities of magnesium since 1995 tunisian geothermal water has been used in reverse osmosis process for drinkable water production 4 6 13 in this process the conversion rate is the most important factor 6 the conversion rate depends on the salinity and solubility limits of salts that are likely to precipitate the decarbonation of groundwater would have the advantage of avoiding scale deposits in the cooling towers and in the desalination plant s sand filters reducing the hardness of the water and conversion rate of the desalination unit in previous work 7 9 12 13 it has been shown that seeding with aragonite can cause precipitation of calcium carbonate in calco carbonic solutions caco3 co2 h2o weakly supersaturated 13 16 in this work a process to avoid precipitation of calcium carbonate during desalination process of ground water is proposed in fact the suggested process is based on decarbonation of the ground water by coupling seeding by aragonite crystals to water degassing with atmospheric air thus the proposed process was tested using a laboratory reactor that operates continuously the experimental conditions are very close to reality since the water refrigerant uses atmospheric air which facilitates the adaptation to industrial scale in the first part the technique of degassing used with synthetic and real waters to study the different parameters that can influence the profitability of this type of decarbonation was tested in a second part decarbonation of calco carbon water is tested with a process designed to operate continuously 2 theory the calco carbonic system is considered as a multiphase system involving three simultaneous phases that imply the existence of two interfaces where the main transfer resistances are located these resistances control the kinetics of global

3 1 decarbonation reactor the seeding of a calco carbonic solution by aragonite crystals has proven effectiveness in instantly triggering the secondary nucleation of calcium carbonate and increasing the kinetics of precipitation in fact three minutes after seeding more than one third of the amount of caco3 is precipitated 3 13 this result which seems to be interesting especially in the absence of chemicals leads us to test this type of experiments in a reactor operating continuously fig 1 the experimental set up consists mainly of a reactor made of plexiglass with a capacity of 3 l composed of 3 parts i a lower part containing the atmospheric air inlet e1 through a diffuser porosity between 10 and 16 μm fixed in the bottom of the conical zone ii a conical zone containing the entry of the working solution e2 and the seed injection e3 this conical portion causes turbulence at the inlet of the reactor to increase the transfer of co2 between water and air it is also the place where germination supported by seed crystals is triggered iii an upper cylindrical part in which the secondary germination continues tests was carried out with synthetic calco carbonic solution ca2 4 mmol l alkalinity alc 8 mmol l equivalent to the geothermal water the parameters followed along the experiments are the ph and the calcium concentration tca at the outlet of the reactor the experiments were carried out with low supersaturated calco carbonic solutions prior to initiating decarbonation the hydrodynamics of the reactor the porosities of the degassing diffusers and the injection conditions of the seeds were evaluated the decarbonation performance of calco carbonic water was monitored according to several parameters and more particularly the ratio of the air flow rate to the flow rate of treated water 3 2 conduct of a typical test after fixing the temperature and the ph of the studied solution the seed crystals aragonites are injected into the reactor just before the simultaneous introduction of water and air at the reactor outlet the ph tca and or alkalinity alc are measured as well as the residence time of the solution to be decarbonated the ph can also be measured at the top of the conical zone each test repeated 3 times represents an experimental point the reactor is cleaned with a weakly acidified solution before resuming another test the parameters studied are water flow air flow and seed quantity the operating conditions are summarized in table 1 it should be noted that 40 f 4 mmol l 1 of caco3 the decarbonation rate dr is calculated as follows 15 d r c a i n l e t c a o u t l e t c a i n l e t 100 where c a i n l e t and c a o u t l e t are the calcium concentration of water on the inlet and outlet of the reactor respectively 3 3 identification of precipitates the precipitates were identified by x ray diffraction x ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy sem the x ray analysis of the obtained precipitates confirmed that the deposits were of aragonitic nature in fact all the peaks present in the diffractogram fig 2 are related to aragonite and like those of injected seeds the photos obtained by scanning electron microscopy confirm the xrd analysis and show that the precipitates obtained are in the form of aragonite needles these are supported by the mother needles as shown in the photo sem of fig 3 4 results and discussions 4 1 hydrodynamic study of the reactor 4 1 1 the residence time distribution rtd the hydrodynamic characterization of the reactor is determined by the study of the residence time distribution rtd the residence time is the time required for a molecule to pass through a reactor from the inlet to the outlet to do this a tracer kcl was injected by injection dirac pulse rapid injection of a very small amount of tracer before the injection of the tracer the working solution degassed by atmospheric air flows into the reactor the feed rate of the solution to be treated the flow rate of degassing air and the temperature are set respectively at 1 l min 1 6 l min 1 and 50 c at time t 10 min 2 ml of a 3 m solution of kcl are injected into the reactor inlet the potassium concentration at the reactor outlet is determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy the passage of k ions through the reactor outlet characterizes the distribution of the residence time the results obtained are shown in fig 4 immediately after the injection the potassium concentration at the reactor outlet passes through a maximum value thereafter the working solution continuing to enter the reactor dilutes the potassium concentration to bring it back to its initial value about 14 min after the injection the evolution of the tracer concentration illustrated in fig 4 a shows that the hydrodynamics of the reactor do not exhibit flow defects no peak concentration the baseline returns to 0 all the injected tracer leaves the reactor the curve representing the distribution of the residence time shows a rapid rise and then a pseudo exponential descent to verify the last remark the logarithmic evolution of the k ion concentration at the reactor outlet as a function of time has been presented in the log k as function of time fig 4 b clearly shows that the logarithmic variation of the concentration of potassium ions as a function of time is a straight line with a negative slope in fact the signal of the tracer decreases exponentially as a function of the time this result shows that the reactor is of the perfectly stirred continuous type 4 1 2 influence of diffuser porosity on degassing rate the diffuser porosity np cm 2 is defined by the following relation 16 np cm 2 n u m b e r o f p o r e s s u r f a c e o f t h e d i f f u s e r c m 2 the distribution of atmospheric air through a diffuser allows the creation of fine bubbles in the solution to be treated in fact the interface separating the solution and the atmospheric air increases allowing a better profitability of the transfer of co2 the objectives of this paragraph are to quantify the transfer of co2 and to optimize the parameters allowing it to be carried out the experiments were carried out on pure calcium carbonate solutions of tca 40 f without seeding the partial pressure of co2 pco2 at the gas liquid interface at ph 7 is 7 63 10 2 atm the degassing is carried out by the atmospheric air of which the pco2 is equal to 3 10 4 atm the reactor is supplied with water and air flows respectively equal to 1 and 6 l min 1 three porosity diffusers 2 5 8 5 and 14 5 were tested the ph at the reactor outlet seems to be the most suitable and easiest parameter to evaluate co2 transfer in fact the concentration of carbon dioxide is directly related to the ph value of the solution as shown in eq 17 valid at ph 8 3 the results obtained are shown in fig 5 17 c o 2 h c o 3 10 p k 1 p h the evolution of ph shows that the degassing of the calco carbonic solution is more important with the highest porosities 14 5 np cm 2 the ph of the solution stabilizes after one minute at a value equal to 8 2 which corresponds to a partial pressure of co2 of the order of 4 7 10 3 atm with a porosity of 8 5 np cm 2 the ph at the reactor outlet stabilizes after 2 min at a value of the order of 8 05 whereas with the lowest porosity the ph stability time exceeds the passage time in the reactor 3 min the degassing system can be characterized by a constant k expressed by eq 18 as follows 18 l o g c e l o g c s k h q w ce is the equilibrium co2 concentration at the inlet cs is the co2 concentration of equilibrium at the exit h is height of the reactor and k is a constant depending on the reactor design the ph values measured at the reactor outlet make it possible to evaluate the constant k for a constant value of the ratio qair qw k increases as the porosity of the diffuser increases fig 6 this is because the high porosity produces thinner gas bubbles so the surface separating the two phases exchange interface is larger it will therefore be more efficient to work with the higher porosities 4 2 optimization of operating parameters 4 2 1 effect of degassing rate on ph the degassing co2 evacuation of a given solution is considered as the most important parameter in the breakdown of the calco carbonic equilibrium as long as the water is in contact with atmospheric air degassing takes place in a continuous and spontaneous manner its speed depends essentially on the temperature the exchange surface and the ratio of the volume of gas to that of water vg vw the working temperature being fixed the exchange surface is linked to the hydrodynamics of the reactor thus it is important to evaluate the influence of the vg vw ratio for this type of decarbonation the evaluation of the contribution of the ratio vg vw or rather that of the flows qgas qwater is carried out at fixed values of seed quantity water flow and temperature respectively equal to 1 g l 1 1 l min 1 and 50 c the diffuser porosity was 14 5 the evolution of the ph at the outlet of the reactor was followed for values of air flow rate of between 2 and 8 l min 1 the results are shown in fig 7 the degassing of the calco carbonic solution allows a transfer of co2 from the liquid to atmospheric air thus ensuring an increase of ph and subsequently promoting the conversion of the bicarbonate ions into carbonate ions when the ph value is equal to 7 the percentage of free co2 is about 12 it decreases to 3 when the ph reaches 7 8 the reaction which makes it possible to describe this transformation in solution is as follows 19 h2co3 co2 aq h2o co2 g h2o the increase of ph during degassing of the tested solution is explained by the decrease of the carbonic acid concentration for the various air flows tested the increase in ph is very accentuated at the beginning of degassing stabilizes one minute later and tends towards a critical value relative to the degassing flow rate degassing quality can be assessed by determining co2 transfer efficiency cte which represents the percentage of co2 transferred from the liquid to the gas at different degassing rates the cte is defined by the following equation 20 c t e 100 c o 2 i e q c o 2 f e q c o 2 f e q co2 eq is the equilibrium concentration this concentration represents the co2 of the gas phase which is in co2 desorption equilibrium at the liquid gas interface with respect to the free co2 in solution and which does not involve equilibrium in the liquid phase and at the liquid solid interface the indices i and f are respectively the initial ph 7 and final after degassing states the equilibrium at the gas liquid interface obeys henry s law it is therefore possible to determine the concentration of equilibrium co2 from this equation fig 8 shows the various results obtained when the degassing system reaches the steady state the cte is proportional to the ratio vg vw in fact the desorption of co2 at the gas liquid interface at constant temperature depends essentially on the exchange surface which depends on the ratio between the volume of the gas phase and that of the liquid phase with a ratio vg vw equal to 2 the cte is of the order of 75 the transfer efficiency reaches about 90 when the ratio vg vw is equal to 8 4 2 2 effect of the degassing rate on calcium concentration at the reactor output the degassing rate seems to have a considerable effect on the kinetics of precipitation of calcium carbonate the results concerning the evolution of the calcium concentration as a function of time for different air flow rates are shown in fig 9 starting from 40 f the tca drops considerably within the reactor at the end of the first minute 80 of the total amount precipitated after 3 min the value corresponding to the passage time of the water in the reactor the calcium concentration stabilizes at values inversely proportional to the flow rate of degassing air 4 2 3 optimization of the quantity of injected seed the objective of this section is to determine the optimal amount of seed that should be used as a crystallization medium for this purpose the effect of the agitation speed of the seeds and of the injected mass on the decarbonation reactor was studied to obtain a constant concentration of the seeds in the reactor attempts were made to keep the seeds in suspension both in the seed preparation vessel and in the tubing connected to the reactor the most accessible parameter for this operation is the agitation rate of the solution containing the seeds four stirring rates were tested to determine the suitable speed that allowed the best distribution of the seeds in the reactor it was noticed that from a speed of 600 tr min 1 the seed mass recovered at the reactor outlet throughout the experiment is practically constant and equal to the value sought the optimum seed mass was injected into the reactor by maintaining the water and air flow rate at 1 and 6 l min 1 respectively the initial values of ph and water temperature are set at 7 0 and 50 c respectively the calcium concentration tca and the initial alkalinity concentration alc are 40 f the tested seed concentrations ranged from 0 25 to 3 5 g l 1 the seeds the operating gas and water are introduced simultaneously into the reactor the results concerning the evolution of the ph and the calcium concentration at the outlet of the reactor as a function of the quantity of injected seeds are shown in fig 10 in the presence of the seeds the ph and the calcium concentration at the outlet of the reactor decrease with the quantity of injected seeds in fact the seeding causes caco3 precipitation which is generally followed by a ph drop seed concentrations greater than 1 g l 1 the tca at the reactor exit stabilized at a value close to 31 f indicating that an additional amount of aragonite provided only a very small improvement in decarbonation from 1 3 5 g l 1 of injected seed the decarbonation rate increased by only about 1 in fact a concentration of 1 g l 1 of aragonitic seeds can be considered as the optimum value under these operating conditions the decarbonation rate obtained at the reactor outlet is close to 22 4 2 4 effect of the ratio gas flow water flow on decarbonation the ratio between the air and water flows is an important parameter on an industrial scale it allows the sizing of the installations the air and water flows intervals chosen in this study are respectively equal to 2 8 l min 1 and 0 3 3 l min 1 respectively this corresponds to ratios vg vw varying from 0 66 to 26 66 the evolution of the decarbonation rate and the cte as a function of the ratio vg vw are summarized in fig 11 clearly the cte which illustrates the quality of degassing increases with the ratio vg vw reaching its maximum at vg vw 12 in fact from this value the co2 transfer efficiency stabilized at about 92 similarly the decarbonation rate increased with the ratio vg vw to reach a pseudo plateau from the same value of the ratio vg vw vg vw 12 the maximum decarbonation rate for the degassing system coupled with seeding reaches 30 the ratio vg vw 12 corresponds to an air flow rate of 6 l min 1 and a water flow rate of 0 5 l min 1 when the ratio of air and water flow rates is greater than 12 the equilibrium co2 partial pressure is around 5 45 10 3 atm this value is slightly higher than the equilibrium pco2 in atmospheric air so the equilibrium state is not yet achieved between the tested solution and the atmospheric air in fact the risk of degassing can continue at the water exit consequently the study of the time passage seems to be necessary to determine the optimum time that the solution must remain in the reactor to reach the calco carbonic equilibrium 4 2 5 effect of transit time on decarbonation the passage time represents the time required for the solution to pass through the reactor it is equal to the ratio between the reactor volume and the water flow this parameter is very important on an industrial scale the process of decarbonation is even more profitable as the passage time of the treated water in the reactor is minimal the results showing the evolution of the decarbonation rate as a function of the passage time at different degassing air flow rates are shown in fig 12 the decarbonation rate was improved with the increase of passage time in fact more the water stays in the reactor greater is the quantity of precipitated caco3 this observation is valid regardless the flow of degassing air however decarbonation is not significantly improved beyond a passage time of 6 min water 0 5 l min 1 in the case of qair 8 l min 1 the decarbonation rate is only improved by about 1 5 when changing from a 6 to 10 min transit time about 10 when the passage time increases from 1 to 3 min between 3 and 6 min the growth rate of the decarbonation rate is close to 5 the same phenomenon is observed for other cases of air flow 5 conclusion in the current work the decarbonation of geothermal water by atmospheric air bubbling coupled to secondary nucleation was investigated it was shown that seeding with aragonite crystals has proven to be effective in instantly triggering the nucleation of calcium carbonate and accelerating its precipitation it was also shown that this process help to protect the walls against the deposit of the precipitates since the precipitation is supported by the seed crystals in addition to the agitation of the solution the degassing with air allows the displacement of the calco carbonic equilibrium towards the formation of the co3 2 ions the efficiency of the process is intimately linked to the flow of the treated water in a continuously operating reactor experiments have shown that the decarbonation rate of a calcium carbonate solution 4 mmol l of caco3 50 c can exceed 30 without using chemicals the residence time is relatively short 2 5 min and the protection of the walls of the reactor is ensured it should be pointed out that the proposed process is very reliable for by geothermal water at low enthalpy t less than 20 c because the thermodynamic data of the three forms aragonite calcite and vaterite keeps the same profile from 0 to 90 c

very high salt concentration over 200 300 gnac l 1 2 however wastewater produced by fish processing is generally mixed with fresh water used for cleaning operation hence the salinity is reduced 3 during the rest of the year salinity significantly decreases because the primary activity carried out is the fish canning that does not require the use of brine however in some cases occasional occurrences of moderate salinity increase may occur during this period according to industry s needs for instance because of occasional fresh fish processing consequently moderate and drastic increases in salinity generally occur in both the long and short term although chemical physical treatments are high efficiency technologies their high operating costs make that activated sludge process remains the most widely used treatment for organic carbon degradation and nutrient removal however high salinity and salinity variations lead to the arising of the osmotic pressure thereby decreasing the metabolic enzyme activity and inhibiting the microorganisms growth this affects the bacterial metabolism and inevitably the performances of the biological system the majority of the saline wastewater related studies reported in the literature dealt with simulated media 4 5 however real saline wastewater i e fish canning wastewater apart from the high salinity are characterized by high suspended solids up to 5000 mg l 1 organic matter cod up to 90000 mg l 1 and nitrogen concentration tn up to 3000 mg l 1 which make their biological treatment a considerable challenge 6 several studies demonstrated the feasibility in treating saline wastewater by means of halotolerant biomass 4 7 however the main bottleneck is that the performance of such salt adapted systems is usually limited to low salinity levels 8 9 a viable approach to overcome the effect of high salinity on bacterial activity is the use of granular sludge biomass 7 10 although granular sludge technology offers several benefits compared with flocculent activated sludge the ability of granules in withstanding highly salinity environment while preserving satisfactorily nutrients removal performance is limited 8 10 11 in the majority of these studies dealing with simulated saline wastewater no significant variations in salinity occurred meaning that either the salinity was constant or it was stepwise increased 4 11 in the literature is reported that rapid salinity fluctuations could significantly affect the performance even of salt adapted bacteria 10 nevertheless no studies aimed at examining the stress of salinity shock on biological systems neither granular nor flocculent activated sludge are available in the literature to overcome the bottleneck of the biological salt adapted systems many researchers speculated the possibility of using halophilic biomass for the treatment of high salinity wastewater 10 12 indeed compared with halotolerant microorganisms halophilic bacteria better withstand high saline environments similar to their natural habitats 13 14 in this context autochthonous halophilic activated sludge was successfully used to treat fish canning wastewater 14 the biological system was successfully tested at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity high biomass activity and nutrients removal efficiencies higher than 90 were observed thereby confirming the capability of halophilic biomass in withstanding highly saline environments based on the literature review arise that if on the one hand it was already demonstrated that salinity fluctuations seriously affect the metabolism of microorganisms that have been successfully acclimated to a steady salinity 15 16 on the other hand there is a lack of knowledge about their effects on halophilic biomass with this purpose this work is aimed at investigating the effects of moderate and drastic fluctuations in salinity on the biological activity of autochthonous halophilic bacteria cultivated from a real fish canning wastewater salinity shocks were applied in both the short and the long term in order to simulate seasonal and weekly fluctuations particularly the study was aimed at assessing the effects of salinity fluctuations on nitritation and denitritation kinetics of the autochthonous halophilic biomass in forms of flocculent and granular sludge a comprehensive comparison between the granular sludge and the flocculent biomass was performed with the aim of demonstrating the potential benefit deriving from the halophilic biomass granulation 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up four sequencing batch lab scale reactors two with aerobic granular sludge ags and two with flocculent activated sludge fas were monitored in this study the ags reactors named ags r1 and ags r2 4 l of volume and the fas reactors named fas r1 and fas r2 8 l of volume were subjected to drastic r1 ones and moderate r2 ones salinity increases both in the long term run i and in the short term run ii both ags and fas were operated with a cycle length equal to 12 h the ags reactor cycle was featured as follows 60 min of feeding from the bottom of the reactors 700 min of aeration 5 min of settling and 5 min of effluent withdrawal the fas cycle instead included 30 min of influent feeding aerated 10 h of aeration 60 of anoxic mixing followed by 5 min of aeration to favour nitrogen stripping and lastly 20 min of settling and 5 min of effluent discharge a programmable logic controller plc automatically handled the cycling operations in all the reactors the volumetric exchange ratio was equal to 50 for each cycle so the feeding daily flow was equal to 4 l and 8 l for the ags and the fas reactor respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt was therefore equal to 24 h for each reactor sludge retention time srt was maintained close to 23 days by daily purging a known amount of sludge from the reactors the srt was calculated by the following eq 1 1 s r t v m l t s s q w m l t s s q d t s s e f f l u e n t where v is the volume of the reactor mltss is the total suspended solids concentration in the mixed liquor qw and qd are the volumes of sludge wasted and of wastewater treated on a daily basis respectively and tss effluent is the tss concentration in the effluent based on the tss concentration in the effluent and the mltss concentration the qw was controlled to maintain the srt approximately 23 days the main process parameters including the organic loading rate olr the total mltss and volatile mlvss suspended solids concentration in the mixed liquor and the food to microorganism ratio are summarized in table 1 2 2 wastewater the fish canning wastewater was collected from a local industry producing canned anchovies the wastewater was characterized by high organic matter content bod5 20 000 mg l 1 and nitrogen tn 3000 mg l 1 high total suspended solids concentrations 4500 mg l 1 and high sodium chloride concentration 150 gnacl l 1 the raw wastewater was diluted with tap water as far as salinity was equal to 30 gnacl l 1 baseline value hereafter a known amount of sodium chloride was added to simulate the salinity increases without changing the organic and nitrogen loading rates 2 3 salinity experimental runs description autochthonous halophilic biomass previously cultivated from the same fish canning wastewater at 30 gnacl l 1 was seeded in all the reactors subsequently the flocculent activated sludge developed in forms of aerobic granules in the ags reactors as previously said during the experimental campaign short and long term salinity increases were simulated particularly the experiment was divided into two periods during which moderate 5 gnacl l 1 and drastic 40 gnacl l 1 increases in salinity were simulated in the long term run i and in the short term run ii the detailed experimental runs description is reported in table 2 in detail during run i the influent salinity was maintained at 30 gnacl l 1 for 40 days thus it was sharply increased simulating a salinity shock particularly salinity was increased up to 70 gnacl l 1 in ags r1 and fas r1 and up to 35 in gnacl l 1 in ags r2 and fas r2 by adding a known amount of sodium chloride to the influent wastewater the salt concentration after the increase was maintained constant for a period close to three times the srt 70 days in order to evaluate the effect in the long term during run ii the influent salinity was sharply decreased to 30 gnacl l 1 simulating in such a way a reverse salinity shock in all the reactors then salinity was maintained constant until a new steady state condition in terms of nitrogen removal efficiency was reached after that salinity was increased again up to 70 gnacl l 1 in ags r1 and fas r1 and up to 35 in gnacl l 1 in ags r2 and fas r2 but in this case the shock had a duration equal to the hydraulic retention time of the reactors in order to simulate short term salinity shocks 2 4 analytical methods during both experimental runs biomass physical properties in term of extracellular polymeric substances eps content and composition as well as activated sludge flocs and granules size and morphology were periodically monitored eps extraction was carried out according to the heating method 17 the polysaccharides and the proteins were determined in accordance with the phenol sulfuric acid method 18 and with the folin method 19 respectively total eps content was evaluated as sum of the not bound fraction soluble microbial products and loosely bound eps and the tightly bound eps therefore the eps content was referred to the amount of volatile suspended solids vss all the chemicals physical analyses bod5 nh4 n no2 n were performed according to standard methods 20 the particle size distribution psd of the sludge was measured regularly by means of an optical granulometer sympatec qicpic the average size of the activated sludge flocs as well as granular sludge was calculated as the diameter corresponding to the 50 of the psd the uniformity coefficient uc was defined as the ratio of d60 by d10 where d60 and d10 mean the diameter of the particles for which 60 percent and 10 percent respectively of the particles are smaller besides nitritation and denitritation kinetics were evaluated by performing ammonium utilization rate aur and nitrite utilization rate nur tests these were evaluated as the slope of the linear regression line of ammonium depletion aur either nitrite production nur versus time in a batch reactor 20 0 2 c the slope was therefore referred to the volatile suspended solids concentration of the sample during run i three aur and nur tests were performed specifically the first before the salinity increase the second after once the hrt 1 days and the third after three times the srt 69 days after the shock similarly during run ii the aur and nur tests were performed before the shock the day after once the hrt and lastly when nitrogen removal efficiency was approximately close to that before the shock in both runs the instantaneous and the steady efficiency losses in term of nitritation and denitritation kinetics were calculated as the percentage decrease compared to the pre shock condition of their respective values immediately after the salinity shock and after steady state was reached 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance the reactors performances in terms of bod5 nitrification and total nitrogen removal efficiency during the experiment are reported in table 3 before run i was performed all the reactors were able to remove approximately 98 of the influent bod5 similarly the ammonia removal efficiency was approximately equal to 98 nitrite was the only product of the ammonia oxidation process thereby suggesting the absence of the nitrite oxidizing bacteria the total nitrogen removal efficiency was approximately 96 in the fas whereas it was lower 70 in the ags likely due to incomplete denitritation during run i the bod5 removal efficiency did not decrease in the reactors subjected to the moderate salinity increase indeed the bod5 removal efficiency in the ags r2 and fas r2 was equal to that observed in the previous period at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity thereby suggesting that moderate salinity increase did not affect the organic carbon removal performance in contrast the bod5 removal efficiency decreased in the reactor subjected to drastic salinity shock specifically the fas r1 suffered a greater decrease in performance than the ags r1 nevertheless stable performances were achieved 18 days after the shock in the ags r1 90 whereas after 27 days in the fas r1 82 the ammonia oxidation efficiency significantly decreased after the salinity shocks the loss in nitritation efficiency was higher in the fas reactors and was proportional to the salinity shock intensity at steady state nitritation efficiency was approximately of 52 44 96 and 74 in ags r1 fas r1 ags r2 and fas r2 respectively stable performances were achieved after 18 days and 39 days in ags r1 and fas r1 respectively whereas approximately 8 days were necessary to reach a new steady condition in the reactors subjected to the moderate shock similarly a higher percentage decrease in tn removal efficiency was observed in the fas reactors at new steady state tn removal was approximately of 32 30 81 and 73 in ags r1 fas r1 ags r2 and fas r2 respectively the percentage decrease of tn removal was approximately of 50 in the ags reactors whereas it was approximately 75 in the fas reactors after the salinity was decreased to 30 gnacl l 1 all the reactors exhibited the same nutrients removal performances observed before run i was started during run ii no decrease in bod5 removal efficiency was observed thereby indicating that heterotrophs are not sensitive to short term salinity shock 21 similarly to what observed after the long term shocks the nitritation and tn removal performances significantly decreased only in the reactors subjected to the drastic shock however in this case a rapid and almost total recovery of the pre shock condition was achieved in all the reactors 3 2 impact of long term salinity increases the aur tests helped to analyse the effect of the moderate and drastic salinity increases in the long term on nitritation activity according to the literature high salt concentration has an inhibitory effect on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob consequently nitrite was the only product of ammonium oxidation process 11 in fig 1 the specific ammonium and nitrite utilization rates during run i are reported before the salinity was increased the specific aur at 30 gnacl l 1 was equal to 3 78 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and 4 49 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in both the ags and both the fas respectively fig 1a nitritation rates significantly decreased immediately after the drastic salinity shock indeed the ammonium oxidation capacity dramatically dropped to approximately 0 46 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 the decrease was even more significant in the fas r1 where the aur decreased to approximately 0 13 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 fig 1a at steady state nitritation activity slightly increased stabilizing at approximately 0 73 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and 0 24 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and fas r1 respectively similarly the specific denitritation rates drastically decreased after the salinity increase indeed denitritation activity decreased from 11 44 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to approximately 1 02 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 whereas in the fas r1 it decreased from 12 53 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to 0 87 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 at steady state the specific nur slightly increased in both reactors stabilizing at approximately 3 93 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and 2 09 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r1 in fig 1c the results of the moderate salinity increase are reported following the salinity increase ammonium oxidation capacity by nitrifiers in the ags r2 decreased by almost half standing at approximately 1 91 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 whereas it decreased to approximately 0 64 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r2 at steady state the specific aur in the ags r2 increased to approximately 3 31 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and to 3 36 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r2 the specific nur before the salinity increase was equal to 11 44 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 and 12 53 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and fas r2 respectively fig 1d after the salinity increase the specific nur decreased in both reactors in particular it decreased to approximately 7 02 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and to 4 31 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r2 at steady state denitritation activity was almost entirely recovered in both reactors the steady value of the specific nur was equal to 10 47 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 and 10 04 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and fas r2 respectively in fig 2 the instantaneous fig 2a and the steady efficiency losses fig 2b for nitritation and denitritation rates in run i are depicted as seen from fig 2a the instantaneous loss in nitritation activity following the drastic salinity increase was equal to approximately 89 and 96 in the ags r1 and the fas r1 respectively therefore although ammonium oxidation capacity collapsed in the ags r1 a complete loss in the activity of ammonium oxidizer bacteria was not observed in contrast the decrease in the aur in the fas r1 was close to 100 thereby revealing an almost complete loss of nitrifiers activity referring to the nur the instantaneous loss was comparable to that observed for the aur indeed the instantaneous losses were equal to 91 and 93 for the ags r1 and fas r1 respectively revealing a significant decrease in the heterotrophic bacteria metabolism as previously observed for autotrophic the instantaneous decrease in nitritation activity following the moderate salinity increase was approximately equal to 50 in the ags r2 whereas it was significantly higher in the fas r2 86 concerning the nur the instantaneous loss was slightly lower than that observed in nitritation activity particularly in the ags r2 the instantaneous loss was slightly lower than 10 whereas in the fas it was approximately equal to 20 the steady efficiency losses for nitritation and denitritation rates are depicted in fig 2b at steady state nitritation activity in the ags r1 decreased by approximately 80 because of the drastic salinity increase showing a partial recovery by approximately 10 than the instantaneous loss in contrast the fas r1 did not show any recover of the nitritation rate at steady state thereby indicating that the effect of the salinity shock on autotrophic biomass was irreversible in the flocculent sludge concerning denitritation kinetic the functionalities recovery of heterotrophic bacteria at steady state was higher than autotrophic the steady state loss in denitritation kinetic after the drastic shock was approximately equal to 63 in the ags r1 and to 81 in the fas r1 consequently the recover capability was higher in the ags 27 than the fas 10 following the moderate salinity increase both the nitritation and denitritation capacity in the ags r2 were almost completely recovered the loss in the aur and nur at steady state in the ags r2 was equal to 12 and 9 respectively thereby suggesting that neither the ammonium oxidation nor the nitrite reduction activities were significantly affected by the shock similar consideration referring to the fas r2 can be made however the efficiency losses at steady state was slightly higher compared with those in the ags in particular the losses were equal to 25 and 20 in the aur and nur respectively again it was confirmed that the steady state efficiency loss was lower referring the denitritation kinetic thereby indicating that heterotrophic bacteria were less sensitive to the salinity shocks compared with the autotrophic by comparing the results above it was found that the ags reactors subjected to both moderate and drastic salinity increases showed a lower instantaneous and steady state loss in nitritation and denitritation activity than the fas ones therefore results demonstrated that granular sludge was more suitable to withstand salinity increases than flocculent activated sludge however both the reactors showed significant efficiency losses especially in case of drastic salinity increase indeed following the drastic salinity increase the specific ammonium oxidation rate was quite modest in both the reactors it should be stressed that from the management point of view a decrease in bacterial metabolic activity would lead to an increase of the volume of the reactors and or the cycle length in order to ensure the best efficiency in terms of nutrient removal because aerobic granular sludge allows operating with higher biomass concentration than flocculent activated sludge and at the same time enables a higher biomass activity the increase in an ags reactor volume or cycle length would be lower in any cases than the flocculent fas activated sludge 3 3 impact of salinity decrease at the end of run i after that steady state conditions were reached salinity was sharply decreased to 30 gnacl l 1 both the nitritation and denitritation activity significantly increased in all the reactors particularly in the reactors that were previously subject to the drastic salinity increase ags r1 fas r1 the ammonium oxidation capacity increased from approximately 0 73 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 4 85 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags and from approximately 0 24 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 5 05 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas thereby showing in both the cases a remarkable resilience similarly the nitritation activity was completely recovered in ags r2 and fas r2 concerning the denitritation even in this case a significant increase in metabolic activity was observed the nitrite reduction capacity increased from approximately 3 93 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to 9 91 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and from approximately 2 09 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to 11 59 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r2 the obtained results indicated that a reverse osmotic shock did not occur moreover it could be stated that the ideal condition for the autochthonous bacteria in terms of salinity was 30 gnacl l 1 this salinity is closer to that of seawater that likely represent the natural environment for these bacteria that derive from fish entrails or in general from the marine environment 3 4 impact of short term salinity increases during the next two months corresponding approximately to three times the srt salt concentration was maintained at 30 gnacl l 1 in all the reactors hereafter short term salinity shocks were simulated run ii accordingly salinity was increased again up to 70 gnacl l 1 in ags r1 and fas r1 and up to 35 gnacl l 1 in ags r2 and fas r2 but in this case the shock had a duration equal to the hydraulic retention time of the reactors 24 h the results of the aur and nur tests in run ii are reported in fig 3 the nitritation activity was similar in the ags r1 and fas r1 before the drastic shock fig 3a in fact the ammonia utilization rate was approximately equal to 5 11 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in both the reactors during run ii the ammonium oxidation capacity decreased in both the reactors particularly the aur decreased to approximately 2 15 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and to 1 89 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and fas r1 respectively thereby indicating also in this case a greater resistance of the granular sludge to sharp salinity fluctuations total nitrogen in the effluent was daily monitored after the shock until a new steady condition in terms of removal was reached approximately 5 days were necessary for both the reactors to recover the nitritation activity therefore the time necessary to revert to steady state was close to 5 times the hrt for both the reactors at new steady state condition the aur increased to 4 97 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and 4 84 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and fas r1 respectively thereby showing a complete recovery of the pre shock conditions similar considerations can be made concerning the denitritation activity fig 3b in this case denitrifiers showed a similar behavior compared to nitrifiers bacteria before the shock the nur was equal to 10 65 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 and 11 23 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags and fas respectively whereas it sharply decreased to 4 43 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 and 4 30 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 after the shock and then revert back to the pre shock conditions after five times the hrt the figs 3c and d show the results of the aur and nur tests in the reactors subjected to the moderate salinity shock after the salinity was increased a slightly decreased in the aur was observed in both the reactors indeed the aur decreased from approximately 4 85 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 4 35 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and from approximately 5 05 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 4 17 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and fas r2 respectively in addition the nitritation capability was completely restored after the shock and the steady values were approximately equal to 5 15 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and the fas r2 no significant changes in the denitritation kinetics were observed following the moderate salinity shock the fig 4 shows the instantaneous as well as the steady efficiency losses for the nitritation fig 4a and denitritation fig 4b activity in run ii based on the discussed results the sharp salinity increase caused an instantaneous decrease close to 60 in the aur and the nur in both the ags and the fas by comparing the nitritation and denitritation kinetics following the long term and the short term moderate shocks it was observed that following to the latter the instantaneous efficiency loss was smaller therefore it can be state that the instantaneous efficiency loss depends on the shock duration meaning that the longer is the salinity shock duration the bigger is the instantaneous efficiency loss in metabolic kinetics conversely the moderate salinity shock did not cause significant changes in both the aur and nur except for the fas even if the efficiency loss was lower than 20 after 5 times the hrt all the reactors completely reverted to the pre shock conditions therefore after the shock the steady state efficiency loss was close to zero in all the four reactors in conclusion both the granular and the flocculent sludge reactors were able to withstand moderate salinity shock in the short term 3 5 influence on extracellular polymeric substances the effects of the salinity shocks on the sludge physical characteristics were evaluated in terms of eps structure and composition as well as in terms of sizes of the activated sludge flocs and granules several studies demonstrated the enhancement of the eps production by bacteria under high salinity stress 22 23 the eps matrix sets a barrier for mass transfer and lower the concentration of toxic compounds in the inner cells indeed when saline concentration is changing in the bulk the eps can reduce the destruction of microorganisms due to maintaining cellular osmotic pressure balance 24 it has been demonstrated that with increasing in sodium chloride concentrations an increase of the soluble and loosely bound eps as well as a corresponding decrease in the bound fraction of eps occurred the increase in the soluble eps fraction is mainly associated to plasmolysis and release of intracellular constituents 25 whereas the decrease in the bound fraction is due to the structural weakening of the eps matrix 26 27 fig 5 depicts the specific tightly bound and loosely bound eps concentration at steady state before run i and run ii were started fig 5a and after reaching of steady state following to salinity shocks in each experimental run fig 5b in all the four reactors following both short term and long term shocks regardless of the shock load the changes in total eps content was lower than 10 therefore it was considered negligible the main constituent of eps were proteins before each salinity shock the ratio between proteins pn and polysaccharides ps ranged approximately between 9 and 12 after each shock the amount of proteins significantly increased and pn ps ratio rose up almost to 15 and 19 as a response to the short term and long term drastic shock respectively in contrast following the moderate salinity increase any changes in the eps composition occurred however it is worth to note that the pn ps ratio significantly changed after each salinity increase in the loosely bound fraction of the eps whereas in the tightly bound eps it was comparable with the previous values after the drastic shocks significant changes occurred in the eps structure indeed by comparing the eps structure before and after the shocks an increase of the loosely bound eps and a decrease of the bound fraction was observed these results confirmed what was previously reported in the literature 28 29 the increase in salinity caused a modification of the eps matrix causing destabilization of their structure the increase in the loosely bound eps occurred because of drastic salinity shocks in both the short and long term while no significant changes occurred as a response to moderate shocks indeed the loosely bound eps content raised from 6 same value for ags and fas before the shock to 45 in the ags and 55 in the fas after the long term shock whereas following the short term shock it increased from 5 to 8 in the ags and to 15 in the fas therefore the increase in the loosely bound eps was proportional to both the shock duration and extent 3 6 influence on granular and flocculent sludge morphology the size of both granular and flocculent sludge was monitored in each experimental run granulometric analysis was performed to provide the psd of each sample in all the analyzed conditions fig 6 depicts the particle size distribution of granular and activated flocculent sludge in run i before the shock a and after three time the srt in run i a decrease in the average size of both the granules and the activated sludge flocs was observed fig 6b because the drastic salinity increase the average size of the activated sludge flocs in fas r1 decreased from 340 μm to 135 μm while it slightly decreased from 1720 μm to 1560 μm in ags r1 accordingly the uniformity coefficient changed thereby indicating the modification of the sludge structure the uc slightly increased from 2 7 to 2 8 in fas r1 whereas it significantly increased from approximately 4 2 10 3 in ags r1 the increase in the uc in the ags reactor indicated that degranulation occurred and both flocculent sludge deriving from the granules breakage and not broken granules coexisted within the reactor nevertheless it is worth to mention that the percentage of granules within the reactor measured as the percentage of particles with a size exceeding 600 μm was approximately equal to 70 thereby indicating that the granules were predominant in the ags reactor a decrease of the average particle size and an increase in the uc were observed also after the moderate shock fig 6b the average size of the activated sludge flocs in fas r2 decreased from 340 μm to 162 μm whereas it slightly decreased from 1720 μm to 1650 μm in the ags r2 the uc was almost constant in the fas 2 8 whereas it slightly increased from approximately 4 2 5 2 in the ags the percentage of granules decreased accordingly from 80 to 70 in contrast neither deflocculation nor granules breakage was observed in run ii thereby indicating that deterioration in the sludge structure occurred only in the long term 3 7 comparison between salt acclimated and autochthonous halophilic biomass several studies dealing the effects of salinity shocks on nitrifiers bacteria in activated sludge have been carried out in the past 30 31 generally these studies report that nitrifiers biological activity decrease with the increase in salinity particularly chen and co authors 32 evaluated the performance of an fas with activated sludge at salinity ranging from 0 to 20 gnacl l 1 demonstrating that salinity deteriorated the removal performance especially those related to nitrogen removal wang et al 33 demonstrated that the increase of influent salinity from 0 to 8 caused the decrease of specific ammonium oxidation rate by over 75 campo et al 34 observed a strong inhibition of the autotrophic bacteria in a granular sludge reactor after the salinity was increased from 10 gnacl l 1 to 20 gnacl l 1 but nitrification activity slightly reprised from 5 up to 25 thereby indicating a gradual adaptation of nitrifying microorganisms to the high salinity environment other authors observed that by stepwise increasing the salinity 5 gnacl l 1 nitrifiers bacteria started to adapt to the new saline environment and stabilized their activity under the new conditions but never reaching the initial activity level 35 however it was demonstrated that at 40 gnacl l 1 nitrification was completely inhibited and any adaptation of the sludge to the saline environment was observed yogalakshmi and joseph 25 found that the increase of salinity from 5 gnacl l 1 to 30 gnacl l 1 produced an average decrease of the ammonium removal efficiency close to 74 whereas the following increment in salinity up to 50 gnacl l 1 produced a further drop to 13 right after the shock and hereafter the complete inhibition of nitrification similarly other authors observed that not acclimated activated sludge suffered high strength salinity impacts which caused the decrease of the biomass biological activity 36 the reason of these results is generally related to two factors first the decrease of the oxygen transfer from air to bulk and second to plasmolysis because of the increasing osmotic pressure 37 what is common among these studies is that over a certain salinity level whether salt concentration was rapidly or stepwise increased nitrifiers activity significantly decreases or collapses it is worth to mention that the salinity tested in the present study was higher than that in the above reported even though in the majority of the studies related to saline wastewater nitrification collapsed at a salt concentration of 30 gnacl l 1 this did not happen in the present study after the short term salinity shocks both moderate and drastic an almost complete recovery of pre shock conditions was observed the obtained results were likely due to the use of autochthonous halophilic biomass as inoculum 14 this biomass because it was cultivated from the same wastewater was naturally acclimated to saline environment as well as to the same wastewater that represent its native habitat nevertheless it is worth saying that a significant decrease of nitrifiers activity was noted only in response to the drastic shock in the long term even if a full metabolic activity loss of autotrophic bacteria was not observed in contrast with the literature our findings demonstrated that the autochthonous autotrophic bacteria showed anyway a minimum biological activity even at 70 gnacl l 1 of salinity it is worth to mention that at this salinity beside the high osmotic pressure the decrease in oxygen transfer efficiency could significantly affect the nitrifiers activity under similar salinity wang et al 4 by using salt acclimated biomass observed that the average nh4 n removal efficiency under steady states dramatically decreased from 88 to 21 as the salinity increased from 3 to 8 thereby indicating the loss in nitrifiers activity similar results were observed by corsino and co authors 38 these results indicate that over a certain salinity satisfactorily performance in ammonia oxidation cannot be achieved neither with salt adapted nor with halophilic biomass nevertheless this study demonstrated that autochthonous biomass is more suitable than the salt adapted biomass to perform high nutrient removal in highly saline environment concerning the physical properties of the sludges in contrast to the literature no significant increase in the eps content of both the granular and the flocculent biomass was observed in this study regardless of the shock load the changes in the total eps content was considered negligible for instance wang and co authors 4 observed a linear correlation between salinity and eps similarly in another study the authors found that the eps production was enhanced at each stepwise salinity increase 32 34 these results obtained in this study could be related to the nature of the autochthonous halophilic microorganisms indeed halophilic bacteria are able to counteract the external osmotic pressure because of the high concentration of ions within their cytoplasm the autochthonous microorganisms because came from saline environments are likely naturally adapted to high salt concentrations the accumulation of ions within the cytoplasm allows balancing the osmotic pressure without producing any excess of eps on the other hand the pattern and the composition of the eps changed even only after the drastic shocks the increase of the loosely bound eps was previously observed in the literature 39 under strong saline conditions the replacement of ca2 in the eps matrix by the abundantly available na could significantly contributes to deterioration of the granule structure as previously reported in another study 26 the increase in loosely bound eps was observed at salinity higher than 50 gnacl l 1 the results above confirmed that the denaturation of the eps matrix occurred over a certain salinity and it is due to a physical rather than a biological occurrence concerning the eps composition the results obtained in this study confirmed what reported in the literature specifically the higher was the salt concentration in the influent the higher was the protein content of the eps 33 29 3 8 comparison between halophilic flocculent and granular sludge biomass the results up to now discussed points out that the use of autochthonous halophilic biomass could help to withstand salinity fluctuations based on researches dealing with the treatment of industrial saline wastewater it was stressed the advantage to operate with aerobic granular sludge instead of conventional activated sludge 40 for insance wang and coauthors 33 compared a salt acclimated granular sludge with a flocculent sludge subjected to stepwise increase in salinity biogranules exhibited better performance for all the salinity tested compared with the activated sludge the authors findings suggested that more favorable conditions for the growth and reproduction of bacteria were found in the biofilm based on the results above the granular and the flocculent activated sludge showed a similar response to the short term salinity shocks indeed the efficiency loss in flocculent sludge reactors was comparable with that in granular sludge ones only in case of short term shocks both drastic and moderate in contrast following the long term shocks the ags reactors showed a lower instantaneous as well as steady state loss in nitritation and denitritation activity respect to the fas these results confirmed what was previously observed by wang et al 33 it is likely that because autotrophic bacteria grow in the inner layers of aerobic granules they were less exposed to the saline environment than those in the activated flocculent sludge 41 because of the smaller and less compact structure of the activated sludge than the granular autotrophic bacteria in the flocs are more susceptible to the osmotic pressure changes 32 instead the structure of the granule acted as a buffer layer resulting in a better protection towards bacteria against the changes occurred in the external environment currently this could be the best explanation for the obtained results concerning the physical properties of the biomass detrimental of the eps matrix in granular sludge was lower than the flocculent sludge under the same conditions indicating that aerobic granules are more suited in withstanding salinity fluctuations the results suggested that granular sludge reactors are more suitable in case of seasonal salinity fluctuations that are characterized by massive and long term salinity variations whereas flocculent fas could be implemented in case that the plant is equipped with an equalizer to dump salinity fluctuations halophilic bacteria bio aggregation could be a further advantage allowing operating at higher salinity or with faster kinetics compared with halophilic activated sludge 4 conclusions the effects of moderate and drastic salinity shocks on autochthonous halophilic granular and flocculent activated sludge were studied in the short and long term based on the obtained results it is possible to point out that drastic salinity shock affected the carbon removal efficiencies only in the long term however at steady state a higher removal efficiency and a faster recovery was observed in the ags 90 after 18 days than fas 82 after 27 days autotrophic bacteria suffered severe loss in biological activity only in response to the lt drastic shock in both ags 80 and fas 97 reactors whereas stable nitritation rates were completely restored 5 days after the st shocks biomass kinetics were reverted after the moderate shock whilst drastic shock caused a severe loss in metabolic activity of both nitrifiers and denitrifiers microorganisms and it was proportional to the shock intensity the increase in salinity caused a modification of the eps matrix causing destabilization of their structure that resulted in an increase in the loosely bound eps fraction the drastic salinity increase resulted in a decrease of the average size of the activated sludge flocs in fas from 340 μm to 135 μm and in a degranulation in the agss the granular and the flocculent activated sludge showed a similar response to the short term salinity shocks in contrast a significant loss in nitritation and denitritation activity occurred in the fas in response to the long term shock this study clearly demonstrates the robustness of autochthonous halophilic biomass to withstand salinity shock loads the results suggested that granular sludge is more suited than flocculent activated sludge to withstand seasonal as well as weekly salinity fluctuations 
14598,the effects of salinity fluctuations on the activity of autochthonous halophilic bacteria in aerobic granular sludge ags and flocculent activated sludge fas reactors were investigated the response of nitrifiers and denitrifiers activity to drastic and moderate salinity shocks in the short term st and long term lt was examined the bod5 removal efficiency decreased only in the reactors subjected to the drastic lt salinity increase nevertheless stable performances were achieved 18 days after the shock in the ags r1 90 whereas after 27 days in the fas r1 82 the loss in nitritation efficiency was higher in the fas reactors and was proportional to the shock intensity nitritation activity collapsed from approximately 3 8 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 0 73 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and from 4 5 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 0 24 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and fas r1 respectively even if the ammonium oxidation capacity did not completely disappeared denitritation activity decreased from 11 44 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to 3 93 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 at steady state whereas in the fas r1 it decreased from 12 53 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to 2 09 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 nitritation and denitritation were completely restored 5 days after st shock no significant effects were observed after the moderate shock the changes in the total eps content were lower than 10 therefore it was considered negligible only drastic shocks caused significant changes in the eps structure with an increase of the loosely bound by 45 in the ags and 55 in the fas abbreviations ags aerobic granular sludge aur

industries produce high inorganic salt concentration in their wastewater inter alia petroleum chemical and fish canning tanning pickling etc because of the massive use of salt during the production process the disposal of such wastewater in conventional wastewater treatment plants wwtps is not a viable solution because it is claimed that even small salt concentrations have negative impacts on microorganisms in the activated sludge process 1 fish canning wastewaters are characterized by high salt concentration and by massive fluctuations in salinity indeed in fish canning industries seasonal and weekly fluctuation in salinity frequently occur salinity variations are mainly depending on the fish to be processed tuna anchovies mackerel etc on the manufacturing process fish evisceration canning machineries cleaning etc and on the production period winter summer etc for instance when fresh fish is processed spring and summer process operations including fishes evisceration washing and salting process require large volumes of brines usually these activities are carried out within a few days per week during which the wastewater produced is characterized by very high salt concentration over 200 300 gnac l 1 2 however wastewater produced by fish processing is generally mixed with fresh water used for cleaning operation hence the salinity is reduced 3 during the rest of the year salinity significantly decreases because the primary activity carried out is the fish canning that does not require the use of brine however in some cases occasional occurrences of moderate salinity increase may occur during this period according to industry s needs for instance because of occasional fresh fish processing consequently moderate and drastic increases in salinity generally occur in both the long and short term although chemical physical treatments are high efficiency technologies their high operating costs make that activated sludge process remains the most widely used treatment for organic carbon degradation and nutrient removal however high salinity and salinity variations lead to the arising of the osmotic pressure thereby decreasing the metabolic enzyme activity and inhibiting the microorganisms growth this affects the bacterial metabolism and inevitably the performances of the biological system the majority of the saline wastewater related studies reported in the literature dealt with simulated media 4 5 however real saline wastewater i e fish canning wastewater apart from the high salinity are characterized by high suspended solids up to 5000 mg l 1 organic matter cod up to 90000 mg l 1 and nitrogen concentration tn up to 3000 mg l 1 which make their biological treatment a considerable challenge 6 several studies demonstrated the feasibility in treating saline wastewater by means of halotolerant biomass 4 7 however the main bottleneck is that the performance of such salt adapted systems is usually limited to low salinity levels 8 9 a viable approach to overcome the effect of high salinity on bacterial activity is the use of granular sludge biomass 7 10 although granular sludge technology offers several benefits compared with flocculent activated sludge the ability of granules in withstanding highly salinity environment while preserving satisfactorily nutrients removal performance is limited 8 10 11 in the majority of these studies dealing with simulated saline wastewater no significant variations in salinity occurred meaning that either the salinity was constant or it was stepwise increased 4 11 in the literature is reported that rapid salinity fluctuations could significantly affect the performance even of salt adapted bacteria 10 nevertheless no studies aimed at examining the stress of salinity shock on biological systems neither granular nor flocculent activated sludge are available in the literature to overcome the bottleneck of the biological salt adapted systems many researchers speculated the possibility of using halophilic biomass for the treatment of high salinity wastewater 10 12 indeed compared with halotolerant microorganisms halophilic bacteria better withstand high saline environments similar to their natural habitats 13 14 in this context autochthonous halophilic activated sludge was successfully used to treat fish canning wastewater 14 the biological system was successfully tested at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity high biomass activity and nutrients removal efficiencies higher than 90 were observed thereby confirming the capability of halophilic biomass in withstanding highly saline environments based on the literature review arise that if on the one hand it was already demonstrated that salinity fluctuations seriously affect the metabolism of microorganisms that have been successfully acclimated to a steady salinity 15 16 on the other hand there is a lack of knowledge about their effects on halophilic biomass with this purpose this work is aimed at investigating the effects of moderate and drastic fluctuations in salinity on the biological activity of autochthonous halophilic bacteria cultivated from a real fish canning wastewater salinity shocks were applied in both the short and the long term in order to simulate seasonal and weekly fluctuations particularly the study was aimed at assessing the effects of salinity fluctuations on nitritation and denitritation kinetics of the autochthonous halophilic biomass in forms of flocculent and granular sludge a comprehensive comparison between the granular sludge and the flocculent biomass was performed with the aim of demonstrating the potential benefit deriving from the halophilic biomass granulation 2 material and methods 2 1 experimental set up four sequencing batch lab scale reactors two with aerobic granular sludge ags and two with flocculent activated sludge fas were monitored in this study the ags reactors named ags r1 and ags r2 4 l of volume and the fas reactors named fas r1 and fas r2 8 l of volume were subjected to drastic r1 ones and moderate r2 ones salinity increases both in the long term run i and in the short term run ii both ags and fas were operated with a cycle length equal to 12 h the ags reactor cycle was featured as follows 60 min of feeding from the bottom of the reactors 700 min of aeration 5 min of settling and 5 min of effluent withdrawal the fas cycle instead included 30 min of influent feeding aerated 10 h of aeration 60 of anoxic mixing followed by 5 min of aeration to favour nitrogen stripping and lastly 20 min of settling and 5 min of effluent discharge a programmable logic controller plc automatically handled the cycling operations in all the reactors the volumetric exchange ratio was equal to 50 for each cycle so the feeding daily flow was equal to 4 l and 8 l for the ags and the fas reactor respectively the hydraulic retention time hrt was therefore equal to 24 h for each reactor sludge retention time srt was maintained close to 23 days by daily purging a known amount of sludge from the reactors the srt was calculated by the following eq 1 1 s r t v m l t s s q w m l t s s q d t s s e f f l u e n t where v is the volume of the reactor mltss is the total suspended solids concentration in the mixed liquor qw and qd are the volumes of sludge wasted and of wastewater treated on a daily basis respectively and tss effluent is the tss concentration in the effluent based on the tss concentration in the effluent and the mltss concentration the qw was controlled to maintain the srt approximately 23 days the main process parameters including the organic loading rate olr the total mltss and volatile mlvss suspended solids concentration in the mixed liquor and the food to microorganism ratio are summarized in table 1 2 2 wastewater the fish canning wastewater was collected from a local industry producing canned anchovies the wastewater was characterized by high organic matter content bod5 20 000 mg l 1 and nitrogen tn 3000 mg l 1 high total suspended solids concentrations 4500 mg l 1 and high sodium chloride concentration 150 gnacl l 1 the raw wastewater was diluted with tap water as far as salinity was equal to 30 gnacl l 1 baseline value hereafter a known amount of sodium chloride was added to simulate the salinity increases without changing the organic and nitrogen loading rates 2 3 salinity experimental runs description autochthonous halophilic biomass previously cultivated from the same fish canning wastewater at 30 gnacl l 1 was seeded in all the reactors subsequently the flocculent activated sludge developed in forms of aerobic granules in the ags reactors as previously said during the experimental campaign short and long term salinity increases were simulated particularly the experiment was divided into two periods during which moderate 5 gnacl l 1 and drastic 40 gnacl l 1 increases in salinity were simulated in the long term run i and in the short term run ii the detailed experimental runs description is reported in table 2 in detail during run i the influent salinity was maintained at 30 gnacl l 1 for 40 days thus it was sharply increased simulating a salinity shock particularly salinity was increased up to 70 gnacl l 1 in ags r1 and fas r1 and up to 35 in gnacl l 1 in ags r2 and fas r2 by adding a known amount of sodium chloride to the influent wastewater the salt concentration after the increase was maintained constant for a period close to three times the srt 70 days in order to evaluate the effect in the long term during run ii the influent salinity was sharply decreased to 30 gnacl l 1 simulating in such a way a reverse salinity shock in all the reactors then salinity was maintained constant until a new steady state condition in terms of nitrogen removal efficiency was reached after that salinity was increased again up to 70 gnacl l 1 in ags r1 and fas r1 and up to 35 in gnacl l 1 in ags r2 and fas r2 but in this case the shock had a duration equal to the hydraulic retention time of the reactors in order to simulate short term salinity shocks 2 4 analytical methods during both experimental runs biomass physical properties in term of extracellular polymeric substances eps content and composition as well as activated sludge flocs and granules size and morphology were periodically monitored eps extraction was carried out according to the heating method 17 the polysaccharides and the proteins were determined in accordance with the phenol sulfuric acid method 18 and with the folin method 19 respectively total eps content was evaluated as sum of the not bound fraction soluble microbial products and loosely bound eps and the tightly bound eps therefore the eps content was referred to the amount of volatile suspended solids vss all the chemicals physical analyses bod5 nh4 n no2 n were performed according to standard methods 20 the particle size distribution psd of the sludge was measured regularly by means of an optical granulometer sympatec qicpic the average size of the activated sludge flocs as well as granular sludge was calculated as the diameter corresponding to the 50 of the psd the uniformity coefficient uc was defined as the ratio of d60 by d10 where d60 and d10 mean the diameter of the particles for which 60 percent and 10 percent respectively of the particles are smaller besides nitritation and denitritation kinetics were evaluated by performing ammonium utilization rate aur and nitrite utilization rate nur tests these were evaluated as the slope of the linear regression line of ammonium depletion aur either nitrite production nur versus time in a batch reactor 20 0 2 c the slope was therefore referred to the volatile suspended solids concentration of the sample during run i three aur and nur tests were performed specifically the first before the salinity increase the second after once the hrt 1 days and the third after three times the srt 69 days after the shock similarly during run ii the aur and nur tests were performed before the shock the day after once the hrt and lastly when nitrogen removal efficiency was approximately close to that before the shock in both runs the instantaneous and the steady efficiency losses in term of nitritation and denitritation kinetics were calculated as the percentage decrease compared to the pre shock condition of their respective values immediately after the salinity shock and after steady state was reached 3 results and discussion 3 1 reactors performance the reactors performances in terms of bod5 nitrification and total nitrogen removal efficiency during the experiment are reported in table 3 before run i was performed all the reactors were able to remove approximately 98 of the influent bod5 similarly the ammonia removal efficiency was approximately equal to 98 nitrite was the only product of the ammonia oxidation process thereby suggesting the absence of the nitrite oxidizing bacteria the total nitrogen removal efficiency was approximately 96 in the fas whereas it was lower 70 in the ags likely due to incomplete denitritation during run i the bod5 removal efficiency did not decrease in the reactors subjected to the moderate salinity increase indeed the bod5 removal efficiency in the ags r2 and fas r2 was equal to that observed in the previous period at 30 gnacl l 1 of salinity thereby suggesting that moderate salinity increase did not affect the organic carbon removal performance in contrast the bod5 removal efficiency decreased in the reactor subjected to drastic salinity shock specifically the fas r1 suffered a greater decrease in performance than the ags r1 nevertheless stable performances were achieved 18 days after the shock in the ags r1 90 whereas after 27 days in the fas r1 82 the ammonia oxidation efficiency significantly decreased after the salinity shocks the loss in nitritation efficiency was higher in the fas reactors and was proportional to the salinity shock intensity at steady state nitritation efficiency was approximately of 52 44 96 and 74 in ags r1 fas r1 ags r2 and fas r2 respectively stable performances were achieved after 18 days and 39 days in ags r1 and fas r1 respectively whereas approximately 8 days were necessary to reach a new steady condition in the reactors subjected to the moderate shock similarly a higher percentage decrease in tn removal efficiency was observed in the fas reactors at new steady state tn removal was approximately of 32 30 81 and 73 in ags r1 fas r1 ags r2 and fas r2 respectively the percentage decrease of tn removal was approximately of 50 in the ags reactors whereas it was approximately 75 in the fas reactors after the salinity was decreased to 30 gnacl l 1 all the reactors exhibited the same nutrients removal performances observed before run i was started during run ii no decrease in bod5 removal efficiency was observed thereby indicating that heterotrophs are not sensitive to short term salinity shock 21 similarly to what observed after the long term shocks the nitritation and tn removal performances significantly decreased only in the reactors subjected to the drastic shock however in this case a rapid and almost total recovery of the pre shock condition was achieved in all the reactors 3 2 impact of long term salinity increases the aur tests helped to analyse the effect of the moderate and drastic salinity increases in the long term on nitritation activity according to the literature high salt concentration has an inhibitory effect on nitrite oxidizing bacteria nob consequently nitrite was the only product of ammonium oxidation process 11 in fig 1 the specific ammonium and nitrite utilization rates during run i are reported before the salinity was increased the specific aur at 30 gnacl l 1 was equal to 3 78 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and 4 49 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in both the ags and both the fas respectively fig 1a nitritation rates significantly decreased immediately after the drastic salinity shock indeed the ammonium oxidation capacity dramatically dropped to approximately 0 46 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 the decrease was even more significant in the fas r1 where the aur decreased to approximately 0 13 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 fig 1a at steady state nitritation activity slightly increased stabilizing at approximately 0 73 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and 0 24 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and fas r1 respectively similarly the specific denitritation rates drastically decreased after the salinity increase indeed denitritation activity decreased from 11 44 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to approximately 1 02 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 whereas in the fas r1 it decreased from 12 53 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to 0 87 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 at steady state the specific nur slightly increased in both reactors stabilizing at approximately 3 93 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and 2 09 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r1 in fig 1c the results of the moderate salinity increase are reported following the salinity increase ammonium oxidation capacity by nitrifiers in the ags r2 decreased by almost half standing at approximately 1 91 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 whereas it decreased to approximately 0 64 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r2 at steady state the specific aur in the ags r2 increased to approximately 3 31 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and to 3 36 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r2 the specific nur before the salinity increase was equal to 11 44 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 and 12 53 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and fas r2 respectively fig 1d after the salinity increase the specific nur decreased in both reactors in particular it decreased to approximately 7 02 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and to 4 31 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r2 at steady state denitritation activity was almost entirely recovered in both reactors the steady value of the specific nur was equal to 10 47 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 and 10 04 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and fas r2 respectively in fig 2 the instantaneous fig 2a and the steady efficiency losses fig 2b for nitritation and denitritation rates in run i are depicted as seen from fig 2a the instantaneous loss in nitritation activity following the drastic salinity increase was equal to approximately 89 and 96 in the ags r1 and the fas r1 respectively therefore although ammonium oxidation capacity collapsed in the ags r1 a complete loss in the activity of ammonium oxidizer bacteria was not observed in contrast the decrease in the aur in the fas r1 was close to 100 thereby revealing an almost complete loss of nitrifiers activity referring to the nur the instantaneous loss was comparable to that observed for the aur indeed the instantaneous losses were equal to 91 and 93 for the ags r1 and fas r1 respectively revealing a significant decrease in the heterotrophic bacteria metabolism as previously observed for autotrophic the instantaneous decrease in nitritation activity following the moderate salinity increase was approximately equal to 50 in the ags r2 whereas it was significantly higher in the fas r2 86 concerning the nur the instantaneous loss was slightly lower than that observed in nitritation activity particularly in the ags r2 the instantaneous loss was slightly lower than 10 whereas in the fas it was approximately equal to 20 the steady efficiency losses for nitritation and denitritation rates are depicted in fig 2b at steady state nitritation activity in the ags r1 decreased by approximately 80 because of the drastic salinity increase showing a partial recovery by approximately 10 than the instantaneous loss in contrast the fas r1 did not show any recover of the nitritation rate at steady state thereby indicating that the effect of the salinity shock on autotrophic biomass was irreversible in the flocculent sludge concerning denitritation kinetic the functionalities recovery of heterotrophic bacteria at steady state was higher than autotrophic the steady state loss in denitritation kinetic after the drastic shock was approximately equal to 63 in the ags r1 and to 81 in the fas r1 consequently the recover capability was higher in the ags 27 than the fas 10 following the moderate salinity increase both the nitritation and denitritation capacity in the ags r2 were almost completely recovered the loss in the aur and nur at steady state in the ags r2 was equal to 12 and 9 respectively thereby suggesting that neither the ammonium oxidation nor the nitrite reduction activities were significantly affected by the shock similar consideration referring to the fas r2 can be made however the efficiency losses at steady state was slightly higher compared with those in the ags in particular the losses were equal to 25 and 20 in the aur and nur respectively again it was confirmed that the steady state efficiency loss was lower referring the denitritation kinetic thereby indicating that heterotrophic bacteria were less sensitive to the salinity shocks compared with the autotrophic by comparing the results above it was found that the ags reactors subjected to both moderate and drastic salinity increases showed a lower instantaneous and steady state loss in nitritation and denitritation activity than the fas ones therefore results demonstrated that granular sludge was more suitable to withstand salinity increases than flocculent activated sludge however both the reactors showed significant efficiency losses especially in case of drastic salinity increase indeed following the drastic salinity increase the specific ammonium oxidation rate was quite modest in both the reactors it should be stressed that from the management point of view a decrease in bacterial metabolic activity would lead to an increase of the volume of the reactors and or the cycle length in order to ensure the best efficiency in terms of nutrient removal because aerobic granular sludge allows operating with higher biomass concentration than flocculent activated sludge and at the same time enables a higher biomass activity the increase in an ags reactor volume or cycle length would be lower in any cases than the flocculent fas activated sludge 3 3 impact of salinity decrease at the end of run i after that steady state conditions were reached salinity was sharply decreased to 30 gnacl l 1 both the nitritation and denitritation activity significantly increased in all the reactors particularly in the reactors that were previously subject to the drastic salinity increase ags r1 fas r1 the ammonium oxidation capacity increased from approximately 0 73 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 4 85 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags and from approximately 0 24 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 5 05 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas thereby showing in both the cases a remarkable resilience similarly the nitritation activity was completely recovered in ags r2 and fas r2 concerning the denitritation even in this case a significant increase in metabolic activity was observed the nitrite reduction capacity increased from approximately 3 93 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to 9 91 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and from approximately 2 09 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 to 11 59 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the fas r2 the obtained results indicated that a reverse osmotic shock did not occur moreover it could be stated that the ideal condition for the autochthonous bacteria in terms of salinity was 30 gnacl l 1 this salinity is closer to that of seawater that likely represent the natural environment for these bacteria that derive from fish entrails or in general from the marine environment 3 4 impact of short term salinity increases during the next two months corresponding approximately to three times the srt salt concentration was maintained at 30 gnacl l 1 in all the reactors hereafter short term salinity shocks were simulated run ii accordingly salinity was increased again up to 70 gnacl l 1 in ags r1 and fas r1 and up to 35 gnacl l 1 in ags r2 and fas r2 but in this case the shock had a duration equal to the hydraulic retention time of the reactors 24 h the results of the aur and nur tests in run ii are reported in fig 3 the nitritation activity was similar in the ags r1 and fas r1 before the drastic shock fig 3a in fact the ammonia utilization rate was approximately equal to 5 11 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in both the reactors during run ii the ammonium oxidation capacity decreased in both the reactors particularly the aur decreased to approximately 2 15 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and to 1 89 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and fas r1 respectively thereby indicating also in this case a greater resistance of the granular sludge to sharp salinity fluctuations total nitrogen in the effluent was daily monitored after the shock until a new steady condition in terms of removal was reached approximately 5 days were necessary for both the reactors to recover the nitritation activity therefore the time necessary to revert to steady state was close to 5 times the hrt for both the reactors at new steady state condition the aur increased to 4 97 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and 4 84 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r1 and fas r1 respectively thereby showing a complete recovery of the pre shock conditions similar considerations can be made concerning the denitritation activity fig 3b in this case denitrifiers showed a similar behavior compared to nitrifiers bacteria before the shock the nur was equal to 10 65 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 and 11 23 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags and fas respectively whereas it sharply decreased to 4 43 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 and 4 30 mgno2 n gvss 1 h 1 after the shock and then revert back to the pre shock conditions after five times the hrt the figs 3c and d show the results of the aur and nur tests in the reactors subjected to the moderate salinity shock after the salinity was increased a slightly decreased in the aur was observed in both the reactors indeed the aur decreased from approximately 4 85 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 4 35 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 and from approximately 5 05 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 to 4 17 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and fas r2 respectively in addition the nitritation capability was completely restored after the shock and the steady values were approximately equal to 5 15 mgnh4 n gvss 1 h 1 in the ags r2 and the fas r2 no significant changes in the denitritation kinetics were observed following the moderate salinity shock the fig 4 shows the instantaneous as well as the steady efficiency losses for the nitritation fig 4a and denitritation fig 4b activity in run ii based on the discussed results the sharp salinity increase caused an instantaneous decrease close to 60 in the aur and the nur in both the ags and the fas by comparing the nitritation and denitritation kinetics following the long term and the short term moderate shocks it was observed that following to the latter the instantaneous efficiency loss was smaller therefore it can be state that the instantaneous efficiency loss depends on the shock duration meaning that the longer is the salinity shock duration the bigger is the instantaneous efficiency loss in metabolic kinetics conversely the moderate salinity shock did not cause significant changes in both the aur and nur except for the fas even if the efficiency loss was lower than 20 after 5 times the hrt all the reactors completely reverted to the pre shock conditions therefore after the shock the steady state efficiency loss was close to zero in all the four reactors in conclusion both the granular and the flocculent sludge reactors were able to withstand moderate salinity shock in the short term 3 5 influence on extracellular polymeric substances the effects of the salinity shocks on the sludge physical characteristics were evaluated in terms of eps structure and composition as well as in terms of sizes of the activated sludge flocs and granules several studies demonstrated the enhancement of the eps production by bacteria under high salinity stress 22 23 the eps matrix sets a barrier for mass transfer and lower the concentration of toxic compounds in the inner cells indeed when saline concentration is changing in the bulk the eps can reduce the destruction of microorganisms due to maintaining cellular osmotic pressure balance 24 it has been demonstrated that with increasing in sodium chloride concentrations an increase of the soluble and loosely bound eps as well as a corresponding decrease in the bound fraction of eps occurred the increase in the soluble eps fraction is mainly associated to plasmolysis and release of intracellular constituents 25 whereas the decrease in the bound fraction is due to the structural weakening of the eps matrix 26 27 fig 5 depicts the specific tightly bound and loosely bound eps concentration at steady state before run i and run ii were started fig 5a and after reaching of steady state following to salinity shocks in each experimental run fig 5b in all the four reactors following both short term and long term shocks regardless of the shock load the changes in total eps content was lower than 10 therefore it was considered negligible the main constituent of eps were proteins before each salinity shock the ratio between proteins pn and polysaccharides ps ranged approximately between 9 and 12 after each shock the amount of proteins significantly increased and pn ps ratio rose up almost to 15 and 19 as a response to the short term and long term drastic shock respectively in contrast following the moderate salinity increase any changes in the eps composition occurred however it is worth to note that the pn ps ratio significantly changed after each salinity increase in the loosely bound fraction of the eps whereas in the tightly bound eps it was comparable with the previous values after the drastic shocks significant changes occurred in the eps structure indeed by comparing the eps structure before and after the shocks an increase of the loosely bound eps and a decrease of the bound fraction was observed these results confirmed what was previously reported in the literature 28 29 the increase in salinity caused a modification of the eps matrix causing destabilization of their structure the increase in the loosely bound eps occurred because of drastic salinity shocks in both the short and long term while no significant changes occurred as a response to moderate shocks indeed the loosely bound eps content raised from 6 same value for ags and fas before the shock to 45 in the ags and 55 in the fas after the long term shock whereas following the short term shock it increased from 5 to 8 in the ags and to 15 in the fas therefore the increase in the loosely bound eps was proportional to both the shock duration and extent 3 6 influence on granular and flocculent sludge morphology the size of both granular and flocculent sludge was monitored in each experimental run granulometric analysis was performed to provide the psd of each sample in all the analyzed conditions fig 6 depicts the particle size distribution of granular and activated flocculent sludge in run i before the shock a and after three time the srt in run i a decrease in the average size of both the granules and the activated sludge flocs was observed fig 6b because the drastic salinity increase the average size of the activated sludge flocs in fas r1 decreased from 340 μm to 135 μm while it slightly decreased from 1720 μm to 1560 μm in ags r1 accordingly the uniformity coefficient changed thereby indicating the modification of the sludge structure the uc slightly increased from 2 7 to 2 8 in fas r1 whereas it significantly increased from approximately 4 2 10 3 in ags r1 the increase in the uc in the ags reactor indicated that degranulation occurred and both flocculent sludge deriving from the granules breakage and not broken granules coexisted within the reactor nevertheless it is worth to mention that the percentage of granules within the reactor measured as the percentage of particles with a size exceeding 600 μm was approximately equal to 70 thereby indicating that the granules were predominant in the ags reactor a decrease of the average particle size and an increase in the uc were observed also after the moderate shock fig 6b the average size of the activated sludge flocs in fas r2 decreased from 340 μm to 162 μm whereas it slightly decreased from 1720 μm to 1650 μm in the ags r2 the uc was almost constant in the fas 2 8 whereas it slightly increased from approximately 4 2 5 2 in the ags the percentage of granules decreased accordingly from 80 to 70 in contrast neither deflocculation nor granules breakage was observed in run ii thereby indicating that deterioration in the sludge structure occurred only in the long term 3 7 comparison between salt acclimated and autochthonous halophilic biomass several studies dealing the effects of salinity shocks on nitrifiers bacteria in activated sludge have been carried out in the past 30 31 generally these studies report that nitrifiers biological activity decrease with the increase in salinity particularly chen and co authors 32 evaluated the performance of an fas with activated sludge at salinity ranging from 0 to 20 gnacl l 1 demonstrating that salinity deteriorated the removal performance especially those related to nitrogen removal wang et al 33 demonstrated that the increase of influent salinity from 0 to 8 caused the decrease of specific ammonium oxidation rate by over 75 campo et al 34 observed a strong inhibition of the autotrophic bacteria in a granular sludge reactor after the salinity was increased from 10 gnacl l 1 to 20 gnacl l 1 but nitrification activity slightly reprised from 5 up to 25 thereby indicating a gradual adaptation of nitrifying microorganisms to the high salinity environment other authors observed that by stepwise increasing the salinity 5 gnacl l 1 nitrifiers bacteria started to adapt to the new saline environment and stabilized their activity under the new conditions but never reaching the initial activity level 35 however it was demonstrated that at 40 gnacl l 1 nitrification was completely inhibited and any adaptation of the sludge to the saline environment was observed yogalakshmi and joseph 25 found that the increase of salinity from 5 gnacl l 1 to 30 gnacl l 1 produced an average decrease of the ammonium removal efficiency close to 74 whereas the following increment in salinity up to 50 gnacl l 1 produced a further drop to 13 right after the shock and hereafter the complete inhibition of nitrification similarly other authors observed that not acclimated activated sludge suffered high strength salinity impacts which caused the decrease of the biomass biological activity 36 the reason of these results is generally related to two factors first the decrease of the oxygen transfer from air to bulk and second to plasmolysis because of the increasing osmotic pressure 37 what is common among these studies is that over a certain salinity level whether salt concentration was rapidly or stepwise increased nitrifiers activity significantly decreases or collapses it is worth to mention that the salinity tested in the present study was higher than that in the above reported even though in the majority of the studies related to saline wastewater nitrification collapsed at a salt concentration of 30 gnacl l 1 this did not happen in the present study after the short term salinity shocks both moderate and drastic an almost complete recovery of pre shock conditions was observed the obtained results were likely due to the use of autochthonous halophilic biomass as inoculum 14 this biomass because it was cultivated from the same wastewater was naturally acclimated to saline environment as well as to the same wastewater that represent its native habitat nevertheless it is worth saying that a significant decrease of nitrifiers activity was noted only in response to the drastic shock in the long term even if a full metabolic activity loss of autotrophic bacteria was not observed in contrast with the literature our findings demonstrated that the autochthonous autotrophic bacteria showed anyway a minimum biological activity even at 70 gnacl l 1 of salinity it is worth to mention that at this salinity beside the high osmotic pressure the decrease in oxygen transfer efficiency could significantly affect the nitrifiers activity under similar salinity wang et al 4 by using salt acclimated biomass observed that the average nh4 n removal efficiency under steady states dramatically decreased from 88 to 21 as the salinity increased from 3 to 8 thereby indicating the loss in nitrifiers activity similar results were observed by corsino and co authors 38 these results indicate that over a certain salinity satisfactorily performance in ammonia oxidation cannot be achieved neither with salt adapted nor with halophilic biomass nevertheless this study demonstrated that autochthonous biomass is more suitable than the salt adapted biomass to perform high nutrient removal in highly saline environment concerning the physical properties of the sludges in contrast to the literature no significant increase in the eps content of both the granular and the flocculent biomass was observed in this study regardless of the shock load the changes in the total eps content was considered negligible for instance wang and co authors 4 observed a linear correlation between salinity and eps similarly in another study the authors found that the eps production was enhanced at each stepwise salinity increase 32 34 these results obtained in this study could be related to the nature of the autochthonous halophilic microorganisms indeed halophilic bacteria are able to counteract the external osmotic pressure because of the high concentration of ions within their cytoplasm the autochthonous microorganisms because came from saline environments are likely naturally adapted to high salt concentrations the accumulation of ions within the cytoplasm allows balancing the osmotic pressure without producing any excess of eps on the other hand the pattern and the composition of the eps changed even only after the drastic shocks the increase of the loosely bound eps was previously observed in the literature 39 under strong saline conditions the replacement of ca2 in the eps matrix by the abundantly available na could significantly contributes to deterioration of the granule structure as previously reported in another study 26 the increase in loosely bound eps was observed at salinity higher than 50 gnacl l 1 the results above confirmed that the denaturation of the eps matrix occurred over a certain salinity and it is due to a physical rather than a biological occurrence concerning the eps composition the results obtained in this study confirmed what reported in the literature specifically the higher was the salt concentration in the influent the higher was the protein content of the eps 33 29 3 8 comparison between halophilic flocculent and granular sludge biomass the results up to now discussed points out that the use of autochthonous halophilic biomass could help to withstand salinity fluctuations based on researches dealing with the treatment of industrial saline wastewater it was stressed the advantage to operate with aerobic granular sludge instead of conventional activated sludge 40 for insance wang and coauthors 33 compared a salt acclimated granular sludge with a flocculent sludge subjected to stepwise increase in salinity biogranules exhibited better performance for all the salinity tested compared with the activated sludge the authors findings suggested that more favorable conditions for the growth and reproduction of bacteria were found in the biofilm based on the results above the granular and the flocculent activated sludge showed a similar response to the short term salinity shocks indeed the efficiency loss in flocculent sludge reactors was comparable with that in granular sludge ones only in case of short term shocks both drastic and moderate in contrast following the long term shocks the ags reactors showed a lower instantaneous as well as steady state loss in nitritation and denitritation activity respect to the fas these results confirmed what was previously observed by wang et al 33 it is likely that because autotrophic bacteria grow in the inner layers of aerobic granules they were less exposed to the saline environment than those in the activated flocculent sludge 41 because of the smaller and less compact structure of the activated sludge than the granular autotrophic bacteria in the flocs are more susceptible to the osmotic pressure changes 32 instead the structure of the granule acted as a buffer layer resulting in a better protection towards bacteria against the changes occurred in the external environment currently this could be the best explanation for the obtained results concerning the physical properties of the biomass detrimental of the eps matrix in granular sludge was lower than the flocculent sludge under the same conditions indicating that aerobic granules are more suited in withstanding salinity fluctuations the results suggested that granular sludge reactors are more suitable in case of seasonal salinity fluctuations that are characterized by massive and long term salinity variations whereas flocculent fas could be implemented in case that the plant is equipped with an equalizer to dump salinity fluctuations halophilic bacteria bio aggregation could be a further advantage allowing operating at higher salinity or with faster kinetics compared with halophilic activated sludge 4 conclusions the effects of moderate and drastic salinity shocks on autochthonous halophilic granular and flocculent activated sludge were studied in the short and long term based on the obtained results it is possible to point out that drastic salinity shock affected the carbon removal efficiencies only in the long term however at steady state a higher removal efficiency and a faster recovery was observed in the ags 90 after 18 days than fas 82 after 27 days autotrophic bacteria suffered severe loss in biological activity only in response to the lt drastic shock in both ags 80 and fas 97 reactors whereas stable nitritation rates were completely restored 5 days after the st shocks biomass kinetics were reverted after the moderate shock whilst drastic shock caused a severe loss in metabolic activity of both nitrifiers and denitrifiers microorganisms and it was proportional to the shock intensity the increase in salinity caused a modification of the eps matrix causing destabilization of their structure that resulted in an increase in the loosely bound eps fraction the drastic salinity increase resulted in a decrease of the average size of the activated sludge flocs in fas from 340 μm to 135 μm and in a degranulation in the agss the granular and the flocculent activated sludge showed a similar response to the short term salinity shocks in contrast a significant loss in nitritation and denitritation activity occurred in the fas in response to the long term shock this study clearly demonstrates the robustness of autochthonous halophilic biomass to withstand salinity shock loads the results suggested that granular sludge is more suited than flocculent activated sludge to withstand seasonal as well as weekly salinity fluctuations

treatment system for dye decolorization and repeated use of decolorized dye bath in dyeing was successful keywords decolorization acid dye spent dye baths repeated dyeing response surface methodology 1 introduction water is one of the most important resources of mother nature which is essentially required to cater the agricultural industrial and domestic needs all activities require good quality water and its scarcity is on the rise day by day as large volumes are consumed and discarded along with a variety of pollutants 1 it is essential to reuse water as far as possible in order to conserve it chemical processing of textile materials is carried out in aqueous medium and the discharge of unused unfixed chemicals and colorants along with large volumes of left over baths and wash liquors causes high levels of pollution among various pollutants of the textile processing industry the dye containing colored wastewater is most notorious from the point of view of its treatment as well as reusability azo dyes are most commonly used for textile colorationand comprise 60 70 of all synthetic dyestuffs 2 water soluble acid dyes are widely used for dyeing of polyamide fibers such as natural fibers wool and silk and synthetic fiber nylon 3 the unused dye concentration present in the textile effluent has been estimated to be around 10 200 mg l 4 with increasingly stringent norms about environmental protection there is an urgent necessity to minimize the use of natural resources without affecting the needs of the consumer lots of efforts have been taken so far by the processing industry to minimize the use of water in dyeing operations now the focus lies on the reuse of spent dye bath to further reduce the consumption of fresh water and save on the cost of operation as well as wastewater treatment processes like photo fenton 5 ozonation 6 photocatalysis 7 coupled nanofiltration membranes and electrochemical processes 8 gamma radiations 9 microbial decolorization 10 combined chitosan adsorption and uv fenton advanced oxidation process caaop 11 etc have been employed for dye containing wastewater treatment for reuse however each of these methods has specific pros and cons advanced oxidation processes are gaining importance for their non polluting characteristics and cost effectiveness 12 although reducing agents are mostly sulfur based and hence unacceptable the azo chromophore based dyes are known to undergo reductive degradation easily as compared to other types of chromophores nanocatalysis has emerged as a substitute for conventional water treatments high surface area to volume ratio and size dependent reactivity have made metal nanoparticles suitable candidate for catalysis 13 among the metal nanoparticles silver nanoparticles agnp are extensively used in various catalytic applications in degradation of dyes they act as a redox catalyst by electron relay effect between donor and acceptor molecules 14 agnp synthesized using aqueous extract of waste tea have been reported to exhibit catalytic activity in decolorization of cationic organic dye solutions with hydrogen peroxide 15 agnp synthesized using trigonella foenum graecum seeds 16 and terminalia cuneata 17 have been used as catalyst for decolorization of cationic and direct dye solutions along with nabh4 silver sulfur oxido vanadium cluster agvt catalyst was used as an effective catalyst for quick reduction of methylene blue methyl orange and hexavalent cr vi to cr iii 18 recent researches have focused on employing ag ag halides nps as photocatalysts through modification in their band gap studies showed that enhanced photocatalytic activity was obtained by either supporting or doping ag agcl nps in various metal oxides such as zno wo3 or tio2 19 21 etc agcl vox and ag agcl vox nps were formed by encapsulating agcl and ag agcl nps into amorphous vanadium oxides vox these nanocomposites were successfully used in photooxidation of methylene blue and methyl orange under direct sunlight 22 the present study focuses on the reuse of decolorized dye bath for similar dyeing repeatedly up to five times for this the exhausted dye bath after dyeing of different polyamide fabrics with azo chromophore based acid dye acid red 249 was decolorized using a non sulfur reducing agent sodium borohydride catalyzed by agnp the agnp were synthesized by environment friendly technique of plant mediation using fresh curry leaves the parameters of reaction were optimized using response surface methodology to our knowledge no study has been reported on reuse of decolorization of spent dye bath containing azo dye with sodium borohydride catalyzed with agnp for dyeing 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercially available sample of c i acid red

nanoparticles silver nanoparticles agnp were synthesized using the method reported by philip et al 23 with slight modification briefly 9 g of fresh green curry leaves murraya koenigii were thoroughly washed with distilled water chopped added to 200 ml of distilled water and stirred at room temperature 32 c for 1 min a pale yellow extract was obtained by filtering the mixture with whatman filter paper 1 uk 11 μm and stored in a refrigerator for further use for plant mediated synthesis of agnp the filtered extract was added drop wise to 1 mm aqueous solution of silver nitrate in the ratio of 1 1 after complete addition of the extract the mixture was stirred further for 10 min at room temperature the reaction solution turned brown from pale yellow in 30 min indicating the formation of agnp 2

specific time intervals and the absorbance was measured after the completion of decolorization process individual dye baths were reconstituted using decolorized solutions alone by the addition of requisite amounts of dye for 1 5 2 and 5 shades and reused for dyeing of nylon silk and wool fabrics respectively the procedure of decolorization reconstitution dyeing was repeated for five times 2 6 experimental design and process optimization box behnken statistical design a widely used form of rsm was employed for the decolorization runs and optimization of experimental variables with the help of design expert 6 0 statistical software stat ease usa three independent variables namely dosage of agnp a concentration of nabh4 b and time for decolorization c were selected and studied at lower 1 intermediate 0 and upper 1 levels factors along with their coded values are presented in esm table s1 in all seventeen experimental runs were carried out to obtain a quadratic model consisting of 12 trials and 5 centre points for the estimation of pure sum of squares the response for the combination of independent variables was evaluated in terms of decolorization dependent variable the

and b ij is the coefficient that determines the effect of interaction between the variables i and j x i and x j are the independent factors analysis of variance anova was employed to evaluate the statistical significance of the model the quality and model terms were evaluated using f test and probability values p three dimensional plots were constructed to study the interactive effect of variables on response 2 7 color measurement the color strength values of all the dyed fabric samples were obtained by measuring the reflectance r of the incident light on datacolorspectraflash sf 300 datacolor switzerland spectrophotometer using illuminant d65 and standard observer 10 the k s values were calculated using kubelka munk equation as follows 2 k s 1 r 2 2 r where k and s are the absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient of the substrate respectively r is the reflectance of the dyed fabric measured at λmax of the dye to assess the effect of reuse of decolorized spent dye bath on color reproduction and degree of uniformity of shade after dyeing cielab 1976 color system was used it uses l a b which are three dimensionless colorimetric parameters where l is the lightness or darkness of the sample a ve value indicates red and ve value indicates green tone b ve value indicates yellow while ve value indicates blue tone color difference was calculated using the

compared with control sample fabric dyed with freshwater to evaluate the color reproducibility 2 8 dye exhaustion after dyeing each fabric sample the amount of dye remaining in the bath was estimated first in terms of the absorbance a of the dye solution at its λmax 552 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer from the calibration curve plotted not shown of a vs amount of dye m the amount of dye

adjacent fabric samples in each case 2 11 phytotoxicity study in order to assess the toxicity of the treated and untreated dye phytotoxicity analysis was carried out for two commercially important crops of indian agriculture i e triticum aestivum monocot and phaseolus mungo dicot at room temperature ten healthy seeds of each crop were separately sowed into pots containing sand these seeds were regularly supplied with 5 ml of distilled water as a control for 8 days the dye and degraded dye metabolites solutions were also used in same amounts 27 after 8 days of growth germination percentage g as well as the length of plumule shoot and radicle root were measured g was calculated according to the following formula 5 g t o t a l n u m b e r o f s e e d s g e r m i n a t e d t o t a l n u m b e r o f s e e d s s o w e d 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv vis spectra as mentioned earlier the reaction solution turned brown from pale yellow in 30 min this color change is caused by surface plasmon resonance spr which is due to the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons produced by an interactive magnetic field 28 the uv vis spectra of synthesized colloidwas recorded to confirm the formation of agnp the spr band appears at 426 nm indicating the formation of agnp fig 2 3 2 xrd and hr tem analysis the xrd pattern of agnp is shown in fig 3 the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 38 88 44 3 64 5 and 77 2 can be assigned to diffraction from the planes 111 200 220 and 311 for silver respectively jcpds no 04 0784 the average crystal size d of agnp was estimated to bearound 23 nm using scherrer equation as given below 6 d 0 9 λ β cos θ where 0 9 is the shape factor λ is the x ray wavelength β is the fwhm in radians and θ is the bragg angle in degrees the xrd pattern also shows additional peaks indicated by star which may be a result of formed metalloproteins crystalline bio organic compounds present in the extract of m koeniigi 29 the morphology size and size distribution of agnp are shown in fig 4 the images show almost spherical shaped nanoparticles with an average size of 20 nm fig 4 a shows a layer of phytoconstituents of the plant extract around the nanoparticles the bright circular fringes in selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig 4 c shows the crystalline nature of agnp literature reports the presence of active pharmacological ingredients like carbazole alkaloids flavonoids and polyphenols in the aqueous extract of murraya koenigii 30 these biomolecules are responsible for reduction of metal ions and acts as capping agents which leads to the efficient stabilization of nanoparticles however the exact mechanism has not been reported so far 3 3 optimization of parameters using rsm and its validation the observed and predicted experimental values on decolorization obtained through the reductive treatment of spent dye baths of nylon silk and wool dyeing are presented in esm table s2 anova results for decolorization obtained from statistical analysis by fisher s f test are given in esm table s3 results indicate higher f values and lower p values greater f value indicates that by using regression equation thevariation in response can be explained associated probability p is used to estimate whether f is large enough to indicate statistical significance the model is said to be statistically significant if value of p f is less than 0 05 31 in this study the f values for nylon silk and wool are 946 11 69 56 and 521 25 respectively implying that the model terms have considerable effect on the response the p f values for all the three fabric dyeing are lower than 0 05 indicating that the model is statistically significant at 95 confidence level interaction between independent variables was fitted to experimental data and regression equations in quadratic models were obtained esm table s4 coefficient of determination r2 describes the overall performance of the model the values of adjusted r2 were close to r2 indicating better and higher correlation between the observed and predicted values of response adequate precision ap measures the signal to noise ratio a ratio greater than 4 is desirable to support the fitness of the model for the present study ap was found to be 59 80 27 35 and 70 48 for nylon silk and wool spent dye baths respectively which indicates adequate signal to support the fitness of the model normal probability plots of the studentized residuals are shown in fig 5 since the data points on the plot lie close to a straight line the assumption of normality is satisfied indicating that the prediction by the model is accurate 3 4 effect of variables on response three dimensional plots were constructed in order to explain the impact of variables agnp dosage np nabh4 conc ra and time and the interactive effects among them the plots were generated to assess the effect of two variables at a time keeping the third variable at fixed interval figs 6 8 show the response surface for decolorization of nylon silk and wool spent dye baths respectively it can be seen from figs figure 6 a figure 7 a and figure 8 a that the decolorization increases with increase in agnp dosage along with increasing concentration of nabh4 this can be explained as follows in the spent dye bath molecules of the unexhausted azo chromophore based dye and the reducing agent nabh4 get adsorbed on the surface of agnp nabh4 being a strong nucleophile its reduction potential decreases on adsorption on agnp whereas the opposite happens in the case of the dye molecule being an electrophile in the reaction mixture when both the species are adsorbed on the nanoparticles electron transfer takes place between nabh4 donor and dye molecule acceptor resulting in rapid destruction of the dye chromophore as illustrated in figs figure 6 b figure 7 b and figure 8 b the increase in agnp dosage along with increase in time the decolorization increases similar trend is observed in figs figure 6 c figure 7 c and figure 8 c wherein the decolorization increases with increase in nabh4 concentration along with increase in time this is because more time is available for the degradation of dye molecule thus these three independent variables showed positive effect on dye decolorization among them concentration of reducing agent had maximum effect followed by agnp dosage and then the time 3 5 numerical optimization of multiple responses the objective of this study is to attain maximum decolorization using minimum concentration of nabh4 and dosage of agnp the optimum conditions derived from this study are summarized in esm table s5 however in each of the three cases solution no 2 was chosen for the further study since the aim of the study was to obtain maximum effective decolorization of spent dye baths such that the decolorized baths can be subjected to redyeing process as a substitute for fresh water further it was also essential to use lower concentrations of nabh4 and agnp in order to minimize the presence of additional chemical pollutantsin spent dye bath simultaneously making the process cost effective to confirm the results of model studies experiments were performed on the basis of optimized parameters it can be observed from table 1 that the response for experimental and predicted values obtained by solution no 2 is similar hence it can be deduced that the empirical model equations developed for the reductive decolorization process are appropriate this verifies the suitability and significance of the response surface box behnken model for optimization of this process 3 6 properties of dyed samples from decolorized dyebaths the color strength color difference and dye exhaustion values for the various fabric samples dyed using repeated dyeing and its control are shown in table 2 the samples dyed with decolorized bath repeatedly showed nearly same k s values although slightly more than the control sample table 3 shows that for all types of fabric dyeing using decolorized spent dye baths the values of l a and b were nearly same indicating that there is no tonal variation in dyeing irrespective of whether fresh water was used for making the dye bath or the decolorized one the same is reflected in δe values which are less than the commercially acceptable higher limit of 1 0 up to four repeated cycles also all the dyed samplesshowed same performance properties with no change in wash fastness 2 3 and light fastness 4 it is worth mentioning here that agnp alone at any dosage was found ineffective in decolorization even after 2 days hence its presence in the dyebath made up using decolorized spent dye bath did not reduce the depth of dyeing during repeated dyeing cycles however nabh4 alone was capable of dye decolorization although at a very slow rate thus 0 3 m nabh4 decolorized 50 ml of 6 6 10 5 m dye solution only to 60 after 2 h 3 7 cod removal the extent of cod removal signifies the efficiency of a treatment to mineralize a pollutant cod removal values were found to be 68 9 63 6 and 52 0 after the spent dye baths of nylon silk and wool dyeing was decolorized thus the pollution load caused by the presence of dye in the wastewater decreases after the treatment apart from this advantage of the treatment further benefits are accrued by reuse of the treated spent dye baths in repeated dyeing to save water 3 8 toxicity studies toxicity of the ar 249 dye and its degraded metabolites was confirmed by inhibition in germination for triticum aestivum monocot and phaseolus mungo dicot as against distilled water both shoot and root lengths were adversely affected by dye solutions table 4 however treated set showed good results comparable to distilled water thus indicating extensive reduction in toxicity by the treatment with agnp and nabh4 thus it can be concluded that the decolorized solutions are considerably safe for irrigation purpose 4 conclusions silver nanoparticles were found to effectively catalyze the reduction of an acid dye ar 249 with nabh4 to attain rapid decolorization results using rsm optimized process parameters demonstrate that maximum decolorizationof the dye ar 249 in the concentration range of 6 6 10 5 m 21 4 10 5 m can be achieved at 0 3 m of nabh4 1 6 ml of agnp in 26 min the decolorized solutions were effectively utilized for

14599,decolorization of spent dye baths after dyeing of nylon silk and wool fabrics with c i acid red 249 was attempted followed by their reuse in repeated dyeing the system comprised of a non sulfur reducing agent sodium borohydride along with silver nanoparticles synthesized by plant mediation technique using fresh curry leaves murraya koenigii response surface methodology was used to optimize the conditions of decolorization for reproducibility of results box behnken design matrix with three variables namely dosage of nanoparticles concentration of reducing agent and time of treatment was

evaluate the quality and model terms three dimensional response surface plots were used to study the interactive effect of operating variables on the response decolorized spent dye bath solutions were reused up to five times to dye fresh samples of nylon silk and wool with the same dye negligible difference was observed in color depth and the fastness properties were identical for all the dyed samples even with respect to that dyed using dye liquor made from fresh water phytotoxicity studies revealed considerable reduction in toxicity of acid red 249 dye due to degradation thus the treatment system for dye decolorization and repeated use of decolorized dye bath in dyeing was successful keywords decolorization acid dye spent dye baths repeated dyeing response surface methodology 1 introduction water is one of the most important resources of mother nature which is essentially required to cater the agricultural industrial and domestic needs all activities require good quality water and its scarcity is on the rise day by day as large volumes are consumed and discarded along with a variety of pollutants 1 it is essential to reuse water as far as possible in order to conserve it chemical processing of textile materials is carried out in aqueous medium and the discharge of unused unfixed chemicals and colorants along with large volumes of left over baths and wash liquors causes high levels of pollution among various pollutants of the textile processing industry the dye containing colored wastewater is most notorious from the point of view of its treatment as well as reusability azo dyes are most commonly used for textile colorationand comprise 60 70 of all synthetic dyestuffs 2 water soluble acid dyes are widely used for dyeing of polyamide fibers such as natural fibers wool and silk and synthetic fiber nylon 3 the unused dye concentration present in the textile effluent has been estimated to be around 10 200 mg l 4 with increasingly stringent norms about environmental protection there is an urgent necessity to minimize the use of natural resources without affecting the needs of the consumer lots of efforts have been taken so far by the processing industry to minimize the use of water in dyeing operations now the focus lies on the reuse of spent dye bath to further reduce the consumption of fresh water and save on the cost of operation as well as wastewater treatment processes like photo fenton 5 ozonation 6 photocatalysis 7 coupled nanofiltration membranes and electrochemical processes 8 gamma radiations 9 microbial decolorization 10 combined chitosan adsorption and uv fenton advanced oxidation process caaop 11 etc have been employed for dye containing wastewater treatment for reuse however each of these methods has specific pros and cons advanced oxidation processes are gaining importance for their non polluting characteristics and cost effectiveness 12 although reducing agents are mostly sulfur based and hence unacceptable the azo chromophore based dyes are known to undergo reductive degradation easily as compared to other types of chromophores nanocatalysis has emerged as a substitute for conventional water treatments high surface area to volume ratio and size dependent reactivity have made metal nanoparticles suitable candidate for catalysis 13 among the metal nanoparticles silver nanoparticles agnp are extensively used in various catalytic applications in degradation of dyes they act as a redox catalyst by electron relay effect between donor and acceptor molecules 14 agnp synthesized using aqueous extract of waste tea have been reported to exhibit catalytic activity in decolorization of cationic organic dye solutions with hydrogen peroxide 15 agnp synthesized using trigonella foenum graecum seeds 16 and terminalia cuneata 17 have been used as catalyst for decolorization of cationic and direct dye solutions along with nabh4 silver sulfur oxido vanadium cluster agvt catalyst was used as an effective catalyst for quick reduction of methylene blue methyl orange and hexavalent cr vi to cr iii 18 recent researches have focused on employing ag ag halides nps as photocatalysts through modification in their band gap studies showed that enhanced photocatalytic activity was obtained by either supporting or doping ag agcl nps in various metal oxides such as zno wo3 or tio2 19 21 etc agcl vox and ag agcl vox nps were formed by encapsulating agcl and ag agcl nps into amorphous vanadium oxides vox these nanocomposites were successfully used in photooxidation of methylene blue and methyl orange under direct sunlight 22 the present study focuses on the reuse of decolorized dye bath for similar dyeing repeatedly up to five times for this the exhausted dye bath after dyeing of different polyamide fabrics with azo chromophore based acid dye acid red 249 was decolorized using a non sulfur reducing agent sodium borohydride catalyzed by agnp the agnp were synthesized by environment friendly technique of plant mediation using fresh curry leaves the parameters of reaction were optimized using response surface methodology to our knowledge no study has been reported on reuse of decolorization of spent dye bath containing azo dye with sodium borohydride catalyzed with agnp for dyeing 2 materials and methods 2 1 materials commercially available sample of c i acid red

nanoparticles silver nanoparticles agnp were synthesized using the method reported by philip et al 23 with slight modification briefly 9 g of fresh green curry leaves murraya koenigii were thoroughly washed with distilled water chopped added to 200 ml of distilled water and stirred at room temperature 32 c for 1 min a pale yellow extract was obtained by filtering the mixture with whatman filter paper 1 uk 11 μm and stored in a refrigerator for further use for plant mediated synthesis of agnp the filtered extract was added drop wise to 1 mm aqueous solution of silver nitrate in the ratio of 1 1 after complete addition of the extract the mixture was stirred further for 10 min at room temperature the reaction solution turned brown from pale yellow in 30 min indicating the formation of agnp 2 3 characterization of agnp uv visible spectral study was performed to ascertain the formation of agnp on shimadzu uv 1800 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan the surface plasmon resonance spr peak

dye baths 2 5 treatment of spent dye bath and its reuse the absorbance values of all the spent dye baths were estimated at λmax of the dye using shimadzu uv 1800 uv vis spectrophotometer shimadzu japan all the decolorization experiments were carried out in batches of 50 ml at room temperature with a constant stirring of 70 rpm prior to decolorization the ph values were determined and adjusted to 4 synthesized colloid of agnp was diluted with distilled water in the ratio of 1 10 various concentrations of the reducing agent nabh4 were prepared ranging from 0 05 to 0 5 m for the reaction 1 ml

specific time intervals and the absorbance was measured after the completion of decolorization process individual dye baths were reconstituted using decolorized solutions alone by the addition of requisite amounts of dye for 1 5 2 and 5 shades and reused for dyeing of nylon silk and wool fabrics respectively the procedure of decolorization reconstitution dyeing was repeated for five times 2 6 experimental design and process optimization box behnken statistical design a widely used form of rsm was employed for the decolorization runs and optimization of experimental variables with the help of design expert 6 0 statistical software stat ease usa three independent variables namely dosage of agnp a concentration of nabh4 b and time for decolorization c were selected and studied at lower 1 intermediate 0 and upper 1 levels factors along with their coded values are presented in esm table s1 in all seventeen experimental runs were carried out to obtain a quadratic model consisting of 12 trials and 5 centre points for the estimation of pure sum of squares the response for the combination of independent variables was evaluated in terms of decolorization dependent variable the experimental results were fitted to a polynomial equation of quadratic order as shown in eq 1 1 y b 0 b i x i b i i x i 2 b i j x i x j i j i j 1 2 3 where y is the response variable dependent

and b ij is the coefficient that determines the effect of interaction between the variables i and j x i and x j are the independent factors analysis of variance anova was employed to evaluate the statistical significance of the model the quality and model terms were evaluated using f test and probability values p three dimensional plots were constructed to study the interactive effect of variables on response 2 7 color measurement the color strength values of all the dyed fabric samples were obtained by measuring the reflectance r of the incident light on datacolorspectraflash sf 300 datacolor switzerland spectrophotometer using illuminant d65 and standard observer 10 the k s values were calculated using kubelka munk equation as follows 2 k s 1 r 2 2 r where k and s are the absorption coefficient and scattering coefficient of the substrate respectively r is the reflectance of the dyed fabric measured at λmax of the dye to assess the effect of reuse of decolorized spent dye bath on color reproduction and degree of uniformity of shade after dyeing cielab 1976 color system was used it uses l a b which are three dimensionless colorimetric parameters where l is the lightness or darkness of the sample a ve value indicates red and ve value indicates green tone b ve value indicates yellow while ve value indicates blue tone color difference was calculated using the equation given below 3 δ e δ l 2 δ a 2 δ b 2 where δe is the difference between control and samples dyed using decolorized spent dye baths δl δa δb are changes in l a and b respectively in the control and dyed samples crease free samples were folded twice so as to give a total of four layers the readings were taken at four different places and averaged fabrics dyed in recycled dye baths were compared with control sample fabric dyed with freshwater to evaluate the color reproducibility 2 8 dye exhaustion after dyeing each fabric sample the amount of dye remaining in the bath was estimated first in terms of the absorbance a of the dye solution at its λmax 552 nm using uv vis spectrophotometer from the calibration curve plotted not shown of a vs amount of dye m the amount of dye remaining in the bath was obtained all the dye solutions were diluted in the ratio of 1 10 so that the absorbance values could be recorded in the range of 0 1 1 2 9 estimation of cod of decolorized dye solutions decolorized dye solutions were analyzed to determine the extent of cod removal using closed reflux colorimetric method 24 samples were digested in a hach drb 200 digital reactor block and were measured on a hach dr 850 colorimeter hach usa the percentage cod removal was calculated using the following equation 4 c o d r e m o v a l c o d i c o d t c o d i 100 where codi and codt are the cod mg l of the dye solution before and after the treatment respectively 2 10 evaluation of fastness properties the color fastness of dyed samples was tested as per standard iso test methods fastness to washing and fastness to light were evaluated according to iso 105 c06 c2s and iso 105 b02 respectively 25 26 aatcc grey scale was used to assess the change in color and staining on the adjacent fabric samples in each case 2 11 phytotoxicity study in order to assess the toxicity of the treated and untreated dye phytotoxicity analysis was carried out for two commercially important crops of indian agriculture i e triticum aestivum monocot and phaseolus mungo dicot at room temperature ten healthy seeds of each crop were separately sowed into pots containing sand these seeds were regularly supplied with 5 ml of distilled water as a control for 8 days the dye and degraded dye metabolites solutions were also used in same amounts 27 after 8 days of growth germination percentage g as well as the length of plumule shoot and radicle root were measured g was calculated according to the following formula 5 g t o t a l n u m b e r o f s e e d s g e r m i n a t e d t o t a l n u m b e r o f s e e d s s o w e d 100 3 results and discussion 3 1 uv vis spectra as mentioned earlier the reaction solution turned brown from pale yellow in 30 min this color change is caused by surface plasmon resonance spr which is due to the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons produced by an interactive magnetic field 28 the uv vis spectra of synthesized colloidwas recorded to confirm the formation of agnp the spr band appears at 426 nm indicating the formation of agnp fig 2 3 2 xrd and hr tem analysis the xrd pattern of agnp is shown in fig 3 the diffraction peaks at 2θ values of 38 88 44 3 64 5 and 77 2 can be assigned to diffraction from the planes 111 200 220 and 311 for silver respectively jcpds no 04 0784 the average crystal size d of agnp was estimated to bearound 23 nm using scherrer equation as given below 6 d 0 9 λ β cos θ where 0 9 is the shape factor λ is the x ray wavelength β is the fwhm in radians and θ is the bragg angle in degrees the xrd pattern also shows additional peaks indicated by star which may be a result of formed metalloproteins crystalline bio organic compounds present in the extract of m koeniigi 29 the morphology size and size distribution of agnp are shown in fig 4 the images show almost spherical shaped nanoparticles with an average size of 20 nm fig 4 a shows a layer of phytoconstituents of the plant extract around the nanoparticles the bright circular fringes in selected area electron diffraction saed pattern fig 4 c shows the crystalline nature of agnp literature reports the presence of active pharmacological ingredients like carbazole alkaloids flavonoids and polyphenols in the aqueous extract of murraya koenigii 30 these biomolecules are responsible for reduction of metal ions and acts as capping agents which leads to the efficient stabilization of nanoparticles however the exact mechanism has not been reported so far 3 3 optimization of parameters using rsm and its validation the observed and predicted experimental values on decolorization obtained through the reductive treatment of spent dye baths of nylon silk and wool dyeing are presented in esm table s2 anova results for decolorization obtained from statistical analysis by fisher s f test are given in esm table s3 results indicate higher f values and lower p values greater f value indicates that by using regression equation thevariation in response can be explained associated probability p is used to estimate whether f is large enough to indicate statistical significance the model is said to be statistically significant if value of p f is less than 0 05 31 in this study the f values for nylon silk and wool are 946 11 69 56 and 521 25 respectively implying that the model terms have considerable effect on the response the p f values for all the three fabric dyeing are lower than 0 05 indicating that the model is statistically significant at 95 confidence level interaction between independent variables was fitted to experimental data and regression equations in quadratic models were obtained esm table s4 coefficient of determination r2 describes the overall performance of the model the values of adjusted r2 were close to r2 indicating better and higher correlation between the observed and predicted values of response adequate precision ap measures the signal to noise ratio a ratio greater than 4 is desirable to support the fitness of the model for the present study ap was found to be 59 80 27 35 and 70 48 for nylon silk and wool spent dye baths respectively which indicates adequate signal to support the fitness of the model normal probability plots of the studentized residuals are shown in fig 5 since the data points on the plot lie close to a straight line the assumption of normality is satisfied indicating that the prediction by the model is accurate 3 4 effect of variables on response three dimensional plots were constructed in order to explain the impact of variables agnp dosage np nabh4 conc ra and time and the interactive effects among them the plots were generated to assess the effect of two variables at a time keeping the third variable at fixed interval figs 6 8 show the response surface for decolorization of nylon silk and wool spent dye baths respectively it can be seen from figs figure 6 a figure 7 a and figure 8 a that the decolorization increases with increase in agnp dosage along with increasing concentration of nabh4 this can be explained as follows in the spent dye bath molecules of the unexhausted azo chromophore based dye and the reducing agent nabh4 get adsorbed on the surface of agnp nabh4 being a strong nucleophile its reduction potential decreases on adsorption on agnp whereas the opposite happens in the case of the dye molecule being an electrophile in the reaction mixture when both the species are adsorbed on the nanoparticles electron transfer takes place between nabh4 donor and dye molecule acceptor resulting in rapid destruction of the dye chromophore as illustrated in figs figure 6 b figure 7 b and figure 8 b the increase in agnp dosage along with increase in time the decolorization increases similar trend is observed in figs figure 6 c figure 7 c and figure 8 c wherein the decolorization increases with increase in nabh4 concentration along with increase in time this is because more time is available for the degradation of dye molecule thus these three independent variables showed positive effect on dye decolorization among them concentration of reducing agent had maximum effect followed by agnp dosage and then the time 3 5 numerical optimization of multiple responses the objective of this study is to attain maximum decolorization using minimum concentration of nabh4 and dosage of agnp the optimum conditions derived from this study are summarized in esm table s5 however in each of the three cases solution no 2 was chosen for the further study since the aim of the study was to obtain maximum effective decolorization of spent dye baths such that the decolorized baths can be subjected to redyeing process as a substitute for fresh water further it was also essential to use lower concentrations of nabh4 and agnp in order to minimize the presence of additional chemical pollutantsin spent dye bath simultaneously making the process cost effective to confirm the results of model studies experiments were performed on the basis of optimized parameters it can be observed from table 1 that the response for experimental and predicted values obtained by solution no 2 is similar hence it can be deduced that the empirical model equations developed for the reductive decolorization process are appropriate this verifies the suitability and significance of the response surface box behnken model for optimization of this process 3 6 properties of dyed samples from decolorized dyebaths the color strength color difference and dye exhaustion values for the various fabric samples dyed using repeated dyeing and its control are shown in table 2 the samples dyed with decolorized bath repeatedly showed nearly same k s values although slightly more than the control sample table 3 shows that for all types of fabric dyeing using decolorized spent dye baths the values of l a and b were nearly same indicating that there is no tonal variation in dyeing irrespective of whether fresh water was used for making the dye bath or the decolorized one the same is reflected in δe values which are less than the commercially acceptable higher limit of 1 0 up to four repeated cycles also all the dyed samplesshowed same performance properties with no change in wash fastness 2 3 and light fastness 4 it is worth mentioning here that agnp alone at any dosage was found ineffective in decolorization even after 2 days hence its presence in the dyebath made up using decolorized spent dye bath did not reduce the depth of dyeing during repeated dyeing cycles however nabh4 alone was capable of dye decolorization although at a very slow rate thus 0 3 m nabh4 decolorized 50 ml of 6 6 10 5 m dye solution only to 60 after 2 h 3 7 cod removal the extent of cod removal signifies the efficiency of a treatment to mineralize a pollutant cod removal values were found to be 68 9 63 6 and 52 0 after the spent dye baths of nylon silk and wool dyeing was decolorized thus the pollution load caused by the presence of dye in the wastewater decreases after the treatment apart from this advantage of the treatment further benefits are accrued by reuse of the treated spent dye baths in repeated dyeing to save water 3 8 toxicity studies toxicity of the ar 249 dye and its degraded metabolites was confirmed by inhibition in germination for triticum aestivum monocot and phaseolus mungo dicot as against distilled water both shoot and root lengths were adversely affected by dye solutions table 4 however treated set showed good results comparable to distilled water thus indicating extensive reduction in toxicity by the treatment with agnp and nabh4 thus it can be concluded that the decolorized solutions are considerably safe for irrigation purpose 4 conclusions silver nanoparticles were found to effectively catalyze the reduction of an acid dye ar 249 with nabh4 to attain rapid decolorization results using rsm optimized process parameters demonstrate that maximum decolorizationof the dye ar 249 in the concentration range of 6 6 10 5 m 21 4 10 5 m can be achieved at 0 3 m of nabh4 1 6 ml of agnp in 26 min the decolorized solutions were effectively utilized for repeated dyeing using same dye up to five cycles without any significant change in color and fastness properties of all dyed samples the method has the advantages of decrease in pollution load in terms of using lower amount of non sulfur reducing agent and lower toxicity of dye degradation products reusability of dye bath water repeatedly and also rapid decolorization conflict of interest the
