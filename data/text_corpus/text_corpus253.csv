engineering hefei university of technology no 193 tunxi road hefei 230009 china surfactant enhanced air sparging seas is an effective technology for the remediation of volatile organic compounds contamination of medium and high permeability soil though applying seas to low permeability soil contamination has rarely been explored in this study a series of two dimensional physical model tests were designed to explore the feasibility and remediation characteristics of seas on low permeability soil in the test results the incorporation and increase in surfactant concentration promoted air channel formation in the low permeability soil finally reduced the capillary breakthrough pressure and improved the airflow rate the majority of the exhausted gaseous contaminants were distributed along the horizontal direction differing from the results observed in medium and high permeability soils the exhausted gaseous contaminant concentration changed slightly when the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased at relatively low levels and increased as the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased further increasing the air sparging pressure without surfactant incorporation or with a low surfactant concentration cannot effectively remove the contaminant while the removal efficiency can be enhanced with further increases in surfactant concentration the discrete remediation characteristics had been confirmed during seas application on low permeability soil then the relationships between the ratios of remediation area and remediation extent under different surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures were established for remediation efficiency evaluation using this method the discrete remediation characteristics can be recreated once the surfactant concentration and the sparging pressure were chosen on the other side targeted improvements in the remediation area or extent can be achieved by controlling the surfactant concentration and sparging pressure through this study seas technology and the proposed evaluation method were successfully implemented in soil with hydraulic conductivity around 9e 7 m s which expanded the application scope of seas technology for contaminant removal graphical abstract seas technology on vocs contaminated soil with low permeability unlabelled image keywords surfactant enhanced air sparging low permeability soil remediation characteristics remediation area remediation extent 1 introduction surfactant enhanced air sparging seas is an enhanced version of conventional air sparging to remove volatile organic compounds vocs from contaminated soil in field implementation the addition of a surfactant to contaminated soil prior to air sparging modifies the surface interface properties and increases the solubilization desorption capacity of the contaminated zone which forms extensive air channels and accelerates voc volatilization diffusion within the vicinity of the channels further improves the remediation efficiency schuring et al 1991 christiansen et al 2008 venkatraman et al 2010 qin et al 2014 shen et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 li et al 2020 in previous studies burns and zhang 2001 selected the surfactant triton x100 to perform seas tests on coarse grained soil the results showed that the distribution and sizes of air bubbles were reduced and the contaminant removal rate was significantly improved by surfactant incorporation kim et al 2004 2006 used an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate to experimentally confirm the improvements in air saturation and sparging influence area further mechanism analysis revealed that air saturation initially increased then decreased with decreasing surface tension and the air water contact area increased monotonically as the air saturation increased the optimal surface tension can be determined based on the maximum air saturation and air water contact area obtained by the addition of a surfactant kim et al 2015 and kim et al 2016 verified the effect of surfactant incorporation on the control of contaminant removal paths the results showed that the surfactant modified the surface tension of the multiphase system and improved the airflow rates and air saturation in the surfactant filled regions which led to preferential contaminant removal zones in the soil xu et al 2020 investigated the effect of surfactant injection position on airflow patterns and contaminant removal efficiency in saturated sand an important conclusion of the research was that the improved contaminant removal rate and the effect of controlling the contaminant migration path could only be guaranteed when the surfactant was injected at a position close to the sparging point choi et al 2018 proposed that the synergistic effect of a thickener and surfactant increased the air saturation in the sparging zone leading to greater remediation efficiency in voc contaminated soil numerous studies have verified the superior performance of seas technology for improving the airflow pattern contaminant removal efficiency and controlling the remediation zone in medium and high permeability soils e g sandy soil and gravel soil table 1 however the heterogeneous stratigraphic distribution at sites arouse the urgent need for vocs removal in low permeability soil clayey soil etc with hydraulic conductivity lower than 1e 6 m s which faces great challenges due to the extremely small size irregular shape poor connectivity of the pores large capillary resistance at the multiphase interface and significant absorption characteristics of the clayey minerals johnson et al 1993 song et al 2015 and peterson et al 2011 investigated the airflow patterns in soil with different permeabilities in the results the air flowed in chamber mode for low permeability soil rather than the channel mode and bubble mode typically observed for medium and high permeability soils then the sparging influencing zone with significant horizontal components and irregular boundaries was presented caused significant difficulties in quantitative description of the remediation area in low permeability soil airflow distribution within the influencing zone studied by lundegard and labrecque 1995 reddy and adams 2000 yao et al 2020 reported that air cannot pass through the low permeability layer when the ratio of permeability between the upper and lower layers was greater than 10 which prompted the air to accumulate and move horizontally until the high permeability stratum was encountered on this basis airflow rate distribution will transit from gaussian shape to bimodal and fingered shape with the decrease of permeability leading to the unpredicted remediation efficiency in low permeability soil zha et al 2022 studied the contaminant migration characteristics and removal mechanism of seas technology on low permeability soil results showed that the improved remediation efficiency was controlled by the contaminant solubilization desorption mechanism rather than the surface tension reduction mechanism that was conventionally confirmed in medium and high permeability soils more importantly the irregular and poor connected pores in soil resulted in discrete distribution of air channels and surfactant leading to the inestimable remediation efficiency during the air sparging process as can be seen the application of seas technology on low permeability soil was controversial and faced huge uncertainties in previous researches loden 1992 johnson et al 1993 song et al 2015 to determine the remediation characteristics of seas technology for voc contaminated soil with low permeability a series of two dimensional physical model tests were designed and conducted in this study the remediation characteristics of airflow rate variation exhaust gaseous contaminant distribution contaminant spatial evolutions and remediation efficiency evaluation were comprehensively investigated 2 materials and testing procedures 2 1 materials the soil was sampled in bozhou city anhui province china the basic physical properties of the sampled soil were tested following the astm standards astm d2216 10 and astm d4318 table 2 x ray fluorescence xrf was used to determine the major chemical components of the soil and the results were shown in table 3 the voc source was purchased and used as received the chosen source was methyl tert butyl ether mtbe which was added to gasoline to improve the oxygen content and combustion quality the basic properties of mtbe were presented in table 4 reagent grade n lauroylsarcosine sodium salt was chosen as the surfactant in this study owing to its low toxicity irritability suitable heat capacity acid alkali resistance and perfect biodegradability akter et al 2011 throughout the experiments air and deionized water were used as gas and liquid sources respectively 2 2 test apparatus a two dimensional physical model was designed to perform the air sparging tests fig 1 the model was manufactured using plexiglass 96 cm width 75 cm height 10 cm thickness with 19 compartments installed at the top end the compartments collected the gas phase mtbe to determine the distribution of exhausted gaseous contaminants during air sparging on the front panel of the model a series of uniformly spaced ports were installed for contaminant and surfactant injection or liquid sampling depending on the specific testing objective two water tanks were connected to either side of the model to saturate and contaminate the soil by providing the prepared mtbe solution and mtbe surfactant mixed solution an air diffuser pore size of 40 μm diameter of 1 2 cm and length of 3 5 cm was installed at the bottom of the model to diffuse the injected air into the soil an air injection unit was connected to the air diffuser consisting of a compressed air source with an output pressure range of 0 12 mpa a high precision pressure regulator with an adjustment range of 0 1 mpa and an accuracy of 1 kpa a pressure buffer tank connected to a pressure sensor and a data acquisition device for pressure monitoring and an air rotameter to monitor the air inflow rate during air sparging 2 3 surfactant enhanced air sparging seas test procedures the apparatus was set up as shown in fig 1 the tested soil was poured into the model and compacted until a height of 50 cm was reached a 10 cm thick sand layer was placed on top of the compacted soil for load application and mechanical stability surfactant solutions with concentrations of 0 500 1000 and 1500 mg l were pre mixed with the mtbe contaminant solution 3000 mg l and were slowly poured into the water tanks on either side of the model to saturate contaminate the tested soil to obtain the mtbe distribution characteristics in the soil and determine the optimal testing time the mtbe liquid samples were extracted at 12 h intervals from the ports in the front panel and tested as shown in fig 2 the low permeability of the soil resulted in different mtbe concentrations at different locations but similar changes of the contaminant concentration with time were seen in all the ports it was clear that mtbe concentration increased and stabilized after 36 h therefore the mtbe incorporation was sustained for 48 h in this study to reach the concentration equilibrium the air injection unit was then connected to the model and an initial air pressure of 60 kpa was applied to start air sparging this process was sustained for 72 h during which the final stable air inflow rate could be measured using the air rotameter the expelled mtbe was deposited into the 19 compartments at the top of the model 1000 μl gaseous mtbe samples were collected and tested using gas chromatography at 3 9 24 48 and 72 h for further determination of the exhausted gaseous contaminant distribution at the top of the soil additionally 5 ml liquid mtbe samples were collected at 0 6 24 48 and 72 h from the 20 ports on the front panel and the contaminant concentration of the samples was immediately tested using gas chromatography to obtain the spatial evolution of the contaminant concentrations it should be noted that 100 ml of deionized water was added to the water tanks to balance the liquid depletion after each sampling based on the spatial characteristics of the mtbe concentration the average mtbe removal rate at a given time was calculated using eq 1 when the air sparging test was completed subsequent tests were performed following the test procedures described but changing the air sparging pressure to 80 100 and 120 kpa 1 e i j 0 n c i j c 0 j j 0 n c i j where e i is the average mtbe removal rate at a given time i c i n is the mtbe concentration at the given time i and given port j g l c 0 n is the initial mtbe concentration at the given port j g l and n is the number of uniformly spaced ports designed at the front panel for determination of hydraulic conductivity of the tested soil a parallel test was performed without the surfactant incorporation and air sparging implementation after equipment installation soil filling and preliminary saturation the deionized water was slowly injected into the air diffuser under a pressure of 50 kpa volume changes of the injected water was recorded and used to determine the hydraulic conductivity based on darcy s law the result was shown in fig 3 the hydraulic conductivity of 8 92e 7 m s was obtained indicating the low permeability of the soil prepared in this study 3 test results and discussion 3 1 relationship between airflow rate and sparging pressure the evolutions of the airflow rate with the sparging pressure are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 for air sparging in low permeability soil the airflow rate begins to increase after reaching a critical pressure and it increases significantly with increasing sparging pressure this significant nonlinear airflow behavior is attributed to the capillary resistance present at the multiphase interface graham et al 2002 ito et al 2011 xu et al 2015 initially the low sparging pressure cannot overcome the capillary resistance to form effective air channels in the soil once a critical value known as the capillary breakthrough pressure is reached effective air channels are formed across the soil leading to the occurrence of airflow hildenbrand et al 2013 busch and hildenbrand 2013 xu et al 2015 a further increase in the sparging pressure forms more air channels in the soil and enhances the airflow gradient in the channels resulting in further improvement of the airflow rate results in fig 4 show that the incorporation and increase in surfactant concentration reduces the surface tension of the multiphase system and decreases the capillary resistance of the low permeability soil as a result the capillary breakthrough pressure for air channel formation is decreased and the airflow rates and air saturation in the surfactant filled regions are improved 3 2 exhausted gaseous mtbe concentration distribution the exhausted gaseous mtbe concentrations from the top of the soil influenced by the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively as indicated in figs 5 and 6 the exhausted gaseous mtbe concentrations are distributed horizontally along the lateral direction of the contaminated soil this distribution characteristic differs from that observed in medium and high permeability soils in which a gaussian distribution is typically seen the peak concentration exists at the central axis and decreases symmetrically along the two wings baker and benson 2007 song et al 2015 kim et al 2016 yao et al 2017 additionally the effects of increasing the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration showed that changes in the exhausted gaseous mtbe concentrations were negligible when the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased slightly gaseous mtbe removal was enhanced when the sparging pressure reached 120 kpa with a surfactant concentration of 1000 mg l and when the surfactant concentration reached 1000 mg l with a sparging pressure of 80 kpa these results confirm the remediation efficiency of seas technology on low permeability soil which is inconsistent with the traditional viewpoint that contaminants cannot be removed due to the significant horizontal and limited vertical migration components reddy and adams 2000 peterson et al 2011 song et al 2015 mechanism analysis reveals that the effective contaminant removal in porous medium is related to the air channel formation and contaminant phrase transformation for medium and high permeability soils with larger pore space and lower capillary resistance air channels are extensively formed around the sparging point and extended into the distance when sparging pressure slightly higher than hydrostatic pressure is applied additionally the sustained air sparging will lead to the interphase redistribution and promote the contaminant dissolution volatilization owing to the inertial solid components existed in typical sandy and gravel soils however for low permeability soil tested in this study the small and irregular pores in soil as well as the strong adsorption of clay minerals constrain the airflow and contaminant phrase transformation which result in lateral expansion of contaminant due to the relatively high horizontal permeability of the layered soil when seas technology is introduced the implementation of larger sparging pressure can overcome the capillary resistance of the low permeability soil the incorporation of higher surfactant concentration will reduce the surface tension at the multiphase interface and promote the contaminant solubilization desorption on this basis contaminant can be effectively removed as shown in figs 5 and 6 it should be noted that the gaseous mtbe was exhausted at discrete locations in the low permeability soil especially with surfactant incorporation fig 6 this phenomenon is attributed to the discrete airflow behavior that is widely reported in studies of airflow in low permeability soil air preferentially flows through the larger interconnected pores with a lower capillary resistance resulting in the discrete characteristic of exhausted gaseous mtbe concentration this characteristic is strengthened with surfactant incorporation because of the preferential mass transfer characteristic and discrete distribution of surfactants in low permeability soil 3 3 spatial evolutions of the mtbe concentration to analyze the spatial evolution of the mtbe concentration during the sparging process the residual mtbe concentrations in soil are measured and arranged by the initial concentration for normalization as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 it is evident that increasing the air sparging pressure without surfactant incorporation or with a low surfactant concentration cannot effectively remove the mtbe while the contaminant can be effectively removed with further increases in surfactant concentration this result confirms that the small size poor connectivity and irregular shape of the pores as well as the strong adsorption of clay minerals in the tested low permeability soil significantly constrain the airflow and contaminant phrase transformation without notable surfactant incorporation when higher surfactant concentration is introduced in the air sparging process the surface tension reduction at the multiphase interface reduces the capillary resistance and forms effective air channels in the soil more importantly as the surfactant concentration exceeds the critical micelle concentration cmc the adsorbed contaminant is encapsulated by the surfactant and dissolved into the liquid phase owing to the hydrophilic groups stacked on the outer layer these surfactant micelles promote contaminant solubilization desorption and increase the contaminant mass transfer capacity for further diffusion processes because of this as the sparging pressure increases mtbe can be removed with a maximum removal rate higher than 70 the evolution of the total mtbe removal rate during the seas process can be determined using eq 1 and is presented in fig 8 similar conclusions can be reached when the seas technology is implemented at lower surfactant concentrations the total removal rates are maintained at relatively low levels and remain almost unchanged when the sparging pressure increases when higher surfactant concentrations were incorporated the total removal rates were significantly enhanced and increased further as the sparging pressure increased on this basis feasibility of seas technology on contaminated soil with hydraulic conductivity around 9e 7 m s has been confirmed which expanses the application scope that previously implemented on contaminated soil with hydraulic conductivity around 1e 4 m s the results in fig 7 also confirm the discrete spatial evolutions of the mtbe concentration in low permeability soil supported by peterson et al 2011 and song et al 2015 in which the chamber flow is observed with significant horizontal components and irregular boundaries these results are significantly different from those reported for medium and high permeability soils which presented a conically shaped sparging remediation area influence zone with distinct boundaries similar to the results presented in figs 5 and 6 this phenomenon is attributed to the preferential airflow behavior through the large interconnected pores with low capillary resistance as well as the preferential mass transfer characteristic and discrete surfactant distribution in the low permeability soil 3 4 quantitative analysis of the remediation characteristic the remediation characteristics of the contaminated soil are reflected in the variations in remediation area and extent ratios in conventional air sparging or seas technology on medium or high permeability soils the conically shaped sparging influence zone and gaussian shaped exhausted contaminant distribution are recorded and used to determine the remediation area and extent in mathematical forms qin et al 2014 kim et al 2015 song et al 2015 xu et al 2020 however the discrete remediation characteristics obtained for low permeability soil which have been confirmed in figs 5 6 and 7 complicate the quantitative analysis of the remediation area and extent ratios and further the mass transfer capacity and remediation efficiency during the seas to circumvent this issue the spatial evolutions of mtbe concentration in soil are referred fig 7 in which the remediation extent ratio of 10 30 50 70 and 90 are respectively selected to extract the corresponding remediation area ratio on this basis relationships between the remediation area and extent ratios under different surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures were illustrated in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the remediation area ratio decreases slowly with the increasing remediation extent ratio this result is different from that observed in medium or high permeability soils in which a steep evolution is obtained due to the concentrated contaminant removal rate and distinct contaminant removal boundary around the sparging point the s shaped curve can be used to describe the relationship between the remediation area and extent ratios the curvature changes slightly for scenarios with low surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures and changes significantly with high surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures this behavior indicates the enhanced remediation efficiency of the seas technology on voc contaminated soil with low permeability especially when high surfactant concentrations are incorporated which is similar to the results previously confirmed in this study for further quantitative analysis the s shaped relationship between remediation area ratio a r and remediation extent ratio e r can be described using eq 2 the typical fitted results are shown in fig 10 the fitting parameters a and b were extracted and are listed in table 5 2 a r 1 e r a b 1 b b according to the results in table 5 the evolutions of parameters a and b with surfactant concentration can be described using the exponential relationship presented in fig 11 and eq 3 3 p a p m p exp c surf n p where c surf is the surfactant concentration incorporated in the air sparging process mg l p refers to the parameters a and b in different scenarios and a p m p and n p are the parameters fitted based on the results shown in fig 11 based on the data analysis of table 6 the evolution of parameters a p m p and n p with sparging pressure p sparging can be obtained in mathematical forms which are illustrated in fig 12 and the expressions are presented in eq 4 to eq 9 4 a a 0 341 1 06 e 13 exp p sparging 4 342 5 a b 5 743 0

using this equation set the relationship between the remediation area and extent ratios under arbitrary surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures were obtained and are illustrated in fig 13 this relationship remains almost constant with changes in the surfactant concentration and sparging pressure at lower values fig 13 a and b however it changes notably at higher values especially with increasing surfactant concentration fig 13 c and d this phenomenon is consistent with previously obtained results and confirms the enhanced remediation efficiency of seas technology on low permeability soil under higher surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures more importantly the discrete remediation characteristics in the remediation area and extent ratios can be recreated once the surfactant concentration and sparging pressure are proposed which is used to quantitatively analyze the remediation efficiency of the seas technology on low permeability soil the targeted improvements in the remediation area or extent ratios can be achieved by controlling the surfactant concentration and sparging pressure in a scenario with a given surfactant concentration 1100 mg l fig 14 a the relationships between the remediation area and extent ratios under different sparging pressures were plotted using the equation set eq 2 to eq 9 it was found that remediation area ratio of 65 and remediation extent ratio of 45 can be achieved by applying a sparging pressure of 105 kpa and a remediation area ratio of 25 and a remediation extent ratio of 60 can be achieved by applying a sparging pressure of 95 100 kpa in a scenario with a given sparging pressure 110 kpa fig 14 b the relationships between the remediation area and extent ratios under different surfactant concentrations could also be plotted using the equation set a remediation area ratio of 60 and remediation extent ratio of 50 could be achieved by applying a surfactant concentration of 1050 mg l and a remediation area ratio of 40 and remediation extent ratio of 70 could be achieved by applying a surfactant concentration of 1250 mg l 4 conclusions to investigate the feasibility and remediation characteristics of seas technology for voc contaminated low permeability soil a series of two dimensional physical model tests were designed and conducted the main conclusions drawn are as follows the incorporation and increase in surfactant concentration decreased the capillary resistance to airflow which reduced the capillary breakthrough pressure for air channel formation and improved the airflow rate the exhausted gaseous mtbe concentrations distributed along the horizontal direction this changed slightly when the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased at relatively low levels and significantly improved when the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased further increasing the air sparging pressure without surfactant incorporation or with a low surfactant concentration cannot effectively remove the mtbe in the soil while the contaminant can be effectively removed with further increases in surfactant concentration the discrete remediation characteristics of the seas technology on low permeability soil were confirmed in this study the relationships between the remediation area and extent ratios under different surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures were established for remediation efficiency evaluation feasibility of seas technology as well as the corresponding evaluation method on contaminated soil with hydraulic conductivity around 9e 7 m s has been confirmed which expanse the application scope of seas technology for contaminant removal credit authorship contribution statement x u long data curation writing

engineering hefei university of technology no 193 tunxi road hefei 230009 china surfactant enhanced air sparging seas is an effective technology for the remediation of volatile organic compounds contamination of medium and high permeability soil though applying seas to low permeability soil contamination has rarely been explored in this study a series of two dimensional physical model tests were designed to explore the feasibility and remediation characteristics of seas on low permeability soil in the test results the incorporation and increase in surfactant concentration promoted air channel formation in the low permeability soil finally reduced the capillary breakthrough pressure and improved the airflow rate the majority of the exhausted gaseous contaminants were distributed along the horizontal direction differing from the results observed in medium and high permeability soils the exhausted gaseous contaminant concentration changed slightly when the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased at relatively low levels and increased as the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased further increasing the air sparging pressure without surfactant incorporation or with a low surfactant concentration cannot effectively remove the contaminant while the removal efficiency can be enhanced with further increases in surfactant concentration the discrete remediation characteristics had been confirmed during seas application on low permeability soil then the relationships between the ratios of remediation area and remediation extent under different surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures were established for remediation efficiency evaluation using this method the discrete remediation characteristics can be recreated once the surfactant concentration and the sparging pressure were chosen on the other side targeted improvements in the remediation area or extent can be achieved by controlling the surfactant concentration and sparging pressure through this study seas technology and the proposed evaluation method were successfully implemented in soil with hydraulic conductivity around 9e 7 m s which expanded the application scope of seas technology for contaminant removal graphical abstract seas technology on vocs contaminated soil with low permeability unlabelled image keywords surfactant enhanced air sparging low permeability soil remediation characteristics remediation area remediation extent 1 introduction surfactant enhanced air sparging seas is an enhanced version of conventional air sparging to remove volatile organic compounds vocs from contaminated soil in field implementation the addition of a surfactant to contaminated soil prior to air sparging modifies the surface interface properties and increases the solubilization desorption capacity of the contaminated zone which forms extensive air channels and accelerates voc volatilization diffusion within the vicinity of the channels further improves the remediation efficiency schuring et al 1991 christiansen et al 2008 venkatraman et al 2010 qin et al 2014 shen et al 2020 zhou et al 2020 li et al 2020 in previous studies burns and zhang 2001 selected the surfactant triton x100 to perform seas tests on coarse grained soil the results showed that the distribution and sizes of air bubbles were reduced and the contaminant removal rate was significantly improved by surfactant incorporation kim et al 2004 2006 used an anionic surfactant sodium dodecyl benzene sulfonate to experimentally confirm the improvements in air saturation and sparging influence area further mechanism analysis revealed that air saturation initially increased then decreased with decreasing surface tension and the air water contact area increased monotonically as the air saturation increased the optimal surface tension can be determined based on the maximum air saturation and air water contact area obtained by the addition of a surfactant kim et al 2015 and kim et al 2016 verified the effect of surfactant incorporation on the control of contaminant removal paths the results showed that the surfactant modified the surface tension of the multiphase system and improved the airflow rates and air saturation in the surfactant filled regions which led to preferential contaminant removal zones in the soil xu et al 2020 investigated the effect of surfactant injection position on airflow patterns and contaminant removal efficiency in saturated sand an important conclusion of the research was that the improved contaminant removal rate and the effect of controlling the contaminant migration path could only be guaranteed when the surfactant was injected at a position close to the sparging point choi et al 2018 proposed that the synergistic effect of a thickener and surfactant increased the air saturation in the sparging zone leading to greater remediation efficiency in voc contaminated soil numerous studies have verified the superior performance of seas technology for improving the airflow pattern contaminant removal efficiency and controlling the remediation zone in medium and high permeability soils e g sandy soil and gravel soil table 1 however the heterogeneous stratigraphic distribution at sites arouse the urgent need for vocs removal in low permeability soil clayey soil etc with hydraulic conductivity lower than 1e 6 m s which faces great challenges due to the extremely small size irregular shape poor connectivity of the pores large capillary resistance at the multiphase interface and significant absorption characteristics of the clayey minerals johnson et al 1993 song et al 2015 and peterson et al 2011 investigated the airflow patterns in soil with different permeabilities in the results the air flowed in chamber mode for low permeability soil rather than the channel mode and bubble mode typically observed for medium and high permeability soils then the sparging influencing zone with significant horizontal components and irregular boundaries was presented caused significant difficulties in quantitative description of the remediation area in low permeability soil airflow distribution within the influencing zone studied by lundegard and labrecque 1995 reddy and adams 2000 yao et al 2020 reported that air cannot pass through the low permeability layer when the ratio of permeability between the upper and lower layers was greater than 10 which prompted the air to accumulate and move horizontally until the high permeability stratum was encountered on this basis airflow rate distribution will transit from gaussian shape to bimodal and fingered shape with the decrease of permeability leading to the unpredicted remediation efficiency in low permeability soil zha et al 2022 studied the contaminant migration characteristics and removal mechanism of seas technology on low permeability soil results showed that the improved remediation efficiency was controlled by the contaminant solubilization desorption mechanism rather than the surface tension reduction mechanism that was conventionally confirmed in medium and high permeability soils more importantly the irregular and poor connected pores in soil resulted in discrete distribution of air channels and surfactant leading to the inestimable remediation efficiency during the air sparging process as can be seen the application of seas technology on low permeability soil was controversial and faced huge uncertainties in previous researches loden 1992 johnson et al 1993 song et al 2015 to determine the remediation characteristics of seas technology for voc contaminated soil with low permeability a series of two dimensional physical model tests were designed and conducted in this study the remediation characteristics of airflow rate variation exhaust gaseous contaminant distribution contaminant spatial evolutions and remediation efficiency evaluation were comprehensively investigated 2 materials and testing procedures 2 1 materials the soil was sampled in bozhou city anhui province china the basic physical properties of the sampled soil were tested following the astm standards astm d2216 10 and astm d4318 table 2 x ray fluorescence xrf was used to determine the major chemical components of the soil and the results were shown in table 3 the voc source was purchased and used as received the chosen source was methyl tert butyl ether mtbe which was added to gasoline to improve the oxygen content and combustion quality the basic properties of mtbe were presented in table 4 reagent grade n lauroylsarcosine sodium salt was chosen as the surfactant in this study owing to its low toxicity irritability suitable heat capacity acid alkali resistance and perfect biodegradability akter et al 2011 throughout the experiments air and deionized water were used as gas and liquid sources respectively 2 2 test apparatus a two dimensional physical model was designed to perform the air sparging tests fig 1 the model was manufactured using plexiglass 96 cm width 75 cm height 10 cm thickness with 19 compartments installed at the top end the compartments collected the gas phase mtbe to determine the distribution of exhausted gaseous contaminants during air sparging on the front panel of the model a series of uniformly spaced ports were installed for contaminant and surfactant injection or liquid sampling depending on the specific testing objective two water tanks were connected to either side of the model to saturate and contaminate the soil by providing the prepared mtbe solution and mtbe surfactant mixed solution an air diffuser pore size of 40 μm diameter of 1 2 cm and length of 3 5 cm was installed at the bottom of the model to diffuse the injected air into the soil an air injection unit was connected to the air diffuser consisting of a compressed air source with an output pressure range of 0 12 mpa a high precision pressure regulator with an adjustment range of 0 1 mpa and an accuracy of 1 kpa a pressure buffer tank connected to a pressure sensor and a data acquisition device for pressure monitoring and an air rotameter to monitor the air inflow rate during air sparging 2 3 surfactant enhanced air sparging seas test procedures the apparatus was set up as shown in fig 1 the tested soil was poured into the model and compacted until a height of 50 cm was reached a 10 cm thick sand layer was placed on top of the compacted soil for load application and mechanical stability surfactant solutions with concentrations of 0 500 1000 and 1500 mg l were pre mixed with the mtbe contaminant solution 3000 mg l and were slowly poured into the water tanks on either side of the model to saturate contaminate the tested soil to obtain the mtbe distribution characteristics in the soil and determine the optimal testing time the mtbe liquid samples were extracted at 12 h intervals from the ports in the front panel and tested as shown in fig 2 the low permeability of the soil resulted in different mtbe concentrations at different locations but similar changes of the contaminant concentration with time were seen in all the ports it was clear that mtbe concentration increased and stabilized after 36 h therefore the mtbe incorporation was sustained for 48 h in this study to reach the concentration equilibrium the air injection unit was then connected to the model and an initial air pressure of 60 kpa was applied to start air sparging this process was sustained for 72 h during which the final stable air inflow rate could be measured using the air rotameter the expelled mtbe was deposited into the 19 compartments at the top of the model 1000 μl gaseous mtbe samples were collected and tested using gas chromatography at 3 9 24 48 and 72 h for further determination of the exhausted gaseous contaminant distribution at the top of the soil additionally 5 ml liquid mtbe samples were collected at 0 6 24 48 and 72 h from the 20 ports on the front panel and the contaminant concentration of the samples was immediately tested using gas chromatography to obtain the spatial evolution of the contaminant concentrations it should be noted that 100 ml of deionized water was added to the water tanks to balance the liquid depletion after each sampling based on the spatial characteristics of the mtbe concentration the average mtbe removal rate at a given time was calculated using eq 1 when the air sparging test was completed subsequent tests were performed following the test procedures described but changing the air sparging pressure to 80 100 and 120 kpa 1 e i j 0 n c i j c 0 j j 0 n c i j where e i is the average mtbe removal rate at a given time i c i n is the mtbe concentration at the given time i and given port j g l c 0 n is the initial mtbe concentration at the given port j g l and n is the number of uniformly spaced ports designed at the front panel for determination of hydraulic conductivity of the tested soil a parallel test was performed without the surfactant incorporation and air sparging implementation after equipment installation soil filling and preliminary saturation the deionized water was slowly injected into the air diffuser under a pressure of 50 kpa volume changes of the injected water was recorded and used to determine the hydraulic conductivity based on darcy s law the result was shown in fig 3 the hydraulic conductivity of 8 92e 7 m s was obtained indicating the low permeability of the soil prepared in this study 3 test results and discussion 3 1 relationship between airflow rate and sparging pressure the evolutions of the airflow rate with the sparging pressure are presented in fig 4 as shown in fig 4 for air sparging in low permeability soil the airflow rate begins to increase after reaching a critical pressure and it increases significantly with increasing sparging pressure this significant nonlinear airflow behavior is attributed to the capillary resistance present at the multiphase interface graham et al 2002 ito et al 2011 xu et al 2015 initially the low sparging pressure cannot overcome the capillary resistance to form effective air channels in the soil once a critical value known as the capillary breakthrough pressure is reached effective air channels are formed across the soil leading to the occurrence of airflow hildenbrand et al 2013 busch and hildenbrand 2013 xu et al 2015 a further increase in the sparging pressure forms more air channels in the soil and enhances the airflow gradient in the channels resulting in further improvement of the airflow rate results in fig 4 show that the incorporation and increase in surfactant concentration reduces the surface tension of the multiphase system and decreases the capillary resistance of the low permeability soil as a result the capillary breakthrough pressure for air channel formation is decreased and the airflow rates and air saturation in the surfactant filled regions are improved 3 2 exhausted gaseous mtbe concentration distribution the exhausted gaseous mtbe concentrations from the top of the soil influenced by the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration are presented in fig 5 and fig 6 respectively as indicated in figs 5 and 6 the exhausted gaseous mtbe concentrations are distributed horizontally along the lateral direction of the contaminated soil this distribution characteristic differs from that observed in medium and high permeability soils in which a gaussian distribution is typically seen the peak concentration exists at the central axis and decreases symmetrically along the two wings baker and benson 2007 song et al 2015 kim et al 2016 yao et al 2017 additionally the effects of increasing the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration showed that changes in the exhausted gaseous mtbe concentrations were negligible when the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased slightly gaseous mtbe removal was enhanced when the sparging pressure reached 120 kpa with a surfactant concentration of 1000 mg l and when the surfactant concentration reached 1000 mg l with a sparging pressure of 80 kpa these results confirm the remediation efficiency of seas technology on low permeability soil which is inconsistent with the traditional viewpoint that contaminants cannot be removed due to the significant horizontal and limited vertical migration components reddy and adams 2000 peterson et al 2011 song et al 2015 mechanism analysis reveals that the effective contaminant removal in porous medium is related to the air channel formation and contaminant phrase transformation for medium and high permeability soils with larger pore space and lower capillary resistance air channels are extensively formed around the sparging point and extended into the distance when sparging pressure slightly higher than hydrostatic pressure is applied additionally the sustained air sparging will lead to the interphase redistribution and promote the contaminant dissolution volatilization owing to the inertial solid components existed in typical sandy and gravel soils however for low permeability soil tested in this study the small and irregular pores in soil as well as the strong adsorption of clay minerals constrain the airflow and contaminant phrase transformation which result in lateral expansion of contaminant due to the relatively high horizontal permeability of the layered soil when seas technology is introduced the implementation of larger sparging pressure can overcome the capillary resistance of the low permeability soil the incorporation of higher surfactant concentration will reduce the surface tension at the multiphase interface and promote the contaminant solubilization desorption on this basis contaminant can be effectively removed as shown in figs 5 and 6 it should be noted that the gaseous mtbe was exhausted at discrete locations in the low permeability soil especially with surfactant incorporation fig 6 this phenomenon is attributed to the discrete airflow behavior that is widely reported in studies of airflow in low permeability soil air preferentially flows through the larger interconnected pores with a lower capillary resistance resulting in the discrete characteristic of exhausted gaseous mtbe concentration this characteristic is strengthened with surfactant incorporation because of the preferential mass transfer characteristic and discrete distribution of surfactants in low permeability soil 3 3 spatial evolutions of the mtbe concentration to analyze the spatial evolution of the mtbe concentration during the sparging process the residual mtbe concentrations in soil are measured and arranged by the initial concentration for normalization as shown in fig 7 as shown in fig 7 it is evident that increasing the air sparging pressure without surfactant incorporation or with a low surfactant concentration cannot effectively remove the mtbe while the contaminant can be effectively removed with further increases in surfactant concentration this result confirms that the small size poor connectivity and irregular shape of the pores as well as the strong adsorption of clay minerals in the tested low permeability soil significantly constrain the airflow and contaminant phrase transformation without notable surfactant incorporation when higher surfactant concentration is introduced in the air sparging process the surface tension reduction at the multiphase interface reduces the capillary resistance and forms effective air channels in the soil more importantly as the surfactant concentration exceeds the critical micelle concentration cmc the adsorbed contaminant is encapsulated by the surfactant and dissolved into the liquid phase owing to the hydrophilic groups stacked on the outer layer these surfactant micelles promote contaminant solubilization desorption and increase the contaminant mass transfer capacity for further diffusion processes because of this as the sparging pressure increases mtbe can be removed with a maximum removal rate higher than 70 the evolution of the total mtbe removal rate during the seas process can be determined using eq 1 and is presented in fig 8 similar conclusions can be reached when the seas technology is implemented at lower surfactant concentrations the total removal rates are maintained at relatively low levels and remain almost unchanged when the sparging pressure increases when higher surfactant concentrations were incorporated the total removal rates were significantly enhanced and increased further as the sparging pressure increased on this basis feasibility of seas technology on contaminated soil with hydraulic conductivity around 9e 7 m s has been confirmed which expanses the application scope that previously implemented on contaminated soil with hydraulic conductivity around 1e 4 m s the results in fig 7 also confirm the discrete spatial evolutions of the mtbe concentration in low permeability soil supported by peterson et al 2011 and song et al 2015 in which the chamber flow is observed with significant horizontal components and irregular boundaries these results are significantly different from those reported for medium and high permeability soils which presented a conically shaped sparging remediation area influence zone with distinct boundaries similar to the results presented in figs 5 and 6 this phenomenon is attributed to the preferential airflow behavior through the large interconnected pores with low capillary resistance as well as the preferential mass transfer characteristic and discrete surfactant distribution in the low permeability soil 3 4 quantitative analysis of the remediation characteristic the remediation characteristics of the contaminated soil are reflected in the variations in remediation area and extent ratios in conventional air sparging or seas technology on medium or high permeability soils the conically shaped sparging influence zone and gaussian shaped exhausted contaminant distribution are recorded and used to determine the remediation area and extent in mathematical forms qin et al 2014 kim et al 2015 song et al 2015 xu et al 2020 however the discrete remediation characteristics obtained for low permeability soil which have been confirmed in figs 5 6 and 7 complicate the quantitative analysis of the remediation area and extent ratios and further the mass transfer capacity and remediation efficiency during the seas to circumvent this issue the spatial evolutions of mtbe concentration in soil are referred fig 7 in which the remediation extent ratio of 10 30 50 70 and 90 are respectively selected to extract the corresponding remediation area ratio on this basis relationships between the remediation area and extent ratios under different surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures were illustrated in fig 9 as shown in fig 9 the remediation area ratio decreases slowly with the increasing remediation extent ratio this result is different from that observed in medium or high permeability soils in which a steep evolution is obtained due to the concentrated contaminant removal rate and distinct contaminant removal boundary around the sparging point the s shaped curve can be used to describe the relationship between the remediation area and extent ratios the curvature changes slightly for scenarios with low surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures and changes significantly with high surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures this behavior indicates the enhanced remediation efficiency of the seas technology on voc contaminated soil with low permeability especially when high surfactant concentrations are incorporated which is similar to the results previously confirmed in this study for further quantitative analysis the s shaped relationship between remediation area ratio a r and remediation extent ratio e r can be described using eq 2 the typical fitted results are shown in fig 10 the fitting parameters a and b were extracted and are listed in table 5 2 a r 1 e r a b 1 b b according to the results in table 5 the evolutions of parameters a and b with surfactant concentration can be described using the exponential relationship presented in fig 11 and eq 3 3 p a p m p exp c surf n p where c surf is the surfactant concentration incorporated in the air sparging process mg l p refers to the parameters a and b in different scenarios and a p m p and n p are the parameters fitted based on the results shown in fig 11 based on the data analysis of table 6 the evolution of parameters a p m p and n p with sparging pressure p sparging can be obtained in mathematical forms which are illustrated in fig 12 and the expressions are presented in eq 4 to eq 9 4 a a 0 341 1 06 e 13 exp p sparging 4 342 5 a b 5 743 0

using this equation set the relationship between the remediation area and extent ratios under arbitrary surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures were obtained and are illustrated in fig 13 this relationship remains almost constant with changes in the surfactant concentration and sparging pressure at lower values fig 13 a and b however it changes notably at higher values especially with increasing surfactant concentration fig 13 c and d this phenomenon is consistent with previously obtained results and confirms the enhanced remediation efficiency of seas technology on low permeability soil under higher surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures more importantly the discrete remediation characteristics in the remediation area and extent ratios can be recreated once the surfactant concentration and sparging pressure are proposed which is used to quantitatively analyze the remediation efficiency of the seas technology on low permeability soil the targeted improvements in the remediation area or extent ratios can be achieved by controlling the surfactant concentration and sparging pressure in a scenario with a given surfactant concentration 1100 mg l fig 14 a the relationships between the remediation area and extent ratios under different sparging pressures were plotted using the equation set eq 2 to eq 9 it was found that remediation area ratio of 65 and remediation extent ratio of 45 can be achieved by applying a sparging pressure of 105 kpa and a remediation area ratio of 25 and a remediation extent ratio of 60 can be achieved by applying a sparging pressure of 95 100 kpa in a scenario with a given sparging pressure 110 kpa fig 14 b the relationships between the remediation area and extent ratios under different surfactant concentrations could also be plotted using the equation set a remediation area ratio of 60 and remediation extent ratio of 50 could be achieved by applying a surfactant concentration of 1050 mg l and a remediation area ratio of 40 and remediation extent ratio of 70 could be achieved by applying a surfactant concentration of 1250 mg l 4 conclusions to investigate the feasibility and remediation characteristics of seas technology for voc contaminated low permeability soil a series of two dimensional physical model tests were designed and conducted the main conclusions drawn are as follows the incorporation and increase in surfactant concentration decreased the capillary resistance to airflow which reduced the capillary breakthrough pressure for air channel formation and improved the airflow rate the exhausted gaseous mtbe concentrations distributed along the horizontal direction this changed slightly when the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased at relatively low levels and significantly improved when the sparging pressure and surfactant concentration increased further increasing the air sparging pressure without surfactant incorporation or with a low surfactant concentration cannot effectively remove the mtbe in the soil while the contaminant can be effectively removed with further increases in surfactant concentration the discrete remediation characteristics of the seas technology on low permeability soil were confirmed in this study the relationships between the remediation area and extent ratios under different surfactant concentrations and sparging pressures were established for remediation efficiency evaluation feasibility of seas technology as well as the corresponding evaluation method on contaminated soil with hydraulic conductivity around 9e 7 m s has been confirmed which expanse the application scope of seas technology for contaminant removal credit authorship contribution statement x u long data curation writing

specific isotope analysis csia has become a valuable tool in understanding the fate of organic contaminants at field sites however its application to chlorinated benzenes cbs a group of toxic and persistent groundwater contaminants has received less attention this study employed csia to investigate the occurrence of natural degradation of various cbs and benzene in a contaminated aquifer despite the complexity of the study area e g installation of a sheet pile barrier and the presence of a complex set of contaminants the substantial enrichments in δ13c values i e 2 for all cbs and benzene across the sampling wells indicate in situ degradation of these compounds in particular the 13c enrichments for 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dichlorobenzene 1 2 dcb display good correlations with decreasing groundwater concentrations consistent with the effects of in situ biodegradation using the rayleigh model the extent of degradation eod is estimated to be 47 99 for 1 2 dcb and 21 73 for 1 2 4 tcb the enrichments observed for the other cbs 1 4 dcb and chlorobenzene mcb and benzene at the site are also suggestive of in situ biodegradation due to simultaneous degradation and production of 1 4 dcb a major 1 2 4 tcb degradation product mcb from dcb degradation and benzene from mcb degradation the estimation of eod for these intermediate compounds is more

brusseau 2019 although cbs and benzene can be transformed aerobically field and sierra alvarez 2008 and references therein anaerobic transformation of these compounds is of particular interest because they are frequently released into anoxic environments or can lead to the deprivation of oxygen due to aerobic degradation process mercer and cohen 1990 to date a growing number of studies shows that cbs adrian and görisch 2002 alfán guzmán et al 2017 field and sierra alvarez 2008 liang et al 2011 2014 nelson et al 2014 qiao et al 2018b vandermeeren et al 2014 and benzene liang et al 2013 mancini et al 2008 toth et al 2021 can be transformed anaerobically based on microcosm studies using natural materials e g sediments and river sludge from contaminated sites despite this knowledge field studies demonstrating in situ degradation are limited especially for highly chlorinated cbs e g cbs with two or more cl atoms alberti et al 2017 qiao et al 2018b stelzer et al 2009 possibly because of their low solubility in water and typical low concentrations relative to detection limits i e on the order of 10 μg l e g alberti et al 2017 gilevska et al 2019 stelzer et al 2009 even at low concentrations these cbs still represent a threat to human health and the environment e g maximum contaminant levels for drinking water are set at 70 μg l for 1 2 4 tcb 600 μg l for 1 2 dcb 75 μg l for 1 4 dcb 100 μg l for mcb and 5 μg l for benzene us epa 2018 since contaminant mass concentration reductions can result from both non degradative and degradative processes measuring concentration decreases alone is not sufficient to confirm transformation and additional lines of evidence are required to identify the occurrence of processes responsible for contaminant attenuation and to quantify in situ degradation of chlorinated cbs qiao et al 2018b compound specific isotope analysis csia has become a widely used diagnostic tool in identifying degradation as outlined in the epa best practice guide hunkeler et al 2008 csia measures the isotope ratio r of the heavy he to light isotope le of an element e in the compound of interest i e rsample and is reported in δ notation i e multiplied by 1000 unit mur or relative to the international standard e g vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb for carbon as shown in eq 1 for carbon 1 δ 13 c r sample r vpdb r vpdb the underlying principle of csia is attributed to measuring the kinetic isotope effect kie which results from differences in the degradation rates of bonds with different isotope compositions elsner 2010 typically the reactive bonds of the molecules containing exclusively light isotopes of an element e g 12c have smaller activation energy and react at a slightly faster rate than the molecules with at least one heavy isotope e g 13c as a result of the kie the remaining unreacted contaminant becomes more enriched in the heavier isotopes i e 13c enrichment during degradation and the corresponding δ13c value of the remaining contaminant can therefore indicate the occurrence of degradation in contrast to the often large carbon isotopic fractionation observed during biotransformation the isotope fractionation produced by physical processes aqueous diffusion dissolution sorption mass transport or phase change volatilization under many circumstances e g bouchard et al 2008 dempster et al 1997 harrington et al 1999 höhener and yu 2012 imfeld et al 2014 slater et al 1999 2000 wanner and hunkeler 2019 xu et al 2016 has been found to be smaller or insignificant relative to the analytical uncertainty which is 0 5 for carbon hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar et al 2007 for many hydrocarbon contaminants the relationship between the amount of contaminant remaining and the isotope signature has been shown to fit a rayleigh model hunkeler et al 2008 and references therein eq 2 2 ln 1000 δ 13 c 1000 δ 13 c o ε c 1000 ln f where δ13co is the initial isotopic composition of the contaminant δ13c is the

source concentration and ɛ i e isotope enrichment factor is the magnitude of fractionation for a given process determined in controlled laboratory experiments previously reported by liang et al 2011 2014 mancini et al 2003 griebler et al 2004a for cbs and benzene often ɛ is reaction specific and reproducible for a given reaction thus using the appropriate laboratory derived ɛ and solving for f in eq 2 the extent of degradation eod can be estimated using eq 3 3 eod 1 f while laboratory studies have shown that anaerobic degradation of benzene and cbs with three or less chlorine atoms display significant carbon isotopic fractionation griebler et al 2004a liang et al 2011 2014 mancini et al 2003 2008 the field application of csia for these contaminants remains limited table s1 particularly for the investigation of dcb alberti et al 2017 stelzer et al 2009 and tcb alberti et al 2017 for dcb alberti et al 2017 observed concentration decreases concomitant with 13c enrichment consistent with in situ degradation while stelzer et al 2009 could not make a straightforward assessment of dcb degradation because δ13c values did not systematically correlate with concentration decreases at their study site for tcb the only available field study to date alberti et al 2017 has very limited data in support of tcb degradation because 13c enrichment was only observed in one well location therefore field sites with cbs concentrations above detection limits such as the present work are an opportunity to apply csia and evaluate isotopic evidence for the occurrence of anaerobic transformation of this important group of priority pollutants another motivation to investigate the degradation of cbs is the fact that under anaerobic conditions the transformation of cbs involves stepwise reductive dechlorination producing daughter products less chlorinated cbs and benzene that are themselves contaminants of concern scheme 1 thus the ultimate remediation goal must be to completely dechlorinate cbs and transform benzene to non toxic products e g co2 or ch4 edwards and grbić galić 1992 liang et al 2013 this presents a two fold problem to assess the degree to which the concentrations of daughter products such as mcb and benzene are contributing to the contaminant plume by production via biodegradation of their parent compounds and to assess whether they themselves are also undergoing biodegradation at the site the concentrations and δ13c signatures of these daughters will be the net result of simultaneous production and biodegradation and the relative rates of these processes this problem has been addressed by modelling approaches van breukelen et al 2005 höhener and atteia 2014 morrill et al 2006 mundle et al 2012 in particular as demonstrated by mundle et al 2012 for chlorinated ethenes the degradation of daughter products can be conclusively confirmed if its δ13c value becomes more enriched than the original δ13c value of its parent compound previous microcosm studies using material from various parts of this same site demonstrated the potential for biotransformation fung et al 2009 liang et al 2011 2013 2014 nelson et al 2011 2014 in the present study csia field data for benzene and the cbs including mcb 1 4 dcb 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb are used to investigate whether biodegradation is indeed occurring at this complex field site 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at a legacy industrial site in new jersey usa with a history of chemical production activities including dye manufacturing since the 1920s that led to the contamination of the groundwater and sediments with a variety of contaminants including cbs and benzene the site has multiple areas of concern with various contaminants of concern some of which have been discussed in recent publications gilevska et al 2019 2021 kurt et al 2012 passeport et al 2016 phillips et al 2020 the present work investigates a new area between a dye manufacturing complex in the north and a canal in the south fig 1 in particular whereas previous studies in this canal gilevska et al 2019 2021 passeport et al 2016 focused on the upper portion up to 80 cm deep from the sediment surface water interface of the canal sediments this work utilized data from sampling wells under the canal e g gw7 and gw8 that were installed at depths encompassing the bulk of the canal sediments sediment thickness up to 1 4 m see also fig 1 for relative depths of sampling wells the hydrogeology of the study area is discussed in detail elsewhere urs corporation 2010 2013 briefly the subsurface of the study area consists of five water bearing units i e aquifer a b c d and e hydraulically separated by four intervening lower permeable units i e a b b c c d and d e this study focuses on the b unit containing free dnapl lower b unit and residual dnapl upper b unit where significant concentrations of cbs up to 600 000 μg l for 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb and up to 38 000 μg l for mcb and 1 4 dcb and benzene up to 1300 μg l were found at the time of sampling table 1 1 3 dcb was not detected or present at much lower concentrations up to 100 μg l than the other dcbs i e 10 1000 fold lower consistent with the observation from other studies nelson et al 2014 qiao et al 2018a indicating that 1 3 dcb is a minor product of 1 2 4 tcb transformation scheme 1 due to the very low concentration and sparse isotope data for 1 3 dcb interpretation of its transformation in the groundwater is not possible for this site and was not included in the discussion the highest concentrations of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb were consistently found in gw2 and gw3 with 2012 concentrations in gw3 exceeding the solubility limits for 1 2 4 tcb 40 000 μg l and 1 2 dcb 150 000 μg l suggestive of the presence of these two compounds as dnapl in the vicinity of these wells fig 1 urs corporation 2013 the concentrations of 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb and the highest concentrations were not always associated with the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 the spatial distribution of these contaminants is discussed in more detail in section 3 besides regular dnapl removal in the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 since 2003 a sheet pile barrier spb red line in fig 1 was built in 2008 to provide a hydraulic barrier between the b unit and the canal preventing downgradient groundwater transport beyond the barrier before the spb installation the groundwater flow direction was north to south fig 1 and the canal was hydraulically connected to the b unit via the lower portion of the canal sidewall and the thin layer of sediments near the bank passeport et al 2016 gilevska et al 2019 2021 intermittent discharge of the b unit to the canal occurred based on variations in groundwater pressure and streamflow leading to cb accumulation in the surface water and sediments prior to spb installation after the spb installation the canal was no longer hydraulically connected to the b unit and groundwater flow is hydraulically controlled on site upgradient from the spb by a site wide

lollar et al 2007 3 results and discussion the concentration and δ13c data for the march 2009 sampling event for each compound are shown in fig 2 and the data for all the sampling periods are shown in

published studies bouchard et al 2008 höhener and atteia 2010 höhener and yu 2012 wanner and hunkeler 2019 xu et al 2016 and discussed in detail in the appendix si note 1 the concentration and δ13c data for each contaminant from all sampling dates were fitted using the rayleigh model eq 2 to test following the recommendations of the epa best practice guide hunkeler et al 2008 if biodegradation is the dominant process controlling concentration reductions fig 3 3 1 isotopic evidence for the biodegradation of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb among the contaminants present at the site 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb have the largest enrichment in their δ13c values with the largest enrichment associated with the lowest concentrations consistent with the effect of in situ biodegradation further the most depleted negative δ13c values and highest concentrations of 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb were measured in the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 figs 2a b and table 1 providing a reasonable estimate of the initial isotope composition of the contaminants following the recommended epa best practice approach after hunkeler et al 2008 over three sampling periods 2009 2015 no measurements taken in september 2009 samples of dnapl from gw2 and gw3 showed remarkably uniform δ13c values of 1 2 dcb mean 29 7 0 5 and 1 2 4 tcb mean 30 7 0 5 except for one measurement in 2012 where gw2 had more enriched 1 2 4 tcb 27 1 the total variation in δ13c values for both compounds in these two wells was less than analytical uncertainty relative to gw2 and gw3 the samples from other wells in this study displayed significant 13c enrichment for 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb table 1 fig 2 overall this pattern of concentration and δ13c values provides compelling evidence for in situ biodegradation based on the criteria recommended by the epa best practice guidance for csia enrichment 2 hunkeler et al 2008 1 2 dcb showed the largest degree of enrichment among all the compounds investigated relative to measured δ13c at gw2 and gw3 1 2 dcb was enriched by 8 9 at both gw7 and gw8 in samples from the march 2009 sampling period fig 2a other well locations with measured δ13c displayed 13c enrichment between 2 7 and 6 2 except for gw1 in 2012 where the concentration 130 000 μg l is high and δ13c value 30 4 is isotopically similar to gw2 and gw3 a quantitative test of the relationship between decreasing concentrations and 13c enrichment is provided by the rayleigh model results fig 3a shows 1 2 dcb data for all sampling dates demonstrating a good rayleigh correlation trend with r2 0 6 that is within the range r2 0 5 0 9 measured in field studies where biodegradation has been found to be a major factor contributing to the decrease in measured contaminant concentrations fischer et al 2009 griebler et al 2004b van keer et al 2012 morrill et al 2005 further the slope of the rayleigh correlation 0 9 is in fact within the uncertainty of the lab derived ɛ 0 8 0 1 liang et al 2014 while this is not always the case for field data when it occurs it provides a strong line of evidence that degradation is in fact the major processes controlling both changes in isotopes and in concentrations another compelling evidence that degradation is a significant process for this compound fewer wells had concentrations of 1 2 4 tcb above the detection limit for csia nonetheless all wells with 1 2 4 tcb above the detection limit for isotope analysis displayed 13c enrichments relative to the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 with 13c enrichment of up to 3 along with concentration decreases table 1 and fig 2b these enrichments also co vary with concentrations for all data except for one data point in gw2 measured in 2012 fig 3b at gw2 in 2012 the δ13c value of 1 2 4 tcb 27 1 was significantly more enriched than other measured δ13c values in either gw2 or gw3 for all other sampling periods mean 30 7 0 5 n 5 the exact reason behind the outlier in gw2 is unknown however it is possible that contamination or disturbance was introduced during regular dnapl removal which occurs at this location urs corporation 2013 it should be noted that while there is a regular dnapl removal occurring in wells gw2 and gw3 this outlier behavior was only observed in one of the six measurements table 1 as discussed above with the gw2 data point in 2012 excluded the remaining data shows a good rayleigh correlation r2 0 7 observed for 1 2 4 tcb that as for 1 2 dcb provides a strong line of evidence for the effects of in situ biodegradation the present work provides important isotopic evidence in support of biodegradation of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb in the field to date only one other csia study from a limited data set has documented enrichment of 1 2 4 tcb alberti et al 2017 and only two csia studies have done so for 1 2 dcb alberti et al 2017 stelzer et al 2009 in a field investigation table s1 here the isotopic evidence suggesting in situ biodegradation is supported by additional lines of evidence several laboratory degradation experiments using sediment microcosms and enrichment cultures from this site fung et al 2009 liang et al 2011 2013 2014 nelson et al 2011 2014 showed evidence of biodegradation potential for the microbial communities from this site specifically these laboratory studies demonstrated biodegradation of various cbs including 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb and reported the presence of indigenous microorganisms i e dehalobacter spp capable of reductive dechlorination fung et al 2009 liang et al 2013 nelson et al 2014 in addition several field studies passeport et al 2016 gilevska et al 2019 2021 carried out in sediments under the canal to a depth of up to 80 cm see also section 2 1 for detailed comparison of the sampling locations between the present study and previous work showed that at this point of discharge upwelling groundwaters no longer contained any detectable 1 2 4 tcb or dcbs consistent with biodegradation in the underlying units consistent with these previous findings the present study similarly observed extremely low concentrations or results that were below the detection limits and enriched δ13c values for 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb in wells under the canal gw6 gw8 fig 2a b and table 1 further supporting biodegradation of the highly chlorinated cbs having identified the occurrence of in situ degradation for 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb the eod for these compounds were estimated from the rayleigh model eqs 2 3 using ɛ values reported in previous laboratory studies under anaerobic conditions the ɛ values are 0 8 0 1 for 1 2 dcb liang et al 2014 and 3 0 0 4 liang et al 2011 and 3 2 0 5 griebler et al 2004a for 1 2 4 tcb the two available ɛ values for 1 2 4 tcb are within the uncertainty of each other and the calculated range of eods for this compound here are similar table 2 also consistent with the epa guidance the δ13co values for 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb used were the average δ13c values of the dnapl measured at this site gw2 and gw3 table 1 using these values ɛ and δ13co the ranges of eod estimates at the site are 21 73 for 1 2 4 tcb and 47 99 for 1 2 dcb table 2 although the eod estimates for 1 2 dcb in wells under the canal and lower b unit were very high up to 99 these values are consistent with the very large concentration decrease e g up to 99 in gw6 compared to gw3 in 2012 sampling observed in these locations as well as in previous studies at this site specifically the data that showed both tcb and dcb were mostly below the detection limit in the sediment pore water under the canal fed by groundwater discharging from unit b gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 while the impermeable sheet pile stops further movement from upgradient residual contaminants in the subsurface can typically take decades to be removed by dissolution alone the large decrease in concentrations accompanied by the observed fractionation in the case of 1 2 dcb in particular demonstrate that degradation is an important process in the recovery of this system this conclusion is consistent with investigations of microbial populations and activity in materials from this same site microcosm studies using sediments demonstrated potential for in situ biodegradation of 1 2 4 tcb dcb isomers and mcb liang et al 2011 2013 2014 nelson et al 2011 2014 despite previous findings that suggested lower cbs e g mcb are typically more recalcitrant towards anaerobic degradation than higher cbs field and sierra alvarez 2008 in addition these studies showed that the contaminated sediments from this site harbor various strains of dehalobacter spp a widely known organohalide respiring bacteria atashgahi et al 2016 that can biodegrade different cb congeners including mcb nelson et al 2011 2014 further amendment of these sediments with a methanogenic enrichment culture rapidly resulted in both mcb and benzene biodegradation liang et al 2013 nelson 2012 recent anaerobic microcosm studies from other sites e g qiao et al 2018b also demonstrated that some cb degraders can also degrade benzene thus anaerobic degradation of benzene and the more highly chlorinated parent cbs is plausible at this site 3 2 daughter product contaminants 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene identification of biodegradation using csia for 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene is not as straightforward as for 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb due to possible simultaneous production of these daughter products from 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb transformation scheme 1 the net observed fractionation will be the net effect of the relative rates of production from the more chlorinated parent compounds as well as their own subsequent biodegradation at many field sites it has been found that if biodegradation is a significant process controlling contamination concentration at a site and hence rates are high enough biodegradation can still be identified based on observed 13c enrichments but necessarily such daughter product data may not show a good fit to a rayleigh model reviewed by hunkeler et al 2008 kuntze et al 2020 here 1 4 dcb δ13c values do show significant 13c enrichment of up to 4 9 compared to the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 fig 2c but indeed the fit of the data to the rayleigh model is weaker for 1 4 dcb fig 3c than for 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb similarly a low r2 r2 0 2 for mcb and benzene were observed fig 3d e while both compounds show significant variation in δ13c up to 5 as is common for daughter products there is no clear correlation of the variation in δ13c with concentrations what is clear in both cases is that the range of observed δ13c values 24 4 to 29 6 for mcb and 19 7 to 25 1 for benzene can only be produced if biodegradation of both compounds is occurring fig 4 demonstrates this finding to illustrate the isotope evolution of benzene and other dechlorinating products from 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb degradation simulations were conducted using the analytical solutions for contaminant decay chains implemented by höhener and atteia 2014 fig 4 and fig s1 and using first order degradation rate constants 0 01 0 84 day 1 taken from previous studies for these compounds gilevska et al 2019 liang et al 2014 complete parameters used for the simulations including the enrichment factors used are provided in table s4 when biodegradation of a parent compound produces daughter products but there is no biodegradation of the final product the δ13c of the final dechlorination product in this hypothetical case benzene fig 4a b and for mcb fig s1a b can only become as enriched as the initial δ13c of the parent compound due to isotope mass balance constraints mundle et al 2012 in contrast if the dechlorination product e g benzene fig 4c d itself undergoes degradation the corresponding δ13c value ultimately becomes more enriched than δ13c of the parent as benzene is transformed to co2 and ch4 liang et al 2013 qiao et al 2018b in this study the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 have average δ13c values of 31 and 30 for the primary contaminants 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb respectively while the daughter products 1 4 dcb up to 27 9 mcb up to 24 4 and benzene up to 19 7 are all significantly more enriched this enrichment can only occur if the daughter compounds 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene are themselves being biodegraded fig 4c d scenario 2 as has been previously demonstrated for compounds such as ethene the final product of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes mundle et al 2012 further support for this interpretation is provided by the previous work on the upper 80 cm of the sediments under the canal as the highly enriched δ13c values measured for mcb and benzene fig 2 found in this study for the underlying aquifer are within the range of the enriched δ13c values measured at those biodegradation hot spot zones under the canal gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 taken together these lines of evidence support biodegradation of both mcb and benzene in addition to the parent compounds 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb at this site as benzene is itself a priority pollutant it is important to determine not only whether biodegradation leads to dechlorination but whether further biodegradation of benzene is occurring at this site previous studies have provided both microcosm nelson 2012 nelson et al 2011 nelson et al 2014 and isotopic data and modelling confirmation of the biodegradation of benzene gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 but this study provides the important definitive evidence of benzene transformation for the underlying aquifers 4 conclusion this study provides important isotopic evidence in support of in situ biodegradation of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb at a legacy contaminated site suggesting depending on well location between 47 and 99 degradation of 1 2 dcb and between 21 and 73 for 1 2 4 tcb furthermore this study presents a field based example that contrasts the trends in csia and concentration data between primary 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb and secondary daughter 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene contaminants belonging to the same degradation chain the strength of the rayleigh correlation along with the clarity of the spatial pattern i e csia and concentration data between dnapl containing and rest of the sampling wells gradually deteriorate as the contaminant moves farther down the degradation chain scheme 1 by establishing that the primary contaminants e g 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb are undergoing in situ degradation the poor or lack of rayleigh correlation observed for the daughter contaminants e g 1 4 dcb and mcb and benzene is not surprising and most likely due to the fact these daughter contaminants are undergoing degradation and production simultaneously for daughter contaminants where degradation is more complex due to simultaneous degradation and continued production due to degradation of parents the isotope evolution of the daughter products may also be used to help assess if degradation is taking place data from this study provide a strong line of evidence for biodegradation of daughter products based on all δ13c values for benzene 19 7 to 25 1 table 1 and mcb 24 4 to 29 6 table 1 at the site being significantly more enriched than the δ13c of the parent compounds a pattern only observed where such biodegradation of daughter products as well as parent compounds is significant future studies should also integrate numerical modelling approaches such as demonstrated here to better constrain the fate and transport of cbs and benzene as parts of a complex

specific isotope analysis csia has become a valuable tool in understanding the fate of organic contaminants at field sites however its application to chlorinated benzenes cbs a group of toxic and persistent groundwater contaminants has received less attention this study employed csia to investigate the occurrence of natural degradation of various cbs and benzene in a contaminated aquifer despite the complexity of the study area e g installation of a sheet pile barrier and the presence of a complex set of contaminants the substantial enrichments in δ13c values i e 2 for all cbs and benzene across the sampling wells indicate in situ degradation of these compounds in particular the 13c enrichments for 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dichlorobenzene 1 2 dcb display good correlations with decreasing groundwater concentrations consistent with the effects of in situ biodegradation using the rayleigh model the extent of degradation eod is estimated to be 47 99 for 1 2 dcb and 21 73 for 1 2 4 tcb the enrichments observed for the other cbs 1 4 dcb and chlorobenzene mcb and benzene at the site are also suggestive of in situ biodegradation due to simultaneous degradation and production of 1 4 dcb a major 1 2 4 tcb degradation product mcb from dcb degradation and benzene from mcb degradation the estimation of eod for these intermediate compounds is more complex but a modelling simulation supports in situ biodegradation of these daughter products in particular the fact that the δ13c values of mcb and benzene i e daughter products of 1 2 4 tcb are more enriched than the original δ13c value of their parent 1 2 4 tcb provides definitive evidence for the occurrence of in situ biodegradation of the mcb and benzene keywords carbon isotopes csia in situ degradation chlorinated benzenes benzene 1 introduction chlorinated benzenes cbs are a group of aromatic compounds containing a benzene ring substituted with up to six chlorine atoms e g chlorobenzene mcb 1 2 dichlorobenzene 1 2 dcb 1 4 dichlorobenzene 1 4 dcb and 1 2 4 trichlorobenzene 1 2 4 tcb cbs along with benzene are widely used chemical intermediates solvents and fuel components that can contaminate the subsurface through a history of improper storage waste disposal practices and accidental releases malcolm et al 2004 vogt et al 2011 cbs and benzene are also persistent and toxic e g benzene is carcinogenic iarc 2018 posing serious health and environmental concerns as such these compounds along with other contaminants are the focus of removal and remedial efforts worldwide e g superfund sites in the u s brusseau 2019 monitored natural attenuation mna is a remediation strategy that relies on non degradative e g volatilization dilution and sorption and degradative e g chemically and microbially mediated degradation processes for reducing concentrations brusseau 2019 magar et al 2009 among these natural attenuation processes degradation is the only process that leads to the actual destruction of the contaminant mass whereas non degradative processes preserve the mass either sequestered to an absorbent media diluted or as a different phase to determine if mna is the appropriate remediation approach the area under investigation should undergo regular monitoring and provide multiple lines of evidence that biodegradation is actively occurring and sustainable brusseau 2019 although cbs and benzene can be transformed aerobically field and sierra alvarez 2008 and references therein anaerobic transformation of these compounds is of particular interest because they are frequently released into anoxic environments or can lead to the deprivation of oxygen due to aerobic degradation process mercer and cohen 1990 to date a growing number of studies shows that cbs adrian and görisch 2002 alfán guzmán et al 2017 field and sierra alvarez 2008 liang et al 2011 2014 nelson et al 2014 qiao et al 2018b vandermeeren et al 2014 and benzene liang et al 2013 mancini et al 2008 toth et al 2021 can be transformed anaerobically based on microcosm studies using natural materials e g sediments and river sludge from contaminated sites despite this knowledge field studies demonstrating in situ degradation are limited especially for highly chlorinated cbs e g cbs with two or more cl atoms alberti et al 2017 qiao et al 2018b stelzer et al 2009 possibly because of their low solubility in water and typical low concentrations relative to detection limits i e on the order of 10 μg l e g alberti et al 2017 gilevska et al 2019 stelzer et al 2009 even at low concentrations these cbs still represent a threat to human health and the environment e g maximum contaminant levels for drinking water are set at 70 μg l for 1 2 4 tcb 600 μg l for 1 2 dcb 75 μg l for 1 4 dcb 100 μg l for mcb and 5 μg l for benzene us epa 2018 since contaminant mass concentration reductions can result from both non degradative and degradative processes measuring concentration decreases alone is not sufficient to confirm transformation and additional lines of evidence are required to identify the occurrence of processes responsible for contaminant attenuation and to quantify in situ degradation of chlorinated cbs qiao et al 2018b compound specific isotope analysis csia has become a widely used diagnostic tool in identifying degradation as outlined in the epa best practice guide hunkeler et al 2008 csia measures the isotope ratio r of the heavy he to light isotope le of an element e in the compound of interest i e rsample and is reported in δ notation i e multiplied by 1000 unit mur or relative to the international standard e g vienna pee dee belemnite vpdb for carbon as shown in eq 1 for carbon 1 δ 13 c r sample r vpdb r vpdb the underlying principle of csia is attributed to measuring the kinetic isotope effect kie which results from differences in the degradation rates of bonds with different isotope compositions elsner 2010 typically the reactive bonds of the molecules containing exclusively light isotopes of an element e g 12c have smaller activation energy and react at a slightly faster rate than the molecules with at least one heavy isotope e g 13c as a result of the kie the remaining unreacted contaminant becomes more enriched in the heavier isotopes i e 13c enrichment during degradation and the corresponding δ13c value of the remaining contaminant can therefore indicate the occurrence of degradation in contrast to the often large carbon isotopic fractionation observed during biotransformation the isotope fractionation produced by physical processes aqueous diffusion dissolution sorption mass transport or phase change volatilization under many circumstances e g bouchard et al 2008 dempster et al 1997 harrington et al 1999 höhener and yu 2012 imfeld et al 2014 slater et al 1999 2000 wanner and hunkeler 2019 xu et al 2016 has been found to be smaller or insignificant relative to the analytical uncertainty which is 0 5 for carbon hunkeler et al 2008 sherwood lollar et al 2007 for many hydrocarbon contaminants the relationship between the amount of contaminant remaining and the isotope signature has been shown to fit a rayleigh model hunkeler et al 2008 and references therein eq 2 2 ln 1000 δ 13 c 1000 δ 13 c o ε c 1000 ln f where δ13co is the initial isotopic composition of the contaminant δ13c is the isotopic composition at a given time or location f is the fraction of the original contaminant remaining i e f c co where c is the concentration at any point in time and space and co is the initial or source concentration and ɛ i e isotope enrichment factor is the magnitude of fractionation for a given process determined in controlled laboratory experiments previously reported by liang et al 2011 2014 mancini et al 2003 griebler et al 2004a for cbs and benzene often ɛ is reaction specific and reproducible for a given reaction thus using the appropriate laboratory derived ɛ and solving for f in eq 2 the extent of degradation eod can be estimated using eq 3 3 eod 1 f while laboratory studies have shown that anaerobic degradation of benzene and cbs with three or less chlorine atoms display significant carbon isotopic fractionation griebler et al 2004a liang et al 2011 2014 mancini et al 2003 2008 the field application of csia for these contaminants remains limited table s1 particularly for the investigation of dcb alberti et al 2017 stelzer et al 2009 and tcb alberti et al 2017 for dcb alberti et al 2017 observed concentration decreases concomitant with 13c enrichment consistent with in situ degradation while stelzer et al 2009 could not make a straightforward assessment of dcb degradation because δ13c values did not systematically correlate with concentration decreases at their study site for tcb the only available field study to date alberti et al 2017 has very limited data in support of tcb degradation because 13c enrichment was only observed in one well location therefore field sites with cbs concentrations above detection limits such as the present work are an opportunity to apply csia and evaluate isotopic evidence for the occurrence of anaerobic transformation of this important group of priority pollutants another motivation to investigate the degradation of cbs is the fact that under anaerobic conditions the transformation of cbs involves stepwise reductive dechlorination producing daughter products less chlorinated cbs and benzene that are themselves contaminants of concern scheme 1 thus the ultimate remediation goal must be to completely dechlorinate cbs and transform benzene to non toxic products e g co2 or ch4 edwards and grbić galić 1992 liang et al 2013 this presents a two fold problem to assess the degree to which the concentrations of daughter products such as mcb and benzene are contributing to the contaminant plume by production via biodegradation of their parent compounds and to assess whether they themselves are also undergoing biodegradation at the site the concentrations and δ13c signatures of these daughters will be the net result of simultaneous production and biodegradation and the relative rates of these processes this problem has been addressed by modelling approaches van breukelen et al 2005 höhener and atteia 2014 morrill et al 2006 mundle et al 2012 in particular as demonstrated by mundle et al 2012 for chlorinated ethenes the degradation of daughter products can be conclusively confirmed if its δ13c value becomes more enriched than the original δ13c value of its parent compound previous microcosm studies using material from various parts of this same site demonstrated the potential for biotransformation fung et al 2009 liang et al 2011 2013 2014 nelson et al 2011 2014 in the present study csia field data for benzene and the cbs including mcb 1 4 dcb 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb are used to investigate whether biodegradation is indeed occurring at this complex field site 2 materials and methods 2 1 study site this study was conducted at a legacy industrial site in new jersey usa with a history of chemical production activities including dye manufacturing since the 1920s that led to the contamination of the groundwater and sediments with a variety of contaminants including cbs and benzene the site has multiple areas of concern with various contaminants of concern some of which have been discussed in recent publications gilevska et al 2019 2021 kurt et al 2012 passeport et al 2016 phillips et al 2020 the present work investigates a new area between a dye manufacturing complex in the north and a canal in the south fig 1 in particular whereas previous studies in this canal gilevska et al 2019 2021 passeport et al 2016 focused on the upper portion up to 80 cm deep from the sediment surface water interface of the canal sediments this work utilized data from sampling wells under the canal e g gw7 and gw8 that were installed at depths encompassing the bulk of the canal sediments sediment thickness up to 1 4 m see also fig 1 for relative depths of sampling wells the hydrogeology of the study area is discussed in detail elsewhere urs corporation 2010 2013 briefly the subsurface of the study area consists of five water bearing units i e aquifer a b c d and e hydraulically separated by four intervening lower permeable units i e a b b c c d and d e this study focuses on the b unit containing free dnapl lower b unit and residual dnapl upper b unit where significant concentrations of cbs up to 600 000 μg l for 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb and up to 38 000 μg l for mcb and 1 4 dcb and benzene up to 1300 μg l were found at the time of sampling table 1 1 3 dcb was not detected or present at much lower concentrations up to 100 μg l than the other dcbs i e 10 1000 fold lower consistent with the observation from other studies nelson et al 2014 qiao et al 2018a indicating that 1 3 dcb is a minor product of 1 2 4 tcb transformation scheme 1 due to the very low concentration and sparse isotope data for 1 3 dcb interpretation of its transformation in the groundwater is not possible for this site and was not included in the discussion the highest concentrations of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb were consistently found in gw2 and gw3 with 2012 concentrations in gw3 exceeding the solubility limits for 1 2 4 tcb 40 000 μg l and 1 2 dcb 150 000 μg l suggestive of the presence of these two compounds as dnapl in the vicinity of these wells fig 1 urs corporation 2013 the concentrations of 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene are at least one order of magnitude lower than those of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb and the highest concentrations were not always associated with the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 the spatial distribution of these contaminants is discussed in more detail in section 3 besides regular dnapl removal in the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 since 2003 a sheet pile barrier spb red line in fig 1 was built in 2008 to provide a hydraulic barrier between the b unit and the canal preventing downgradient groundwater transport beyond the barrier before the spb installation the groundwater flow direction was north to south fig 1 and the canal was hydraulically connected to the b unit via the lower portion of the canal sidewall and the thin layer of sediments near the bank passeport et al 2016 gilevska et al 2019 2021 intermittent discharge of the b unit to the canal occurred based on variations in groundwater pressure and streamflow leading to cb accumulation in the surface water and sediments prior to spb installation after the spb installation the canal was no longer hydraulically connected to the b unit and groundwater flow is hydraulically controlled on site upgradient from the spb by a site wide

measurements were collected in 40 ml volatile organic analysis voa epa bottles with septum caps after the epa s best practice guidance hunkeler et al 2008 the concentrations of the cbs and benzene

lollar et al 2007 3 results and discussion the concentration and δ13c data for the march 2009 sampling event for each compound are shown in fig 2 and the data for all the sampling periods are shown in

published studies bouchard et al 2008 höhener and atteia 2010 höhener and yu 2012 wanner and hunkeler 2019 xu et al 2016 and discussed in detail in the appendix si note 1 the concentration and δ13c data for each contaminant from all sampling dates were fitted using the rayleigh model eq 2 to test following the recommendations of the epa best practice guide hunkeler et al 2008 if biodegradation is the dominant process controlling concentration reductions fig 3 3 1 isotopic evidence for the biodegradation of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb among the contaminants present at the site 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb have the largest enrichment in their δ13c values with the largest enrichment associated with the lowest concentrations consistent with the effect of in situ biodegradation further the most depleted negative δ13c values and highest concentrations of 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb were measured in the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 figs 2a b and table 1 providing a reasonable estimate of the initial isotope composition of the contaminants following the recommended epa best practice approach after hunkeler et al 2008 over three sampling periods 2009 2015 no measurements taken in september 2009 samples of dnapl from gw2 and gw3 showed remarkably uniform δ13c values of 1 2 dcb mean 29 7 0 5 and 1 2 4 tcb mean 30 7 0 5 except for one measurement in 2012 where gw2 had more enriched 1 2 4 tcb 27 1 the total variation in δ13c values for both compounds in these two wells was less than analytical uncertainty relative to gw2 and gw3 the samples from other wells in this study displayed significant 13c enrichment for 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb table 1 fig 2 overall this pattern of concentration and δ13c values provides compelling evidence for in situ biodegradation based on the criteria recommended by the epa best practice guidance for csia enrichment 2 hunkeler et al 2008 1 2 dcb showed the largest degree of enrichment among all the compounds investigated relative to measured δ13c at gw2 and gw3 1 2 dcb was enriched by 8 9 at both gw7 and gw8 in samples from the march 2009 sampling period fig 2a other well locations with measured δ13c displayed 13c enrichment between 2 7 and 6 2 except for gw1 in 2012 where the concentration 130 000 μg l is high and δ13c value 30 4 is isotopically similar to gw2 and gw3 a quantitative test of the relationship between decreasing concentrations and 13c enrichment is provided by the rayleigh model results fig 3a shows 1 2 dcb data for all sampling dates demonstrating a good rayleigh correlation trend with r2 0 6 that is within the range r2 0 5 0 9 measured in field studies where biodegradation has been found to be a major factor contributing to the decrease in measured contaminant concentrations fischer et al 2009 griebler et al 2004b van keer et al 2012 morrill et al 2005 further the slope of the rayleigh correlation 0 9 is in fact within the uncertainty of the lab derived ɛ 0 8 0 1 liang et al 2014 while this is not always the case for field data when it occurs it provides a strong line of evidence that degradation is in fact the major processes controlling both changes in isotopes and in concentrations another compelling evidence that degradation is a significant process for this compound fewer wells had concentrations of 1 2 4 tcb above the detection limit for csia nonetheless all wells with 1 2 4 tcb above the detection limit for isotope analysis displayed 13c enrichments relative to the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 with 13c enrichment of up to 3 along with concentration decreases table 1 and fig 2b these enrichments also co vary with concentrations for all data except for one data point in gw2 measured in 2012 fig 3b at gw2 in 2012 the δ13c value of 1 2 4 tcb 27 1 was significantly more enriched than other measured δ13c values in either gw2 or gw3 for all other sampling periods mean 30 7 0 5 n 5 the exact reason behind the outlier in gw2 is unknown however it is possible that contamination or disturbance was introduced during regular dnapl removal which occurs at this location urs corporation 2013 it should be noted that while there is a regular dnapl removal occurring in wells gw2 and gw3 this outlier behavior was only observed in one of the six measurements table 1 as discussed above with the gw2 data point in 2012 excluded the remaining data shows a good rayleigh correlation r2 0 7 observed for 1 2 4 tcb that as for 1 2 dcb provides a strong line of evidence for the effects of in situ biodegradation the present work provides important isotopic evidence in support of biodegradation of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb in the field to date only one other csia study from a limited data set has documented enrichment of 1 2 4 tcb alberti et al 2017 and only two csia studies have done so for 1 2 dcb alberti et al 2017 stelzer et al 2009 in a field investigation table s1 here the isotopic evidence suggesting in situ biodegradation is supported by additional lines of evidence several laboratory degradation experiments using sediment microcosms and enrichment cultures from this site fung et al 2009 liang et al 2011 2013 2014 nelson et al 2011 2014 showed evidence of biodegradation potential for the microbial communities from this site specifically these laboratory studies demonstrated biodegradation of various cbs including 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb and reported the presence of indigenous microorganisms i e dehalobacter spp capable of reductive dechlorination fung et al 2009 liang et al 2013 nelson et al 2014 in addition several field studies passeport et al 2016 gilevska et al 2019 2021 carried out in sediments under the canal to a depth of up to 80 cm see also section 2 1 for detailed comparison of the sampling locations between the present study and previous work showed that at this point of discharge upwelling groundwaters no longer contained any detectable 1 2 4 tcb or dcbs consistent with biodegradation in the underlying units consistent with these previous findings the present study similarly observed extremely low concentrations or results that were below the detection limits and enriched δ13c values for 1 2 dcb and 1 2 4 tcb in wells under the canal gw6 gw8 fig 2a b and table 1 further supporting biodegradation of the highly chlorinated cbs having identified the occurrence of in situ degradation for 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb the eod for these compounds were estimated from the rayleigh model eqs 2 3 using ɛ values reported in previous laboratory studies under anaerobic conditions the ɛ values are 0 8 0 1 for 1 2 dcb liang et al 2014 and 3 0 0 4 liang et al 2011 and 3 2 0 5 griebler et al 2004a for 1 2 4 tcb the two available ɛ values for 1 2 4 tcb are within the uncertainty of each other and the calculated range of eods for this compound here are similar table 2 also consistent with the epa guidance the δ13co values for 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb used were the average δ13c values of the dnapl measured at this site gw2 and gw3 table 1 using these values ɛ and δ13co the ranges of eod estimates at the site are 21 73 for 1 2 4 tcb and 47 99 for 1 2 dcb table 2 although the eod estimates for 1 2 dcb in wells under the canal and lower b unit were very high up to 99 these values are consistent with the very large concentration decrease e g up to 99 in gw6 compared to gw3 in 2012 sampling observed in these locations as well as in previous studies at this site specifically the data that showed both tcb and dcb were mostly below the detection limit in the sediment pore water under the canal fed by groundwater discharging from unit b gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 while the impermeable sheet pile stops further movement from upgradient residual contaminants in the subsurface can typically take decades to be removed by dissolution alone the large decrease in concentrations accompanied by the observed fractionation in the case of 1 2 dcb in particular demonstrate that degradation is an important process in the recovery of this system this conclusion is consistent with investigations of microbial populations and activity in materials from this same site microcosm studies using sediments demonstrated potential for in situ biodegradation of 1 2 4 tcb dcb isomers and mcb liang et al 2011 2013 2014 nelson et al 2011 2014 despite previous findings that suggested lower cbs e g mcb are typically more recalcitrant towards anaerobic degradation than higher cbs field and sierra alvarez 2008 in addition these studies showed that the contaminated sediments from this site harbor various strains of dehalobacter spp a widely known organohalide respiring bacteria atashgahi et al 2016 that can biodegrade different cb congeners including mcb nelson et al 2011 2014 further amendment of these sediments with a methanogenic enrichment culture rapidly resulted in both mcb and benzene biodegradation liang et al 2013 nelson 2012 recent anaerobic microcosm studies from other sites e g qiao et al 2018b also demonstrated that some cb degraders can also degrade benzene thus anaerobic degradation of benzene and the more highly chlorinated parent cbs is plausible at this site 3 2 daughter product contaminants 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene identification of biodegradation using csia for 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene is not as straightforward as for 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb due to possible simultaneous production of these daughter products from 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb transformation scheme 1 the net observed fractionation will be the net effect of the relative rates of production from the more chlorinated parent compounds as well as their own subsequent biodegradation at many field sites it has been found that if biodegradation is a significant process controlling contamination concentration at a site and hence rates are high enough biodegradation can still be identified based on observed 13c enrichments but necessarily such daughter product data may not show a good fit to a rayleigh model reviewed by hunkeler et al 2008 kuntze et al 2020 here 1 4 dcb δ13c values do show significant 13c enrichment of up to 4 9 compared to the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 fig 2c but indeed the fit of the data to the rayleigh model is weaker for 1 4 dcb fig 3c than for 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb similarly a low r2 r2 0 2 for mcb and benzene were observed fig 3d e while both compounds show significant variation in δ13c up to 5 as is common for daughter products there is no clear correlation of the variation in δ13c with concentrations what is clear in both cases is that the range of observed δ13c values 24 4 to 29 6 for mcb and 19 7 to 25 1 for benzene can only be produced if biodegradation of both compounds is occurring fig 4 demonstrates this finding to illustrate the isotope evolution of benzene and other dechlorinating products from 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb degradation simulations were conducted using the analytical solutions for contaminant decay chains implemented by höhener and atteia 2014 fig 4 and fig s1 and using first order degradation rate constants 0 01 0 84 day 1 taken from previous studies for these compounds gilevska et al 2019 liang et al 2014 complete parameters used for the simulations including the enrichment factors used are provided in table s4 when biodegradation of a parent compound produces daughter products but there is no biodegradation of the final product the δ13c of the final dechlorination product in this hypothetical case benzene fig 4a b and for mcb fig s1a b can only become as enriched as the initial δ13c of the parent compound due to isotope mass balance constraints mundle et al 2012 in contrast if the dechlorination product e g benzene fig 4c d itself undergoes degradation the corresponding δ13c value ultimately becomes more enriched than δ13c of the parent as benzene is transformed to co2 and ch4 liang et al 2013 qiao et al 2018b in this study the dnapl containing wells gw2 and gw3 have average δ13c values of 31 and 30 for the primary contaminants 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb respectively while the daughter products 1 4 dcb up to 27 9 mcb up to 24 4 and benzene up to 19 7 are all significantly more enriched this enrichment can only occur if the daughter compounds 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene are themselves being biodegraded fig 4c d scenario 2 as has been previously demonstrated for compounds such as ethene the final product of reductive dechlorination of chlorinated ethenes mundle et al 2012 further support for this interpretation is provided by the previous work on the upper 80 cm of the sediments under the canal as the highly enriched δ13c values measured for mcb and benzene fig 2 found in this study for the underlying aquifer are within the range of the enriched δ13c values measured at those biodegradation hot spot zones under the canal gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 taken together these lines of evidence support biodegradation of both mcb and benzene in addition to the parent compounds 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb at this site as benzene is itself a priority pollutant it is important to determine not only whether biodegradation leads to dechlorination but whether further biodegradation of benzene is occurring at this site previous studies have provided both microcosm nelson 2012 nelson et al 2011 nelson et al 2014 and isotopic data and modelling confirmation of the biodegradation of benzene gilevska et al 2019 passeport et al 2016 but this study provides the important definitive evidence of benzene transformation for the underlying aquifers 4 conclusion this study provides important isotopic evidence in support of in situ biodegradation of 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb at a legacy contaminated site suggesting depending on well location between 47 and 99 degradation of 1 2 dcb and between 21 and 73 for 1 2 4 tcb furthermore this study presents a field based example that contrasts the trends in csia and concentration data between primary 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb and secondary daughter 1 4 dcb mcb and benzene contaminants belonging to the same degradation chain the strength of the rayleigh correlation along with the clarity of the spatial pattern i e csia and concentration data between dnapl containing and rest of the sampling wells gradually deteriorate as the contaminant moves farther down the degradation chain scheme 1 by establishing that the primary contaminants e g 1 2 4 tcb and 1 2 dcb are undergoing in situ degradation the poor or lack of rayleigh correlation observed for the daughter contaminants e g 1 4 dcb and mcb and benzene is not surprising and most likely due to the fact these daughter contaminants are undergoing degradation and production simultaneously for daughter contaminants where degradation is more complex due to simultaneous degradation and continued production due to degradation of parents the isotope evolution of the daughter products may also be used to help assess if degradation is taking place data from this study provide a strong line of evidence for biodegradation of daughter products based on all δ13c values for benzene 19 7 to 25 1 table 1 and mcb 24 4 to 29 6 table 1 at the site being significantly more enriched than the δ13c of the parent compounds a pattern only observed where such biodegradation of daughter products as well as parent compounds is significant future studies should also integrate numerical modelling approaches such as demonstrated here to better constrain the fate and transport of cbs and benzene as parts of a complex

1 introduction still there are numerous challenges related to water quality scarcity and more scientific efforts are needed sharma et al 2022 adsorption of numerous contaminants onto nanoparticles fatima et al 2021 abdelghany et al 2021 kumar et al 2013 and nanocomposites siddiqui and chaudhry 2019 sharma et al 2021 has been investigated since its successful preparation by novoselov and his coworkers novoselov et al 2004 graphene has been a rising star in material science field due to its high young s modulus high carrier mobility excellent optical property and large surface area it is also considered as an ideal material for energy storage and conversion due to its particular structure and excellent properties liu et al 2022 graphene was investigated for harvesting solar energy with the aid of photovoltaic cells and solar thermal collectors as well as in capacitive deionization alami 2021 the high production cost and complex preparation methods limit the applications and large scale production of graphene another defect in the preparation of graphene by conventional methods is the use of some chemicals that are corrosive and toxic these methods result in the generation of hazardous waste and poisonous gaseous emissions recently researchers adopted approaches that focus on the direct liquid exfoliation of graphite powder through several hours of mild sonication to produce defect free monolayer graphene the full liquid exfoliation of graphite is using different solvents namely 1 3 dimethyl 2 imidazolidinone dmeu n methylpyrrolidone nmp n n dimethylacetamide dma and γ butyrolactone gbl hernandez et al 2008 the main drawbacks of using these solvents are their high boiling points high cost toxicity as well as their negative impacts on human and environment to overcome these drawbacks chia et al chia et al 2014 recently used cheap and nontoxic aqueous ethanol solutions to exfoliate graphite in order to produce high quality graphene layers via mild sonication treatments in recent years graphene based composites have attracted a great deal of research interest in energy storage cheng et al 2022 photocatalysis sajna et al 2022 photoelectrical wang et al 2020 due to their good mechanical electrical thermal and optical properties yang et al 2014 in most cases of preparation of graphene semiconductor composites researchers have first to purchase or prepare graphene oxide go cheng et al 2022 this will be expensive or dangerous as previously mentioned coupling graphene with titanate nanostructures enable the formed composite to be used in many vital application such as biosensors photocatalysis and adsorption but unfortunately in most cases highly sensitive reactive and expensive titanium salts such as butoxide or isopropoxide etc is used in the preparation process which in turn convert into tio2 or titanate over the graphene layers herein this work demonstrates that graphene tio2 nanocomposites can be prepared from low cost graphite and tio2 powder without using sophisticated techniques or harmful chemicals and it involves implementation of two simple techniques sonochemical and hydrothermal obviously it is of highly importance to study the removal of organic pollutants whose negative impacts on human and environment have been widely recorded choudhry et al 2021 methylene blue adsorption onto the surface of graphene titanate nanocomposite was reported to elucidate the adsorption mechanism and to enable the applications of these materials in contaminants removal numerous previous studies of titanate composites focused on applications of these composites in photocatalytic destruction of pollutants and little attention were paid to identifying adsorption characteristic of graphene titanate nanocomposites toward adsorption of organics the adsorption of mb dye by graphene titanate nanocomposites is very scarce as listed in table 1 cheng et al 2022 sajna et al 2022 wang et al 2020 yang et al 2014 choudhry et al 2021 our present work studied synthesis of graphene titanate nanocomposite in low cost approach still the usage of solvent in the preparation of numerous nanocomposites including graphene titanate nanocomposite is the main challenge however future work should focus in general on green synthesis of nanomaterials the second part of this manuscript is investigated the adsorption characteristics of this graphene titanate nanocomposite toward methylene blue mb as a model dye fig 1 in single contaminant system for the first time finally the experimental data of the adsorption process were used to fit thermodynamic models including langmuir and freundlich models and several kinetic models the model parameters were also determined from the data correlations 2 materials and methods 2 1 composite preparation all the reactants and the solvents are of analytical grade and were used without further purification as in our previously published method farghali et al 2016 but with little modification where 10 g of pure anatase phase tio2 powder was mixed with 500 ml of 10 n naoh aqueous solution under constant stirring for about 30 min where a milky white solution was appeared on the other hand 1 g of graphite was dispersed in 100 ml 40 ethanol aqueous solution and subjected to sonication by ultrasonic with probe 20 khz pulsed mode 9 9 s on and 3 s off for 30 min then both solutions of titanate and exfoliated graphite were mixed together and sonicated for additional 30 min after that this mixture was transferred to a teflon lined stainless steel autoclave with 1000 ml capacity and heat treated at 160 c for 23 h the autoclave chamber was air cooled to room temperature after the reaction the formed precipitates were recovered and washed several times with distilled water and were finally dried at 80 c for 2 h the obtained composite was treated with concentrated hydrochloric acid to dissolve most of titanate nanotubes to study the type of interaction between graphene and titanate and to modify the ratio of graphene to titanate when needed scheme 1 2 2 characterization the morphology and microstructure of all samples were characterized by field emission scanning electron microscope fesem quanta feg 250 and high resolution transmission electron microscope hrtem jeol jem 2100 the chemical bond vibrations of samples were examined using bruker vertex 70 ftir ft raman germany spectrophotometry serial number 1341 in the range of 400 4000 cm 1 thermal stability of the materials before and after mb adsorption were also determined using labsys evo setaram kep technologies france thermogravimetric analyzer in the temperature range 26 800 c at a heating rate of 10 c min using dry nitrogen purge at a flow rate of 50 ml min 2 3 adsorption of mb from contaminated solutions all chemicals used are analytical reagents and used without further purification the adsorption of mb was studied using batch operation at 25 0 5 c the isothermal adsorption experiments were conducted by mixing the graphene titanate nanocomposite and 10 100 mg l mb aqueous solution the prepared samples were shaken at speed of 200 rpm at 25 0 5 c for 24 h using an orbital shaker then the solid liquid phases were separated by centrifugation the concentration of the remaining mb after adsorption was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu the effect of contact time on the adsorption experiments was also investigated using 0 10 g of the sorbent graphene titanate nanocomposite in flasks that contained 50 ml of mb solution 10 mg l at ph 7 the percentage of mb that adsorbed onto the graphene titanate nanocomposite q is determined by the following equation 1 q c o c t c o x 100 where c o mg mb l and c t mg mb l represent the concentrations of mb at initial and after adsorption at time t min respectively the amount of adsorption at equilibrium q e mg mb g adsorbent was determined by using eq 2 2 q e v c o c e w where c e mg mb l is the equilibrium concentration of mb v l is the volume of aqueous mb solution and w g is the sorbent mass 2 4 adsorption isotherm freundlich and langmuir equations are the commonly used models to explain the adsorption isotherm the langmuir model represents the formation of a monolayer adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent quantitatively at the end of the adsorption process the model also describes the distribution of the adsorbate between the liquid and solid phases after reaching equilibrium state the langmuir equation of adsorption isotherm assumes that all the sorption sites are energetically identical with a finite number and result in monolayer adsorption onto a surface and given by eq 3 as follows 3 c e q e 1 q o k l 1 q o c e this model contains two parameters q o and k l which are the adsorption capacity and the rate of adsorption respectively as plotting c e q e against c e a straight line with a slope of 1 q o and intercept of 1 q o k l is obtained if the adsorption behavior follows the langmuir equation and thus the langmuir constants k l and q o can be calculated from this data correlation there is another important parameter r l which is called the separation factor or the equilibrium parameter can be determined from eq 4 hall et al 1966 4 r l 1 1 k l c o where k l l mg is the langmuir constant and c o mg l is the highest mb concentration i e initial concentration of mb the value of r l indicates whether the type of the isotherm is either unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 favorable 0 r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 table 2 reports the calculated results by using the langmuir model the value of r l for the mb adsorption onto the graphene titanate nanocomposite were found to be less than one and greater than zero r l 0 05 revealing that the adsorption is favorable on the other hand the freundlich equilibrium isotherm equation is used for describing the multilayer adsorption of pollutants sepehr et al 2016 the linear form of freundlich adsorption isotherm takes the following form 5 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where k f is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and n indicates favorability of the adsorption process the values of these two parameters k f and n can be determined from the linear regression of ln q e against ln c e the slope of eq 5 is 1 n and its value is in the range of 0 to 1 2 5 reusability evaluation to evaluate the recyclability of the sorbent two cycles were occurred after the adsorption process the mixture solution was still for 1 h allowing the spent composite to settle by gravity then about 95 of the supernatant was discarded and the exhausted sorbent was washed many times with distilled water then dried at 80 c the product was subjected to the adsorption again 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the developed materials fig 2 shows the raman spectra of the obtained graphene graphene titanate composite before and after acid treatment the characteristic raman lines of titanate appeared at 278 435 665 and 893 cm 1 respectively which confirm the successful growth of titanate nanotubes on the graphene sheets these three characteristic graphitic bands d g and 2d 1345 1570 and 2700 cm 1 respectively are also shown in fig 2 it is clear that after the sonication in 40 ethanol aqueous solution the common d band intensity increased which confirmed the successful exfoliation of graphite chia et al 2014 similar profile of raman spectrum was reported in literature perera et al 2012 pan et al 2013 but they prepared graphene from graphene oxide fig 2 also confirms the successful growth of titanate nanotubes on the graphene sheets where the characteristic peaks of titanate and graphene were observed at 278 435 665 and 893 cm 1 and 1345 1570 and 2700 cm 1 respectively the fesem and hrtem images of graphene titanate nanocomposite are shown in fig 3a and b respectively it is clear from these two figures that the titanate nanotubes randomly grown on the graphene sheets in crumbled and re stacked sheet on sheet structure resulting in difficulty in distinguish between titanate and graphene layers as well as their size and thickness edx spectrum fig 3c confirmed the presence of dominant ti and o species together with less amount of c n and na little nanotubes remain on the surface of graphene and also can be observed above and in between layers of graphene as shown in fig 3b from the ft ir spectra as shown in fig 4 the peaks at 1064 and 1640 cm 1 indicate the vibration of co and co respectively which ensure functionalization of graphene nanoplatelets with oxygen groups the same absorption peaks present in ir spectrum of graphene oxide sheet li et al 2008 these peaks indicate covalent bond between tio2 and graphene through carbon oxygen titanium bond which improves electron transfer from conduction band of tio2 to fermi level of graphene that acts as electron sink pan et al 2013 the broad peak between 3000 and 3700 cm 1 as shown in each ir spectrum indicates the stretching vibration of hydroxyl group which presents at surface of three samples liu et al 2015a both titanate and graphene titanate composite show absorption bands between 400 and 700 cm 1 that represent tio and ti o ti bridging vibration and ensures composite formation liu et al 2015a 4 adsorption studies 4 1 effect of ph the solution ph plays an important factor in the adsorption process the results showed that the adsorption capacity of the composite toward mb is high along the whole ph range and the adsorption capability of graphene titanate for mb is slightly increased with the increase in solution ph fig 5a because mb is a cationic dye and surface of the composite is negatively charged over wide range of ph fig 5b therefore mb was strongly adsorbed on the composite according to the negative charges on the sorbent surface which gradually increase as ph increasing fig 5b the electrical attraction between the composite and the mb dye increase 4 2 adsorption isotherms the initial concentration effect has been performed with 50 ml of mb dye solutions 10 100 mg l with adsorbent 0 1 g the results are shown in fig 6 indicating that increasing the initial concentration of mb increases the adsorption amount of mb on the adsorbent from 4 30 mg g to 34 05 mg g this trend associated with the electrostatic attraction and related to a cation exchange mechanism which has been previously reported for the adsorption of cationic dyes on titanate nanotubes hsieh et al 2008 lee et al 2008a lee et al 2008b lin et al 2010 harsha et al 2011 which cause increasing the percentage of removal the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was calculated from eq 2 where c e is the mb concentration as the adsorption reaches to equilibrium the range of the experimental initial concentrations of mb is from 10 to 100 mg l fig 7 a b and c shows the adsorption isotherms of mb onto graphene titanate nanocomposite as seen from these graphs the equilibrium uptake increases with the increase of mb concentration as a result of the increase in the driving force from the concentration gradient table 2 lists the correlated results of the freundlich model which shows that the square of coefficient of correlation r 2 is as high as 0 996 for the freundlich model compared to that for langmuir it appears that the adsorption behavior of the investigated system is satisfactorily represented by the freundlich model more than langmuir 4 3 kinetic study the effect of contact time on mb adsorption onto the composite was studied with c o 10 mg l fig 8 shows the change in the amount of the adsorbed mb at different absorption time it can be seen that a fast adsorption of mb occurs by the graphene titanate nanocomposite at the initial stage reaching about 56 of equilibrium value after 10 min adsorption and adsorption equilibrium state was attained around t 30 min in the present study the experimental kinetics data of mb adsorption were evaluated with five kinetic models namely the pseudo first order model the pseudo second order model and the intraparticle diffusion model the definition of each model and its correlated results are reported in table 3 see table 4 table 3 shows that the pseudo second order model has the highest r 2 value 0 999 than those of the other two models in addition the q e cal values that were determined from the pseudo first order model and the pseudo second order model match the experimental values q e exp in other words the pseudo second order model can be employed to describe the adsorption process of this study the adsorption of mb onto the adsorbent is controlled by the intraparticle mass transport rate or the liquid phase mass transport rate the rate constant k 1 of the pseudo first order kinetics can be determined practically from the slope of linear figure of ln q e q t against t fig 9a the determined values k 1 and q e are presented in table 3 and the rate constant k 2 of the pseudo second order g mg min and q e mg g which can be practically estimated from the intercept fig 9b and the slope of t q t vs t plot are also given in table 3 where k 1 is the rate constant of the pseudo first order k 2 is the pseudo second order model model k 3 is the rate constant of the intraparticle diffusion model and c is a constant value the results clearly reveal that the pseudo second order kinetic model match quite well with the experimental results r 2 square of correlation coefficient is closer to unity the initial adsorption rate is defined by h k 2 q e 2 mg g min which is reported in table 3 the validity of the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetic models for favored adsorption of mb was also estimated by sse the sum of error squares analysis which was calculated from the following equation 6 sse qexp qcal 2 n where n is the number of data points as shown in table 3 the second order kinetic model has lower value of sse 0 02 with r 2 0 999 this model is better than the first order kinetic model for the adsorption process also the kinetics experimental data were interpreted according to the intraparticle diffusion model table 3 to clarify the diffusion mechanism as shown in fig 9c the experiments proved that by changing the contact time from 0 min to 180 min the removal of mb was more rapidly at the early stage this is due to the presence of high driving force over more vacant sites on the graphene titanate nanocomposite surface and rapid transfer of mb to adsorbent surface fig 10 the previous studies displayed the kinetics process of the pollutants removal that explicate by using nonlinear pseudo first order gürses et al 2006 second order lagergren 1898 avrami rudzinski and plazinski 2008 and intraparticle diffusion kinetic ho et al 2000 models the studying of the adsorption equilibrium isotherm is very important to explain how the molecules of adsorbate spread between the liquid and the solid phases thus kinetics study is an important for the design of adsorbents also the kinetics study provides key resources to the mechanisms and the rate of pollutant s adsorption the kinetics of adsorption includes four steps bulk film intra particle transport and adsorption onto the adsorbent surface ho et al 2000 the pseudo first order model considers a physisorption process it doesn t depend on the concentrations of both reactants physical exchange and the diffusion is the mechanism of this model lagergren 1898 for pseudo second order model the chemisorption process involves the chemical reaction as the rate controlling step ho and mckay 1999 the intraparticle diffusion model assumes that the mechanism of adsorption happens through the distribution of adsorbates molecules into the pores of adsorbent material avrami model explains and describes how solids convert from one phase to another phase at constant temperature lopes et al 2003 as shown from fig 10 plotting the four kinetic models nonlinear equations is showing that the intraparticle diffusion model is completely valid for the present system moreover both avrami and pseudo first order rate expression models are displayed the same results for fitness of the experimental data r 2 0 82 0 83 the correlation coefficient was 0 89 for the second order kinetic model this proves that the sorption of mb from solutions by graphene titanate nanocomposite is controlled kinetically by the intraparticle diffusion reaction avrami and lastly second order reaction compared to the intraparticle diffusion model the calculated q e calc values from the used model are varied from 18 35 to 19 29 mg g which are very close to the value of the equilibrium experimental quantity adsorbed q e exp 19 82 mg g hence it can be concluded that the pseudo first order and avrami models are predominant for the adsorption of mb onto graphene titanate nanocomposite which is referred to that the physical adsorption is the rate determining step through the electrostatic interactions and van der waals force liu et al 2015b 4 4 thermal stability the thermal stabilities of the developed materials are tested by tga fig 11 the results show that the mb adsorption onto graphene titanate doesn t affect the thermal stability which may attributed to that the incorporation of mb can yield the barrier effect making some small molecules developed during the thermal decomposition cannot permeate or acting as retarder and the dye is well distributed over the sorbent the reduction in the peak of dtg curve at 320 c after mb adsorption confirmed this assumption the major reduction 10 of the sample weight in the graphene titanate at 320 c 4 5 reusability to evaluate the recyclability of graphene titante two successive repeatability experiments were testes as shown in fig 12 in the first run 96 2 of mb removal efficiency was recorded and in the second run the removal of mb was 94 after two cycles the adsorption capacity of the sorbent was still higher than 90 indicating a promising recycling performance of the nanocomposite in water treatment application 5 conclusion graphene titanate nanocomposite was prepared in high quality and large amount by a simple two step method this successful preparation facilitates the mass production of this composite which used in many vital applications such as dyes removal photocatalysis sensors hydrogen production and energy storage in this work methylene blue was removed efficiently using the developed graphene titanate nanocomposites hence this composite can be used as a low cost filtering media for dyes removal the results show that about 86 of mb was preferentially adsorbed on the graphene titanate nanocomposites the experimental adsorption data were best fitted into the freundlich isotherm and the second order kinetic model r 2 0 999 and the nonlinear fit of kinetic models were discussed the mechanism of adsorption process is the electrostatic interaction between the positive charge at mb molecules and the graphene titanate nanocomposites surface rich with hydroxyl group of negatively charged as well as the π π conjugation between the aromatic regions of graphene titanate and mb additionally the thermal stability of the developed nanocomposite is improved after mb adsorption funding this research did not receive any specific grant

0 5 c for 24 h using an orbital shaker then the solid liquid phases were separated by centrifugation the concentration of the remaining mb after adsorption was determined using uv vis spectrophotometer uv 2600 shimadzu the effect of contact time on the adsorption experiments was also investigated using 0 10 g of the sorbent graphene titanate nanocomposite in flasks that contained 50 ml of mb solution 10 mg l at ph 7 the percentage of mb that adsorbed onto the graphene titanate nanocomposite q is determined by the following equation 1 q c o c t c o x 100 where c o mg mb l and c t mg mb l represent the concentrations of mb at initial and after adsorption at time t min respectively the amount of adsorption at equilibrium q e mg mb g adsorbent was determined by using eq 2 2 q e v c o c e w where c e mg mb l is the equilibrium concentration of mb v l is the volume of aqueous mb solution and w g is the sorbent mass 2 4 adsorption isotherm freundlich and langmuir equations are the commonly used models to explain the adsorption isotherm the langmuir model represents the formation of a monolayer adsorbate on the surface of the adsorbent quantitatively at the end of the adsorption process the model also describes the distribution of the adsorbate between the liquid and solid phases after reaching equilibrium state the langmuir equation of adsorption isotherm assumes that all the sorption sites are energetically identical with a finite number and result in monolayer adsorption onto a surface and given by eq 3 as follows 3 c e q e 1 q o k l 1 q o c e this model contains two parameters q o and k l which are the adsorption capacity and the rate of adsorption respectively as plotting c e q e against c e a straight line with a slope of 1 q o and intercept of 1 q o k l is obtained if the adsorption behavior follows the langmuir equation and thus the langmuir constants k l and q o can be calculated from this data correlation there is another important parameter r l which is called the separation factor or the equilibrium parameter can be determined from eq 4 hall et al 1966 4 r l 1 1 k l c o where k l l mg is the langmuir constant and c o mg l is the highest mb concentration i e initial concentration of mb the value of r l indicates whether the type of the isotherm is either unfavorable r l 1 linear r l 1 favorable 0 r l 1 or irreversible r l 0 table 2 reports the calculated results by using the langmuir model the value of r l for the mb adsorption onto the graphene titanate nanocomposite were found to be less than one and greater than zero r l 0 05 revealing that the adsorption is favorable on the other hand the freundlich equilibrium isotherm equation is used for describing the multilayer adsorption of pollutants sepehr et al 2016 the linear form of freundlich adsorption isotherm takes the following form 5 ln q e ln k f 1 n ln c e where k f is the adsorption capacity of the adsorbent and n indicates favorability of the adsorption process the values of these two parameters k f and n can be determined from the linear regression of ln q e against ln c e the slope of eq 5 is 1 n and its value is in the range of 0 to 1 2 5 reusability evaluation to evaluate the recyclability of the sorbent two cycles were occurred after the adsorption process the mixture solution was still for 1 h allowing the spent composite to settle by gravity then about 95 of the supernatant was discarded and the exhausted sorbent was washed many times with distilled water then dried at 80 c the product was subjected to the adsorption again 3 results and discussions 3 1 characterization of the developed materials fig 2 shows the raman spectra of the obtained graphene graphene titanate composite before and after acid treatment the characteristic raman lines of titanate appeared at 278 435 665 and 893 cm 1 respectively which confirm the successful growth of titanate nanotubes on the graphene sheets these three characteristic graphitic bands d g and 2d 1345 1570 and 2700 cm 1 respectively are also shown in fig 2 it is clear that after the sonication in 40 ethanol aqueous solution the common d band intensity increased which confirmed the successful exfoliation of graphite chia et al 2014 similar profile of raman spectrum was reported in literature perera et al 2012 pan et al 2013 but they prepared graphene from graphene oxide fig 2 also confirms the successful growth of titanate nanotubes on the graphene sheets where the characteristic peaks of titanate and graphene were observed at 278 435 665 and 893 cm 1 and 1345 1570 and 2700 cm 1 respectively the fesem and hrtem images of graphene titanate nanocomposite are shown in fig 3a and b respectively it is clear from these two figures that the titanate nanotubes randomly grown on the graphene sheets in crumbled and re stacked sheet on sheet structure resulting in difficulty in distinguish between titanate and graphene layers as well as their size and thickness edx spectrum fig 3c confirmed the presence of dominant ti and o species together with less amount of c n and na little nanotubes remain on the surface of graphene and also can be observed above and in between layers of graphene as shown in fig 3b from the ft ir spectra as shown in fig 4 the peaks at 1064 and 1640 cm 1 indicate the vibration of co and co respectively which ensure functionalization of graphene nanoplatelets with oxygen groups the same absorption peaks present in ir spectrum of graphene oxide sheet li et al 2008 these peaks indicate covalent bond between tio2 and graphene through carbon oxygen titanium bond which improves electron transfer from conduction band of tio2 to fermi level of graphene that acts as electron sink pan et al 2013 the broad peak between 3000 and 3700 cm 1 as shown in each ir spectrum indicates the stretching vibration of hydroxyl group which presents at surface of three samples liu et al 2015a both titanate and graphene titanate composite show absorption bands between 400 and 700 cm 1 that represent tio and ti o ti bridging vibration and ensures composite formation liu et al 2015a 4 adsorption studies 4 1 effect of ph the solution ph plays an important factor in the adsorption process the results showed that the adsorption capacity of the composite toward mb is high along the whole ph range and the adsorption capability of graphene titanate for mb is slightly increased with the increase in solution ph fig 5a because mb is a cationic dye and surface of the composite is negatively charged over wide range of ph fig 5b therefore mb was strongly adsorbed on the composite according to the negative charges on the sorbent surface which gradually increase as ph increasing fig 5b the electrical attraction between the composite and the mb dye increase 4 2 adsorption isotherms the initial concentration effect has been performed with 50 ml of mb dye solutions 10 100 mg l with adsorbent 0 1 g the results are shown in fig 6 indicating that increasing the initial concentration of mb increases the adsorption amount of mb on the adsorbent from 4 30 mg g to 34 05 mg g this trend associated with the electrostatic attraction and related to a cation exchange mechanism which has been previously reported for the adsorption of cationic dyes on titanate nanotubes hsieh et al 2008 lee et al 2008a lee et al 2008b lin et al 2010 harsha et al 2011 which cause increasing the percentage of removal the equilibrium adsorption capacity of the adsorbent was calculated from eq 2 where c e is the mb concentration as the adsorption reaches to equilibrium the range of the experimental initial concentrations of mb is from 10 to 100 mg l fig 7 a b and c shows the adsorption isotherms of mb onto graphene titanate nanocomposite as seen from these graphs the equilibrium uptake increases with the increase of mb concentration as a result of the increase in the driving force from the concentration gradient table 2 lists the correlated results of the freundlich model which shows that the square of coefficient of correlation r 2 is as high as 0 996 for the freundlich model compared to that for langmuir it appears that the adsorption behavior of the investigated system is satisfactorily represented by the freundlich model more than langmuir 4 3 kinetic study the effect of contact time on mb adsorption onto the composite was studied with c o 10 mg l fig 8 shows the change in the amount of the adsorbed mb at different absorption time it can be seen that a fast adsorption of mb occurs by the graphene titanate nanocomposite at the initial stage reaching about 56 of equilibrium value after 10 min adsorption and adsorption equilibrium state was attained around t 30 min in the present study the experimental kinetics data of mb adsorption were evaluated with five kinetic models namely the pseudo first order model the pseudo second order model and the intraparticle diffusion model the definition of each model and its correlated results are reported in table 3 see table 4 table 3 shows that the pseudo second order model has the highest r 2 value 0 999 than those of the other two models in addition the q e cal values that were determined from the pseudo first order model and the pseudo second order model match the experimental values q e exp in other words the pseudo second order model can be employed to describe the adsorption process of this study the adsorption of mb onto the adsorbent is controlled by the intraparticle mass transport rate or the liquid phase mass transport rate the rate constant k 1 of the pseudo first order kinetics can be determined practically from the slope of linear figure of ln q e q t against t fig 9a the determined values k 1 and q e are presented in table 3 and the rate constant k 2 of the pseudo second order g mg min and q e mg g which can be practically estimated from the intercept fig 9b and the slope of t q t vs t plot are also given in table 3 where k 1 is the rate constant of the pseudo first order k 2 is the pseudo second order model model k 3 is the rate constant of the intraparticle diffusion model and c is a constant value the results clearly reveal that the pseudo second order kinetic model match quite well with the experimental results r 2 square of correlation coefficient is closer to unity the initial adsorption rate is defined by h k 2 q e 2 mg g min which is reported in table 3 the validity of the pseudo first order and the pseudo second order kinetic models for favored adsorption of mb was also estimated by sse the sum of error squares analysis which was calculated from the following equation 6 sse qexp qcal 2 n where n is the number of data points as shown in table 3 the second order kinetic model has lower value of sse 0 02 with r 2 0 999 this model is better than the first order kinetic model for the adsorption process also the kinetics experimental data were interpreted according to the intraparticle diffusion model table 3 to clarify the diffusion mechanism as shown in fig 9c the experiments proved that by changing the contact time from 0 min to 180 min the removal of mb was more rapidly at the early stage this is due to the presence of high driving force over more vacant sites on the graphene titanate nanocomposite surface and rapid transfer of mb to adsorbent surface fig 10 the previous studies displayed the kinetics process of the pollutants removal that explicate by using nonlinear pseudo first order gürses et al 2006 second order lagergren 1898 avrami rudzinski and plazinski 2008 and intraparticle diffusion kinetic ho et al 2000 models the studying of the adsorption equilibrium isotherm is very important to explain how the molecules of adsorbate spread between the liquid and the solid phases thus kinetics study is an important for the design of adsorbents also the kinetics study provides key resources to the mechanisms and the rate of pollutant s adsorption the kinetics of adsorption includes four steps bulk film intra particle transport and adsorption onto the adsorbent surface ho et al 2000 the pseudo first order model considers a physisorption process it doesn t depend on the concentrations of both reactants physical exchange and the diffusion is the mechanism of this model lagergren 1898 for pseudo second order model the chemisorption process involves the chemical reaction as the rate controlling step ho and mckay 1999 the intraparticle diffusion model assumes that the mechanism of adsorption happens through the distribution of adsorbates molecules into the pores of adsorbent material avrami model explains and describes how solids convert from one phase to another phase at constant temperature lopes et al 2003 as shown from fig 10 plotting the four kinetic models nonlinear equations is showing that the intraparticle diffusion model is completely valid for the present system moreover both avrami and pseudo first order rate expression models are displayed the same results for fitness of the experimental data r 2 0 82 0 83 the correlation coefficient was 0 89 for the second order kinetic model this proves that the sorption of mb from solutions by graphene titanate nanocomposite is controlled kinetically by the intraparticle diffusion reaction avrami and lastly second order reaction compared to the intraparticle diffusion model the calculated q e calc values from the used model are varied from 18 35 to 19 29 mg g which are very close to the value of the equilibrium experimental quantity adsorbed q e exp 19 82 mg g hence it can be concluded that the pseudo first order and avrami models are predominant for the adsorption of mb onto graphene titanate nanocomposite which is referred to that the physical adsorption is the rate determining step through the electrostatic interactions and van der waals force liu et al 2015b 4 4 thermal stability the thermal stabilities of the developed materials are tested by tga fig 11 the results show that the mb adsorption onto graphene titanate doesn t affect the thermal stability which may attributed to that the incorporation of mb can yield the barrier effect making some small molecules developed during the thermal decomposition cannot permeate or acting as retarder and the dye is well distributed over the sorbent the reduction in the peak of dtg curve at 320 c after mb adsorption confirmed this assumption the major reduction 10 of the sample weight in the graphene titanate at 320 c 4 5 reusability to evaluate the recyclability of graphene titante two successive repeatability experiments were testes as shown in fig 12 in the first run 96 2 of mb removal efficiency was recorded and in the second run the removal of mb was 94 after two cycles the adsorption capacity of the sorbent was still higher than 90 indicating a promising recycling performance of the nanocomposite in water treatment application 5 conclusion graphene titanate nanocomposite was prepared in high quality and large amount by a simple two step method this successful preparation facilitates the mass production of this composite which used in many vital applications such as dyes removal photocatalysis sensors hydrogen production and energy storage in this work methylene blue was removed efficiently using the developed graphene titanate nanocomposites hence this composite can be used as a low cost filtering media for dyes removal the results show that about 86 of mb was preferentially adsorbed on the graphene titanate nanocomposites the experimental adsorption data were best fitted into the freundlich isotherm and the second order kinetic model r 2 0 999 and the nonlinear fit of kinetic models were discussed the mechanism of adsorption process is the electrostatic interaction between the positive charge at mb molecules and the graphene titanate nanocomposites surface rich with hydroxyl group of negatively charged as well as the π π conjugation between the aromatic regions of graphene titanate and mb additionally the thermal stability of the developed nanocomposite is improved after mb adsorption funding this research did not receive any specific grant

1268,the release of trace metals caused by industrial effluents and anthropogenic activities has been recorded in the xixi river estuary southern china however a thorough understanding of the behavior of trace heavy metals in xixi river sediments is lacking a total of 12 sediment cores were collected in june and december in the upper estuary section and mouth of the estuary here an in situ high resolution sampling technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt was employed to acquire profiles of trace element concentrations and the release of bioavailable metals from sediments in different seasons a three step community bureau of reference bcr sequential extraction method was used to explore the chemical speciation of trace metals in different seasons and to thereby assess the release potential of trace elements in sediments the bcr sequential extraction results showed that the trace metals fe mn co and pb were mainly in the residual fraction which rarely influences living organisms the total mobile fractions f1 f2 f3 of all trace metals were higher in winter than in summer suggesting that accumulation occurred from summer to winter dgt measurements showed that the intensity of sulfate reduction was higher in summer than in winter because of the high temperatures and high organic matter in summer the intensity of sulfate and mn iii iv reduction increased from the upper estuary section to the lower estuary fe iii reduction decreased in summer but increased slowly in winter the pearson correlation results showed that the release of dgt labile co in pore water was related to mn iii iv reduction while the release of dgt labile pb was basically not controlled by the fe mn s redox transition abnormally high dgt labile pb concentrations were observed at the sampling station xr3 closest to the estuary in winter which might have been caused by the high pb content in the local micro sediments keywords bcr extraction diffusive gradients in thin films estuarine sediment labile trace metals 1 introduction with the development of the economy and industry and the influence of anthropogenic activities coastal seas and estuaries are polluted and serve as sinks for large amounts of different nondegradable trace metals and compounds alyazichi et al 2015 bai et al 2015 gao and chen 2012 gao et al 2014 pan and wang 2012 parra et al 2015 yang et al 2017 thus posing a severe threat to coastal and estuarine ecosystems moderate essential trace elements are beneficial for the growth of organisms but excessive trace elements that are toxic and bioaccumulative can exert a negative effect oursel et al 2013 pb is widely distributed is the second most toxic metal after arsenic in the earth s crust and is highly noxious and non disintegrative kumar et al 2020 pb is not an essential element and is persistent in sediments and water fahr et al 2013 the development of neuronal systems cell function and intelligence quotients are badly influenced if children are exposed to pb contaminated soils yan et al 2017 high concentrations of pb ii can inhibit the absorption of other cations e g mn2 fe2 ca2 by plants thus reducing the mineral nutrient contents of plants zulfiqar et al 2019 the toxicity of pb depends on its chemical speciation and the toxicity of organic pb complexes is usually higher than that of inorganic pb shahid et al 2012 in contrast to pb co is an essential trace element for living organisms and is the limiting nutrient in modern oceans in some regions swanner et al 2014 however co can also be toxic at higher concentrations early diagenesis refers to sediments buried to a few hundred meters where elevated temperatures are not encountered and water fills the pores of the sediment zeng et al 2019 which often occurs in high strength coastal seas himmelheber et al 2008 the decomposition of organic matter as an important part of early diagenesis uses o2 no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 as electron acceptors patrick and jugsujinda 1992 sediments can act as sinks and sources for trace elements on the one hand trace metals can accumulate in sediments on the other hand they can also be returned to overlying water via internal environmental conditions and external disturbances pan and wang 2012 williams et al 1998 although there is no distinct concentration boundary at the sediment water interface a concentration gradient exists changes in the redox potential ph dissolved oxygen do and bioturbation in sediments cause trace element dissolution or precipitation and adsorption or desorption gao et al 2009 masscheleyn et al 1992 in addition to the influence of external pollution on the migration of trace metals in sediments the characteristics of sediments themselves such as particle sizes and the organic carbon content also impact the migration of trace metals in sediments zhou et al 2014 fine grained sediments 63 μm have a large specific surface area and a high humic acid content so they can affect the adsorption desorption balance of trace elements in sediment water systems guven and akinci 2013 strom et al 2011 tam and wong 2000 vertacnik et al 1995 in addition organic matter and femn oxides have the ability to connect with trace metals balistrieri and murray 1984 huo et al 2015 previous studies have found that the release of co is related to mn reduction this release occurs because of the mn oxide reduction reaction which occurs in turn due to the mineralization of organic matter under anoxic conditions leading to the remobilization of co adsorbed on mn oxidation and the release into pore water pan et al 2019 to date studies on the geochemical behavior of co and pb in xixi river estuary sediments are still scarce therefore it is necessary to study the geochemical behavior and spatial and temporal distributions of trace metals in sediments traditional ex situ sampling techniques including centrifugation and compression have limitations in determining the in situ concentrations and are influenced by changes in the external environment kankanmge et al 2017 ure et al 1993 a novel in situ passive sampling technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is used in the study davison and zhang 1994 this technique can be used as a simulated substitute for the biological uptake of trace metals to predict the bioavailability of trace metals in environmental media dabrin et al 2012 li et al 2018 dgt has a high resolution and therefore can reflect temporal and spatial changes in sediment on a microscale han et al 2013 herein the objectives were 1 to use the three step european community bureau of reference bcr geochemical sequential extraction to analyze the occurrence forms of trace metals in sediments 2 to describe the spatial distributions of dgt labile trace metals and 3 to combine bcr sequential extraction and dgt results to evaluate the release of pb and co from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study sites the sampling sites are located in the xixi river fujian province southeast china fig 1 the adjacent waters have regular semidiurnal tides with a tidal range of 4 1 m and a maximum tidal range of 6 m pan et al 2017 the xixi river is the largest river in xiamen originating from the mountains in the northwestern part of tong an district the region has a typical subtropical marine monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1371 mm and has abundant rainfall in the wet season and little rainfall in the dry season the average annual temperature is 21 5 c zhao et al 2010 the xixi river is a perennial river and the seasonal variation in river runoff is obvious the xixi river is part of a mountain stream and a large amount of terrigenous material is imported to its estuary under the influence of heavy rainfall during the flood season in june rainfall is abundant river runoff is plentiful and more terrigenous materials are input into the estuary in contrast little precipitation occurs in winter river runoff is weaker and terrigenous material input is less the sediments in the xixi river estuary are mostly composed of silt and sand and the clay content is low see fig 2 this study selected six sites in the xixi river to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of trace metals in sediments sampling station xr1 was close to the estuary and lacked the influence of tidal action and xr2 and xr3 were located in the upper estuary section which was dominated by downstream runoff from rivers and was less affected by tidal action sampling stations xr4 and xr5 were located in the estuary and lower estuary respectively and were influenced by the interaction of downward flowing river runoff and upward flowing sea currents the effect of tidal action on station xr5 was higher than that at station xr4 sampling station xr6 was located at the mouth of the estuary which was mainly affected by the tidal action of seawater and the river mainly served to transport sediment 2 2 preparation of dgt probes in this research dgt devices were used to explore the soluble and labile concentrations of metals all of which were provided by easy sensor ltd china www easysensor net zro chelex dgt probes were used to determine the concentrations of labile pb co fe and mn wang et al 2017 agi dgt probes were used to determine the concentration of labile s pan et al 2020a a dgt device consists of three parts the innermost layer is a fixed membrane for absorbing effective ions the middle layer is a diffusion membrane for diffusing and limiting the ion radius and the outermost layer is a protective filter membrane han et al 2015 the principles and operation procedures of the dgt devices have been described in previous studies davison and zhang 1994 the zro chelex and agi dgt probes were 15 cm long and 1 8 cm wide respectively before sampling the dgt devices were filled with nitrogen to remove the internal oxygen and placed into deionized water for at least 16 h before insertion into sediments 2 3 sampling and measurements of porewater and sediment in 2019 two sampling campaigns were completed in june and december in the xixi river the sampling process was as follows first sampling stations were selected in the upper estuary section estuary lower estuary and mouth of the estuary and then dgt probes were gently inserted into the sediments at low tide after 24 h the dgt probes were pulled out moreover the sediments were collected with pvc tubes 5 cm in diameter and 35 cm in length placed in polyethylene bags and brought back to the laboratory for analysis after the sediment cores were returned to the laboratory they were sectioned at 2 cm their wet weight was measured and the separated samples were freeze dried 80 c russell et al 1998 they were then removed to measure the dry weight sediment particle sizes were analyzed with a mastersizer 2000 malvern instrument ltd uk the total organic carbon toc total carbon total nitrogen and total sulfur ts in sediments from different months were analyzed using an element analyzer vario el iii elementar germany the species of trace metals in sediments were analyzed based on modified three step bcr sequential extraction sahuquillo et al 1999 the chemical species of trace metals were divided into 4 parts the acid soluble fraction f1 represents elements that are exchangeable ions or easily bond with carbonate under acidic conditions the reducible fraction f2 represents elements that tend to bind with femn oxides the oxidizable fraction f3 represents elements that combine with organic matter and sulfides and the residual fraction f4 is a representation of elements containing chemically stable and biologically inactive metals panda et al 1995 labile sulfur was absorbed by agi gel a scanner canon 5600f was used to scan the agi binding gel at a resolution of 600 dpi corresponding to a pixel size of 42 3 μm 42 3 μm the accumulated mass ms mg cm 2 of the dgt labile s was calculated using the calibration curve of the grayscale density y versus ms x pan et al 2019 each zro chelex dgt probe was cut into 5 mm strips in the horizontal direction and then placed into centrifuge tubes hno3 1 2 ml 1 mol l was used to extract dgt labile metals in centrifuge tubes afterward 1 ml of the extracting solution was placed into new centrifugal tubes and diluted with 0 6 ml of 3 hno3 the concentration of labile trace metals was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 2000 method blanks standard material and repeatability experiments were employed for quality control and quality assurance for icp ms analysis quality control samples were tested repeatedly after 20 samples to ensure the stability of the icp ms analysis three replicates were tested and the average relative standard deviation rsd was 5 for the bcr method all bcr fraction contents of gbw07314 were summed and compared to the certified values the average recovery rates of fe mn co and pb were 100 3 113 5 90 4 and 95 7 respectively and the method rsds were 5 38 10 15 5 03 and 6 63 respectively 2 4 calculation of dgt labile trace metal concentrations the accumulated mass trace metals in the dgt binding gel can be calculated using eq 1 1 m c e v e v g f e where c e is the concentration of the labile trace metals in the eluate v g and v e are the volumes of gel and nitric acid respectively and f e is the extraction efficiency 0 957 for co and 0 955 for pb wang et al 2017 the flux of metal ions from the porewater fixed by the binding membrane can be calculated using eq 2 and the concentration of dgt labile trace metals can be calculated by eq 3 davison and zhang 1994 2 f dgt m at 3 c dgt m g dat where m represents the accumulated ions fixed in the binding layer g is the thickness of the diffusive layer a is the gel layer area t is the time of deployment and d is the diffusion efficiency of labile trace metals 3 results 3 1 overlying water and sediment properties the overlying water parameters at each sampling station in june and december including temperature salinity s ph and do are listed in table 1 generally the temperature at each site in june was higher than that in december indicating that the rate of organic matter mineralization was higher in june than in december the salinity gradually increased from station xr1 to station xr6 the salinity at station xr6 was much lower in winter than in summer probably because the sampling time in winter coincided with the low neap tide the ph values of the sediments were approximately 7 88 8 36 june and 8 23 9 32 december indicating that the sediments were alkaline and decreased from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary the do was higher in winter and station xr2 had the highest concentration the properties of sediments in june and december including tc toc ts and constituent sediment contents from sampling sites are shown in table 1 in june the silt contents in table 1 ranged from 42 8 to 72 8 whereas the clay and sand contents ranged from 6 99 to 22 5 and 4 63 50 2 respectively the silt and clay contents increased from xr1 to xr5 while the sand content showed the opposite trend due to stronger seawater dynamics downstream xr6 had significantly less silt and clay than the other stations in winter the silt clay and sand contents varied from 42 0 to 77 9 4 64 18 3 and 5 83 53 3 respectively similar to summer the silt and clay contents increased from upstream to downstream and sand showed the opposite trend the toc values of stations xr1 xr2 xr3 and xr4 were higher than those of stations xr5 and xr6 the toc in june and december ranged from 0 7 g kg 1 79 g kg and 0 52 g kg 2 1 g kg respectively the highest toc contents of xr4 in summer and xr2 in winter may have been influenced by the large input amounts from the surrounding land this phenomenon might have been caused by the difference in rainfall and riverine flow rate between summer and winter in summer more terrigenous materials were transported to the mouth of the estuary by higher river runoff so station xr4 in the lower estuary has a higher toc content however in winter due to lower rainfall and reduced river flow although less terrestrial material input still existed it was transported over a short distance and accumulated near station xr2 thus station xr2 in the upper estuary had a higher toc content the toc tn values ranged from 5 91 to 11 88 in summer and 7 43 12 46 in winter however the toc tn ratio did not show terrigenous material patterns from terrestrial to marine inputs except for xr6 in june the ts fluctuated from 1 10 g kg to 6 80 g kg in summer and from 1 20 g kg to 6 90 g kg in winter while xr4 had the highest ts value 3 2 sequential extraction results of trace metals 3 2 1 speciation of fe and mn the residual fraction of fe had the highest concentration among the four fractions suggesting that fe was found mainly in mineral lattices the reducible fraction followed while the acid exchangeable fraction and oxidizable fraction were relatively low the exchangeable fraction is the most labile and can be released when the ionic strength of the medium is changed the reducible and oxidizable fractions can be mobilized with changes in the redox potential and the residual fraction can be mobilized only in harsh environments filgueiras et al 2002 the total mobile concentration f1 f2 f3 was the highest at station xr4 6999 1 mg kg in summer and at station xr3 9178 4 mg kg in winter more attention should be given to stations xr2 and xr3 which possessed the highest concentrations of the acid exchangeable fraction and reducible fraction respectively nonetheless the total mobile concentration in winter was higher than that in summer the main speciation order of fe was in the order of fe residual fe reducible fe soluble exchangeable fe oxidizable similar to fe mn was mainly in the residual fraction followed by the reducible fraction and finally the oxidizable fraction the total mobile concentration f1 f2 f3 was the highest at station xr5 with values of 338 8 mg kg in summer and 947 9 mg kg in winter the total mobile concentration in winter at all sampling stations was higher than that in summer the maximum value of the acid exchangeable fraction for mn occurred at stations xr6 256 9 mg kg in summer and xr5 779 5 mg kg in winter the main speciation order of mn was in the order of mn residual mn soluble exchangeable mn reducible mn oxidizable 3 2 2 speciation of co and pb the result of sequential extraction showed that co mainly existed in the residual fraction and the second highest fraction was the acid exchangeable fraction in june and the reducible fraction in december compared to fe the total mobile fraction of co was extremely low the highest concentration of the total mobile fraction appeared at stations xr4 1 9 mg kg in summer and xr3 1 8 mg kg in winter the main speciation of co between the four fractions was in the order of co residual co reducible co soluble exchangeable co oxidizable the main chemical speciation of pb was the residual fraction in summer but the reducible fraction and residual fraction were quite similar in winter the acid exchangeable fraction of pb had the maximum value at station xr4 the total mobile concentration was the largest at xr4 30 8 mg kg in summer and xr3 35 7 mg kg in winter trace metals in the acid soluble fraction can easily be absorbed by aquatic organisms thus leading to environmental toxicity sungur et al 2014 the average concentration and proportion of co in the acid soluble fraction were higher than those of pb while the average concentration and proportion of pb in the reducible fraction were higher than those of co 3 3 depth profiles of dgt labile trace metals 3 3 1 fe mn and s according to the 2d flux profile of dgt labile s fig 3 the variation in dgt labile s depth was divided into two types namely high flux in the surface layer and low flux in the bottom layer and high flux in the bottom layer and low flux in the surface layer stations xr1 xr4 and xr5 in summer and xr2 and xr3 in winter showed a high flux at the surface and a low flux at the bottom xr4 and xr5 in winter and xr2 xr3 and xr6 in summer showed a high flux in the bottom layer and a low flux in the surface layer in general the flux of labile s in summer was significantly higher than that in winter fluxes of labile s at different sampling points were vertically inconsistent reflecting a high degree of spatial heterogeneity this study discussed fe and mn together because they have similar chemical properties the abrupt increase in the dgt labile fe concentration to a stable depth can be regarded as the fe reduction zone and the upper part of the reduction zone can be regarded as the fe oxidation zone the depth at which the dgt labile mn concentration began to rise at all sampling sites was shallower than that for dgt labile fe fig 4 at the same time the labile mn concentration began to increase and decrease and was basically followed by labile fe in summer except for stations xr3 and xr5 the depth at which the labile mn concentration began to rise gradually became shallower from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary in contrast the rising depth of the labile mn concentration gradually became deeper in winter except at station xr3 in june the average concentrations of mn showed a growing trend from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary fig 6 while the average concentrations of fe exhibited a slowly increasing trend or even remained stable from xr1 to xr6 in summer except at station xr2 which had an anomalously high value however in winter the opposite trend was observed the maximum concentration of labile fe occurred at a depth of 4 cm at sampling site xr2 in winter while labile mn had the highest concentration at a depth of 2 cm at station xr6 in summer the concentration of labile mn in summer was significantly higher than that in winter except for stations xr3 and xr4 labile fe concentrations were higher in winter than in summer except at stations xr5 and xr6 most of the dgt labile femn concentration profiles showed a low concentration in the upper sediment and with increasing depth the dgt labile femn concentration began to increase reached a peak value and then gradually or rapidly decreased reaching a stable state 3 3 2 co and pb the concentration of dgt labile co tended to remain low and fluctuated in the upper few centimeters fig 5 with increasing depth the concentration began to increase reached a peak and then decreased at a steep or gentle slope reaching stability at deep depths in addition to stations xr4 and xr5 in june and station xr4 in december the profiles began to increase at the sediment water interface from the perspective of spatial distribution the peak value of sampling station xr2 at a depth of 5 cm was the highest in summer followed by sampling stations xr5 and xr6 in winter the peak value of sampling station xr6 was the highest at a depth of approximately 4 cm followed by stations xr2 and xr6 according to the trend of the average concentration at each sampling station fig 6 the variation in the average concentration from the upper estuary sections to the estuary and finally to the mouth of the estuary was small showing a small fluctuation interestingly the dgt profiles of co and mn were highly similar by comparing the dgt profiles of co and mn there was a high degree of overlap between the depths at which the co concentration began to increase and decrease and the depths where the mn concentration began to increase and decrease and the peaks occurred at almost exactly the same depth the fe concentration profiles did not have the same high similarity the dgt profiles of pb had elevated concentrations beneath the sediment water interface at almost all sampling stations except station xr1 in winter demonstrating that it was affected by the diffusion process of the overlying water the distribution of dgt labile pb showed considerable fluctuations with sediment depth in the depth profiles the labile pb concentration reached its maximum peak at sampling station xr3 which was approximately 4 5 cm in summer and 10 cm in winter at the same time the labile pb concentration in winter was generally higher than that in summer and the peak value at sampling station xr3 was much higher than that at other sampling stations a comparison of pb dgt concentration profiles with femn dgt concentration profiles revealed that there were few similar distributions and trends between fe and mn 4 discussion 4 1 sequential extraction of trace metals fine grained sediments such as clay and silt due to their large specific surface areas can absorb a large number of metals in the process of settling into the bottom sediments in water and the trace metals adsorbed on these particles are more bioavailable than those adsorbed on large particles tam and wong 2000 vertacnik et al 1995 the increase in clay and silt contents and the decrease in the sand content from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary indicated an increase in trace metal contents which also explains the increase in the mobile fractions of pb and co from the upper estuary sections to the mouth of the estuary metal speciation in sediments is closely related to their potential environmental pollution lestari budiyanto and hindarti 2018 trace metals in the exchangeable fraction reducible fraction and oxidizable fraction have a large potential to remobilize from sediment and produce biotoxicity to organisms in sediments yin et al 2014 generally the ion exchange fraction is the component that is the most easily absorbed by living organisms while the carbonate binding state refers to the metal adsorbed on the surface of carbonate or coprecipitated with carbonate which is easily rereleased into water when the environment becomes reductive trace metals bound to femn hydr oxides are also released back into the water and the fraction of the metal bound to organic matter is generally considered inactive and ineffective because the polymer material combined with metal degrades slowly rao et al 2008 roulier et al 2010 however the residual fraction is relatively stable and not available to living organisms filgueiras et al 2002 zhang et al 2020 the bcr sequential extraction results show the speciation of trace metals occurring on the surfaces and insides of sediment particles indicating the potential of trace metals in sediments to be released into pore water over a long time span liu et al 2021 from the perspective of spatial distribution the mobile fraction of pb increased from the upper estuary section to the lower estuary but decreased at the mouth of the estuary indicating that the potential release risk of lead increased from xr1 to xr5 at the same time the mobile fraction of pb in winter was higher than that in summer indicating that after a period of flooding events the mobile fraction of pb increased the spatial distributions of co and fe were similar to those of pb except that the mobile fraction of co and fe at station xr3 decreased in winter indicating that the released amounts at these two sampling stations were greater than the accumulation amounts during the same period of time the concentration of the acid exchangeable fraction of mn was the highest at sampling station xr4 in winter which indicated that the release potential was very large in the nonresidual fractions the reducible fraction of pb accounted for the largest proportion indicating that pb bound to femn oxides has greater pollution potential which is consistent with an earlier report fu et al 2020 xu et al 2017 the average acid exchangeable fraction concentration of xr5 in december was very high 779 47 mg kg in winter indicating that the f1 fraction with a large amount of mn has a large potential to combine with other trace metals previous studies have also reported that excess mn exists in the f1 fraction in the jiulong river estuary pan et al 2019 4 2 depth profiles of dgt labile trace metals 4 2 1 dgt labile s organic matter is mineralized and decomposed by heterotrophic microorganisms using different electron acceptors under the action of dissimilation reduction this process is controlled by the organic matter content temperature and availability of electron acceptors zhou et al 2020 active s regulates and restricts the activity and bioavailability of divalent metals in sediments wolfenden et al 2005 the premise is that active s combines with divalent iron first to produce fes and then divalent metal ions react with it to produce sulfide precipitation chen et al 2006 sulfate reducing bacteria srb are anaerobic prokaryotes that can survive by electron migration cell aggregation and particle association in aerobic environments heidelberg et al 2004 pan et al 2020b the dgt labile s flux profiles showed a higher flux of labile s in the upper few centimeters of the sediments suggesting that srb can also mineralize organic matter under oxic conditions which is contrary to the traditional early diagenetic mineralization pathway this phenomenon has been observed in a previous paper pan et al 2020b this phenomenon occurs because although srb are strictly anaerobic microorganisms they can tolerate the presence of oxygen under the action of cell aggregation migration and particles and dissimilar reduction occurs in the presence of high organic matter content pan et al 2020b bottrell et al 2009 this further suggests that reduced s can exist in aerobic conditions although it is oxygen sensitive at station xr4 the dgt labile s flux was high from the surface layer to a depth of 9 cm in summer and from depths of 8 cm to 12 cm in winter which was consistent with the high toc content at the station in winter the dgt labile s flux in the surface layer of station xr2 was high with increasing depth the flux decreased continuously which was speculatively caused by the downward diffusion of a high flux of labile s in the sediment surface layer the presence of a high labile s flux in some locally hypoxic or anaerobic regions with a high organic matter content is termed microniches e g at depths from 8 cm to 12 cm at xr2 in june pan et al 2020b ding et al 2012 in general the sulfate reduction intensity in summer was greater than that in winter and the sulfate reduction intensity in the upper estuary section was less than that in the estuary as shown in fig 7 the stronger sulfate reduction in summer resulted from the higher organic matter content and higher temperature the sulfate reduction intensity gradually increased from the upper estuary section to the lower estuary 4 2 2 dgt labile fe and mn active fe hydr oxide in offshore sediments is mainly consumed by dissimilatory microorganism reduction in early diagenesis and by reaction with the product of sulfate reduction to produce sulfide precipitation aller 1998 borch et al 2010 when the oxygen in the sediment is exhausted fe hydr oxide reduction begins the depth from the top of the sediment to the beginning of iron oxide reduction is called the oxidation zone and the following layer is the reduction zone parker et al 2017 when the mineralized organic matter reactant is dissolved fe mn oxide mn oxide and fe oxide are used according to the gibbs free energy difference thermodynamically fe iii is a less energetically favorable terminal electron acceptor than mn iii iv pan et al 2019 so a pronounced elevation of dgt labile fe is usually secondary to that of dgt labile mn this explains why the increased depth of dgt labile fe concentrations in xr1 and xr3 was greater than that of dgt labile mn concentrations in summer fig 5 however at some sampling stations such as xr5 in summer and xr1 in winter the dgt labile fe and mn concentrations began to increase at almost the same depth fig 5 this might be related to the fact that the fe and mn oxides were in a solid state which drove the synchronous beginning of the reduction reaction of fe and mn oxides this phenomenon was also consistent with the results of previous studies pan et al 2021 cai et al 2022 in summer stations xr1 and xr3 had deep oxidation zones of 11 cm and 8 cm respectively in winter there was a deep oxidation zone of 12 cm at sampling station xr5 however the depth of the oxidation zone in summer was generally deeper than that in winter which was probably due to the different lengths of time that the zones were covered by overlying water being covered by water for less time in summer results in the sediments being exposed to the air for longer thus the oxidation zone was deeper the increase in the labile mn concentration was accompanied by a higher labile s flux indicating that mn reduction could coexist with sulfate reduction it is noteworthy that there was a competitive relationship between sulfate reduction and dissimilatory iron reduction this competitive relationship was particularly evident at station xr4 in winter which had a high organic matter content the dissimilatory iron reduction began at the top of the dgt profile peaked at a depth of 7 cm and then declined rapidly however the sulfate reduction was weak in the shallow layer and began to increase rapidly at the bottom of the dgt profile if mn hydr oxide exists at the same time when fe hydr oxide reduction occurs the resulting fe ii is oxidized to fe iii again by mn mn iii iv is reduced to mn ii and rhodochrosite mnco3 is formed at the same time pan et al 2019 this explains the continuous extraction results in which mn was mainly in the acid extractable state in the unstable components the depth of the maximum value for mn was shallower than that for fe which was consistent with the ideal redox sequence in sediments fe dissimilatory reduction generally occurs in an environment with a low organic matter content and high iron oxide content and activity jacobson 1994 which explains why fe reduction was weak in sediments under a high labile s flux after reaching the peak value in the middle of the sediment at station xr5 in june the concentration of labile fe began to decrease rapidly and then began to increase at a depth of 10 cm moreover a high labile s flux was present at the same depth in the dgt labile s flux profile which may have been due to the increase in the concentrations of fe2 and s2 caused by the dissolution of fes zhou et al 2020 it is obvious that the maximum concentrations of dgt labile fe in winter were higher than those in summer at stations xr1 xr2 and xr3 while the maximum concentrations of labile fe at stations xr4 xr5 and xr6 were much lower in winter this result occurred because of the abundant rainfall in summer during which the input of terrigenous material and river runoff were large which transported terrigenous material to the mouth of the estuary however winter rainfall was less abundant and terrigenous material was not transported far the average concentration of labile mn at the mouth of the estuary was higher than that at other sampling stations while the average concentration of iron at sampling station xr2 was higher than that at other sampling stations fig 5 indicating that the mouth of the estuary and upper estuary section had higher release capacities of labile fe and mn respectively 4 2 3 the relationships among s fe and mn the relationships among s fe and mn are listed in table 2 fe mn reduction includes dissimilatory fe mn reduction and chemical fe mn reduction dissimilatory fe mn reduction is the organic matter remineralization process using fe mn hydr oxide as an electron acceptor in processes mediated by fe reducing bacteria ferb while chemical fe mn reduction is mainly driven by sulfide oxidation which consumes fe mn hydr oxide cai et al 2022 as listed in table 2 dgt labile fe and mn were positively correlated at sampling stations xr1 xr3 and xr5 in june r 0 60 p 0 05 and positively correlated at sampling stations xr1 and xr2 in december r 0 63 p 0 05 while there was no significant correlation at other sampling stations this indicated that fe and mn oxides synchronously released fe and mn free ions into pore water which can be confirmed by the vertical distribution of dgt labile fe and mn concentrations mentioned above fig 4 in december dgt labile s was negatively correlated with dgt labile fe and mn at xr2 r 0 93 p 0 05 which indicated that the reduction products of fe mn hydr oxide coprecipitated with sulfate reduction products resulting in the migration of free fe and mn ions from pore water and therefore a negative correlation between dgt labile s and dgt labile fe and mn at sampling station xr4 dgt labile s had a positive correlation with dgt labile fe and mn r 0 71 p 0 05 showing that in the presence of fe and mn hydr oxides the reduction strength and sulfate reducing strength were high and the amount of the sulfate reduction product s ii was not enough to precipitate all the free fe ii and mn ii ions so the unprecipitated fe and mn free ions were captured by dgt resulting in a positive correlation between dgt labile s and dgt labile fe and mn 4 2 4 dgt labile co and pb under oxidation conditions co ii and co iii can be effectively adsorbed to fe hydr oxide and mn hydr oxide respectively and thus removed from water when femn oxide reduction occurs co ii is released into the water and co iii replaces mn iii iv in anoxic surface water the co concentration is controlled by organic ligands and plant uptake swanner et al 2014 the similarity of labile co and mn in the dgt profiles suggested that the release of labile co in pore water might be caused by mn iii iv reduction the highly positive significant relationships r 0 59 p 0 01 between mn and co at almost all sampling stations except station xr2 in summer confirmed the above speculation table 2 this is consistent with the findings of previous reports hamilton taylor et al 1999 pan et al 2019 roulier et al 2010 due to the sulfurophilic property of divalent metals they can react with h2s produced by sulfate reduction in pore water to form insoluble metal sulfides thus reducing the biotoxicity of sediment ditoro et al 1992 liu et al 2007 this is why the labile co concentration began to decline after reaching the peak on the one hand it was caused by a lack of organic matter supply and the mn reduction rate decreased leading to the decline in the labile co release on the other hand it was due to the bivalent sulfur molecular diffusion through the upward and downward movement combined with divalent metal ions e g fe2 and co2 in pore water which reduced their concentrations a previous report showed that pb2 can be effectively adsorbed by fe hydr oxide singh et al 2018 the free ionic pb absorbed by dissolved organic matter dom is not easily released zhang and davison 1995 as a result the oxidizable fraction makes little contribution to dgt labile pb pearson linear correlation results table 2 showed that co and pb were significantly positively correlated r 0 77 p 0 01 at xr3 xr5 and xr6 in winter pb and mn were positively correlated r 0 80 p 0 01 at xr3 and xr5 but not significantly correlated with fe suggesting that co at xr3 and xr5 in winter might be controlled by the mn oxide reduction the correlations between labile pb and labile fe were generally poor indicating that pb is basically not redox sensitive fu et al 2020 in the upper part of the sediment the dgt labile pb concentration gradually decreased from the sediment water interface indicating that pb diffused from the overlying water while in the surface layer due to the oxic environment of the sediment the high femn oxide content adsorbed labile pb leading to a decrease in the lead concentration an extremely high concentration of labile pb appeared at a depth of 12 cm at station xr3 in winter indicating that a high active pb content likely occurred at a depth of 12 cm where the local micro sediments might have been polluted by pb contamination from terrestrial sources the mean concentration of labile co at the sampling sites was relatively uniform and did not fluctuate greatly while the mean concentration of labile pb was particularly high at the sampling sites closest to the estuary 5 conclusions in this study bcr sequential extraction and dgt in situ sampling technology were combined to analyze the potential environmental risks and bioavailability of co and pb in the surface sediments in the xixi river estuary 1 bcr sequential extraction results showed that the metals fe mn co and pb mainly occurred in the residual fraction the total mobile concentrations f1 f2 f3 of co and pb at almost all sampling stations were higher in winter than in summer indicating that co and pb in the surface sediments accumulated from june to december the acid exchangeable fraction was easily absorbed by living organisms and co in the surface sediments has a higher potential risk of release than pb 2 the dgt profile results revealed that the stronger sulfate reduction in summer resulted from the higher organic matter content and higher temperature the sulfate reduction intensity gradually increased from the upper estuary section to the lower estuary 3 the reduction of mn oxides and sulfate could coexist which was observed at the top of the dgt profile at station xr4 in summer in contrast sulfate reduction and dissimilatory iron reduction competed with each other in most situations 4 co and pb could be adsorbed by femn hydr oxides and the release of co from the surface sediments was mainly controlled by the potential manganese oxide reduction instead of the iron oxide reduction in comparison the release of pb was basically not controlled by femn hydr oxides these research findings provide a fundamental view of the geochemical cycling of co and pb coupled with fe mn and s in a small river estuary under a subtropical climate in future works research should focus on the release mechanism of the reducible and oxidizable fractions of pb adsorbed onto femn hydr oxides and organic matter declaration of competing interest none

1268,the release of trace metals caused by industrial effluents and anthropogenic activities has been recorded in the xixi river estuary southern china however a thorough understanding of the behavior of trace heavy metals in xixi river sediments is lacking a total of 12 sediment cores were collected in june and december in the upper estuary section and mouth of the estuary here an in situ high resolution sampling technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt was employed to acquire profiles of trace element concentrations and the release of bioavailable metals from sediments in different seasons a three step community bureau of reference bcr sequential extraction method was used to explore the chemical speciation of trace metals in different seasons and to thereby assess the release potential of trace elements in sediments the bcr sequential extraction results showed that the trace metals fe mn co and pb were mainly in the residual fraction which rarely influences living organisms the total mobile fractions f1 f2 f3 of all trace metals were higher in winter than in summer suggesting that accumulation occurred from summer to winter dgt measurements showed that the intensity of sulfate reduction was higher in summer than in winter because of the high temperatures and high organic matter in summer the intensity of sulfate and mn iii iv reduction increased from the upper estuary section to the lower estuary fe iii reduction decreased in summer but increased slowly in winter the pearson correlation results showed that the release of dgt labile co in pore water was related to mn iii iv reduction while the release of dgt labile pb was basically not controlled by the fe mn s redox transition abnormally high dgt labile pb concentrations were observed at the sampling station xr3 closest to the estuary in winter which might have been caused by the high pb content in the local micro sediments keywords bcr extraction diffusive gradients in thin films estuarine sediment labile trace metals 1 introduction with the development of the economy and industry and the influence of anthropogenic activities coastal seas and estuaries are polluted and serve as sinks for large amounts of different nondegradable trace metals and compounds alyazichi et al 2015 bai et al 2015 gao and chen 2012 gao et al 2014 pan and wang 2012 parra et al 2015 yang et al 2017 thus posing a severe threat to coastal and estuarine ecosystems moderate essential trace elements are beneficial for the growth of organisms but excessive trace elements that are toxic and bioaccumulative can exert a negative effect oursel et al 2013 pb is widely distributed is the second most toxic metal after arsenic in the earth s crust and is highly noxious and non disintegrative kumar et al 2020 pb is not an essential element and is persistent in sediments and water fahr et al 2013 the development of neuronal systems cell function and intelligence quotients are badly influenced if children are exposed to pb contaminated soils yan et al 2017 high concentrations of pb ii can inhibit the absorption of other cations e g mn2 fe2 ca2 by plants thus reducing the mineral nutrient contents of plants zulfiqar et al 2019 the toxicity of pb depends on its chemical speciation and the toxicity of organic pb complexes is usually higher than that of inorganic pb shahid et al 2012 in contrast to pb co is an essential trace element for living organisms and is the limiting nutrient in modern oceans in some regions swanner et al 2014 however co can also be toxic at higher concentrations early diagenesis refers to sediments buried to a few hundred meters where elevated temperatures are not encountered and water fills the pores of the sediment zeng et al 2019 which often occurs in high strength coastal seas himmelheber et al 2008 the decomposition of organic matter as an important part of early diagenesis uses o2 no3 mn iv fe iii and so4 2 as electron acceptors patrick and jugsujinda 1992 sediments can act as sinks and sources for trace elements on the one hand trace metals can accumulate in sediments on the other hand they can also be returned to overlying water via internal environmental conditions and external disturbances pan and wang 2012 williams et al 1998 although there is no distinct concentration boundary at the sediment water interface a concentration gradient exists changes in the redox potential ph dissolved oxygen do and bioturbation in sediments cause trace element dissolution or precipitation and adsorption or desorption gao et al 2009 masscheleyn et al 1992 in addition to the influence of external pollution on the migration of trace metals in sediments the characteristics of sediments themselves such as particle sizes and the organic carbon content also impact the migration of trace metals in sediments zhou et al 2014 fine grained sediments 63 μm have a large specific surface area and a high humic acid content so they can affect the adsorption desorption balance of trace elements in sediment water systems guven and akinci 2013 strom et al 2011 tam and wong 2000 vertacnik et al 1995 in addition organic matter and femn oxides have the ability to connect with trace metals balistrieri and murray 1984 huo et al 2015 previous studies have found that the release of co is related to mn reduction this release occurs because of the mn oxide reduction reaction which occurs in turn due to the mineralization of organic matter under anoxic conditions leading to the remobilization of co adsorbed on mn oxidation and the release into pore water pan et al 2019 to date studies on the geochemical behavior of co and pb in xixi river estuary sediments are still scarce therefore it is necessary to study the geochemical behavior and spatial and temporal distributions of trace metals in sediments traditional ex situ sampling techniques including centrifugation and compression have limitations in determining the in situ concentrations and are influenced by changes in the external environment kankanmge et al 2017 ure et al 1993 a novel in situ passive sampling technique namely diffusive gradients in thin films dgt is used in the study davison and zhang 1994 this technique can be used as a simulated substitute for the biological uptake of trace metals to predict the bioavailability of trace metals in environmental media dabrin et al 2012 li et al 2018 dgt has a high resolution and therefore can reflect temporal and spatial changes in sediment on a microscale han et al 2013 herein the objectives were 1 to use the three step european community bureau of reference bcr geochemical sequential extraction to analyze the occurrence forms of trace metals in sediments 2 to describe the spatial distributions of dgt labile trace metals and 3 to combine bcr sequential extraction and dgt results to evaluate the release of pb and co from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study sites the sampling sites are located in the xixi river fujian province southeast china fig 1 the adjacent waters have regular semidiurnal tides with a tidal range of 4 1 m and a maximum tidal range of 6 m pan et al 2017 the xixi river is the largest river in xiamen originating from the mountains in the northwestern part of tong an district the region has a typical subtropical marine monsoon climate with an average annual precipitation of 1371 mm and has abundant rainfall in the wet season and little rainfall in the dry season the average annual temperature is 21 5 c zhao et al 2010 the xixi river is a perennial river and the seasonal variation in river runoff is obvious the xixi river is part of a mountain stream and a large amount of terrigenous material is imported to its estuary under the influence of heavy rainfall during the flood season in june rainfall is abundant river runoff is plentiful and more terrigenous materials are input into the estuary in contrast little precipitation occurs in winter river runoff is weaker and terrigenous material input is less the sediments in the xixi river estuary are mostly composed of silt and sand and the clay content is low see fig 2 this study selected six sites in the xixi river to investigate the spatial and temporal distributions of trace metals in sediments sampling station xr1 was close to the estuary and lacked the influence of tidal action and xr2 and xr3 were located in the upper estuary section which was dominated by downstream runoff from rivers and was less affected by tidal action sampling stations xr4 and xr5 were located in the estuary and lower estuary respectively and were influenced by the interaction of downward flowing river runoff and upward flowing sea currents the effect of tidal action on station xr5 was higher than that at station xr4 sampling station xr6 was located at the mouth of the estuary which was mainly affected by the tidal action of seawater and the river mainly served to transport sediment 2 2 preparation of dgt probes in this research dgt devices were used to explore the soluble and labile concentrations of metals all of which were provided by easy sensor ltd china www easysensor net zro chelex dgt probes were used to determine the concentrations of labile pb co fe and mn wang et al 2017 agi dgt probes were used to determine the concentration of labile s pan et al 2020a a dgt device consists of three parts the innermost layer is a fixed membrane for absorbing effective ions the middle layer is a diffusion membrane for diffusing and limiting the ion radius and the outermost layer is a protective filter membrane han et al 2015 the principles and operation procedures of the dgt devices have been described in previous studies davison and zhang 1994 the zro chelex and agi dgt probes were 15 cm long and 1 8 cm wide respectively before sampling the dgt devices were filled with nitrogen to remove the internal oxygen and placed into deionized water for at least 16 h before insertion into sediments 2 3 sampling and measurements of porewater and sediment in 2019 two sampling campaigns were completed in june and december in the xixi river the sampling process was as follows first sampling stations were selected in the upper estuary section estuary lower estuary and mouth of the estuary and then dgt probes were gently inserted into the sediments at low tide after 24 h the dgt probes were pulled out moreover the sediments were collected with pvc tubes 5 cm in diameter and 35 cm in length placed in polyethylene bags and brought back to the laboratory for analysis after the sediment cores were returned to the laboratory they were sectioned at 2 cm their wet weight was measured and the separated samples were freeze dried 80 c russell et al 1998 they were then removed to measure the dry weight sediment particle sizes were analyzed with a mastersizer 2000 malvern instrument ltd uk the total organic carbon toc total carbon total nitrogen and total sulfur ts in sediments from different months were analyzed using an element analyzer vario el iii elementar germany the species of trace metals in sediments were analyzed based on modified three step bcr sequential extraction sahuquillo et al 1999 the chemical species of trace metals were divided into 4 parts the acid soluble fraction f1 represents elements that are exchangeable ions or easily bond with carbonate under acidic conditions the reducible fraction f2 represents elements that tend to bind with femn oxides the oxidizable fraction f3 represents elements that combine with organic matter and sulfides and the residual fraction f4 is a representation of elements containing chemically stable and biologically inactive metals panda et al 1995 labile sulfur was absorbed by agi gel a scanner canon 5600f was used to scan the agi binding gel at a resolution of 600 dpi corresponding to a pixel size of 42 3 μm 42 3 μm the accumulated mass ms mg cm 2 of the dgt labile s was calculated using the calibration curve of the grayscale density y versus ms x pan et al 2019 each zro chelex dgt probe was cut into 5 mm strips in the horizontal direction and then placed into centrifuge tubes hno3 1 2 ml 1 mol l was used to extract dgt labile metals in centrifuge tubes afterward 1 ml of the extracting solution was placed into new centrifugal tubes and diluted with 0 6 ml of 3 hno3 the concentration of labile trace metals was analyzed by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry icp ms nexion 2000 method blanks standard material and repeatability experiments were employed for quality control and quality assurance for icp ms analysis quality control samples were tested repeatedly after 20 samples to ensure the stability of the icp ms analysis three replicates were tested and the average relative standard deviation rsd was 5 for the bcr method all bcr fraction contents of gbw07314 were summed and compared to the certified values the average recovery rates of fe mn co and pb were 100 3 113 5 90 4 and 95 7 respectively and the method rsds were 5 38 10 15 5 03 and 6 63 respectively 2 4 calculation of dgt labile trace metal concentrations the accumulated mass trace metals in the dgt binding gel can be calculated using eq 1 1 m c e v e v g f e where c e is the concentration of the labile trace metals in

trace metals 3 results 3 1 overlying water and sediment properties the overlying water parameters at each sampling station in june and december including temperature salinity s ph and do are listed in table 1 generally the temperature at each site in june was higher than that in december indicating that the rate of organic matter mineralization was higher in june than in december the salinity gradually increased from station xr1 to station xr6 the salinity at station xr6 was much lower in winter than in summer probably because the sampling time in winter coincided with the low neap tide the ph values of the sediments were approximately 7 88 8 36 june and 8 23 9 32 december indicating that the sediments were alkaline and decreased from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary the do was higher in winter and station xr2 had the highest concentration the properties of sediments in june and december including tc toc ts and constituent sediment contents from sampling sites are shown in table 1 in june the silt contents in table 1 ranged from 42 8 to 72 8 whereas the clay and sand contents ranged from 6 99 to 22 5 and 4 63 50 2 respectively the silt and clay contents increased from xr1 to xr5 while the sand content showed the opposite trend due to stronger seawater dynamics downstream xr6 had significantly less silt and clay than the other stations in winter the silt clay and sand contents varied from 42 0 to 77 9 4 64 18 3 and 5 83 53 3 respectively similar to summer the silt and clay contents increased from upstream to downstream and sand showed the opposite trend the toc values of stations xr1 xr2 xr3 and xr4 were higher than those of stations xr5 and xr6 the toc in june and december ranged from 0 7 g kg 1 79 g kg and 0 52 g kg 2 1 g kg respectively the highest toc contents of xr4 in summer and xr2 in winter may have been influenced by the large input amounts from the surrounding land this phenomenon might have been caused by the difference in rainfall and riverine flow rate between summer and winter in summer more terrigenous materials were transported to the mouth of the estuary by higher river runoff so station xr4 in the lower estuary has a higher toc content however in winter due to lower rainfall and reduced river flow although less terrestrial material input still existed it was transported over a short distance and accumulated near station xr2 thus station xr2 in the upper estuary had a higher toc content the toc tn values ranged from 5 91 to 11 88 in summer and 7 43 12 46 in winter however the toc tn ratio did not show terrigenous material patterns from terrestrial to marine inputs except for xr6 in june the ts fluctuated from 1 10 g kg to 6 80 g kg in summer and from 1 20 g kg to 6 90 g kg in winter while xr4 had the highest ts value 3 2 sequential extraction results of trace metals 3 2 1 speciation of fe and mn the residual fraction of fe had the highest concentration among the four fractions suggesting that fe was found mainly in mineral lattices the reducible fraction followed while the acid exchangeable fraction and oxidizable fraction were relatively low the exchangeable fraction is the most labile and can be released when the ionic strength of the medium is changed the reducible and oxidizable fractions can be mobilized with changes in the redox potential and the residual fraction can be mobilized only in harsh environments filgueiras et al 2002 the total mobile concentration f1 f2 f3 was the highest at station xr4 6999 1 mg kg in summer and at station xr3 9178 4 mg kg in winter more attention should be given to stations xr2 and xr3 which possessed the highest concentrations of the acid exchangeable fraction and reducible fraction respectively nonetheless the total mobile concentration in winter was higher than that in summer the main speciation order of fe was in the order of fe residual fe reducible fe soluble exchangeable fe oxidizable similar to fe mn was mainly in the residual fraction followed by the reducible fraction and finally the oxidizable fraction the total mobile concentration f1 f2 f3 was the highest at station xr5 with values of 338 8 mg kg in summer and 947 9 mg kg in winter the total mobile concentration in winter at all sampling stations was higher than that in summer the maximum value of the acid exchangeable fraction for mn occurred at stations xr6 256 9 mg kg in summer and xr5 779 5 mg kg in winter the main speciation order of mn was in the order of mn residual mn soluble exchangeable mn reducible mn oxidizable 3 2 2 speciation of co and pb the result of sequential extraction showed that co mainly existed in the residual fraction and the second highest fraction was the acid exchangeable fraction in june and the reducible fraction in december compared to fe the total mobile fraction of co was extremely low the highest concentration of the total mobile fraction appeared at stations xr4 1 9 mg kg in summer and xr3 1 8 mg kg in winter the main speciation of co between the four fractions was in the order of co residual co reducible co soluble exchangeable co oxidizable the main chemical speciation of pb was the residual fraction in summer but the reducible fraction and residual fraction were quite similar in winter the acid exchangeable fraction of pb had the maximum value at station xr4 the total mobile concentration was the largest at xr4 30 8 mg kg in summer and xr3 35 7 mg kg in winter trace metals in the acid soluble fraction can easily be absorbed by aquatic organisms thus leading to environmental toxicity sungur et al 2014 the average concentration and proportion of co in the acid soluble fraction were higher than those of pb while the average concentration and proportion of pb in the reducible fraction were higher than those of co 3 3 depth profiles of dgt labile trace metals 3 3 1 fe mn and s according to the 2d flux profile of dgt labile s fig 3 the variation in dgt labile s depth was divided into two types namely high flux in the surface layer and low flux in the bottom layer and high flux in the bottom layer and low flux in the surface layer stations xr1 xr4 and xr5 in summer and xr2 and xr3 in winter showed a high flux at the surface and a low flux at the bottom xr4 and xr5 in winter and xr2 xr3 and xr6 in summer showed a high flux in the bottom layer and a low flux in the surface layer in general the flux of labile s in summer was significantly higher than that in winter fluxes of labile s at different sampling points were vertically inconsistent reflecting a high degree of spatial heterogeneity this study discussed fe and mn together because they have similar chemical properties the abrupt increase in the dgt labile fe concentration to a stable depth can be regarded as the fe reduction zone and the upper part of the reduction zone can be regarded as the fe oxidation zone the depth at which the dgt labile mn concentration began to rise at all sampling sites was shallower than that for dgt labile fe fig 4 at the same time the labile mn concentration began to increase and decrease and was basically followed by labile fe in summer except for stations xr3 and xr5 the depth at which the labile mn concentration began to rise gradually became shallower from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary in contrast the rising depth of the labile mn concentration gradually became deeper in winter except at station xr3 in june the average concentrations of mn showed a growing trend from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary fig 6 while the average concentrations of fe exhibited a slowly increasing trend or even remained stable from xr1 to xr6 in summer except at station xr2 which had an anomalously high value however in winter the opposite trend was observed the maximum concentration of labile fe occurred at a depth of 4 cm at sampling site xr2 in winter while labile mn had the highest concentration at a depth of 2 cm at station xr6 in summer the concentration of labile mn in summer was significantly higher than that in winter except for stations xr3 and xr4 labile fe concentrations were higher in winter than in summer except at stations xr5 and xr6 most of the dgt labile femn concentration profiles showed a low concentration in the upper sediment and with increasing depth the dgt labile femn concentration began to increase reached a peak value and then gradually or rapidly decreased reaching a stable state 3 3 2 co and pb the concentration of dgt labile co tended to remain low and fluctuated in the upper few centimeters fig 5 with increasing depth the concentration began to increase reached a peak and then decreased at a steep or gentle slope reaching stability at deep depths in addition to stations xr4 and xr5 in june and station xr4 in december the profiles began to increase at the sediment water interface from the perspective of spatial distribution the peak value of sampling station xr2 at a depth of 5 cm was the highest in summer followed by sampling stations xr5 and xr6 in winter the peak value of sampling station xr6 was the highest at a depth of approximately 4 cm followed by stations xr2 and xr6 according to the trend of the average concentration at each sampling station fig 6 the variation in the average concentration from the upper estuary sections to the estuary and finally to the mouth of the estuary was small showing a small fluctuation interestingly the dgt profiles of co and mn were highly similar by comparing the dgt profiles of co and mn there was a high degree of overlap between the depths at which the co concentration began to increase and decrease and the depths where the mn concentration began to increase and decrease and the peaks occurred at almost exactly the same depth the fe concentration profiles did not have the same high similarity the dgt profiles of pb had elevated concentrations beneath the sediment water interface at almost all sampling stations except station xr1 in winter demonstrating that it was affected by the diffusion process of the overlying water the distribution of dgt labile pb showed considerable fluctuations with sediment depth in the depth profiles the labile pb concentration reached its maximum peak at sampling station xr3 which was approximately 4 5 cm in summer and 10 cm in winter at the same time the labile pb concentration in winter was generally higher than that in summer and the peak value at sampling station xr3 was much higher than that at other sampling stations a comparison of pb dgt concentration profiles with femn dgt concentration profiles revealed that there were few similar distributions and trends between fe and mn 4 discussion 4 1 sequential extraction of trace metals fine grained sediments such as clay and silt due to their large specific surface areas can absorb a large number of metals in the process of settling into the bottom sediments in water and the trace metals adsorbed on these particles are more bioavailable than those adsorbed on large particles tam and wong 2000 vertacnik et al 1995 the increase in clay and silt contents and the decrease in the sand content from the upper estuary section to the mouth of the estuary indicated an increase in trace metal contents which also explains the increase in the mobile fractions of pb and co from the upper estuary sections to the mouth of the estuary metal speciation in sediments is closely related to their potential environmental pollution lestari budiyanto and hindarti 2018 trace metals in the exchangeable fraction reducible fraction and oxidizable fraction have a large potential to remobilize from sediment and produce biotoxicity to organisms in sediments yin et al 2014 generally the ion exchange fraction is the component that is the most easily absorbed by living organisms while the carbonate binding state refers to the metal adsorbed on the surface of carbonate or coprecipitated with carbonate which is easily rereleased into water when the environment becomes reductive trace metals bound to femn hydr oxides are also released back into the water and the fraction of the metal bound to organic matter is generally considered inactive and ineffective because the polymer material combined with metal degrades slowly rao et al 2008 roulier et al 2010 however the residual fraction is relatively stable and not available to living organisms filgueiras et al 2002 zhang et al 2020 the bcr sequential extraction results show the speciation of trace metals occurring on the surfaces and insides of sediment particles indicating the potential of trace metals in sediments to be released into pore water over a long time span liu et al 2021 from the perspective of spatial distribution the mobile fraction of pb increased from the upper estuary section to the lower estuary but decreased at the mouth of the estuary indicating that the potential release risk of lead increased from xr1 to xr5 at the same time the mobile fraction of pb in winter was higher than that in summer indicating that after a period of flooding events the mobile fraction of pb increased the spatial distributions of co and fe were similar to those of pb except that the mobile fraction of co and fe at station xr3 decreased in winter indicating that the released amounts at these two sampling stations were greater than the accumulation amounts during the same period of time the concentration of the acid exchangeable fraction of mn was the highest at sampling station xr4 in winter which indicated that the release potential was very large in the nonresidual fractions the reducible fraction of pb accounted for the largest proportion indicating that pb bound to femn oxides has greater pollution potential which is consistent with an earlier report fu et al 2020 xu et al 2017 the average acid exchangeable fraction concentration of xr5 in december was very high 779 47 mg kg in winter indicating that the f1 fraction with a large amount of mn has a large potential to combine with other trace metals previous studies have also reported that excess mn exists in the f1 fraction in the jiulong river estuary pan et al 2019 4 2 depth profiles of dgt labile trace metals 4 2 1 dgt labile s organic matter is mineralized and decomposed by heterotrophic microorganisms using different electron acceptors under the action of dissimilation reduction this process is controlled by the organic matter content temperature and availability of electron acceptors zhou et al 2020 active s regulates and restricts the activity and bioavailability of divalent metals in sediments wolfenden et al 2005 the premise is that active s combines with divalent iron first to produce fes and then divalent metal ions react with it to produce sulfide precipitation chen et al 2006 sulfate reducing bacteria srb are anaerobic prokaryotes that can survive by electron migration cell aggregation and particle association in aerobic environments heidelberg et al 2004 pan et al 2020b the dgt labile s flux profiles showed a higher flux of labile s in the upper few centimeters of the sediments suggesting that srb can also mineralize organic matter under oxic conditions which is contrary to the traditional early diagenetic mineralization pathway this phenomenon has been observed in a previous paper pan et al 2020b this phenomenon occurs because although srb are strictly anaerobic microorganisms they can tolerate the presence of oxygen under the action of cell aggregation migration and particles and dissimilar reduction occurs in the presence of high organic matter content pan et al 2020b bottrell et al 2009 this further suggests that reduced s can exist in aerobic conditions although it is oxygen sensitive at station xr4 the dgt labile s flux was high from the surface layer to a depth of 9 cm in summer and from depths of 8 cm to 12 cm in winter which was consistent with the high toc content at the station in winter the dgt labile s flux in the surface layer of station xr2 was high with increasing depth the flux decreased continuously which was speculatively caused by the downward diffusion of a high flux of labile s in the sediment surface layer the presence of a high labile s flux in some locally hypoxic or anaerobic regions with a high organic matter content is termed microniches e g at depths from 8 cm to 12 cm at xr2 in june pan et al 2020b ding et al 2012 in general the sulfate reduction intensity in summer was greater than that in winter and the sulfate reduction intensity in the upper estuary section was less than that in the estuary as shown in fig 7 the stronger sulfate reduction in summer resulted from the higher organic matter content and higher temperature the sulfate reduction intensity gradually increased from the upper estuary section to the lower estuary 4 2 2 dgt labile fe and mn active fe hydr oxide in offshore sediments is mainly consumed by dissimilatory microorganism reduction in early diagenesis and by reaction with the product of sulfate reduction to produce sulfide precipitation aller 1998 borch et al 2010 when the oxygen in the sediment is exhausted fe hydr oxide reduction begins the depth from the top of the sediment to the beginning of iron oxide reduction is called the oxidation zone and the following layer is the reduction zone parker et al 2017 when the mineralized organic matter reactant is dissolved fe mn oxide mn oxide and fe oxide are used according to the gibbs free energy difference thermodynamically fe iii is a less energetically favorable terminal electron acceptor than mn iii iv pan et al 2019 so a pronounced elevation of dgt labile fe is usually secondary to that of dgt labile mn this explains why the increased depth of dgt labile fe concentrations in xr1 and xr3 was greater than that of dgt labile mn concentrations in summer fig 5 however at some sampling stations such as xr5 in summer and xr1 in winter the dgt labile fe and mn concentrations began to increase at almost the same depth fig 5 this might be related to the fact that the fe and mn oxides were in a solid state which drove the synchronous beginning of the reduction reaction of fe and mn oxides this phenomenon was also consistent with the results of previous studies pan et al 2021 cai et al 2022 in summer stations xr1 and xr3 had deep oxidation zones of 11 cm and 8 cm respectively in winter there was a deep oxidation zone of 12 cm at sampling station xr5 however the depth of the oxidation zone in summer was generally deeper than that in winter which was probably due to the different lengths of time that the zones were covered by overlying water being covered by water for less time in summer results in the sediments being exposed to the air for longer thus the oxidation zone was deeper the increase in the labile mn concentration was accompanied by a higher labile s flux indicating that mn reduction could coexist with sulfate reduction it is noteworthy that there was a competitive relationship between sulfate reduction and dissimilatory iron reduction this competitive relationship was particularly evident at station xr4 in winter which had a high organic matter content the dissimilatory iron reduction began at the top of the dgt profile peaked at a depth of 7 cm and then declined rapidly however the sulfate reduction was weak in the shallow layer and began to increase rapidly at the bottom of the dgt profile if mn hydr oxide exists at the same time when fe hydr oxide reduction occurs the resulting fe ii is oxidized to fe iii again by mn mn iii iv is reduced to mn ii and rhodochrosite mnco3 is formed at the same time pan et al 2019 this explains the continuous extraction results in which mn was mainly in the acid extractable state in the unstable components the depth of the maximum value for mn was shallower than that for fe which was consistent with the ideal redox sequence in sediments fe dissimilatory reduction generally occurs in an environment with a low organic matter content and high iron oxide content and activity jacobson 1994 which explains why fe reduction was weak in sediments under a high labile s flux after reaching the peak value in the middle of the sediment at station xr5 in june the concentration of labile fe began to decrease rapidly and then began to increase at a depth of 10 cm moreover a high labile s flux was present at the same depth in the dgt labile s flux profile which may have been due to the increase in the concentrations of fe2 and s2 caused by the dissolution of fes zhou et al 2020 it is obvious that the maximum concentrations of dgt labile fe in winter were higher than those in summer at stations xr1 xr2 and xr3 while the maximum concentrations of labile fe at stations xr4 xr5 and xr6 were much lower in winter this result occurred because of the abundant rainfall in summer during which the input of terrigenous material and river runoff were large which transported terrigenous material to the mouth of the estuary however winter rainfall was less abundant and terrigenous material was not transported far the average concentration of labile mn at the mouth of the estuary was higher than that at other sampling stations while the average concentration of iron at sampling station xr2 was higher than that at other sampling stations fig 5 indicating that the mouth of the estuary and upper estuary section had higher release capacities of labile fe and mn respectively 4 2 3 the relationships among s fe and mn the relationships among s fe and mn are listed in table 2 fe mn reduction includes dissimilatory fe mn reduction and chemical fe mn reduction dissimilatory fe mn reduction is the organic matter remineralization process using fe mn hydr oxide as an electron acceptor in processes mediated by fe reducing bacteria ferb while chemical fe mn reduction is mainly driven by sulfide oxidation which consumes fe mn hydr oxide cai et al 2022 as listed in table 2 dgt labile fe and mn were positively correlated at sampling stations xr1 xr3 and xr5 in june r 0 60 p 0 05 and positively correlated at sampling stations xr1 and xr2 in december r 0 63 p 0 05 while there was no significant correlation at other sampling stations this indicated that fe and mn oxides synchronously released fe and mn free ions into pore water which can be confirmed by the vertical distribution of dgt labile fe and mn concentrations mentioned above fig 4 in december dgt labile s was negatively correlated with dgt labile fe and mn at xr2 r 0 93 p 0 05 which indicated that the reduction products of fe mn hydr oxide coprecipitated with sulfate reduction products resulting in the migration of free fe and mn ions from pore water and therefore a negative correlation between dgt labile s and dgt labile fe and mn at sampling station xr4 dgt labile s had a positive correlation with dgt labile fe and mn r 0 71 p 0 05 showing that in the presence of fe and mn hydr oxides the reduction strength and sulfate reducing strength were high and the amount of the sulfate reduction product s ii was not enough to precipitate all the free fe ii and mn ii ions so the unprecipitated fe and mn free ions were captured by dgt resulting in a positive correlation between dgt labile s and dgt labile fe and mn 4 2 4 dgt labile co and pb under oxidation conditions co ii and co iii can be effectively adsorbed to fe hydr oxide and mn hydr oxide respectively and thus removed from water when femn oxide reduction occurs co ii is released into the water and co iii replaces mn iii iv in anoxic surface water the co concentration is controlled by organic ligands and plant uptake swanner et al 2014 the similarity of labile co and mn in the dgt profiles suggested that the release of labile co in pore water might be caused by mn iii iv reduction the highly positive significant relationships r 0 59 p 0 01 between mn and co at almost all sampling stations except station xr2 in summer confirmed the above speculation table 2 this is consistent with the findings of previous reports hamilton taylor et al 1999 pan et al 2019 roulier et al 2010 due to the sulfurophilic property of divalent metals they can react with h2s produced by sulfate reduction in pore water to form insoluble metal sulfides thus reducing the biotoxicity of sediment ditoro et al 1992 liu et al 2007 this is why the labile co concentration began to decline after reaching the peak on the one hand it was caused by a lack of organic matter supply and the mn reduction rate decreased leading to the decline in the labile co release on the other hand it was due to the bivalent sulfur molecular diffusion through the upward and downward movement combined with divalent metal ions e g fe2 and co2 in pore water which reduced their concentrations a previous report showed that pb2 can be effectively adsorbed by fe hydr oxide singh et al 2018 the free ionic pb absorbed by dissolved organic matter dom is not easily released zhang and davison 1995 as a result the oxidizable fraction makes little contribution to dgt labile pb pearson linear correlation results table 2 showed that co and pb were significantly positively correlated r 0 77 p 0 01 at xr3 xr5 and xr6 in winter pb and mn were positively correlated r 0 80 p 0 01 at xr3 and xr5 but not significantly correlated with fe suggesting that co at xr3 and xr5 in winter might be controlled by the mn oxide reduction the correlations between labile pb and labile fe were generally poor indicating that pb is basically not redox sensitive fu et al 2020 in the upper part of the sediment the dgt labile pb concentration gradually decreased from the sediment water interface indicating that pb diffused from the overlying water while in the surface layer due to the oxic environment of the sediment the high femn oxide content adsorbed labile pb leading to a decrease in the lead concentration an extremely high concentration of labile pb appeared at a depth of 12 cm at station xr3 in winter indicating that a high active pb content likely occurred at a depth of 12 cm where the local micro sediments might have been polluted by pb contamination from terrestrial sources the mean concentration of labile co at the sampling sites was relatively uniform and did not fluctuate greatly while the mean concentration of labile pb was particularly high at the sampling sites closest to the estuary 5 conclusions in this study bcr sequential extraction and dgt in situ sampling technology were combined to analyze the potential environmental risks and bioavailability of co and pb in the surface sediments in the xixi river estuary 1 bcr sequential extraction results showed that the metals fe mn co and pb mainly occurred in the residual fraction the total mobile concentrations f1 f2 f3 of co and pb at almost all sampling stations were higher in winter than in summer indicating that co and pb in the surface sediments accumulated from june to december the acid exchangeable fraction was easily absorbed by living organisms and co in the surface sediments has a higher potential risk of release than pb 2 the dgt profile results revealed that the stronger sulfate reduction in summer resulted from the higher organic matter content and higher temperature the sulfate reduction intensity gradually increased from the upper estuary section to the lower estuary 3 the reduction of mn oxides and sulfate could coexist which was observed at the top of the dgt profile at station xr4 in summer in contrast sulfate reduction and dissimilatory iron reduction competed with each other in most situations 4 co and pb could be adsorbed by femn hydr oxides and the release of co from the surface sediments was mainly controlled by the potential manganese oxide reduction instead of the iron oxide reduction in comparison the release of pb was basically not controlled by femn hydr oxides these research findings provide a fundamental view of the geochemical cycling of co and pb coupled with fe mn and s in a small river estuary under a subtropical climate in future works research should focus on the release mechanism of the reducible and oxidizable fractions of pb adsorbed onto femn hydr oxides and organic matter declaration of competing interest none

1269,thermal desorption is a method of soil treatment that heats soil in order to vaporize and extract contaminants it relies on temperature measurements to assess the progress of the remediation but these measurements are generally not numerous because of cost constraints this paper proposes a low complexity method to interpolate sparse temperature data over the whole site to generate visual representations that ease the treatment follow up the temperatures of the points that are not monitored are approximated by a weighted average of the 3 closest measurements then a third degree polynomial is fitted to the data via a finite element method the resulting approximations yield an overall root mean square error rmse of the temperature estimation of 35 k which allows for realistic representations of the temperature at each point of the map with reduced sensor deployment keywords soil treatment thermal treatment modelling temperature thermography 1 introduction in addition to global warming soil pollution has become an increasingly important concern for our society to deal with the sources of soil contamination are diverse the most common being the continuous progress of industrialization intensive mining sewage irrigation sludge application to soil and the application of fertilizers and pesticides zhao et al 2019 in order to evaluate the depth of the environmental issue most countries perform nation wide assessment and remediation campaigns for example in china a 2014 survey showed that 16 of sampled locations exceeded quality standards the major pollutants being heavy metals dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs li et al 2019 in norway s three largest cities it has been shown that 38 of children day care centers require remediation due to industries previously occupying the sites ottesen et al 2008 the remediation of such contaminated soil can be achieved by a variety of techniques they can be classified in several categories namely biological physicochemical chemical electric electromagnetic acoustic and thermal treatment methods ossai et al 2020 this paper focuses on thermal treatments due to the field experience of the authors but could be extended to any other technology that relies on sparse measurements to perform the follow up of the remediation thermal desorption is a soil treatment method in which volatile and semi volatile contaminants are heated until their volatilization conditions are reached haemers and simonnot 2003 as the heating is performed under vacuum the contaminants in the vapor phase are extracted to an ad hoc treatment unit to be recovered or destroyed thermal desorption has been demonstrated to successfully remediate volatile organic compounds semi volatile compounds such as pcbs pahs ddt and volatile inorganic substances such as mercury zhao et al 2019 one significant difficulty regarding thermal treatments is the ability to assess the progress of the remediation at any given point in time indeed the main physical quantity of interest is typically the soil temperature but it is solely an indirect indicator and cannot be directly used to infer the residual soil contamination furthermore it is often impractical and expensive to monitor the temperature all over the site with a high granularity in practice a small fraction of cold points is monitored leading to an incomplete representation of the treatment hence making it harder to pilot this can imply unnecessarily longer treatment durations and consumptions consequently reducing the overall process efficiency the issue of extrapolating a finite set of data points over an entire area is often encountered in soil pollution mapping where soil pollution concentrations are only sampled at a low and finite number of locations however in the context of pollution mapping high complexity solutions are often needed and rely increasingly more on the use of artificial intelligence ai and neural networks nns dong et al 2018 yang et al 2019 this paper proposes a method to extrapolate from the on site measurements which are not numerous their value at all points of the treated mass in order to map them and produce graphical representations that allow for an easier treatment follow up the aim is as opposed to the previously mentioned techniques to keep the complexity low but to provide a global view of the treatment evolution with a minimal sensor deployment 2 materials and methods in practical applications the heating of the soil is performed by the insertion of heating tubes in the soil matrix they can be powered by either fossil fuels or electricity and are typically spaced from 1 to 10 m the monitoring of the treatment is generally done by measuring the temperature of the soil at several depths at the so called cold points which are the farthest points from heating elements the heating wells being often arranged to form equilateral triangles the cold points are then equivalent to the centroid of the said triangle as depicted in fig 1 the temperature in the soil is mainly modified by thermal conductivity which obeys fourier s law gao et al 2003 1 f λ t x with f denoting the heat flux at a given point x λ denoting the soil thermal conductivity and t x denoting the temperature gradient along the axis between the heating well and the cold point under the assumption that the soil properties are homogenous and that the conduction of heat mainly takes place in one dimension between the heating element and the cold point the temporal evolution of the soil temperature can be written as bhumralkar 1975 2 t t λ ρc 2 t x 2 k s 2 t x 2 where ρ is the soil density and c is the specific heat capacity of the soil the term λ ρc can be written as the thermal diffusivity k s the temperature gradient between the heating element and the cold point along one dimension is shown in fig 2 the treatment is considered complete when all the cold points reach the desired target temperature which is the volatilization temperature of the contaminant of concern as this implies that the whole volume reached the target temperature and all the contaminants have been desorbed with quasi certainty however in practice sensors are installed at only a small fraction of all the cold points indeed the temperature sensing is usually implemented as tubes inserted vertically in the soil after drilling in which thermocouples are inserted at several depths this implies significant extra costs mostly for drilling that can be several tens of meters deep in most occurrences maximum 10 to 15 of the cold points are monitored under the assumption that the sample size will be representative based on the layout represented in fig 3 an accurate representation of the temperature at any point of the site cannot be achieved in a trivial way if only the monitored cold points are used to generate a heatmap or in this case a thermography it would appear much colder than the reality since it would ignore all the hot spots on the other hand including the heating wells temperature on top of the much less numerous cold points temperatures would result in a representation hotter than reality ideally thermocouples would be needed at each cold point also the interpolation between cold and hot points must approximate the real behavior of the temperature gradient in order to offer a useful representation at a minimal cost the proposed method first approximates the value of all cold points that are not monitored from the value of neighboring thermocouples at the same depth the resulting grid of data points is used to generate an interpolating function mapping each point of the site to an estimated temperature this mapping can be used to generate heatmaps or other graphical representation that make the temperature data much easier to analyze at a glance 3 theory and calculations this section describes the computations performed in order to compute the value of un monitored cold points then how they are used to interpolate the mapping function 3 1 cold points computation let v i be the temperature of the i th cold point of the grid that is not measured which will be referred to as the virtual cold points and t i the temperature of the i th cold point of the grid that is actually measured by a thermocouple referred to as the thermocouple points v i is computed as a weighted average of the 3 closest thermocouple points the scaling factor being the distance between the virtual and thermocouple point it can then be written as 3 v i i 1 3 d i t i i 1 3 d i the distance d i is directly computed as the euclidean distance between the considered virtual cold point and the three closest thermocouple points 4 d i v x t i x 2 v y t i y 2 this interpolation method is known as an inverse distance interpolator it is extensively used in the litterature to map discrete sampling of environmental data such as annual precipitations tan et al 2021 soil pollution qiao et al 2018 or particulate matter in the ambiant air shukla et al 2020 the inverse distance interpolator has not been used in the context of thermal desorption where soil is heated to high temperatures but such an interpolator offers precise estimations when the variables at hand are smooth and gradually change with distance tan et al 2021 which is the case of the temperature due to the nature of the propagation of the heat by conductivity lastly the behavior of the temperature gradient at the boundaries of the treatment zone must be modeled in theory the soil temperature reaches the ambient temperature in an asymptotic way as the distance from the heating wells at the edge of the site increases this is simulated in practice by adding a border of data points at ambient temperature all around the site the distance between the edge heating wells and the ambient data points is fixed to the smallest dimension of the treatment zone for example if a treatment takes place in a 20 m by 100 m area the boundary data points will be spaced 20 m from the edge of the zone as shown in fig 4 3 2 cubic interpolation thermodynamic simulations performed with the ansys fluent software have shown that the temperature gradient between the heating wells and cold points can be well approximated by a 3 rd degree polynomial and this has been validated experimentally on several thermal desorption sites depasse et al 2021 this naturally leads to performing a cubic interpolation on the data according to the method described below the array of coordinates coupled to their temperature are used to define a grid in which each point could be defined as the node of a triangular grid in order to perform a smooth cubic interpolation a method based

accuracy the method was test on a real worksite dataset as previously stated a small portion of the actual cold points are fitted with a thermocouple tube indeed while there are 156 burners spread over an area of 440 m2 only 24 temperature sensing tubes are installed the accuracy of the estimation was determined by excluding a thermocouple point from the dataset and considering it as a virtual cold point i e an unknown of the problem the estimated temperature is then compared to the actual measured temperature this is done for 5 different cold points at 3 different depths 2 2 m 7 m and 12 m throughout a treatment that lasted 58 days hence totaling 870 data points one measurement is considered per day as the temperature is a slowly evolving variable the resulting root mean square error rmse of the estimation in kelvin is presented in table 1 the heating of the soil can be broken down in three phases that are referred to in table 1 in phase 1 the temperature is rising from its initial state to around 100 c where the water starts to evaporate it then enters phase 2 a steady plateau at 100 c where all the energy transmitted to the soil is used to vaporize the water only when there is no moisture left does phase 3 begin and the temperature continuously rises to the target temperature typically 250 c for hydrocarbon contaminations the increasing rmse throughout the treatment phases can be understood because as the treatment progresses the heterogeneity of the soil translates into bigger discrepancies in temperature indeed local differences in water content or pollutant concentration have a significant influence on the duration of the phase 2 plateau as the temperature begins to skyrocket in phase 3 at different timing intervals the estimation error can also rise this is illustrated in fig 5 where the rmse for one given point is shown over time and the treatment phases are highlighted most probably the entry in phase 3 did not happen at the same time as the neighboring thermocouple points skewing the estimation and increasing the rmse another possible cause of errors is the fact that the method currently does not take into account the heating history of the hot points but solely their temperature at the time of the computation potential downtime of some heating wells also contribute to the heterogeneity of the heating this should be addressed in further developments of the technique it is important to note that while the error rises up to 60 k in the third phase the relative error never exceeds 15 indeed the temperatures reach 500 k which means that the relative importance of the estimation error is lowered consequently the overall accuracy of the estimation is deemed adequate to perform semi quantitative assessments of the remediation progress and identify areas where interventions are required 4 2 thermographies the presented method was applied to a site whose layout is shown in fig 6 the data is the same that was used for the accuracy computation the site at hand is a former landfill of the residual oils of refinery in gela sicily italy the landfill caused a pollution of light and heavy hydrocarbons maximum concentration of 130 000 mg kg benzene polycyclic hydrocarbons aromatic hydrocarbons chlorinated compounds and mercury its remediation is part of a several years long project that separates the whole contaminated area in 24 batches pacella 2021 a thermography temperature heatmap of a site based on the presented method is depicted in fig 7 although only 24 actual thermocouple tubes are deployed across the whole site the thermography allows to immediately get a sense of the progress of heating the fact that the north west area of the site is heating slower is clearly visible to the eye as a matter of fact this is explained by the fact that the neighboring east and south areas were already heated in previous batches this visual representation can be critical in customer and or public communications thanks to this method both hot and cold points are taken into account to provide a realistic visualization of the situation subsequently it is also possible to color code the variation in temperature for a said period of time and immediately identify areas where the heating is slower than others or even where energy sinks occur e g water influx this can also be compared against theoretical and historical data to highlight zones where the increase in temperature is not happening as expected allowing for corrective measures to be taken quickly the method can also be generalized to other measurements for which the granularity of the sampling locations is not dense enough for realistic representations typically this is the case for pressure monitoring or sampling of contamination before treatment an overview map can be presented while limiting the required number of installed sensors hence avoiding time and material costs 5 conclusion thermal treatments suffer from the difficulty to have a clear picture of the evolution of the remediation process from day to day the soil temperature which is indirectly linked to the amount of remaining contamination is only monitored at a small portion of the cold points due to the important drilling costs the proposed method offers a way to alleviate the sparsity of temperature measurements in a typical thermal desorption treatment without requiring heavy computational power the temperatures of the non monitored cold points are approximated by a weighted average of the neighboring thermocouples a border of ambient temperature points is added to the edge of the zone before applying a third degree interpolation providing an estimation of the temperature at each point of the treatment area the errors on the estimation increase with soil and heating heterogeneity especially in the third phase of the heating however they stay within reasonable range and the relative error does not exceed 15 of the monitored temperature while being based on conventional interpolations the method provides useful insight for the operators the customers and the public the same method could be used in similar scenarios with temperature variations over a given period of time temperature deviations against historic or theoretical data or even with other physical grandeurs of interest such as pressure or level of contamination before treatment this can hopefully contribute to make soil remediation not only more affordable but also more predictable efficient and accessible funding this research did not

1269,thermal desorption is a method of soil treatment that heats soil in order to vaporize and extract contaminants it relies on temperature measurements to assess the progress of the remediation but these measurements are generally not numerous because of cost constraints this paper proposes a low complexity method to interpolate sparse temperature data over the whole site to generate visual representations that ease the treatment follow up the temperatures of the points that are not monitored are approximated by a weighted average of the 3 closest measurements then a third degree polynomial is fitted to the data via a finite element method the resulting approximations yield an overall root mean square error rmse of the temperature estimation of 35 k which allows for realistic representations of the temperature at each point of the map with reduced sensor deployment keywords soil treatment thermal treatment modelling temperature thermography 1 introduction in addition to global warming soil pollution has become an increasingly important concern for our society to deal with the sources of soil contamination are diverse the most common being the continuous progress of industrialization intensive mining sewage irrigation sludge application to soil and the application of fertilizers and pesticides zhao et al 2019 in order to evaluate the depth of the environmental issue most countries perform nation wide assessment and remediation campaigns for example in china a 2014 survey showed that 16 of sampled locations exceeded quality standards the major pollutants being heavy metals dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane ddt and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs li et al 2019 in norway s three largest cities it has been shown that 38 of children day care centers require remediation due to industries previously occupying the sites ottesen et al 2008 the remediation of such contaminated soil can be achieved by a variety of techniques they can be classified in several categories namely biological physicochemical chemical electric electromagnetic acoustic and thermal treatment methods ossai et al 2020 this paper focuses on thermal treatments due to the field experience of the authors but could be extended to any other technology that relies on sparse measurements to perform the follow up of the remediation thermal desorption is a soil treatment method in which volatile and semi volatile contaminants are heated until their volatilization conditions are reached haemers and simonnot 2003 as the heating is performed under vacuum the contaminants in the vapor phase are extracted to an ad hoc treatment unit to be recovered or destroyed thermal desorption has been demonstrated to successfully remediate volatile organic compounds semi volatile compounds such as pcbs pahs ddt and volatile inorganic substances such as mercury zhao et al 2019 one significant difficulty regarding thermal treatments is the ability to assess the progress of the remediation at any given point in time indeed the main physical quantity of interest is typically the soil temperature but it is solely an indirect indicator and cannot be directly used to infer the residual soil contamination furthermore it is often impractical and expensive to monitor the temperature all over the site with a high granularity in practice a small fraction of cold points is monitored leading to an incomplete representation of the treatment hence making it harder to pilot this can imply unnecessarily longer treatment durations and consumptions consequently reducing the overall process efficiency the issue of extrapolating a finite set of data points over an entire area is often encountered in soil pollution mapping where soil pollution concentrations are only sampled at a low and finite number of locations however in the context of pollution mapping high complexity solutions are often needed and rely increasingly more on the use of artificial intelligence ai and neural networks nns dong et al 2018 yang et al 2019 this paper proposes a method to extrapolate from the on site measurements which are not numerous their value at all points of the treated mass in order to map them and produce graphical representations that allow for an easier treatment follow up the aim is as opposed to the previously mentioned techniques to keep the complexity low but to provide a global view of the treatment evolution with a minimal sensor deployment 2 materials and methods in practical applications the heating of the soil is performed by the insertion of heating tubes in the soil matrix they can be powered by either fossil fuels or electricity and are typically spaced from 1 to 10 m the monitoring of the treatment is generally done by measuring the temperature of the soil at several depths at the so called cold points which are the farthest points from heating elements the heating wells being often arranged to form equilateral triangles the cold points are then equivalent to the centroid of the said triangle as depicted in fig 1 the temperature in the soil is mainly modified by thermal conductivity which obeys fourier s law gao et al 2003 1 f λ t x with f denoting the heat flux at a given point x λ denoting the soil thermal conductivity and t x denoting the temperature gradient along the axis between the heating well and the cold point under the assumption that the soil properties are homogenous and that the conduction of heat mainly takes place in one dimension between the heating element and the cold point the temporal evolution of the soil temperature can be written as bhumralkar 1975 2 t t λ ρc 2 t x 2 k s 2 t x 2 where ρ is the soil density and c is the specific heat capacity of the soil the term λ ρc can be written as the thermal diffusivity k s the temperature gradient between the heating element and the cold point along one dimension is shown in fig 2 the treatment is considered complete when all the cold points reach the desired target temperature which is the volatilization temperature of the contaminant of concern as this implies that the whole volume reached the target temperature and all the contaminants have been desorbed with quasi certainty however in practice sensors are installed at only a small fraction of all the cold points indeed the temperature sensing is usually implemented as tubes inserted vertically in the soil after drilling in which thermocouples are inserted at several depths this implies significant extra costs mostly for drilling that can be several tens of meters deep in most occurrences maximum 10 to 15 of the cold points are monitored under the assumption that the sample size will be representative based on the layout represented in fig 3 an accurate representation of the temperature at any point of the site cannot be achieved in a trivial way if only the monitored cold points are used to generate a heatmap or in this case a thermography it would appear much colder than the reality since it would ignore all the hot spots on the other hand including the heating wells temperature on top of the much less numerous cold points temperatures would result in a representation hotter than reality ideally thermocouples would be needed at each cold point also the interpolation between cold and hot points must approximate the real behavior of the temperature gradient in order to offer a useful representation at a minimal cost the proposed method first approximates the value of all cold points that are not monitored from the value of neighboring thermocouples at the same depth the resulting grid of data points is used to generate an interpolating function mapping each point of the site to an estimated temperature this mapping can be used to generate heatmaps or other graphical representation that make the temperature data much easier to analyze at a glance 3 theory and calculations this section describes the computations performed in order to compute the value of un monitored cold points then how they are used to interpolate the mapping function 3 1 cold points computation let v i be the temperature of the i th cold point of the grid that is not measured which will be referred to as the virtual cold points and t i the temperature of the i th cold point of the grid that is actually measured by a thermocouple referred to as the thermocouple points v i is computed as a weighted average of the 3 closest thermocouple points the scaling factor being the distance between the virtual and thermocouple point it can then be written as 3 v i i 1 3 d i t i i 1 3 d i the distance d i is directly computed as the euclidean distance between the considered virtual cold point and the three closest thermocouple points 4 d i v x t i x 2 v y t i y 2 this interpolation method is known as an inverse distance interpolator it is extensively used in the litterature to map discrete sampling of environmental data such as annual precipitations tan et al 2021 soil pollution qiao et al 2018 or particulate matter in the ambiant air shukla et al 2020 the inverse distance interpolator has not been used in the context of thermal desorption where soil is heated to high temperatures but such an interpolator offers precise estimations when the variables at hand are smooth and gradually change with distance tan et al 2021 which is the case of the temperature due to the nature of the propagation of the heat by conductivity lastly the behavior of the temperature gradient at the boundaries of the treatment zone must be modeled in theory the soil temperature reaches the ambient temperature in an asymptotic way as the distance from the heating wells at the edge of the site increases this is simulated in practice by adding a border of data points at ambient temperature all around the site the distance between the edge heating wells and the ambient data points is fixed to the smallest dimension of the treatment zone for example if a treatment takes place in a 20 m by 100 m area the boundary data points will be spaced 20 m from the edge of the zone as shown in fig 4 3 2 cubic interpolation thermodynamic simulations performed with the ansys fluent software have shown that the temperature gradient between the heating wells and cold points can be well approximated by a 3 rd degree polynomial and this has been validated experimentally on several thermal desorption sites depasse et al 2021 this naturally leads to performing a cubic interpolation on the data according to the method described below the array of coordinates coupled to their temperature are used to define a grid in which each point could be defined as the node of a triangular grid in order to perform a smooth cubic interpolation a method based on finite element methods analysis is used in which the element used is a hsieh clough toucher hct element as described in bernadou and hassan 1981 each triangle of the mesh is subdivided in 3 child
