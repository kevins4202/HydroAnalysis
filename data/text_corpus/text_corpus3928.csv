shaffer et al 2015 shannon et al 2008 by integrating membrane filtration with activated sludge treatment membrane bioreactor mbr has been globally deployed as a state of the art technology for wastewater treatment and reuse hai et al 2014 judd 2008 recent development in mbr has led to the emergence of a new variation namely osmotic membrane bioreactor ombr achilli et al 2009 chen et al 2014 cornelissen et al 2011 nguyen et al 2016 ombr utilises forward osmosis fo an osmotically driven membrane process to extract biologically treated water from the mixed liquor into a highly concentrated draw solution compared to conventional mbr that employs hydraulically driven membrane processes such as microfiltration and ultrafiltration ombr has been well reported to show a lower fouling propensity higher fouling reversibility and better product water quality luo et al 2017a wang et al 2016a despite the low fouling propensity of the fo process luo et al 2015 mi and elimelech 2010 membrane fouling an accumulation of organic inorganic and biological foulants on the membrane surface and or within the membrane matrix occurs in ombr operation yuan et al 2015 zhang et al 2012 membrane fouling of ombr may be further exacerbated by the high membrane permeability and selectivity which results in the detrimental accumulation of unfavorable foulants such as inorganic salts soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances in the bioreactor luo et al 2017a membrane fouling hinders the efficiency and productivity of ombr by decreasing permeate flux membrane selectivity and service lifetime as a result the ability to visualize and characterize the spatial distribution and transport of key membrane foulants in ombr may play a pivotal role in the design of pre treatment process the formulation of operational procedure and the optimization of cleaning approaches for fouled membranes in practical ombr operation dedicated efforts were made to characterize membrane fouling such as surface enhanced raman spectroscopy sers confocal laser scanning microscopy clsm and transmission electron microscopy tem 3d visualization for instance cui et al 2011 employed sers technique to investigate protein fouling on polyvinylidene fluoride pvdf membranes as well as to distinguish fouling propensity of three different proteins a similar vibrational spectroscopic imaging technique was also developed to probe the chemical structure of foulants and their 3 dimensional spatial distribution during microfiltration of protein and polysaccharide solutions chen et al 2017 in addition clsm is a non invasive approach to examine membrane structure wang et al 2012 as well as biofilm characteristics in biofouling mukherjee et al 2016 xie et al 2015 furthermore 3d visualization by tem tomography has gained attention to visualize internal structures of polyamide membrane active layer kłosowski et al 2016 li et al 2017 lin et al 2016 pacheco et al 2016 such ultra high resolution provides unique perspective in internal nanostructure as well as nano sized pore distribution of polyamide thin films synchrotron infrared ir spectroscopy utilising the ultra bright synchrotron ir beamline offers a novel approach to precisely identify specific foulant molecules with satisfactory spatial resolution synchrotron ir spectroscopy has been developed as a rapid direct non destructive and non invasive analytical technique for micron sized samples bertrand et al 2012 ellis and martin 2016 lehmann and solomon 2010 this advanced technique has been applied to a range of environmental applications such as living cellular exposure and early molecular responses to environmental pollutants holman et al 2000 tio2 nanoparticle accumulation in cucumber fruit servin et al 2013 and chemical and structural changes of enzyme on catalysts ash et al 2016 however the application of synchrotron ir technique in spatially and chemically resolving membrane fouling layer was rather scarce we previously employed synchrotron ir mapping to resolve combined membrane fouling organic foulants with colloidal silica in membrane distillation md xie et al 2017 elucidating the fouling mechanism in md filtration in this study we employed the synchrotron ir technique to examine membrane fouling in ombr two mapping modes transmission and attenuated total reflection atr were utilised to comprehensively investigate membrane fouling development and foulant distribution in ombr where membrane fouling develops in a highly heterogeneous environment we mapped the surface and cross section of the fouled membrane in ombr demonstrating the location and spatial distribution of foulants and extracting chemical information of foulant membrane interaction these findings also highlight the efficiency of synchrotron ir technique in characterizing foulant membrane interfaces 2 materials and methods 2 1 ombr system a flat sheet aquaporin fo membrane aquaporin asia singapore was used in ombr this aquaporin fo membrane was structurally similar to that of the conventional thin film composite tfc fo membrane but consisted of a polyamide selective layer embedded with aquaporin proteins vesicles and a porous polysulfone supporting layer luo et al 2017b madsen et al 2015 key mass transport parameters are tabulated in table s1 supplementary data the combination of

dissolved organic matter in mixed liquor supernatant and draw solution during ombr operation details of the sec measurement are described in the supplementary data 2 3 micro x ray computed tomography for fouled membrane the three dimensional 3d structure of the fouled fo membrane at the conclusion of ombr operation was visualised by micro x ray computed tomography ct measurements xradia micro xct200 carl zeiss x ray microscopy inc usa the ct used a micro focus x ray source with a rotating sample holder and an imaging detector system the source consisted of a closed x ray tube with the tube voltage of 40 kv and a peak power of 10 w one data acquisition set contained 361 equiangular projections over 180 providing a complete tomographic reconstruction the exposure time was 8 s for each

transmission and atr modes transmission mode mapping allowed close examination of the cross section of the fo membrane while atr mode offered insights into the chemical composition of the fo membrane surface fouled fo membrane was first dehydrated by sequential 10 min immersions in ethanol 50 70 80 90 100 in water and dried overnight in a desiccator at room temperature 22 1 c for transmission mode imaging samples were then embedded in parafilm at 58 c for two hours embedded samples were cut into 10 μm thick slices with a leica ultra cryo uc7 microtome leica mikrosysteme gmbh vienna austria and was transferred to a caf2 window 22 mm in diameter and 0 5 mm in thickness crystran dorset united kingdom for imaging in transmission mode for atr mode imaging the dehydrated fo membrane sample was cut and mounted to bruker single bounce macro atr device equipped with znse crystal tip refractive index of 2 4 tip radius of 250 μm 2 5 synchrotron infrared measurements synchrotron ir spectra and images were collected at the infrared beamline at the australia synchrotron clayton melbourne australia the brilliance of infrared synchrotron radiation is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of the laboratory source in the region of 2000 800 cm 1 tobin et al 2010 synchrotron ir measurements in the transmission mode were collected by a fourier transform infrared ftir ifs 125 hr brüker spectrometer a membrane sample on the adjustable motorized x y mapping stage can be observed with an optical microscope a rectangular region of the fouled fo membrane cross section was mapped with an aperture size of 6 9 μm and 3 μm steps in the horizontal and vertical directions the humidity and temperature of the imaging chamber were maintained at less than 20 and 22 c respectively in order to minimize the effect of water vapour on ir spectra ir spectra were acquired with 32 scans and signals were averaged and fourier transformed to generate a spectrum with a nominal resolution of 4 cm 1 on the other hand synchrotron ir spectra in the atr mode were collected with bruker single bounce macro atr device bruker optik gmbh ettlingen germany using a 32 objective spectratech shelton ct usa 0 65 numerical aperture all spectra were recorded in the spectral range of 4000 800 cm 1 with 32 scans at a spectral resolution of 4 cm 1 resolution the synchrotron atr mapping grid was set as 2 μm step prior to collection of each samples spectra the atr crystal was cleaned with isopropanol and a new background measurement was performed for spectral measurements the microscope aperture was set at 100 100 μm2 2 6 data processing for synchrotron ir spectra analysis was performed using opus software version 7 2 brüker from the spectra acquired in the experiments the integrated areas of the relevant peaks were calculated for each spectrum after smoothing between adjacent pixels the calculated results were plotted as a function of the position to produce a coloured contour map to illustrate the chemical composition and distribution of the fouling layer 3 results and discussion 3 1 3d structure and chemical distribution of fouling layer in ombr a stable ombr operation resulted in a gradual decrease in water flux and an effective removal of organic matter and nutrients salinity build up in the bioreactor an intrinsic issue associated with ombr xiao et al 2011 resulted in water flux decline figure s2 supplementary data nevertheless ombr effectively removed organic matter as toc and tn and nutrients as nh4 and po4 3 table s4 supplementary data with the complementarity of biological treatment and highly selective fo membrane luo et al 2017a such ombr operation performance also resulted in a patchy and thin fouling layer on the fo membrane surface at the end of ombr operation figure s3 supplementary data the 3d structure of the fo membrane fouling layer was visualised by a non destructive approach fig 1 typical composite membrane structure manickam et al 2014 was presented with a dense polyamide layer fig 1a and a porous fiber mesh supporting layer fig 1b resulting in a favorable finger like structure yip et al 2010 for water permeation in fo filtration fig 1c more importantly sand dune structures were scattered on the membrane surface which agreed well with the patchy distribution of membrane foulants in ombr a close examination of these structures video s1 and figure s4 supplementary data suggested the colonization and accumulation of biomass on the fo membrane mirroring the optical image of the fouled fo membrane in ombr fig 2 a the detailed 3d structure of the fouled membrane also guided synchrotron ir mapping providing areas of interest and determining the membrane fouling layer boundary carbohydrate and protein key membrane foulants for ombr meng et al 2010 yonebayashi and hattori 1989 were identified and illustrated by synchrotron atr ir mapping fig 2 as two predominant components of soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances carbohydrate and protein concentrations in the mixed liquor have been reported to increase with salinity build up in the bioreactor during ombr operation luo et al 2016 the corresponding integral peaks of carbohydrate and protein were 1150 cm 1 and 1650 cm 1 respectively kimura et al 2005 movasaghi et al 2008 specifically major adsorption near 1150 cm 1 symmetric and asymmetric co stretch was an indication of carbohydrate character for polysaccharide like substances croué et al 2003 strong peak at 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of amide i was unique for protein like substance wu and fane 2012 the mapping grid covered the sand dune feature fig 2a characterized by micro ct fig 1d of the fouling layer in order to extract their chemical information thereby shedding light on the underlying fouling mechanism medium intensity as carbohydrate was detected which roughly matched the sand dune feature on the fouling layer fig 2b in addition strong protein signal was recorded which covered major area of the fouling layer fig 2c carbohydrate and protein mapping provided a clue for membrane fouling development in ombr similarity between carbohydrate mapping and sand dune feature indicated that the polysaccharide like substance excreted from biomass activities first colonized fo membrane surface overlapping carbohydrate and protein distributions further suggested a multilayered fouling structure in ombr with polysaccharide like carbohydrate as the fouling foundation previous studies employing confocal microscopy with multiple fluorescence labeling also showed the α glucopyranose polysaccharides initiated biofilm development on the conventional tfc fo membrane in ombr wang et al 2016b yuan et al 2015 our synchrotron atr ir mapping strongly supports this hypothesis from the perspective of foulant chemical information and spatial distribution 3 2 occurrence of organic matter in draw solution raised concern we tracked organic matters in feed and draw solutions during ombr operation it was expected that refractory organic matter would accumulate in the bioreactor due to the high rejection of the fo membrane however the detection of organic matter in the draw solution at the conclusion of ombr operation was detrimental to the sustainability of the process eem analysis specified the build up of humic like λex em 300 370 400 500 nm hazrati et al 2017 jin et al 2013 and protein like substances λex em 275 290 330 370 nm hazrati et al 2016 sheng and yu 2006 in the draw solution fig 3 c and d in addition sec measurement also suggested the presence of protein like substance together with a small portion of humic like substance in the draw solution figure s5 supplementary data as a result we examined the cross section of the fouled fo membrane by synchrotron ftir mapping thereby shedding light on the underlying fouling mechanism in ombr 3 3 synchrotron ftir manifested foulant penetration into membrane matrix mapping the cross section of the fouled fo membrane offered a unique perspective to elucidate the fouling mechanisms and associated consequences in ombr operation we demonstrated the spatial distribution and relative intensity of carbohydrate and protein longitudinally along the fouled fo membrane at the conclusion of ombr operation fig 4 mapping of the boundary is presented fig 4a between the fouling layer and the membrane with characteristic structurer of finger like supporting layer fig 2c which anchored position for quantitative analysis of the foulant spatial distribution specifically carbohydrate formed a clear layer with negligible penetration into the fo membrane matrix fig 4b by contrast protein exhibited significant diffusion into the membrane polymer with even detection in the region of membrane supporting layer fig 4c in addition carbohydrate also manifested absorbance hotspots which corresponded to the sand dune 3d structures evidence for protein penetration into membrane matrix explains the occurrence of protein like substance in the draw solution captured by eem and sec measurements synchrotron ftir mapping for the first time offered panoramic view of membrane fouling in ombr where varying foulants accumulated on and subsequently migrated through the fo membrane resulting in unfavorable contaminant build up in the draw solution 3 4 implications resolve chemical and structural features of the fouling layer is fundamentally important to membrane based process synchrotron ir mapping offers an effective and powerful tool to describe and decipher fouling mechanisms in ombr process with foulant spatial distribution and quantitative analysis at molecular level with the technical feasibility our synchrotron ir mapping of the fo membrane explored the sequence of fouling development in ombr where polysaccharide like carbohydrate colonized membrane surface and initiated the vicious cycle of fouling in addition foulant penetration into membrane matrix was visualised and was the culprit for detrimental contaminant accumulation in the draw solution 4 conclusion results reported here demonstrated the effectiveness of

ombr meng et al 2010 yonebayashi and hattori 1989 were identified and illustrated by synchrotron atr ir mapping fig 2 as two predominant components of soluble microbial products and extracellular polymeric substances carbohydrate and protein concentrations in the mixed liquor have been reported to increase with salinity build up in the bioreactor during ombr operation luo et al 2016 the corresponding integral peaks of carbohydrate and protein were 1150 cm 1 and 1650 cm 1 respectively kimura et al 2005 movasaghi et al 2008 specifically major adsorption near 1150 cm 1 symmetric and asymmetric co stretch was an indication of carbohydrate character for polysaccharide like substances croué et al 2003 strong peak at 1650 cm 1 stretching vibration of amide i was unique for protein like substance wu and fane 2012 the mapping grid covered the sand dune feature fig 2a characterized by micro ct fig 1d of the fouling layer in order to extract their chemical information thereby shedding light on the underlying fouling mechanism medium intensity as carbohydrate was detected which roughly matched the sand dune feature on the fouling layer fig 2b in addition strong protein signal was recorded which covered major area of the fouling layer fig 2c carbohydrate and protein mapping provided a clue for membrane fouling development in ombr similarity between carbohydrate mapping and sand dune feature indicated that the polysaccharide like substance excreted from biomass activities first colonized fo membrane surface overlapping carbohydrate and protein distributions further suggested a multilayered fouling structure in ombr with polysaccharide like carbohydrate as the fouling foundation previous studies employing confocal microscopy with multiple fluorescence labeling also showed the α glucopyranose polysaccharides initiated biofilm development on the conventional tfc fo membrane in ombr wang et al 2016b yuan et al 2015 our synchrotron atr ir mapping strongly supports this hypothesis from the perspective of foulant chemical information and spatial distribution 3 2 occurrence of organic matter in draw solution raised concern we tracked organic matters in feed and draw solutions during ombr operation it was expected that refractory organic matter would accumulate in the bioreactor due to the high rejection of the fo membrane however the detection of organic matter in the draw solution at the conclusion of ombr operation was detrimental to the sustainability of the process eem analysis specified the build up of humic like λex em 300

penetration into membrane matrix explains the occurrence of protein like substance in the draw solution captured by eem and sec measurements synchrotron ftir mapping for the first time offered panoramic view of membrane fouling in ombr where varying foulants accumulated on and subsequently migrated through the fo membrane resulting in unfavorable contaminant build up in the draw solution 3 4 implications resolve chemical and structural features of the fouling layer is fundamentally important to membrane based process synchrotron ir mapping offers an effective and powerful tool to describe and decipher fouling mechanisms in ombr process with foulant spatial distribution and quantitative analysis at molecular level with the technical feasibility our synchrotron ir mapping of the fo membrane explored the sequence of fouling development in ombr where polysaccharide like carbohydrate colonized membrane surface and initiated the vicious cycle of fouling in addition foulant

membrane at the conclusion of ombr operation micro x ray computed tomography revealed patchy sand dune features on the membrane surface at the conclusion of ombr operation synchrotron ir atr mapping

19641,enhanced fouling resistance has been observed in recent variants of reverse osmosis ro desalination which use time varying batch or semi batch processes such as closed circuit ro ccro and pulse flow ro pfro however the mechanisms of batch processes fouling resistance are not well understood and models have not been developed for prediction of their fouling performance here a framework for predicting reverse osmosis fouling is developed by comparing the fluid residence time in batch and continuous conventional reverse osmosis systems to the nucleation induction times for crystallization of sparingly soluble salts this study considers the inorganic foulants calcium sulfate gypsum calcium carbonate calcite and silica and the work predicts maximum recovery ratios for the treatment of typical water sources using batch reverse osmosis bro and continuous reverse osmosis the prediction method is validated through comparisons to the measured time delay for caso4 membrane scaling in a bench scale recirculating reverse osmosis unit the maximum recovery ratio for each salt solution caco3 caso4 is individually predicted as a function of inlet salinity as shown in contour plots next the maximum recovery ratios of batch and conventional ro are compared across several water sources including seawater brackish groundwater and ro brine batch ro s shorter residence times associated with cycling from low to high salinity during each batch enable significantly higher recovery ratios and higher salinity than in continuous ro for all cases examined finally representative brackish ro brine samples were analyzed to determine the maximum possible recovery with batch ro overall the induction time modeling methodology provided here can be used to allow batch ro to operate at high salinity and high recovery while controlling scaling the results show that in addition to its known energy efficiency improvement batch ro has superior inorganic fouling resistance relative to

discharge 1 introduction membrane fouling such as scaling by salts is a significant barrier to implementation of water treatment technologies rezaei et al 2017 including the dominant desalination technology reverse osmosis ro chakraborty et al 2015 shirazi et al 2010 ro is considered to be particularly vulnerable to scaling in comparison to thermal technologies such as membrane distillation or multistage flash distillation tow et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015d 2017c despite this ro is the most widely used and energy efficient desalination technology mcgovern and lienhard 2014 thiel et al 2015 tow et al 2015 warsinger et al 2015b and improving this technology s fouling resistance is critical to operational efficiency and longevity cohen et al 2017 batch systems as opposed to continuous systems offer a new approach to significant fouling and efficiency improvements warsinger et al 2016b in continuous ro systems the membrane elements near the end of the train may contact supersaturated solution for extended time periods between cleanings greenlee et al 2009 however recirculating batch and semi batch systems frequently flush the concentrated solution out with fresh feed as a result no part of the membrane train remains in contact with supersaturated solutions for a prolonged period 1 1 batch ro the term batch in this study refers to a desalination process wherein a set quantity of feed solution is concentrated over time up to the required final brine salinity and this process is repeated to produce large amounts of permeate batch desalination configurations have time varying salinity often achieving this via recirculation to further concentrate a contained volume of fluid qiu and davies 2012a the recirculating brine is rejected at the end of each cycle batch desalination technologies efraty et al 2011 qiu and davies 2012a have also shown robust resistance to membrane fouling efraty and septon 2012 although a theoretical explanation for this is lacking in the literature these fouling improvements are seen in a new semi batch process pulse flow ro pfro liberman 2017 2018 and also in another rapidly growing technology semi batch ro process called ccro or closed circuit reverse osmosis and trademarked as ccd or closed circuit desalination stover 2013 the technology is classified as a semi batch process because although it cycles salinity over time it continuously introduces new feed water to the system the semi batch design allows for improvement over traditional ro with a similar design and flow parameters and can be retrofitted into existing systems batch ro see e g fig 1 is expected to have very similar advantages with some energy efficiency improvements over ccro due to reduced entropy of mixing warsinger et al 2016b in ccro continuous mixing occurs between the recirculating brine and the lower salinity feed this mixing increases the average osmotic pressure in comparison to batch ro and makes higher recoveries more energy intensive to achieve ccro has been tested to recoveries as high as 97 for brackish waters although 82 92 is more typical stover 2013 these levels greatly exceed typical ro recovery ratios shirazi et al 2010 1 2 fouling in ro fouling occurs when organic inorganic or biological water contaminants attach to the membrane tong et al 2017 fouling on ro membranes reduces permeate flux and quality hoek et al 2008 salvador cob et al 2012 increases the streamwise pressure drop as the feed flows across the membrane decreases energy efficiency and leads to more frequent membrane replacement and the need for extensive pretreatment comstock et al 2011 malki 2008 warsinger et al 2015e these effects lead to higher operational costs for an ro facility which in turn affect water cost resistance to fouling of various types including inorganic organic and biological has thus been an important long term focus of research inorganic fouling the accumulation of salts and other inorganic substances such as silica on membranes can be avoided by operating the process under conditions that prevent nucleation of crystals d m warsinger et al 2016e f pomerantz et al 2006 warsinger et al 2015a here we show that avoidance of crystal nucleation by rapid salinity cycling is a potentially major advantage of the batch processes compared to conventional steady ro time varying conditions like those found in batch processes may also inhibit biofouling warsinger et al 2015e the susceptibility of ro membranes to damage by fouling has prompted the development of other processes such as membrane distillation rezaei et al 2017 servi et al 2017 warsinger et al 2014 and forward osmosis boo et al 2012 which are thought to exhibit greater resistance to fouling tow et al 2018 tow and lienhard 2017 warsinger et al 2017a 2017c xie et al 2015 furthermore a trend in environmental legislation mandates for zero liquid discharge zld to reduce pollution from brine waste is requiring many applications to use higher recoveries qiu and davies 2012b additionally newer ro membranes have focused on increasing permeability and membrane flux to reduce sizes and costs cohen tanugi et al 2014 but these higher fluxes although bounded by the limiting effect of concentration polarization mcgovern and lienhard 2016 may still lead to increased fouling as wastewater reuse increases and the adverse effects of groundwater salinity on agriculture continue to grow cohen et al 2018 ro is increasingly being used for water sources other than seawater kumar et al 2017 at higher recovery ratios of brackish water inorganic fouling has a greater impact on system performance high concentrations of common dissolved ions such as ca2 so4 2 and co3 2 are also significant factors in system fouling khan et al 2014 harvested foulant layers from ro membranes used to treat seawater and secondary wastewater effluent in a pilot plant and found that although organic foulants dominated in seawater ro and on the first membrane of wastewater ro inorganic foulants comprised 88 9 by mass of the foulant layer on the last membrane in the wastewater ro train some sparingly soluble salts common in the scaling of desalination systems are listed in table 1 caco3 and caso4 are the most common fouling concerns in typical desalination systems comstock et al 2011 jawor and hoek 2009 yang 2005 solubility is calculated using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 2013 using the phreeqc database for activity coefficients and data from a variety of sources on the standard state ion concentration thiel and lienhard 2014 scaling mitigation can involve reducing supersaturation through pretreatment prolonging the induction time through antiscalant addition shirazi et al 2010 or as proposed in the present study keeping the residence time of supersaturated solutions under the nucleation induction time knowledge of crystallization kinetics can be used to avoid or minimize scaling under supersaturated conditions crystallization is delayed for a period of time known as the nucleation induction time which is the time needed for stable crystals to form under given conditions çelikbilek et al 2012 warsinger et al 2017c this delay occurs because very small nuclei of a few hundred atoms are unstable in supersaturated conditions due to competition between the interfacial energy of the crystal surface and the change in gibbs energy of the solid relative to the salt in solution çelikbilek et al 2012 nagy and braatz 2012 1 3 fouling in batch and semi batch ro applications of batch and semi batch ro have demonstrated substantial fouling resistance stover 2012 has proposed that ccro can reduce fouling and scaling through the time variation of water composition at the membrane tarquin and delgado 2012 reported that batch ro may be especially resistant to fouling and scaling based on experiments in which fouling was not observed even with brackish water under high concentrations of silica and calcium sulfates at 90 recovery several studies have shown ccro to be resistant to silica fouling sonera et al 2015 in one such study the system began at around half saturation 57 ppm with a ph of 5 5 and went to 93 8 recovery without any evidence of silica fouling notably an antiscalant was used but antiscalants largely delay nucleation rather than alter saturation levels shirazi et al 2010 another ccro study began at around one quarter of silica saturation 32 ppm and went to 96 recovery without any evidence of fouling gal et al 2016 a third study began near saturation 125 ppt with 85 recovery efraty 2015 slight flux decline was observed over 23 min of run time ccro plants that begin with supersaturated foulants such as silica have exhibited heavy fouling efraty 2015 the trend seems to be that even for systems that concentrate past saturation fouling is minimal if the starting feed is subsaturated this observation hints that frequently returning to sub saturated concentrations may be the key to avoiding fouling and modeling the mechanism behind any fouling that does occur will allow the system to push the limits of fouling free operation a substantial advantage that batch and semi batch processes have over traditional steady flow ro is their transient operation which limits the time period of supersaturated conditions periodically they eject all of the brine and refill the system with feed water as long as no crystals have yet formed and the feed is subsaturated progress toward nucleation should be undone at the end of each cycle when brine is rejected from the system warsinger et al 2015c crystals that have formed may also dissolve in contrast continuous ro operates at steady state so high salinity stages for higher recovery operations may run at supersaturated conditions almost indefinitely causing fouling bartman et al 2011 chai et al 2007 the long times of supersaturation in continuous ro are only interrupted by periodic cleaning processes which can be as infrequent as weeks or months in industrial applications notably batch ro has an additional advantage not discussed here batch cycles have a natural osmotic backwash step at the end of each cycle when pressure is reduced with salty brine inside the membrane elements osmotic backwash ramon and hoek 2012 sagiv et al 2008 tow et al 2016 and flow reversal bartman et al 2009 gu et al 2013 have proven to be effective anti fouling strategies in continuous ro in this paper we compare the cycle time of batch ro to the time between cleaning processes in continuous ro these times are then compared to the nucleation induction time to estimate what recovery ratios can be achieved before scaling occurs in either system an expression for residence time in batch and semi batch systems is developed and nucleation induction time is correlated from existing measurements for common scalants caso4 and caco3 results are displayed as contour plots of fouling zones as a function of inlet feed salinity and recovery ratio which include batch and continuous ro paths the use of nucleation induction time to predict the time delay for scaling in ro is validated against experimental data for calcium sulfate solutions the methods are applied to key water types seawater and groundwater and used to predict the potential of batch ro to increase water recovery from representative ro brines these results provide upper bounds on safe operating conditions as membranes themselves may play an additional role in promoting the crystal nucleation elimelech et al 1997 2 modeling methodology this study predicts fouling by comparing fluid residence time to nucleation induction time the fluid residence time is defined as the time during which any part of the membrane module is supersaturated in continuous ro this is the time between cleaning processes and in batch ro the residence time is conservatively considered to be the permeate production period of each cycle the other relevant timescale is the nucleation induction time for salt crystals the time required for stable crystals to form in a supersaturated solution which can range from minutes to days depending on the degree of supersaturation and other conditions chesters 2009 batch cycle times may be shorter than the times for nucleation induction of common foulants such as caso4 and caco3 pomerantz et al 2006 as a result systems starting operation at sub saturated conditions may be able to run up to concentrations several times saturation without causing crystallization to determine whether fouling is likely to occur the length of time over which the feed is supersaturated in an ro system is compared to the nucleation induction time which is calculated from feed concentration using existing correlations he et al 1994 xyla et al 1992 fig 2 illustrates this comparison 2 1 nucleation induction time in this section we report or develop correlations for the nucleation induction time for three common scalants caco3 caso4 and silica although these induction times are derived from experiments in stirred liquids with stirrer bars and recirculating baths he et al 1999 we assume that they apply to the moving fluids in ro systems the same assumption enabled successful prediction of gypsum scaling in membrane distillation systems in our previous report warsinger et al 2017c these correlations are based on the assumption of pure salt solutions in which ph is determined by concentration to include the effects of ph in real waters the saturation index si used in the induction time correlations is calculated using phreeqc for each solution s composition and ph however additional impacts of ph and the presence of other species on induction time are not accounted for in the present model due to the lack of available data on these effects 2 1 1 calcium carbonate the nucleation induction time of caco3 was calculated using a correlation from refs he et al 1999 xyla et al 1992 1 t ind caco 3 10 a 1 a 2 si a 3 t a 4 si t where t ind is the induction time si is the saturation index t is the absolute temperature in k and the empirically determined constants are as follows a 1 4 22 a 2 13 8 a 3 1876 4 and a 4 6259 6 the solubility of calcite was evaluated at ph 7 adjusting the concentration of co32 to satisfy electroneutrality 2 1 2 calcium sulfate the nucleation induction time of calcium sulfate as gypsum caso4 2h2o was calculated using linear interpolation within table 1 of ref he et al 1994 for the data at 25 c to predict induction times at higher or lower supersaturation than tested by he et al 1994 extrapolation was performed with a power law fits of the data 2 t i n d c a s o 4 55 5 s i 4 701 s i 0 20 t i n d c a s o 4 47 4 s i 4 858 s i 0 66 2 1 3 silica silica induction time data is limited so we fit a correlation to experimental observations of the delay in static and dynamic light scattering from supersaturated silica solutions reported in ref kempter et al 2013 3 t ind sio2 7 93 1018 w 5 57 where t ind sio2 is the induction time in seconds and w is the mass concentration of silica in mg l 2 2 modeling groundwater groundwater is highly variable in nature and thus no representative numbers for ion concentrations are readily available to describe average groundwater median salt concentrations were taken from the entire dataset produced by the us geological survey which contains over 120 000 samples qi and harris 2017 standard deviations of concentrations were taken from this dataset and added to the medians to represent a higher fouling case for both these sets of concentrations the nearest real sample of groundwater was used which was determined by comparing the concentrations of ca2 so4 2 cl na mg2 and hco3 2 gutentag et al 1984 with a least squares fit weighted for the scaling prone salts studied here see table 2 to predict nucleation in these sources the si s were calculated in phreeqc for the scaling prone salts at five different recovery ratios and a curve fit for these points was used as the si input to the induction time equations described above to create the contour maps in section 3 2 2 3 residence time in ro systems the residence time for steady ro is very long relative to batch processes because the initial nucleation causes a cascade of crystal growth from the first crystals secondary nucleation nucleation induction time must be calculated for the most fouling prone part of an ro module because steady ro is a continuous process the time period during which parts of the membrane are exposed to supersaturated conditions is long and can be estimated in several ways shirazi et al 2010 one calculation for this supersaturation time is examining the residence time of solutes near the membrane the maximum residence time in typical ro modules considering boundary layers at the membrane surface as derived in our previous report warsinger et al 2017c was found to be several days this residence time calculation used a methodology that considered module length and the boundary layer velocity at a distance from the wall that is related to the minimum size for stable crystals however for practical systems a more realistic maximum residence time may consider the various stagnant regions in the ro system such areas are only effectively purged of nucleating crystals during cleaning cycles consequently the residence time for continuous ro can be estimated by the time between cleaning processes which remove the supersaturated solution from these dead zones cleaning can occur as frequently as once a week but is typically less frequent shirazi et al 2010 based on these considerations for the purpose of comparing batch and continuous processes a residence time of 10000 s about 1 week is used for continuous ro in the results of section 2 3 irrespective of the precise value selected the residence time of the continuous ro processes is much greater than that of the batch process because the cycle time of a batch process is only a few minutes waly et al 2009 warsinger et al 2016b for batch processes the upper limit of residence time is considered to be the process cycle time during which permeate is produced the residence time for the batch and ccro systems is 4 t res t pass n pass t pass rr rr m 1 rr where t res is the residence time t pass is the time for a unit of fluid to complete one pass through the module i e the ratio of length to feed velocity rr is the recovery ratio for a complete cycle rr m is the recovery ratio from one pass through the module and n pass is the effective number of passes through the module the maximum salinity in batch ro varies cyclically as shown in fig 3 swaminathan et al 2017 although the system is only at the highest salinity for part of the cycle time induction times are calculated at the maximum concentration to give conservative predictions of fouling free conditions 2 4 predicting fouling by comparing induction and residence times prediction of fouling remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of fouling phenomena the stochastic nature of fouling and the very long times needed to experimentally gather data while exact prediction of fouling behavior is challenging inorganic fouling is better understood than other fouling types and models built from experimental data can yield useful insights despite variability in real conditions the nucleation of salts or inorganic fouling can be described by classical nucleation theory and eqns 1 2 and 4 provide empirical fits to the expected behavior for each foulant these equations describe nucleation in stirred cells and focus on nucleation in the fluid bulk such conditions are very similar to the fluid bulk in an ideal ro setup with minor differences in flow patterns data is not available for nucleation induction time in systems whose salinity varies over time as in batch ro however we can conservatively estimate nucleation induction time from the highest salinity occurring in batch ro contour maps describing fouling can be created using these nucleation equations and residence times in ro and batch ro systems the time axis for these maps describes sufficient time for nucleation of salts this time can be compared with the typical residence times of volumes of water within these systems these maps can visually show operating conditions prone to fouling as a function of time inlet salinity and final recovery the residence time of each ro process is plotted on these contour maps where a process line crosses into a fouling region significant fouling is expected in practice predicting fouling occurrence is very hard to do as other constituents impact fouling e g interaction with biofouling or suspended matter antiscalants ph modification and other mitigation methods also influence fouling the goal of this work is thus to use quantitative modelling for to gain qualitative insights when and how significantly does fouling differ between batch and continuous ro while the values shown here may be accurate for pure solutions they likely will differ for real solutions in industrial settings nevertheless using the methodology here and experimentally determined induction times individual maps of safe operating conditions can be made for any water source 3 results 3 1 experimental validation of theory although induction time correlations were derived from experimental data the relationship of nucleation induction time to the time delay before scaling in ro has not been previously validated our previous reports tow et al 2018 warsinger et al 2016a include measurements of flux decline due to caso4 scaling in a recirculating bench scale ro system which can be used to validate the theory developed in the present work a custom designed 8 cm long 3 cm wide 1 mm deep cross flow module was used with dow sw30hr ro membranes to filter supersaturated caso4 solutions at constant pressure for 36 h or until fouling had clearly occurred the supersaturated caso4 solutions were created by mixing sodium sulfate and calcium chloride solutions sodium and chloride are therefore also present at twice the caso4 concentration temperature was maintained at 20 1 c with a temperature controller feed concentration was maintained within 5 of the value stated in table 3 by periodically diluting the feed solution as it became more concentrated pressure was controlled with a back pressure regulator and chosen such that different trials had approximately the same initial flux flux was measured by recording the mass of permeate on a digital balance and calculating the rate of change over 15 min increments flux declined slightly in all trials due to membrane compaction but the flux decline rate was independent of feed concentration for the trials that had no fouling during 36 h for the trials with fouling flux declined significantly more than in the trials without fouling at least 20 over 36 h the time of onset of fouling was estimated from the flux decline data as the time when the flux decline curve diverged from the slight flux decline observed in the non fouling trials fouling and non fouling results were confirmed by visually examining used membranes significant crystallization was observed only in trials with significant flux decline for details of the experimental data collection see tow et al 2016 2018 theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of fouling onset time are given in table 3 tow et al 2018 the predictions in table 3 considered both the concentration in the bulk and the higher concentration at the membrane a result of concentration polarization kim et al 2009 see tow et al 2018 for details of calculations to calculate upper and lower bounds on induction time respectively as expected the experimental measurements of fouling time delay in ref tow et al 2018 fall within the range of nucleation induction times in the bulk feed and in the more concentrated solution near the membrane in the two experimental trials in which fouling occurred the time delay of fouling occurred between the lower and upper bounds of the model prediction with and without concentration polarization respectively in the three trials in which fouling did not occur the upper bound of the model prediction was greater than the duration of the experiment 36 h the difference between the two bounds on the predicted fouling time is very large and future studies should elucidate the role of concentration polarization in determining the delay before fouling however the success of the model in bounding experimentally measured fouling time delays helps to validate the use of induction time correlations to predict the time delay of fouling in ro 3 2 contour maps for fouling prediction the ro technologies residence times can be plotted on contour maps of fouling induction time with axes for recovery ratio and residence time the contours represent fouling occurrence colored by different initial saturation indexes where a technology curve crosses a fouling region induction time curve for a given feed inlet salinity significant bulk nucleation is expected to occur the intersection of the technology curves with a given region e g the batch ro line with the shaded region for 50 saturation give a maximum recovery possible before significant fouling notably batch and semi batch technologies have the same residence time and are both denoted by the batch curve the induction times for gypsum calcium sulfate dihydrate the least soluble form of caso4 at ro temperatures are shown in fig 4 1 1 the jagged appearance of the curves at longer induction times is due to the fact that induction time is interpolated from experimental data in ref he et al 1994 he et al 1994 for shorter induction times curves are extrapolated from the data using an exponential fit continuous ro is expected to begin fouling at moderate recovery ratios 54 for saturated solutions and at about 77 for feed solutions at half of that concentration meanwhile batch ro processes are expected not to foul until about 87 recovery for saturated solutions and above 90 for feed salinity starting at half the saturation concentration allowing for most of the typical operation range to be accessible as seen in fig 5 caco3 has relatively long induction times and is near saturation in many groundwater resources gutentag et al 1984 given the lengthy induction times for calcite batch systems are expected to offer less of an advantage over conventional ro for this salt compared to gypsum in figs 4 6 bulk nucleation occurs at a lower recovery ratio for continuous ro compared to the batch technologies for example for gypsum entering near saturation continuous ro with weekly backwash or cleaning will foul when the recovery has reached 53 but batch ro will not experience bulk precipitation until the recovery ratio is 87 similarly for caco3 beginning at half the saturation concentration continuous ro will experience bulk nucleation at a recovery of 90 while the batch systems will not see it until 93 these results show that because of the vastly shorter residence times and repeated subsaturated conditions it is possible for batch ro variants to handle much more saline brines without scaling this model can also predict the maximum recovery ratio achievable for each salt as a function of initial feed concentration fig 6 the maximum achievable recovery ratios is much higher for batch systems than continuous systems 3 3 implications for ro treatment of real feed waters in this section realistic mixed salt solutions are considered rather than the pure salt solutions discussed in the previous section here the above models are applied based on the inlet concentrations of representative water sources table 4 this includes seawater and average groundwater gutentag et al 1984 here graphs are provided to show maximum recovery before fouling with each salt occurs they include breakdowns by salt and water source instead of displaying both residence times and induction times as in previous sections the present section sets the operating time the cycle time in batch ro or the time between cleanings in continuous ro equal to the induction time to examine the maximum recovery ratio attainable without fouling these graphs provide insight into conditions where batch ro can significantly reduce fouling or raise water recovery the ion concentrations used as input for each water source and their calculated saturation indexes are given in table 4 the modeling for these solutions included the ions na k cl f ca2 mg2 so4 2 and co3 2 but only the ions present in the most likely scalants are tabulated these results neglect impacts of concentration polarization hydranautics 2001 which would reduce the maximum recovery ratio achievable in both continuous and batch ro as seen in fig 7 possible recovery ratios vary significantly by salt and water type unsurprisingly caco3 is the more likely scalant for groundwater the more concentrated groundwater is already supersaturated with calcite the model framework assumes sub saturated feed conditions and further research is necessary to determine how batch ro systems will perform with supersaturated feeds supersaturated feeds may benefit from pretreatment with ultrafiltration which can have sufficiently small pores to remove stable nuclei as well as ph reduction to raise the solubility of calcite caso4 begins to become a concern for groundwater with a standard deviation higher concentrations fig 7c although caco3 still dominates due to its lower solubility and high typical co3 2 concentrations meanwhile both salts are a concern for seawater with caso4 likely to foul first for the solutions given batch systems significantly improve the maximum recovery ratios achievable before bulk nucleation notably although these predictions indicate that seawater ro solutions will be saturated with caco3 when the recovery ratio reaches around 50 fouling is not predicted until much higher recovery ratios due to its long induction time in practice fouling is significantly altered by ph changes chemical softening and antiscalant additionally concentration polarization enhances supersaturation near the membrane and hence attainable bulk recoveries will be lower than those shown in fig 7 overall the composition of these representative groundwaters makes them more prone to fouling with caco3 in contrast seawater feeds are more prone to caso4 fouling batch ro has the potential to significantly raise water recovery without fouling for both seawater and groundwater 3 4 increased recovery for real ro brine due to the challenges associated with concentrate disposal raising water recovery in groundwater desalination is desirable however many ro systems have to limit water recovery in order to avoid scaling it may be possible to recover additional water by feeding a batch ro system with the ro concentrate from an existing continuous ro plant fig 8 2 water compositions specified by a competition for treating high fouling waters the us bureau of reclamation s more water less concentrate challenge stage 1 the u s environmental protection agency and water research foundation 2017 this approach is predicted to have cost savings compared to conventional treatment for high fouling waters and is predicted to be cheaper than even continuous ro under most conditions warsinger et al 2016d 2017b to explore this ability representative samples of inland brackish ro plant concentrate the u s environmental protection agency and water research foundation 2017 are shown in table 5 both concentrates are supersaturated with calcite but hcl addition to reduce the concentrate ph to 5 is sufficient to create sub saturated conditions throughout the subsequent batch ro step gomez morales et al 1996 using the induction time correlations given in this paper and a model of batch ro salinity 3 3 including concentration polarization as a function of time swaminathan et al 2017 induction time was calculated as a function of time batch ro concentration of both water samples fig 9 shows how the induction time of silica and gypsum varies over the duration of one cycle of batch ro treating the existing ro plant concentrate of samples a and b in sample a gypsum is the more likely scalant and the batch ro recovery ratio 58 is chosen such that the cycle time is just below the minimum gypsum induction time in sample b silica s induction time 4 4 the jagged appearance of gypsum induction time curves results from the interpolation of induction time experimental data is shorter so silica is the scale that limits the batch ro recovery ratio to 74 5 of the continuous ro plant concentrate flow rate calcite and other carbonates remain subsaturated throughout the entire concentration process because the ph was assumed to be reduced to 5 from the values in table 5 values through acid addition as seen in fig 8 therefore caco3 induction times are infinite and not shown in fig 9 as each batch cycle progresses the concentration of salts in contact with the membrane increases the recovery ratios for sample a and sample b are chosen so that the batch process duration is shorter than the induction time of any common scalant fig 10 shows the potential increase in total water recovery achievable by feeding the ro concentrate samples a and b to a batch ro system the recoveries achieved are around 90 for both samples as a result of increased water recovery there is less concentrate to dispose of which is especially beneficial when ro concentrate must be trucked away for disposal hutchings et al 2010 4 conclusions this study developed and validated a simple method of predicting the occurrence of scaling in batch ro systems the model equates the time delay of fouling to the nucleation induction time based on correlations from the literature the model was validated against experimental data for fouling time delay in continuous ro and used to predict the increase in recovery ratio achievable through the use of batch ro with different water sources through this study the following conclusions were reached the liquid residence times in batch including semi batch ro are 3 4 orders of magnitude shorter than in continuous ro which may explain batch systems resistance to membrane fouling batch ro systems can treat water to higher recovery without scaling than continuous ro systems for example in systems limited by caso4 scaling batch operation can reach high recoveries 90 under conditions that limit continuous ro recovery to 60 batch operation has the potential to further concentrate brine from existing continuous ro plants and reduce the volume of concentrate disposal which is particularly

19641,enhanced fouling resistance has been observed in recent variants of reverse osmosis ro desalination which use time varying batch or semi batch processes such as closed circuit ro ccro and pulse flow ro pfro however the mechanisms of batch processes fouling resistance are not well understood and models have not been developed for prediction of their fouling performance here a framework for predicting reverse osmosis fouling is developed by comparing the fluid residence time in batch and continuous conventional reverse osmosis systems to the nucleation induction times for crystallization of sparingly soluble salts this study considers the inorganic foulants calcium sulfate gypsum calcium carbonate calcite and silica and the work predicts maximum recovery ratios for the treatment of typical water sources using batch reverse osmosis bro and continuous reverse osmosis the prediction method is validated through comparisons to the measured time delay for caso4 membrane scaling in a bench scale recirculating reverse osmosis unit the maximum recovery ratio for each salt solution caco3 caso4 is individually predicted as a function of inlet salinity as shown in contour plots next the maximum recovery ratios of batch and conventional ro are compared across several water sources including seawater brackish groundwater and ro brine batch ro s shorter residence times associated with cycling from low to high salinity during each batch enable significantly higher recovery ratios and higher salinity than in continuous ro for all cases examined finally representative brackish ro brine samples were analyzed to determine the maximum possible recovery with batch ro overall the induction time modeling methodology provided here can be used to allow batch ro to operate at high salinity and high recovery while controlling scaling the results show that in addition to its known energy efficiency improvement batch ro has superior inorganic fouling resistance relative to

technology reverse osmosis ro chakraborty et al 2015 shirazi et al 2010 ro is considered to be particularly vulnerable to scaling in comparison to thermal technologies such as membrane distillation or multistage flash distillation tow et al 2018 warsinger et al 2015d 2017c despite this ro is the most widely used and energy efficient desalination technology mcgovern and lienhard 2014 thiel et al 2015 tow et al 2015 warsinger et al 2015b and improving this technology s fouling resistance is critical to operational efficiency and longevity cohen et al 2017 batch systems as opposed to continuous systems offer a new approach to significant fouling and efficiency improvements warsinger et al 2016b in continuous ro systems the membrane elements near the end of the train may contact supersaturated solution for extended time periods between cleanings greenlee et al 2009 however recirculating batch and semi batch systems frequently flush the concentrated solution out with fresh feed as a result no part of the membrane train remains in contact with supersaturated solutions for a prolonged period 1 1 batch ro the term batch in this study refers to a desalination process wherein a set quantity of feed solution is concentrated over time up to the required final brine salinity and this process is repeated to produce large amounts of permeate batch desalination configurations have time varying salinity often achieving this via recirculation to further concentrate a contained volume of fluid qiu and davies 2012a the recirculating brine is rejected at the end of each cycle batch desalination technologies efraty et al 2011 qiu and davies 2012a have also shown robust resistance to membrane fouling efraty and septon 2012 although a theoretical explanation for this is lacking in the literature these fouling improvements are seen in a new semi batch process pulse flow ro pfro liberman 2017 2018 and also in another rapidly growing technology semi batch ro process called ccro or closed circuit reverse osmosis and trademarked as ccd or closed circuit desalination stover 2013 the technology is classified as a semi batch process because although it cycles salinity over time it continuously introduces new feed water to the system the semi batch design allows for improvement over traditional ro with a similar design and flow parameters and can be retrofitted into existing systems batch ro see e g fig 1 is expected to have very similar advantages with some energy efficiency improvements over ccro due to reduced entropy of mixing warsinger et al 2016b in ccro continuous mixing occurs between the recirculating brine and the lower salinity feed this mixing increases the average osmotic pressure in comparison to batch ro and makes higher recoveries more energy intensive to achieve ccro has been tested to recoveries as high as 97 for brackish waters although 82 92 is more typical stover 2013 these levels greatly exceed typical ro recovery ratios shirazi et al 2010 1 2 fouling in ro fouling occurs when organic inorganic or biological water contaminants attach to the membrane tong et al 2017 fouling on ro membranes reduces permeate flux and quality hoek et al 2008 salvador cob et al 2012 increases the streamwise pressure drop as the feed flows across the membrane decreases energy efficiency and leads to more frequent membrane replacement and the need for extensive pretreatment comstock et al 2011 malki 2008 warsinger et al 2015e these effects lead to higher operational costs for an ro facility which in turn affect water cost resistance to fouling of various types including inorganic organic and biological has thus been an important long term focus of research inorganic fouling the accumulation of salts and other inorganic substances such as silica on membranes can be avoided by operating the process under conditions that prevent nucleation of crystals d m warsinger et al 2016e f pomerantz et al 2006 warsinger et al 2015a here we show that avoidance of crystal nucleation by rapid salinity cycling is a potentially major advantage of the batch processes compared to conventional steady ro time varying conditions like those found in batch processes may also inhibit biofouling warsinger et al 2015e the susceptibility of ro membranes to damage by fouling has prompted the development of other processes such as membrane distillation rezaei et al 2017 servi et al 2017 warsinger et al 2014 and forward osmosis boo et al 2012 which are thought to exhibit greater resistance to fouling tow et al 2018 tow and lienhard 2017 warsinger et al 2017a 2017c xie et al 2015 furthermore a trend in environmental legislation mandates for zero liquid discharge zld to reduce pollution from brine waste is requiring many applications to use higher recoveries qiu and davies 2012b additionally newer ro membranes have focused on increasing permeability and membrane flux to reduce sizes and costs cohen tanugi et al 2014 but these higher fluxes although bounded by the limiting effect of concentration polarization mcgovern and lienhard 2016 may still lead to increased fouling as wastewater reuse increases and the adverse effects of groundwater salinity on agriculture continue to grow cohen et al 2018 ro is increasingly being used for water sources other than seawater kumar et al 2017 at higher recovery ratios of brackish water inorganic fouling has a greater impact on system performance high concentrations of common dissolved ions such as ca2 so4 2 and co3 2 are also significant factors in system fouling khan et al 2014 harvested foulant layers from ro membranes used to treat seawater and secondary wastewater effluent in a pilot plant and found that although organic foulants dominated in seawater ro and on the first membrane of wastewater ro inorganic foulants comprised 88 9 by mass of the foulant layer on the last membrane in the wastewater ro train some sparingly soluble salts common in the scaling of desalination systems are listed in table 1 caco3 and caso4 are the most common fouling concerns in typical desalination systems comstock et al 2011 jawor and hoek 2009 yang 2005 solubility is calculated using phreeqc software parkhurst and appelo 2013 using the phreeqc database for activity coefficients and data from a variety of sources on the standard state ion concentration thiel and lienhard 2014 scaling mitigation can involve reducing supersaturation through pretreatment prolonging the induction time through antiscalant addition shirazi et al 2010 or as proposed in the present study keeping the residence time of supersaturated solutions under the nucleation induction time knowledge of crystallization kinetics can be used to avoid or minimize scaling under supersaturated conditions crystallization is delayed for a period of time known as the nucleation induction time which is the time needed for stable crystals to form under given conditions çelikbilek et al 2012 warsinger et al 2017c this delay occurs because very small nuclei of a few hundred atoms are unstable in supersaturated conditions due to competition between the interfacial energy of the crystal surface and the change in gibbs energy of the solid relative to the salt in solution çelikbilek et al 2012 nagy and braatz 2012 1 3 fouling in batch and semi batch ro applications of batch and semi batch ro have demonstrated substantial fouling resistance stover 2012 has proposed that ccro can reduce fouling and scaling through the time variation of water composition at the membrane tarquin and delgado 2012 reported that batch ro may be especially resistant to fouling and scaling based on experiments in which fouling was not observed even with brackish water under high concentrations of silica and calcium sulfates at 90 recovery several studies have shown ccro to be resistant to silica fouling sonera et al 2015 in one such study the system began at around half saturation 57 ppm with a ph of 5 5 and went to 93 8 recovery without any evidence of silica fouling notably an antiscalant was used but antiscalants largely delay nucleation rather than alter saturation levels shirazi et al 2010 another ccro study began at around one quarter of silica saturation 32 ppm and went to 96 recovery without any evidence of fouling gal et al 2016 a third study began near saturation 125 ppt with 85 recovery efraty 2015 slight flux decline was observed over 23 min of run time ccro plants that begin with supersaturated foulants such as silica have exhibited heavy fouling efraty 2015 the trend seems to be that even for systems that concentrate past saturation fouling is minimal if the starting feed is subsaturated this observation hints that frequently returning to sub saturated concentrations may be the key to avoiding fouling and modeling the mechanism behind any fouling that does occur will allow the system to push the limits of fouling free operation a substantial advantage that batch and semi batch processes have over traditional steady flow ro is their transient operation which limits the time period of supersaturated conditions periodically they eject all of the brine and refill the system with feed water as long as no crystals have yet formed and the feed is subsaturated progress toward nucleation should be undone at the end of each cycle when brine is rejected from the system warsinger et al 2015c crystals that have formed may also dissolve in contrast continuous ro operates at steady state so high salinity stages for higher recovery operations may run at supersaturated conditions almost indefinitely causing fouling bartman et al 2011 chai et al 2007 the long times of supersaturation in continuous ro are only interrupted by periodic cleaning processes which can be as infrequent as weeks or months in industrial applications notably batch ro has an additional advantage not discussed here batch cycles have a natural osmotic backwash step at the end of each cycle when pressure is reduced with salty brine inside the membrane elements osmotic backwash ramon and hoek 2012 sagiv et al 2008 tow et al 2016 and flow reversal bartman et al 2009 gu et al 2013 have proven to be effective anti fouling strategies in continuous ro in this paper we compare the cycle time of batch ro to the time between cleaning processes in continuous ro these times are then compared to the nucleation induction time to estimate what recovery ratios can be achieved before scaling occurs in either system an expression for residence time in batch and semi batch systems is developed and nucleation induction time is correlated from existing measurements for common scalants caso4 and caco3 results are displayed as contour plots of fouling zones as a function of inlet feed salinity and recovery ratio which include batch and continuous ro paths the use of nucleation induction time to predict the time delay for scaling in ro is validated against experimental data for calcium sulfate solutions the methods are applied to key water types seawater and groundwater and used to predict the potential of batch ro to increase water recovery from representative ro brines these results provide upper bounds on safe operating conditions as membranes themselves may play an additional role in promoting the crystal nucleation elimelech et al 1997 2 modeling methodology this study predicts fouling by comparing fluid residence time to nucleation induction time the fluid residence time is defined as the time during which any part of the membrane module is supersaturated in continuous ro this is the time between cleaning processes and in batch ro the residence time is conservatively considered to be the permeate production period of each cycle the other relevant timescale is the nucleation induction time for salt crystals the time required for stable crystals to form in a supersaturated solution which can range from minutes to days depending on the degree of supersaturation and other conditions chesters 2009 batch cycle times may be shorter than the times for nucleation induction of common foulants such as caso4 and caco3 pomerantz et al 2006 as a result systems starting operation at sub saturated conditions may be able to run up to concentrations several times saturation without causing crystallization to determine whether fouling is likely to occur the length of time over which the feed is supersaturated in an ro system is compared to the nucleation induction time which is calculated from feed concentration using existing correlations he et al 1994 xyla et al 1992 fig 2 illustrates this comparison 2 1 nucleation induction time in this section we report or develop correlations for the nucleation induction time for three common scalants caco3 caso4 and silica although these induction times are derived from experiments in stirred liquids with stirrer bars and recirculating baths he et al 1999 we assume that they apply to the moving fluids in ro systems the same assumption enabled successful prediction of gypsum scaling in membrane distillation systems in our previous report warsinger et al 2017c these correlations are based on the assumption of pure salt solutions in which ph is determined by concentration to include the effects of ph in real waters the saturation index si used in the induction time correlations is calculated using phreeqc for each solution s composition and ph however additional impacts of ph and the presence of other species on induction time are not accounted for in the present model due to the lack of available data on these effects 2 1 1 calcium carbonate the nucleation induction time of caco3 was calculated using a correlation from refs he et al 1999 xyla et al 1992 1 t ind caco 3 10 a 1 a 2 si a 3 t a 4 si t where t ind is the induction time si is the saturation index t is the absolute temperature in k and the empirically determined constants are as follows a 1 4 22 a 2 13 8 a 3 1876 4 and a 4 6259 6 the solubility of calcite was evaluated at ph 7 adjusting the concentration of co32 to satisfy electroneutrality 2 1 2 calcium sulfate the nucleation induction time of calcium sulfate as gypsum caso4 2h2o was calculated using linear interpolation within table 1 of ref he et al 1994 for the data at 25 c to predict induction times at higher or lower supersaturation than tested by he et al 1994 extrapolation was performed with a power law fits of the data 2 t i n d c a s o 4 55 5 s i 4 701 s i 0 20 t i n d c a s o 4 47 4 s i 4 858 s i 0 66 2 1 3 silica silica induction time data is limited so we fit a correlation to experimental observations of the delay in static and dynamic light scattering from supersaturated silica solutions reported in ref kempter et al 2013 3 t ind sio2 7 93 1018 w 5 57 where t ind sio2 is the induction time in seconds and w is the mass concentration of silica in mg l 2 2 modeling groundwater groundwater is highly variable in nature and thus no representative numbers for ion concentrations are readily available to describe average groundwater median salt concentrations were taken from the entire dataset produced by the us geological survey which contains over 120 000 samples qi and harris 2017 standard deviations of concentrations were taken from this dataset and added to the medians to represent a higher fouling case for both these sets of concentrations the nearest real sample of groundwater was used which was determined by comparing the concentrations of ca2 so4 2 cl na mg2 and hco3 2 gutentag et al 1984 with a least squares fit weighted for the scaling prone salts studied here see table 2 to predict nucleation in these sources the si s were calculated in phreeqc for the scaling prone salts at five different recovery ratios and a curve fit for these points was used as the si input to the induction time equations described above to create the contour maps in section 3 2 2 3 residence time in ro systems the residence time for steady ro is very long relative to batch processes because the initial nucleation causes a cascade of crystal growth from the first crystals secondary nucleation nucleation induction time must be calculated for the most fouling prone part of an ro module because steady ro is a continuous process the time period during which parts of the membrane are exposed to supersaturated conditions is long and can be estimated in several ways shirazi et al 2010 one calculation for this supersaturation time is examining the residence time of solutes near the membrane the maximum residence time in typical ro modules considering boundary layers at the membrane surface as derived in our previous report warsinger et al 2017c was found to be several days this residence time calculation used a methodology that considered module length and the boundary layer velocity at a distance from the wall that is related to the minimum size for stable crystals however for practical systems a more realistic maximum residence time may consider the various stagnant regions in the ro system such areas are only effectively purged of nucleating crystals during cleaning cycles consequently the residence time for continuous ro can be estimated by the time between cleaning processes which remove the supersaturated solution from these dead zones cleaning can occur as frequently as once a week but is typically less frequent shirazi et al 2010 based on these considerations for the purpose of comparing batch and continuous processes a residence time of 10000 s about 1 week is used for continuous ro in the results of section 2 3 irrespective of the precise value selected the residence time of the continuous ro processes is much greater than that of the batch process because the cycle time of a batch process is only a few minutes waly et al 2009 warsinger et al 2016b for batch processes the upper limit of residence time is considered to be the process cycle time during which permeate is produced the residence time for the batch and ccro systems is 4 t res t pass n pass t pass rr rr m 1 rr where t res is the residence time t pass is the time for a unit of fluid to complete one pass through the module i e the ratio of length to feed velocity rr is the recovery ratio for a complete cycle rr m is the recovery ratio from one pass through the module and n pass is the effective number of passes through the module the maximum salinity in batch ro varies cyclically as shown in fig 3 swaminathan et al 2017 although the system is only at the highest salinity for part of the cycle time induction times are calculated at the maximum concentration to give conservative predictions of fouling free conditions 2 4 predicting fouling by comparing induction and residence times prediction of fouling remains a significant challenge due to the complexity of fouling phenomena the stochastic nature of fouling and the very long times needed to experimentally gather data while exact prediction of fouling behavior is challenging inorganic fouling is better understood than other fouling types and models built from experimental data can yield useful insights despite variability in real conditions the nucleation of salts or inorganic fouling can be described by classical nucleation theory and eqns 1 2 and 4 provide empirical fits to the expected behavior for each foulant these equations describe nucleation in stirred cells and focus on nucleation in the fluid bulk such conditions are very similar to the fluid bulk in an ideal ro setup with minor differences in flow patterns data is not available for nucleation induction time in systems whose salinity varies over time as in batch ro however we can conservatively estimate nucleation induction time from the highest salinity occurring in batch ro contour maps describing fouling can be created using these nucleation equations and residence times in ro and batch ro systems the time axis for these maps describes sufficient time for nucleation of salts this time can be compared with the typical residence times of volumes of water within these systems these maps can visually show operating conditions prone to fouling as a function of time inlet salinity and final recovery the residence time of each ro process is plotted on these contour maps where a process line crosses into a fouling region significant fouling is expected in practice predicting fouling occurrence is very hard to do as other constituents impact fouling e g interaction with biofouling or suspended matter antiscalants ph modification and other mitigation methods also influence fouling the goal of this work is thus to use quantitative modelling for to gain qualitative insights when and how significantly does fouling differ between batch and continuous ro while the values shown here may be accurate for pure solutions they likely will differ for real solutions in industrial settings nevertheless using the methodology here and experimentally determined induction times individual maps of safe operating conditions can be made for any water source 3 results 3 1 experimental validation of theory although induction time correlations were derived from experimental data the relationship of nucleation induction time to the time delay before scaling in ro has not been previously validated our previous reports tow et al 2018 warsinger et al 2016a include measurements of flux decline due to caso4 scaling in a recirculating bench scale ro system which can be used to validate the theory developed in the present work a custom designed 8 cm long 3 cm wide 1 mm deep cross flow module was used with dow sw30hr ro membranes to filter supersaturated caso4 solutions at constant pressure for 36 h or until fouling had clearly occurred the supersaturated caso4 solutions were created by mixing sodium sulfate and calcium chloride solutions sodium and chloride are therefore also present at twice the caso4 concentration temperature was maintained at 20 1 c with a temperature controller feed concentration was maintained within 5 of the value stated in table 3 by periodically diluting the feed solution as it became more concentrated pressure was controlled with a back pressure regulator and chosen such that different trials had approximately the same initial flux flux was measured by recording the mass of permeate on a digital balance and calculating the rate of change over 15 min increments flux declined slightly in all trials due to membrane compaction but the flux decline rate was independent of feed concentration for the trials that had no fouling during 36 h for the trials with fouling flux declined significantly more than in the trials without fouling at least 20 over 36 h the time of onset of fouling was estimated from the flux decline data as the time when the flux decline curve diverged from the slight flux decline observed in the non fouling trials fouling and non fouling results were confirmed by visually examining used membranes significant crystallization was observed only in trials with significant flux decline for details of the experimental data collection see tow et al 2016 2018 theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of fouling onset time are given in table 3 tow et al 2018 the predictions in table 3 considered both the concentration in the bulk and the higher concentration at the membrane a result of concentration polarization kim et al 2009 see tow et al 2018 for details of calculations to calculate upper and lower bounds on induction time respectively as expected the experimental measurements of fouling time delay in ref tow et al 2018 fall within the range of nucleation induction times in the bulk feed and in the more concentrated solution near the membrane in the two experimental trials in which fouling occurred the time delay of fouling occurred between the lower and upper bounds of the model prediction with and without concentration polarization respectively in the three trials in which fouling did not occur the upper bound of the model prediction was greater than the duration of the experiment 36 h the difference between the two bounds on the predicted fouling time is very large and future studies should elucidate the role of concentration polarization in determining the delay before fouling however the success of the model in bounding experimentally measured fouling time delays helps to validate the use of induction time correlations to predict the time delay of fouling in ro 3 2 contour maps for fouling prediction the ro technologies residence times can be plotted on contour maps of fouling induction time with axes for recovery ratio and residence time the contours represent fouling occurrence colored by different initial saturation indexes where a technology curve crosses a fouling region induction time curve for a given feed inlet salinity significant bulk nucleation is expected to occur the intersection of the technology curves with a given region e g the batch ro line with the shaded region for 50 saturation give a maximum recovery possible before significant fouling notably batch and semi batch technologies have the same residence time and are both denoted by the batch curve the induction times for gypsum calcium sulfate dihydrate the least soluble form of caso4 at ro temperatures are shown in fig 4 1 1 the jagged appearance of the curves at longer induction times is due to the fact that induction time is interpolated from experimental data in ref he et al 1994 he et al 1994 for shorter induction times curves are extrapolated from the data using an exponential fit continuous ro is expected to begin fouling at moderate recovery ratios 54 for saturated solutions and at about 77 for feed solutions at half of that concentration meanwhile batch ro processes are expected not to foul until about 87 recovery for saturated solutions and above 90 for feed salinity starting at half the saturation concentration allowing for most of the typical operation range to be accessible as seen in fig 5 caco3 has relatively long induction times and is near saturation in many groundwater resources gutentag et al 1984 given the lengthy induction times for calcite batch systems are expected to offer less of an advantage over conventional ro for this salt compared to gypsum in figs 4 6 bulk nucleation occurs at a lower recovery ratio for continuous ro compared to the batch technologies for example for gypsum entering near saturation continuous ro with weekly backwash or cleaning will foul when the recovery has reached 53 but batch ro will not experience bulk precipitation until the recovery ratio is 87 similarly for caco3 beginning at half the saturation concentration continuous ro will experience bulk nucleation at a recovery of 90 while the batch systems will not see it until 93 these results show that because of the vastly shorter residence times and repeated subsaturated conditions it is possible for batch ro variants to handle much more saline brines without scaling this model can also predict the maximum recovery ratio achievable for each salt as a function of initial feed concentration fig 6 the maximum achievable recovery ratios is much higher for batch systems than continuous systems 3 3 implications for ro treatment of real feed waters in this section realistic mixed salt solutions are considered rather than the pure salt solutions discussed in the previous section here the above models are applied based on the inlet concentrations of representative water sources table 4 this includes seawater and average groundwater gutentag et al 1984 here graphs are provided to show maximum recovery before fouling with each salt occurs they include breakdowns by salt and water source instead of displaying both residence times and induction times as in previous sections the present section sets the operating time the cycle time in batch ro or the time between cleanings in continuous ro equal to the induction time to examine the maximum recovery ratio attainable without fouling these graphs provide insight into conditions where batch ro can significantly reduce fouling or raise water recovery the ion concentrations used as input for each water source and their calculated saturation indexes are given in table 4 the modeling for these solutions included the ions na k cl f ca2 mg2 so4 2 and co3 2 but only the ions present in the most likely scalants are tabulated these results neglect impacts of concentration polarization hydranautics 2001 which would reduce the maximum recovery ratio achievable in both continuous and batch ro as seen in fig 7 possible recovery ratios vary significantly by salt and water type unsurprisingly caco3 is the more likely scalant for groundwater the more concentrated groundwater is already supersaturated with calcite the model framework assumes sub saturated feed conditions and further research is necessary to determine how batch ro systems will perform with supersaturated feeds supersaturated feeds may benefit from pretreatment with ultrafiltration which can have sufficiently small pores to remove stable nuclei as well as ph reduction to raise the solubility of calcite caso4 begins to become a concern for groundwater with a standard deviation higher concentrations fig 7c although caco3 still dominates due to its lower solubility and high typical co3 2 concentrations meanwhile both salts are a concern for seawater with caso4 likely to foul first for the solutions given batch systems significantly improve the maximum recovery ratios achievable before bulk nucleation notably although these predictions indicate that seawater ro solutions will be saturated with caco3 when the recovery ratio reaches around 50 fouling is not predicted until much higher recovery ratios due to its long induction time in practice fouling is significantly altered by ph changes chemical softening and antiscalant additionally concentration polarization enhances supersaturation near the membrane and hence attainable bulk recoveries will be lower than those shown in fig 7 overall the composition of these representative groundwaters makes them more prone to fouling with caco3 in contrast seawater feeds are more prone to caso4 fouling batch ro has the potential to significantly raise water recovery without fouling for both seawater and groundwater 3 4 increased recovery for real ro brine due to the challenges associated with concentrate disposal raising water recovery in groundwater desalination is desirable however many ro systems have to limit water recovery in order to avoid scaling it may be possible to recover additional water by feeding a batch ro system with the ro concentrate from an existing continuous ro plant fig 8 2

water research foundation 2017 this approach is predicted to have cost savings compared to conventional treatment for high fouling waters and is predicted to be cheaper than even continuous ro under most conditions warsinger et al 2016d 2017b to explore this ability representative samples of inland brackish ro plant concentrate the u s environmental protection agency and water research foundation 2017 are shown in table 5 both concentrates are supersaturated with calcite but hcl addition to reduce the concentrate ph to 5 is sufficient to create sub saturated conditions throughout the subsequent batch ro step gomez morales et al 1996 using the induction time correlations given in this paper and a model of batch ro salinity 3 3 including concentration polarization as a function of time swaminathan et al 2017 induction time was calculated as a function of time batch ro concentration of both water samples fig 9 shows how the induction time of silica and gypsum varies over the duration of one cycle of batch ro treating the existing ro plant concentrate of samples a and b in sample a gypsum is the more likely scalant and the batch ro recovery ratio 58 is chosen such that the cycle time is just below the minimum gypsum induction time in sample b silica s induction time 4 4 the jagged appearance of gypsum induction time curves results from the interpolation of induction time experimental data is shorter so silica is the scale that limits the batch ro recovery ratio to 74 5 of the continuous ro plant concentrate flow rate calcite and other carbonates remain subsaturated throughout the entire concentration process because the ph was assumed to be reduced to 5 from the values in table 5 values through acid addition as seen in fig 8 therefore caco3 induction times are infinite and not shown in fig 9 as each batch cycle progresses the concentration of salts in contact with the membrane increases the recovery ratios for sample a and sample b are chosen so that the batch process duration is shorter than the induction time of any common scalant fig 10 shows the potential increase in total water recovery achievable by feeding the ro concentrate samples a and b to a batch ro system the recoveries achieved are around 90 for both samples as a result of increased water recovery there is less concentrate to dispose of which is especially beneficial when ro concentrate must be trucked away for disposal hutchings et al 2010 4 conclusions this study developed and validated a simple method of predicting the occurrence of scaling in batch ro systems the model equates the time delay of fouling to the nucleation induction time based on correlations from the literature the model was validated against experimental data for fouling time delay in continuous ro and used to predict the increase in recovery ratio achievable through the use of batch ro with different water sources through this study the following conclusions were reached the liquid residence times in batch including semi batch ro are 3 4 orders of magnitude shorter than in continuous ro which may explain batch systems resistance to membrane fouling batch ro systems can treat water to higher recovery without scaling than continuous ro systems for example in systems limited by caso4 scaling batch operation can reach high recoveries 90 under conditions that limit continuous ro recovery to 60 batch operation has the potential to further concentrate brine from existing continuous ro plants and reduce the volume of concentrate disposal which is particularly beneficial at inland water desalination plants author contributions david led the overall research effort proposed the methodology carried out modeling figs 4 8 created most graphics graphical

19642,baseline biogeochemical surveys of natural environments is an often overlooked field of environmental studies too often research begins once contamination has occurred with a knowledge gap as to how the affected area behaved prior to outside often anthropogenic influences these baseline characterizations can provide insight into proposed bioremediation strategies crucial in cleaning up chemical spill sites or heavily mined regions hence this study was conducted to survey the in situ microbial activity within freshwater hydrocarbon rich environments cutting through the mcmurray formation the geologic strata constituting the oil sands we are the first to report in situ functional variations among these freshwater microbial ecosystems using metatranscriptomics providing insight into the in situ gene expression within these naturally hydrocarbon rich sites key genes involved in energy metabolism nitrogen sulfur and methane and hydrocarbon degradation including transcripts relating to the observed expression of methane oxidation are reported this information provides better linkages between hydrocarbon impacted environments closing knowledge gaps for optimizing not only oil sands mine reclamation but also enhancing microbial reclamation strategies in various freshwater environments these finding can also be applied to existing contaminated environments in need of efficient reclamation efforts graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrocarbons metatranscriptomics microbial biodegradation metabolism sediments 1 introduction understanding the biogeochemical function within natural aquatic ecosystems is a necessity given the inevitable impacts of climate change and broad ranging anthropogenic stressors aquatic ecosystems respond readily to external inputs altering entire biogeochemical signatures with impacts on ecosystem health possibly extending throughout the entire food web microbes the dominant driver of chemical cycling will inevitably alter their function to accommodate nutrient fluxes within their surrounding environment when subjected to increased levels of hydrocarbons for example utilization of these hydrocarbons as an energy source is to their advantage given the global ubiquity of hydrocarbons in our aquatic ecosystems studying environments chronically exposed to naturally occurring hydrocarbon sources i e bitumen coal deposits etc can provide great insight into how microbes function in these complex environments several studies have characterized microbial activity in hydrocarbon rich marine spill sites legacy contaminant sediments alongside natural hydrothermal vents boufadel and michel 2008 bragg et al 1994 kappell et al 2014 kimes et al 2014 king et al 2015 mason et al 2012 pritchard et al 1992 zhang et al 2015 however microbial dynamics in association with freshwater hydrocarbon rich environments is still poorly studied in northern alberta canada the mcmurray formation is a bituminous sand layer constituting the athabasca oil sands rivers cut through this formation providing a major conduit of hydrocarbon expression into the natural environment fig 1 erosion transportation and deposition of the bitumen has a profound effect on the natural chemistry and overall health of these ecosystems these unique natural hydrocarbon outcrops provide an interesting environment from which to compare natural microbial metabolism in the presence of hydrocarbons between regional outcrop sites if the microbes in these ecosystems are naturally metabolizing these complex compounds and their metabolic pathways can be characterized then reclamation efforts within the industrial oil sands mining areas can utilize these baseline characterizations for optimizing reclamation strategies furthermore this environment gives a unique opportunity to study biodegradation in a freshwater boreal setting unlike the many marine based studies in recent years until now studies in this region have stopped at taxonomic assessments alongside geochemical surveys yergeau et al 2012 this can be attributed to not only logistical difficulties accessing these sites but also molecular difficulties in attempting to extract viable messenger rna that which shows active gene transcription from such complex sediments the mcmurray formation is characterized by a complex hydrocarbon mixture of both unsubstituted and substituted species dominated by sulfur and nitrogen compounds aromatic hydrocarbons chlorinated hydrocarbons and linear and chained alkanes are widely studied due to their persistence in the environment and their complexity in terms of the breadth of variation between chemical structures dabestani and lvanov 1999 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are most difficult to degrade as opposed to linear alkanes due to their complex ringed structure and are found both naturally in these hydrocarbon rich environments as well as in industrially influenced sites dabestani and lvanov ilia n 1999 haritash and kaushik 2009 the atmospheric release can also contribute to the spatial distribution of pahs because of the combustion of various compounds from industrial processes including automotive emissions ravindra et al 2008 natural contributions can also occur as a result of the many forest fires in the area ravindra et al 2008 in the natural environment the native microbial consortia will utilize these complex molecules in their energy metabolism as they are a readily available carbon source however many studies involve potentially biased cultured microbial consortia thus studying environments containing naturally occurring hydrocarbon outcrops is a unique opportunity for an unbiased functional analysis ghazali et al 2004 jaekel et al 2015 furthermore in a natural freshwater setting it could be that microbial community development has evolved to metabolize certain groups of hydrocarbons though this remains poorly understood identifying novel degradation pathways under various redox conditions in natural reference systems could provide insight into the potential for enhanced microbial reclamation strategies in existing contaminate environments where bioremediation is a potential option the importance of characterizing actual microbial gene expression in the natural environment should not be overlooked as conventional taxonomic assessments and subsequent inferences are becoming a risky venture high throughput sequencing has further emphasized the vastly complex microbial phylogenetic tree with ongoing studies proving this complexity is only growing hug et al 2016 long et al 2016 lynch and neufeld 2015 pace 1997 microbial species that differ by only fractions of a percent in terms of their genetic code make the quest for taxonomic identification and subsequent functional inferences a shot in the dark in some cases hanage et al 2006 konstantinidis and tiedje 2005 rosselli et al 2016 recent studies identifying microbes with single genes or perhaps closely related homologs being responsible for multiple processes has further emphasized the need for microbial characterization on an expression and activity level chistoserdova et al 2005 this study investigates the dominant hydrocarbon signatures and in situ microbial function within 3 major freshwater tributaries of the lower athabasca river which cut through the mcmurray formation including a unique groundwater bitumen seep functional processes relating to energy metabolism and hydrocarbon degradation at these sites will be discussed with inferences as to how these findings can be utilized in actual contaminant environments for improving aquatic resource management 2 methodology 2 1 sampling site descriptions in situ sampling sites fig 1 were chosen at natural locations known to contain bitumen outcrops outside direct mining sites the site named groundwater plume gp appeared the most visually untouched though historical chemical data table 1 aemera 2016 suggests the highest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah concentrations compared to the other two sites in 1974 1975 syncrude canada ltd performed a baseline study of ruth lake and poplar creek before the commencement of hydrocarbon extraction from lease no 17 since beaver creek had to be diverted from the mining area obviously this was before to advanced sequencing technologies so baseline measurements consisted of fairly standard chemical measurements and benthic flora and fauna syncrude 1975 wasmund et al 2009 this site is truly a unique groundwater plume system included here as a novel baseline environment steepbank river stb is closest to the mining activity in terms of proximity and contained large volumes of bitumen outcropping on the riverbank stb water also was high in pah content and overall humic substances environment and climate change canada has several long term monitoring studies recording water quality data from the chosen sample sites finally ells river er sample site is located north of industrial mining sites though still had a large amount of bitumen outcropping from the riverbank historical data suggested that er has relatively low pah levels both parent and substituted relative to gp but only slightly less than stb 2 2 sediment sample collection and pah analysis in situ sample collection and preservation took place on september 2 2015 at the 3 sites explained in the previous section fig 1 sediment samples from the river banks at each site were taken in sterile rnase and dnase free 5 ml cryogenic vials and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen within the molecular dimensions dry shipper cx100 riverbed sediments were collected in duplicate at the river s edge directly below the hydrocarbon outcrops consisting of surface sediments down to approximately 1 2 cm depth samples remained in liquid nitrogen until returning to the lab in which they were stored at 80 c until extractions were performed 2 3 pah analyses samples for polycyclic aromatic compound pac analysis were sent for analysis at the pacific yukon laboratory for environmental testing at environment and climate change canada eccc dichloromethane dcm extractions were performed on bulk solids samples after deuterated surrogate standards were added following shaking and centrifugation extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry gc ms ms agilent technologies inc santa clara ca usa two standard calibration curves were used high 0 01 2 μg ml and low 0 1 10 ng ml for quantification in multiple reaction monitoring mode mrm in accordance with pac and substituted pac concentrations to cover the range of c1 c4 carbon substitutions an appropriate range of retention times was used to integrate the substituted pac homolog groups and calculations based on authentic substituted pac standard response factors isomer pairs are reported in cases where compounds could not be isolated on the ms given equal masses e g c1 phenanthrene anthracene data is publicly accessible via the canada alberta oil sands environmental monitoring data portal http donnees ec gc ca data the practical limit of quantification was 0 02 μg g and 0 04 μg g for unsubstituted and substituted pacs respectively the limit of detection was 0 01 μg g and 0 02 μg g dry weight solids for unsubstituted and substituted pacs respectively 2 4 sediment rna isolation and quality control rna was extracted from each sediment sample with the mobio powersoil total rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc ca with slightly modified protocols concerning manufacturer guidelines samples were slowly thawed in their cryogenic vials on ice and immediately added to extraction tubes in a still semi frozen state as to minimize rna degradation all reagents and instruments extraction tubes pipet tips strippettes etc were kept chilled on ice before and during use when feasible further 5 g of sediment was added to each extraction tube and subsequent reagent additions were adjusted for this additional volume the precipitation of rna was performed for 24 h at 20 c to increase rna yield following final centrifugation the pellet was dissolved in 30 μl rnase free water to concentrate the extracted rna further aliquots of extracted rna isolations were kept at 80 c until quality control and sequencing was performed 2 5 rna library construction and sequencing rna extractions were sent for transcriptome analysis on the illumina hiseq 2000 at the genome quebec innovation center at mcgill university in montreal quebec canada extracted rna was analyzed in house to assure sufficient quality for sequencing on the illumina hiseq 2000 samples with rna integrity numbers rin over 7 and concentrations of at least 100 ng ul were sent off for analysis with additional qc checks performed at genome quebec prior to sequencing depletion of rrna was also performed before sequencing using the illumina ribo zero rrna removal kit for bacteria enhancing mrna quantity in each sample for improved functional assignments duplicate samples were sequenced to ensure sample accuracy 2 6 bioinformatic analysis paired end reads obtained from illumina hiseq were uploaded to the mg rast meta genome rapid annotation using subsystem technology v3 1 server at the argonne national library http metagenomics anl gov meyer et al 2008 this automated bioanalysis pipeline is used for the analysis of large shotgun metagenomic datasets targeted amplicons and metatranscriptome rna seq datasets functional assignments using kegg orthology within mgrast assigned over 500 000 annotations for each of the ells river er and steepbank stb samples with over 1 5 million assigned to the groundwater plume gp quality scores phred were set at q 30 to remove low quality reads and subsequent similarity thresholds set to 60 for gene expression functional annotations phylogenetic associations of residual 16s rrna sequences were also annotated within mg rast annotated to the rdp database at a 60 minimum sequence identity all reads were analyzed and compared within the mg rast analysis platform before exportation of read data for further normalization and data mining functional read annotations for presented figures and tables were assigned using the ko kegg orthology database gene expression pathways were explored visualized using the kegg mapper reads assigned to recognized functional groups were normalized within each sample to rpoc dna directed rna polymerase subunit beta berdygulova et al 2011 colston et al 2014 nieto et al 2009 rivers et al 2016 duplicates for each sample were averaged for accuracy and then compared between sample sites analysis of functional hits was broken down into two categories for this publication energy metabolism and alkane hydrocarbon biodegradation and metabolism results present these level 3 functional annotations providing insight into where dominant expression was observed functional assignments within these dominant categories are further interpreted and plotted within aabel 3 graphical software to present visual comparisons between specific genes corresponding to active transcripts 3 results and discussion 3 1 unsubstituted substituted pah concentrations pah concentrations are included for the er and stb sites measured during sample acquisition for this research table 2 samples could not be attained for site gp high concentrations of c1 c4 substituted hydrocarbons we recorded for both er and stb which is characteristic of the bituminous sands found in the mcmurray formation especially dominant are c4 dibenzothiophene c2 c3 phenanthrene anthracenes c1 c4 fluoranthene pyrene and c1 c4 benzo a anthracene chrysene the consistently lower pah expression in stb total pahs 26 that of er suggests a possible mechanism of biodegradation controlling the pah signature here compared to er overall er has the higher total pah content though interestingly consistently measured lower parent pah concentrations than stb this suggests that many of the pahs in these sites are in fact a result of diagenetic processes and are not a result of combustion sources the pah characteristics measured in these sites closely match previous studies and reflect the chemical characteristics of the bitumen deposit present at these outcrop sites historic water pah measurements at gp indicate high concentrations there inviting future studies to characterize this novel location as well 3 2 sequencing statistics functional assignments sequencing stats are outlined in the supplementary data table s1 for all sample sites from here on in the ells river sample site is referred to as er the groundwater plume on poplar creek as gp and the steepbank river sample as stb briefly the illumina hiseq 2000 sequencing resulted in over 67 million 53 million and 29 million sequence counts for er gp and stb respectively identified functional categories for use in gene expression results to follow all exceeded 500 000 reads for all three sites hereafter expression levels where expressed in text and figures are expressed as a percentage of the rpoc gene as noted previously 3 3 differential gene expression 3 3 1 energy metabolism gene expression data derived from the mg rast pipeline utilizing the kegg annotations and ko database annotations were normalized to the rpoc gene encoding the dna directed rna polymerase enzyme to allow normalized comparisons between sites initial characterizations of dominant level 3 functional assignments were compared for the three sampling locations fig s1 dominant transcripts are evident in level 3 categories of methane metabolism ko00680 carbon fixation ko00720 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 and sulfur metabolism ko00920 the most highly expressed transcripts were annotated to carbon fixation where gp transcripts dominated followed by similar transcripts expressed for both nitrogen and sulfur metabolism regardless of location visualization of specific functional annotations fig 2 reveal the differential expression for methane carbon fixation nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms concerning specific enzymatic pathways 3 3 1 1 nitrogen dominant transcripts related to nitrogen metabolism were observed in all samples sites figs 2 and 3 indicating strong linkages between the degradation of hydrocarbons and denitrification processes nitrogen is often associated with aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons via increase in carbon nitrogen bonding making the cleaving of these bonds extremely difficult scott et al 2014 results shown indicate a higher expression of nitrogen metabolism genes in sites known to contain correspondingly high concentrations of hydrocarbons in this case gp relating to other studies observing similar characteristics in oil rich environments scott et al 2014 historical water quality data table 1 indicates gp contains the highest concentrations of pahs which appear to correlate with denitrification transcripts of napa nirb norb and nosz sediment pah data table 2 indicates similar pah concentrations between er and stb aside from c2 c3 and c4 substituted homologs correlating to more similar dentrification transcript abundance as noted in fig 3 metabolic expressions observed in nitrate reduction and denitrification environments suggest that these reference sites are influenced by excess carbon input regulating primary metabolisms of organics and nutrients with symbiotic biodegradation of hydrocarbons scott et al 2014 showed a shift towards denitrification processes in contaminated environments where nitrate appeared to be consumed with increasing concentrations of nitrite and nitric oxide further here we observe nitrogen metabolism in general is more highly expressed across all sites compared to sulfur metabolism correlating with previous studies indicating the preferential use of nitrate as electron acceptors in btex degradation pathways in the presence of more complex btex compounds sulfate reduction was out competed by nitrate reduction processes as well dou et al 2008 3 3 1 2 sulfur a differential expression relating to sulfur transcripts can be observed between all sites in fig 2 sulfate adenyltransferase and several associated subunits cysnd met3 sat indicate the activity of both assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate reduction intermediate pathways including genes encoding aps to paps to sulfide assimilatory and aps straight to sulfide dissimilatory are also expressed assimilatory sulfide production as a result of sir gene expression indicates the highest sulfide production in the gp followed closely by er then stb 17 68 17 00 15 20 respectively this is perhaps correlated to the higher c3 and c4 dibenzothiophene measured in er compared to stb table 2 this sulfide pathway may be scavenging sulfur from the dibenzothiophenes within the environment regarding dissimilatory sulfide production dsrab expression indicates high expression in stb 7 4 followed by er 6 1 then gp 4 1 in this case overall gene expression indicates more highly expressed dissimilatory reduction activity following previous studies identifying srb communities thriving in hydrocarbon rich environments actively reducing a variety of btex compounds kleikemper et al 2002 interestingly these authors observed visible iron sulfide deposition in the riverine sediments adjacent to the outcrops samples supporting the aforementioned gene expression results further it has been noted that sulfur metabolism specifically sulfate reduction often works in cooperation with carbon fixation cycles and alkane consumption as thioautotrophic bacteria in extreme environments such as deep ocean hydrothermal vents are capable of using reduced sulfur compounds for energy bose et al 2013 mattes et al 2013 these deep sea vents like these hydrocarbon rich environments in this study are subject to steep chemical gradients and redox pockets due to the rich nutrient fluxes throughout the systems it is also interesting to note that annotations of the dsrab genes are also related to nitrotoluene degradation enzyme production see 3 3 2 the high concentration of dibenzothiophene measured at both er and stb suggest that perhaps these sulfur related transcripts imply an active degradation of this dominant organosulfur compound these extreme environment characteristics could be the cause of these complex intermediate pathways working in cooperation with several other processes in a unique symbiotic relationship interestingly the expression from high to low of aprab and dsrab follows stb er gp which roughly correlates to the inverse ranking of measured total hydrocarbon concentrations i e gp contains highest total hydrocarbons followed by stb and er according to historical records this possible suppression of both enzymes constituting dissimilatory sulfate reduction perhaps indicates an inhibitory effect because of elevated hydrocarbon levels this supports the previously outlined characterization that nitrate reduction will preferentially out compete sulfate reduction as the provided electron acceptor in the degradation of various btex components 3 3 1 3 methane the mcra gene encoding methyl coenzyme m reductase which is associated with the final stage of methanogenesis was most dominant in stb 4 28 followed by gp 3 42 and then er 2 37 related to mcra the expression of mcrbcd as well as the expression of several subunits of mtr genes encoding tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase further provide an indication of methane production within all sites though in these cases gp presents the highest expression levels expression of hydrogenase and acetyl coa pathways as well as pathways indicating methylamine utilization indicates that acetoclastic hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenesis is occurring through extensive electron transport systems the utilization of not only acetate but also methylated compounds co2 and h2 for methane production is indicative of the diverse nature of the microbial population sampled in this study this is further corroborated by the extensive abundance of unclassified organisms identified in the taxonomy derived from the rnaseq dataset fig 4 the occurrence of the methylotrophic methanogenic activity specifically is interesting given hydrogenotrophic methane production tends to dominate in most systems vanwonterghem et al 2016 utilization of hydrogen for methane production relieves the buildup of h2 resulting from prior degradation processes and further boosts ongoing biodegradation the presence of methanosarcina at these same sites aside from the previously unstudied gp in the study by yergeau et al 2012 directly correlates to these findings yergeau et al 2012 methanosarcina are capable of producing methane from not only acetate but co2 and h2 as well further methanosarcina are tolerant to environmental changes which may inhibit ch4 production from acetate or otherwise hinder growth under varying physicochemical conditions ali shah et al 2014 highly expressed hdra gene encoding the reduction of heterodisulfide was evident across all sites correlating to intracellular transport associated with methane metabolism hdra utilizes f420 non reducing hydrogenase mvhadg and mvhb to complete the h2 dependent reduction of heterodisulfide to ferredoxin in the case of hdr expression sites were ranked stb er gp in order from highest to lowest expression levels 32 12 29 29 22 05 respectively the hdr expression has also been linked to oxidizing sulfides though perhaps more importantly facilitating reverse methanogenesis methane oxidation under anaerobic conditions wang et al 2014 here taxonomy data identified a relatively high abundance of active potential methanotrophs alongside potential methanotrophs that are were identified as not only unclassified archaea but also bacteria fig 4 expression of mcra mtrabcdefgh and dsrab also have the potential for facilitating anaerobic oxidation of methane aom within the sediment alongside the traditional characterization of methane production and sulfate reduction respectively nercessian et al 2005 timmers et al 2017 studies characterizing various methanotrophic archaea have indicated the ability of these genes to function in reverse to oxidize methane in the absence of oxygen biddle et al 2012 this novel process of aom was reported in several studies both in laboratory settings and in the field dhillon et al 2003 hallam et al 2004 he et al 2015 lloyd et al 2006 nunoura et al 2006 thomsen 2001 two recent studies have also observed anaerobic oxidation of methane within microcosm oil sands tailings systems boudens et al 2016 reid et al 2016 indicating that perhaps these natural sites exhibit some functional similarities to those tailings ponds in the region the dominant cycling of nitrogen across all sites and the sulfate reduction transcripts observed further indicate possible electron acceptors for this oxidation process though perhaps in association with bacteria zhu et al 2016 methylomonas a genus of the family methylococcaceae and class of gammaproteobacteria is able to cooperatively couple nitrate reduction with methane oxidation though is reported to be an aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria mob kits et al 2015 milucka et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 however no reads encoding monooxygenases were observed indicating that the sample locations were operating under limited oxygen conditions at the time of sampling though counterintuitive this finding is the same as those in other studies where aerobic mob can in fact thrive in anoxic conditions and actively oxidize methane despite their obligate aerobe designation blees et al 2014 bowman 2006 milucka et al 2015 the sequestering of methane within the sediments is a beneficial process limiting the expression of harmful greenhouse gas from these hydrocarbon rich environments though the complexity that is methane oxidation within steep redox gradient environments continues to provide ample research opportunity the use of biomarker genes once primarily accepted as purely responsible for methanogenic activity i e mcr should be used with caution given the now commonly accepted notion that these same genes could be responsible for reverse methanogenesis as well novel strains of bacteria capable of oxidizing methane i e methylomonas indicate the importance of augmenting taxonomy assessments with more in depth functional analyses as taxonomic inferences can be misguided finally the presence of these types of genes able to function in both methanogenic and methanotrophic conditions indicates the need for further characterization of the aom aerobic mob process involving the culturing of pure strains which has so far remained an unsuccessful venture timmers et al 2017 the authors believe the study of microbial function within an environment and the correlative syntrophic relations revealed through these advanced molecular approaches is becoming the new paradigm for microbial ecology and biogeochemical studies in general 3 3 2 biodegradation of alkanes and hydrocarbons the direct influence of the mcmurray formation to the er stb and gp reference sites suggests that the microbial consortia is likely benefiting from the array of hydrocarbon compounds measured at these sites associated with level 3 functional categories fig s2 indicating various hydrocarbon constituent degradation pathways the most highly expressed biodegradations regions for all 3 sites include nitrotoluene degradation ko00633 and chlorocyclohexane and chlorobenzene degradation ko00361 for the noted highly expressed nitrotoluene degradation pathways fig 5 expression of the genes nema and nfnb nfsb encoding n ethylmaleimide reductase and nitroreductase dihydropteridine reductase respectively show the capability of the microbial consortia to degrade a wide array of nitroalkanes and nitroaromatics valle et al 2012 their ability to naturally degrade these compounds is advantageous given that these compounds tend to be a result of hydrocarbon combustion and are present along with fossil fuels ju and parales 2010 degradation of these lower complexity aromatics suggests further degradation of more complex molecules given appropriate redox and nutrient substrates further the highly expressed chlorocyclohexanes and chlorobenzene degradation pathways fig 5 indicate degradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons as a result of an accumulation of chlorinated aromatics within these sites kappell et al 2014 the most dominant transcripts expressed were largely carboxymethylenebutenolidase ec 3 1 1 45 followed by dehalogenases and mono and di oxygenases these enzymes are associated with the degradation of halogenated compounds such as chlorohexenes chlorobenzenes and fluorinated btex compounds these mono and di oxygenase as well as dehalogenase enzymatic functions are most highly expressed at gp indicating the diversity of this site both in energy metabolism and xenobiotic degradation capabilities on the other hand er and stb exhibited a higher expression of nitrotoluene degradation compared to gp suggesting not surprisingly that these two sites are more closely related than the unique plume site located on poplar creek it should also be taken into consideration that complex interactions between the various pah compounds and the surrounding particulate grains within the sediment can affect the bioavailability of the pah for degradation though not studied here these varying sorption affects could provide reasoning for the seemingly selective degradation of certain families of pahs further interpretation of the gene expression data indicates further evidence for aromatic compound degradation within the level 3 category of benzoate degradation ko00362 several key genes are notably expressed including bada benzoate coa ligase badbcdefghi benzoyl coa reductases pcab c d f h i j intermediate stages of benzene ring degradation as well as poba p hydroxybenzoate 3 monooxygenase of interest is the expression of poba which has previously been indicated as being the initial oxidation of aromatic compounds leading to further degradation by the aforementioned pca genes jiménez et al 2002 the highest expression of poba directly correlates to the overall higher biodegradation related transcripts observed at the gp site these expressed benzoate degradation genes indicate that benzene rings are being selectively cleaved via enzymatic activity and further broken down through subsequent degradation pathways the fact that the benzoyl coa is expressed indicates that a range of aromatic compound have been degraded by various tertiary processes all of which narrow to the benzoyl coa pathways which are then degraded further through subsequent central pathways expression of oah a homolog of the bama gene a ring opening hydrolase indicates that the natural microbial consortia are breaking benzene rings naturally the array of genes suggesting natural biodegradation of hydrocarbons alongside the syntrophic nature of the energy metabolism provides insight into the complexity of the in situ degradation processes unlike controlled lab studies these pathways are quite intricate involving a mixed consortia of microbes all working in syntrophy to progress towards a degraded end product reads annotated to fatty acid metabolism indicate highly expressed fade genes acyl coa dehydrogenase as well as the presence of the important alkb alkane monooxygenase which implies the degradation of medium c5 c22 chain alkanes is also occurring across all sites but most highly expressed within the gp site at 3 8 additionally alkb has been suggested in several papers to be a biomarker gene indicating hydrocarbon levels within an environment smith et al 2013 wasmund et al 2009 in the case of these three sample sites the differentially expressed alkb directly appears to correlate in the ranking with unsubstituted pah concentrations between er and stb table 2 supporting the use of this gene as a biomarker here furthermore a study by nie et al 2014 also suggested gene copies of alkb were identified in several key bacterial phyla and classes of proteobacteria nie et al 2014 the enrichment of alkb in alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria alongside actinobacteria and bacteroidetes correlate with taxonomic abundances observed here fig 4 alongside those described in yergeau et al 2012 these results strongly support the notion that the expression of alkb could indeed be a novel bioindicator gene to systematically survey an environment for active hydrocarbon degradation and should be studied further in targeted freshwater functional studies however given the high concentrations of select substituted pahs in this environment and the syntrophy of microbial metabolism observed future work should also attempt to correlate a broader range of biomarkers to these observed pah compounds additionally more intricate characterizations i e rna sip of various hydrocarbon degradation pathways would establish novel in situ metabolic capabilities of the native microbial community concerning specific substrates i e naphthalene dibenzothiophene anthracene etc 4 conclusions in this study high throughput sequencing of environmental mrna metatranscriptomics was used to gain further insight into these hydrocarbon rich environments results provide insight into the microbial communities responsible for hydrocarbon degradation in syntrophic association with methane sulfate and nitrate reduction within several athabasca river tributaries the abundance of alkane degradation transcripts and mono and di oxygenases at all sites suggest considerable natural degradation of small to medium chained hydrocarbons the high expression of sulfate and nitrate reduction transcripts alongside cooperative methanogenic methanotrophic activity all promote this notion of multiple mechanisms facilitating the degradation of hydrocarbons and the oxidation of methane within these unique sediments the current study allowed us to examine the variation within the natural hydrocarbon rich environments and to identify the functional biomarkers for the active microbial community involved in degradation further our analysis revealed novel lineages of microbe s potentially involved in hydrocarbon degradation alongside sulfur nitrate and methane metabolism the current study could provide insight into how contaminated sites may behave given the sudden presence of a similarly complex hydrocarbon mixture conflicts of interest the authors declare

19642,baseline biogeochemical surveys of natural environments is an often overlooked field of environmental studies too often research begins once contamination has occurred with a knowledge gap as to how the affected area behaved prior to outside often anthropogenic influences these baseline characterizations can provide insight into proposed bioremediation strategies crucial in cleaning up chemical spill sites or heavily mined regions hence this study was conducted to survey the in situ microbial activity within freshwater hydrocarbon rich environments cutting through the mcmurray formation the geologic strata constituting the oil sands we are the first to report in situ functional variations among these freshwater microbial ecosystems using metatranscriptomics providing insight into the in situ gene expression within these naturally hydrocarbon rich sites key genes involved in energy metabolism nitrogen sulfur and methane and hydrocarbon degradation including transcripts relating to the observed expression of methane oxidation are reported this information provides better linkages between hydrocarbon impacted environments closing knowledge gaps for optimizing not only oil sands mine reclamation but also enhancing microbial reclamation strategies in various freshwater environments these finding can also be applied to existing contaminated environments in need of efficient reclamation efforts graphical abstract image 1 keywords hydrocarbons metatranscriptomics microbial biodegradation metabolism sediments 1 introduction understanding the biogeochemical function within natural aquatic ecosystems is a necessity given the inevitable impacts of climate change and broad ranging anthropogenic stressors aquatic ecosystems respond readily to external inputs altering entire biogeochemical signatures with impacts on ecosystem health possibly extending throughout the entire food web microbes the dominant driver of chemical cycling will inevitably alter their function to accommodate nutrient fluxes within their surrounding environment when subjected to increased levels of hydrocarbons for example utilization of these hydrocarbons as an energy source is to their advantage given the global ubiquity of hydrocarbons in our aquatic ecosystems studying environments chronically exposed to naturally occurring hydrocarbon sources i e bitumen coal deposits etc can provide great insight into how microbes function in these complex environments several studies have characterized microbial activity in hydrocarbon rich marine spill sites legacy contaminant sediments alongside natural hydrothermal vents boufadel and michel 2008 bragg et al 1994 kappell et al 2014 kimes et al 2014 king et al 2015 mason et al 2012 pritchard et al 1992 zhang et al 2015 however microbial dynamics in association with freshwater hydrocarbon rich environments is still poorly studied in northern alberta canada the mcmurray formation is a bituminous sand layer constituting the athabasca oil sands rivers cut through this formation providing a major conduit of hydrocarbon expression into the natural environment fig 1 erosion transportation and deposition of the bitumen has a profound effect on the natural chemistry and overall health of these ecosystems these unique natural hydrocarbon outcrops provide an interesting environment from which to compare natural microbial metabolism in the presence of hydrocarbons between regional outcrop sites if the microbes in these ecosystems are naturally metabolizing these complex compounds and their metabolic pathways can be characterized then reclamation efforts within the industrial oil sands mining areas can utilize these baseline characterizations for optimizing reclamation strategies furthermore this environment gives a unique opportunity to study biodegradation in a freshwater boreal setting unlike the many marine based studies in recent years until now studies in this region have stopped at taxonomic assessments alongside geochemical surveys yergeau et al 2012 this can be attributed to not only logistical difficulties accessing these sites but also molecular difficulties in attempting to extract viable messenger rna that which shows active gene transcription from such complex sediments the mcmurray formation is characterized by a complex hydrocarbon mixture of both unsubstituted and substituted species dominated by sulfur and nitrogen compounds aromatic hydrocarbons chlorinated hydrocarbons and linear and chained alkanes are widely studied due to their persistence in the environment and their complexity in terms of the breadth of variation between chemical structures dabestani and lvanov 1999 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are most difficult to degrade as opposed to linear alkanes due to their complex ringed structure and are found both naturally in these hydrocarbon rich environments as well as in industrially influenced sites dabestani and lvanov ilia n 1999 haritash and kaushik 2009 the atmospheric release can also contribute to the spatial distribution of pahs because of the combustion of various compounds from industrial processes including automotive emissions ravindra et al 2008 natural contributions can also occur as a result of the many forest fires in the area ravindra et al 2008 in the natural environment the native microbial consortia will utilize these complex molecules in their energy metabolism as they are a readily available carbon source however many studies involve potentially biased cultured microbial consortia thus studying environments containing naturally occurring hydrocarbon outcrops is a unique opportunity for an unbiased functional analysis ghazali et al 2004 jaekel et al 2015 furthermore in a natural freshwater setting it could be that microbial community development has evolved to metabolize certain groups of hydrocarbons though this remains poorly understood identifying novel degradation pathways under various redox conditions in natural reference systems could provide insight into the potential for enhanced microbial reclamation strategies in existing contaminate environments where bioremediation is a potential option the importance of characterizing actual microbial gene expression in the natural environment should not be overlooked as conventional taxonomic assessments and subsequent inferences are becoming a risky venture high throughput sequencing has further emphasized the vastly complex microbial phylogenetic tree with ongoing studies proving this complexity is only growing hug et al 2016 long et al 2016 lynch and neufeld 2015 pace 1997 microbial species that differ by only fractions of a percent in terms of their genetic code make the quest for taxonomic identification and subsequent functional inferences a shot in the dark in some cases hanage et al 2006 konstantinidis and tiedje 2005 rosselli et al 2016 recent studies identifying microbes with single genes or perhaps closely related homologs being responsible for multiple processes has further emphasized the need for microbial characterization on an expression and activity level chistoserdova et al 2005 this study investigates the dominant hydrocarbon signatures and in situ microbial function within 3 major freshwater tributaries of the lower athabasca river which cut through the mcmurray formation including a unique groundwater bitumen seep functional processes relating to energy metabolism and hydrocarbon degradation at these sites will be discussed with inferences as to how these findings can be utilized in actual contaminant environments for improving aquatic resource management 2 methodology 2 1 sampling site descriptions in situ sampling sites fig 1 were chosen at natural locations known to contain bitumen outcrops outside direct mining sites the site named groundwater plume gp appeared the most visually untouched though historical chemical data table 1 aemera 2016 suggests the highest polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon pah concentrations compared to the other two sites in 1974 1975 syncrude canada ltd performed a baseline study of ruth lake and poplar creek before the commencement of hydrocarbon extraction from lease no 17 since beaver creek had to be diverted from the mining area obviously this was before to advanced sequencing technologies so baseline measurements consisted of fairly standard chemical measurements and benthic flora and fauna syncrude 1975 wasmund et al 2009 this site is truly a unique groundwater plume system included here as a novel baseline environment steepbank river stb is closest to the mining activity in terms of proximity and contained large volumes of bitumen outcropping on the riverbank stb water also was high in pah content and overall humic substances environment and climate change canada has several long term monitoring studies recording water quality data from the chosen sample sites finally ells river er sample site is located north of industrial mining sites though still had a large amount of bitumen outcropping from the riverbank historical data suggested that er has relatively low pah levels both parent and substituted relative to gp but only slightly less than stb 2 2 sediment sample collection and pah analysis in situ sample collection and preservation took place on september 2 2015 at the 3 sites explained in the previous section fig 1 sediment samples from the river banks at each site were taken in sterile rnase and dnase free 5 ml cryogenic vials and immediately flash frozen in liquid nitrogen within the molecular dimensions dry shipper cx100 riverbed sediments were collected in duplicate at the river s edge directly below the hydrocarbon outcrops consisting of surface sediments down to approximately 1 2 cm depth samples remained in liquid nitrogen until returning to the lab in which they were stored at 80 c until extractions were performed 2 3 pah analyses samples for polycyclic aromatic compound pac analysis were sent for analysis at the pacific yukon laboratory for environmental testing at environment and climate change canada eccc dichloromethane dcm extractions were performed on bulk solids samples after deuterated surrogate standards were added following shaking and centrifugation extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography tandem triple quadrupole mass spectrometry gc ms ms agilent technologies inc santa clara ca usa two standard calibration curves were used high 0 01 2 μg ml and low 0 1 10 ng ml for quantification in multiple reaction monitoring mode mrm in accordance with pac and substituted pac concentrations to cover the range of c1 c4 carbon substitutions an appropriate range of retention times was used to integrate the substituted pac homolog groups and calculations based on authentic substituted pac standard response factors isomer pairs are reported in cases where compounds could not be isolated on the ms given equal masses e g c1 phenanthrene anthracene data is publicly accessible via the canada alberta oil sands environmental monitoring data portal http donnees ec gc ca data the practical limit of quantification was 0 02 μg g and 0 04 μg g for unsubstituted and substituted pacs respectively the limit of detection was 0 01 μg g and 0 02 μg g dry weight solids for unsubstituted and substituted pacs respectively 2 4 sediment rna isolation and quality control rna was extracted from each sediment sample with the mobio powersoil total rna isolation kit mo bio laboratories inc ca with slightly modified protocols concerning manufacturer guidelines samples were slowly thawed in their cryogenic vials on ice and immediately added to extraction tubes in a still semi frozen state as to minimize rna degradation all reagents and instruments extraction tubes pipet tips strippettes etc were kept chilled on ice before and during use when feasible further 5 g of sediment was added to each extraction tube and subsequent reagent additions were adjusted for this additional volume the precipitation of rna was performed for 24 h at 20 c to increase rna yield following final centrifugation the pellet was dissolved in 30 μl rnase free water to concentrate the extracted rna further aliquots of extracted rna isolations were kept at 80 c until quality control and sequencing was performed 2 5 rna library construction and sequencing rna extractions were sent for transcriptome analysis on the illumina hiseq 2000 at the genome quebec innovation center at mcgill university in montreal quebec canada extracted rna was analyzed in house to assure sufficient quality for sequencing on the illumina hiseq 2000 samples with rna integrity numbers rin over 7 and concentrations of at least 100 ng ul were sent off for analysis with additional qc checks performed at genome quebec prior to sequencing depletion of rrna was also performed before sequencing using the illumina ribo zero rrna removal kit for bacteria enhancing mrna quantity in each sample for improved functional assignments duplicate samples were sequenced to ensure sample accuracy 2 6 bioinformatic analysis paired end reads obtained from illumina hiseq were uploaded to the mg rast meta genome rapid annotation using subsystem technology v3 1 server at the argonne national library http metagenomics anl gov meyer et al 2008 this automated bioanalysis pipeline is used for the analysis of large shotgun metagenomic datasets targeted amplicons and metatranscriptome rna seq datasets functional assignments using kegg orthology within mgrast assigned over 500 000 annotations for each of the ells river er and steepbank stb samples with over 1 5 million assigned to the groundwater plume gp quality scores phred were set at q 30 to remove low quality reads and subsequent similarity thresholds set to 60 for gene expression functional annotations phylogenetic associations of residual 16s rrna sequences were also annotated within mg rast annotated to the rdp database at a 60 minimum sequence identity all reads were analyzed and compared within the mg rast analysis platform before exportation of read data for further normalization and data mining functional read annotations for presented figures and tables were assigned using the ko kegg orthology database gene expression pathways were explored visualized using the kegg mapper reads assigned to recognized functional groups were normalized within each sample to rpoc dna directed rna polymerase subunit beta berdygulova et al 2011 colston et al 2014 nieto et al 2009 rivers et al 2016 duplicates for each sample were averaged for accuracy and then compared between sample sites analysis of functional hits was broken down into two categories for this publication energy metabolism and alkane hydrocarbon biodegradation and metabolism results present these level 3 functional annotations providing insight into where dominant expression was observed functional assignments within these dominant categories are further interpreted and plotted within aabel 3 graphical software to present visual comparisons between specific genes corresponding to active transcripts 3 results and discussion 3 1 unsubstituted substituted pah concentrations pah concentrations are included for the er and stb sites measured during sample acquisition for this research table 2 samples could not be attained for site gp high concentrations of c1 c4 substituted hydrocarbons we recorded for both er and stb which is characteristic of the bituminous sands found in the mcmurray formation especially dominant are c4 dibenzothiophene c2 c3 phenanthrene anthracenes c1 c4 fluoranthene pyrene and c1 c4 benzo a anthracene chrysene the consistently lower pah expression in stb total pahs 26 that of er suggests a possible mechanism of biodegradation controlling the pah signature here compared to er overall er has the higher total pah content though interestingly consistently measured lower parent pah concentrations than stb this suggests that many of the pahs in these sites are in fact a result of diagenetic processes and are not a result of combustion sources the pah characteristics measured in these sites closely match previous studies and reflect the chemical characteristics of the bitumen deposit present at these outcrop sites historic water pah measurements at gp indicate high concentrations there inviting future studies to characterize this novel location as well 3 2 sequencing statistics functional assignments sequencing stats are outlined in the supplementary data table s1 for all sample sites from here on in the ells river sample site is referred to as er the groundwater plume on poplar creek as gp and the steepbank river sample as stb briefly the illumina hiseq 2000 sequencing resulted in over 67 million 53 million and 29 million sequence counts for er gp and stb respectively identified functional categories for use in gene expression results to follow all exceeded 500 000 reads for all three sites hereafter expression levels where expressed in text and figures are expressed as a percentage of the rpoc gene as noted previously 3 3 differential gene expression 3 3 1 energy metabolism gene expression data derived from the mg rast pipeline utilizing the kegg annotations and ko database annotations were normalized to the rpoc gene encoding the dna directed rna polymerase enzyme to allow normalized comparisons between sites initial characterizations of dominant level 3 functional assignments were compared for the three sampling locations fig s1 dominant transcripts are evident in level 3 categories of methane metabolism ko00680 carbon fixation ko00720 nitrogen metabolism ko00910 and sulfur metabolism ko00920 the most highly expressed transcripts were annotated to carbon fixation where gp transcripts dominated followed by similar transcripts expressed for both nitrogen and sulfur metabolism regardless of location visualization of specific functional annotations fig 2 reveal the differential expression for methane carbon fixation nitrogen and sulfur metabolisms concerning specific enzymatic pathways 3 3 1 1 nitrogen dominant transcripts related to nitrogen metabolism were observed in all samples sites figs 2 and 3 indicating strong linkages between the degradation of hydrocarbons and denitrification processes nitrogen is often associated with aromatic petroleum hydrocarbons via increase in carbon nitrogen bonding making the cleaving of these bonds extremely difficult scott et al 2014 results shown indicate a higher expression of nitrogen metabolism genes in sites known to contain correspondingly high concentrations of hydrocarbons in this case gp relating to other studies observing similar characteristics in oil rich environments scott et al 2014 historical water quality data table 1 indicates gp contains the highest concentrations of pahs which appear to correlate with denitrification transcripts of napa nirb norb and nosz sediment pah data table 2 indicates similar pah concentrations between er and stb aside from c2 c3 and c4 substituted homologs correlating to more similar dentrification transcript abundance as noted in fig 3 metabolic expressions observed in nitrate reduction and denitrification environments suggest that these reference sites are influenced by excess carbon input regulating primary metabolisms of organics and nutrients with symbiotic biodegradation of hydrocarbons scott et al 2014 showed a shift towards denitrification processes in contaminated environments where nitrate appeared to be consumed with increasing concentrations of nitrite and nitric oxide further here we observe nitrogen metabolism in general is more highly expressed across all sites compared to sulfur metabolism correlating with previous studies indicating the preferential use of nitrate as electron acceptors in btex degradation pathways in the presence of more complex btex compounds sulfate reduction was out competed by nitrate reduction processes as well dou et al 2008 3 3 1 2 sulfur a differential expression relating to sulfur transcripts can be observed between all sites in fig 2 sulfate adenyltransferase and several associated subunits cysnd met3 sat indicate the activity of both assimilatory and dissimilatory sulfate reduction intermediate pathways including genes encoding aps to paps to sulfide assimilatory and aps straight to sulfide dissimilatory are also expressed assimilatory sulfide production as a result of sir gene expression indicates the highest sulfide production in the gp followed closely by er then stb 17 68 17 00 15 20 respectively this is perhaps correlated to the higher c3 and c4 dibenzothiophene measured in er compared to stb table 2 this sulfide pathway may be scavenging sulfur from the dibenzothiophenes within the environment regarding dissimilatory sulfide production dsrab expression indicates high expression in stb 7 4 followed by er 6 1 then gp 4 1 in this case overall gene expression indicates more highly expressed dissimilatory reduction activity following previous studies identifying srb communities thriving in hydrocarbon rich environments actively reducing a variety of btex compounds kleikemper et al 2002 interestingly these authors observed visible iron sulfide deposition in the riverine sediments adjacent to the outcrops samples supporting the aforementioned gene expression results further it has been noted that sulfur metabolism specifically sulfate reduction often works in cooperation with carbon fixation cycles and alkane consumption as thioautotrophic bacteria in extreme environments such as deep ocean hydrothermal vents are capable of using reduced sulfur compounds for energy bose et al 2013 mattes et al 2013 these deep sea vents like these hydrocarbon rich environments in this study are subject to steep chemical gradients and redox pockets due to the rich nutrient fluxes throughout the systems it is also interesting to note that annotations of the dsrab genes are also related to nitrotoluene degradation enzyme production see 3 3 2 the high concentration of dibenzothiophene measured at both er and stb suggest that perhaps these sulfur related transcripts imply an active degradation of this dominant organosulfur compound these extreme environment characteristics could be the cause of these complex intermediate pathways working in cooperation with several other processes in a unique symbiotic relationship interestingly the expression from high to low of aprab and dsrab follows stb er gp which roughly correlates to the inverse ranking of measured total hydrocarbon concentrations i e gp contains highest total hydrocarbons followed by stb and er according to historical records this possible suppression of both enzymes constituting dissimilatory sulfate reduction perhaps indicates an inhibitory effect because of elevated hydrocarbon levels this supports the previously outlined characterization that nitrate reduction will preferentially out compete sulfate reduction as the provided electron acceptor in the degradation of various btex components 3 3 1 3 methane the mcra gene encoding methyl coenzyme m reductase which is associated with the final stage of methanogenesis was most dominant in stb 4 28 followed by gp 3 42 and then er 2 37 related to mcra the expression of mcrbcd as well as the expression of several subunits of mtr genes encoding tetrahydromethanopterin s methyltransferase further provide an indication of methane production within all sites though in these cases gp presents the highest expression levels expression of hydrogenase and acetyl coa pathways as well as pathways indicating methylamine utilization indicates that acetoclastic hydrogenotrophic and methylotrophic methanogenesis is occurring through extensive electron transport systems the utilization of not only acetate but also methylated compounds co2 and h2 for methane production is indicative of the diverse nature of the microbial population sampled in this study this is further corroborated by the extensive abundance of unclassified organisms identified in the taxonomy derived from the rnaseq dataset fig 4 the occurrence of the methylotrophic methanogenic activity specifically is interesting given hydrogenotrophic methane production tends to dominate in most systems vanwonterghem et al 2016 utilization of hydrogen for methane production relieves the buildup of h2 resulting from prior degradation processes and further boosts ongoing biodegradation the presence of methanosarcina at these same sites aside from the previously unstudied gp in the study by yergeau et al 2012 directly correlates to these findings yergeau et al 2012 methanosarcina are capable of producing methane from not only acetate but co2 and h2 as well further methanosarcina are tolerant to environmental changes which may inhibit ch4 production from acetate or otherwise hinder growth under varying physicochemical conditions ali shah et al 2014 highly expressed hdra gene encoding the reduction of heterodisulfide was evident across all sites correlating to intracellular transport associated with methane metabolism hdra utilizes f420 non reducing hydrogenase mvhadg and mvhb to complete the h2 dependent reduction of heterodisulfide to ferredoxin in the case of hdr expression sites were ranked stb er gp in order from highest to lowest expression levels 32 12 29 29 22 05 respectively the hdr expression has also been linked to oxidizing sulfides though perhaps more importantly facilitating reverse methanogenesis methane oxidation under anaerobic conditions wang et al 2014 here taxonomy data identified a relatively high abundance of active potential methanotrophs alongside potential methanotrophs that are were identified as not only unclassified archaea but also bacteria fig 4 expression of mcra mtrabcdefgh and dsrab also have the potential for facilitating anaerobic oxidation of methane aom within the sediment alongside the traditional characterization of methane production and sulfate reduction respectively nercessian et al 2005 timmers et al 2017 studies characterizing various methanotrophic archaea have indicated the ability of these genes to function in reverse to oxidize methane in the absence of oxygen biddle et al 2012 this novel process of aom was reported in several studies both in laboratory settings and in the field dhillon et al 2003 hallam et al 2004 he et al 2015 lloyd et al 2006 nunoura et al 2006 thomsen 2001 two recent studies have also observed anaerobic oxidation of methane within microcosm oil sands tailings systems boudens et al 2016 reid et al 2016 indicating that perhaps these natural sites exhibit some functional similarities to those tailings ponds in the region the dominant cycling of nitrogen across all sites and the sulfate reduction transcripts observed further indicate possible electron acceptors for this oxidation process though perhaps in association with bacteria zhu et al 2016 methylomonas a genus of the family methylococcaceae and class of gammaproteobacteria is able to cooperatively couple nitrate reduction with methane oxidation though is reported to be an aerobic methane oxidizing bacteria mob kits et al 2015 milucka et al 2015 zhu et al 2016 however no reads encoding monooxygenases were observed indicating that the sample locations were operating under limited oxygen conditions at the time of sampling though counterintuitive this finding is the same as those in other studies where aerobic mob can in fact thrive in anoxic conditions and actively oxidize methane despite their obligate aerobe designation blees et al 2014 bowman 2006 milucka et al 2015 the sequestering of methane within the sediments is a beneficial process limiting the expression of harmful greenhouse gas from these hydrocarbon rich environments though the complexity that is methane oxidation within steep redox gradient environments continues to provide ample research opportunity the use of biomarker genes once primarily accepted as purely responsible for methanogenic activity i e mcr should be used with caution given the now commonly accepted notion that these same genes could be responsible for reverse methanogenesis as well novel strains of bacteria capable of oxidizing methane i e methylomonas indicate the importance of augmenting taxonomy assessments with more in depth functional analyses as taxonomic inferences can be misguided finally the presence of these types of genes able to function in both methanogenic and methanotrophic conditions indicates the need for further characterization of the aom aerobic mob process involving the culturing of pure strains which has so far remained an unsuccessful venture timmers et al 2017 the authors believe the study of microbial function within an environment and the correlative syntrophic relations revealed through these advanced molecular approaches is becoming the new paradigm for microbial ecology and biogeochemical studies in general 3 3 2 biodegradation of alkanes and hydrocarbons the direct influence of the mcmurray formation to the er stb and gp reference sites suggests that the microbial consortia is likely benefiting from the array of hydrocarbon compounds measured at these sites associated with level 3 functional categories fig s2 indicating various hydrocarbon constituent degradation pathways the most highly expressed biodegradations regions for all 3 sites include nitrotoluene degradation ko00633 and chlorocyclohexane and chlorobenzene degradation ko00361 for the noted highly expressed nitrotoluene degradation pathways fig 5 expression of the genes nema and nfnb nfsb encoding n ethylmaleimide reductase and nitroreductase dihydropteridine reductase respectively show the capability of the microbial consortia to degrade a wide array of nitroalkanes and nitroaromatics valle et al 2012 their ability to naturally degrade these compounds is advantageous given that these compounds tend to be a result of hydrocarbon combustion and are present along with fossil fuels ju and parales 2010 degradation of these lower complexity aromatics suggests further degradation of more complex molecules given appropriate redox and nutrient substrates further the highly expressed chlorocyclohexanes and chlorobenzene degradation pathways fig 5 indicate degradation of chlorinated hydrocarbons as a result of an accumulation of chlorinated aromatics within these sites kappell et al 2014 the most dominant transcripts expressed were largely carboxymethylenebutenolidase ec 3 1 1 45 followed by dehalogenases and mono and di oxygenases these enzymes are associated with the degradation of halogenated compounds such as chlorohexenes chlorobenzenes and fluorinated btex compounds these mono and di oxygenase as well as dehalogenase enzymatic functions are most highly expressed at gp indicating the diversity of this site both in energy metabolism and xenobiotic degradation capabilities on the other hand er and stb exhibited a higher expression of nitrotoluene degradation compared to gp suggesting not surprisingly that these two sites are more closely related than the unique plume site located on poplar creek it should also be taken into consideration that complex interactions between the various pah compounds and the surrounding particulate grains within the sediment can affect the bioavailability of the pah for degradation though not studied here these varying sorption affects could provide reasoning for the seemingly selective degradation of certain families of pahs further interpretation of the gene expression data indicates further evidence for aromatic compound degradation within the level 3 category of benzoate degradation ko00362 several key genes are notably expressed including bada benzoate coa ligase badbcdefghi benzoyl coa reductases pcab c d f h i j intermediate stages of benzene ring degradation as well as poba p hydroxybenzoate 3 monooxygenase of interest is the expression of poba which has previously been indicated as being the initial oxidation of aromatic compounds leading to further degradation by the aforementioned pca genes jiménez et al 2002 the highest expression of poba directly correlates to the overall higher biodegradation related transcripts observed at the gp site these expressed benzoate degradation genes indicate that benzene rings are being selectively cleaved via enzymatic activity and further broken down through subsequent degradation pathways the fact that the benzoyl coa is expressed indicates that a range of aromatic compound have been degraded by various tertiary processes all of which narrow to the benzoyl coa pathways which are then degraded further through subsequent central pathways expression of oah a homolog of the bama gene a ring opening hydrolase indicates that the natural microbial consortia are breaking benzene rings naturally the array of genes suggesting natural biodegradation of hydrocarbons alongside the syntrophic nature of the energy metabolism provides insight into the complexity of the in situ degradation processes unlike controlled lab studies these pathways are quite intricate involving a mixed consortia of microbes all working in syntrophy to progress towards a degraded end product reads annotated to fatty acid metabolism indicate highly expressed fade genes acyl coa dehydrogenase as well as the presence of the important alkb alkane monooxygenase which implies the degradation of medium c5 c22 chain alkanes is also occurring across all sites but most highly expressed within the gp site at 3 8 additionally alkb has been suggested in several papers to be a biomarker gene indicating hydrocarbon levels within an environment smith et al 2013 wasmund et al 2009 in the case of these three sample sites the differentially expressed alkb directly appears to correlate in the ranking with unsubstituted pah concentrations between er and stb table 2 supporting the use of this gene as a biomarker here furthermore a study by nie et al 2014 also suggested gene copies of alkb were identified in several key bacterial phyla and classes of proteobacteria nie et al 2014 the enrichment of alkb in alpha beta and gammaproteobacteria alongside actinobacteria and bacteroidetes correlate with taxonomic abundances observed here fig 4 alongside those described in yergeau et al 2012 these results strongly support the notion that the expression of alkb could indeed be a novel bioindicator gene to systematically survey an environment for active hydrocarbon degradation and should be studied further in targeted freshwater functional studies however given the high concentrations of select substituted pahs in this environment and the syntrophy of microbial metabolism observed future work should also attempt to correlate a broader range of biomarkers to these observed pah compounds additionally more intricate characterizations i e rna sip of various hydrocarbon degradation pathways would establish novel in situ metabolic capabilities of the native microbial community concerning specific substrates i e naphthalene dibenzothiophene anthracene etc 4 conclusions in this study high throughput sequencing of environmental mrna metatranscriptomics was used to gain further insight into these hydrocarbon rich environments results provide insight into the microbial communities responsible for hydrocarbon degradation in syntrophic association with methane sulfate and nitrate reduction within several athabasca river tributaries the abundance of alkane degradation transcripts and mono and di oxygenases at all sites suggest considerable natural degradation of small to medium chained hydrocarbons the high expression of sulfate and nitrate reduction transcripts alongside cooperative methanogenic methanotrophic activity all promote this notion of multiple mechanisms facilitating the degradation of hydrocarbons and the oxidation of methane within these unique sediments the current study allowed us to examine the variation within the natural hydrocarbon rich environments and to identify the functional biomarkers for the active microbial community involved in degradation further our analysis revealed novel lineages of microbe s potentially involved in hydrocarbon degradation alongside sulfur nitrate and methane metabolism the current study could provide insight into how contaminated sites may behave given the sudden presence of a similarly complex hydrocarbon mixture conflicts of interest the authors declare

19643,stagnant water bodies have generally received little attention regarding the presence of endocrine disruptive compounds although they can integrate diverse pollutants from multiple different sources many compounds of anthropogenic as well as natural origin can contribute to the overall estrogenicity of surface waters and some of them can exhibit adverse effects on aquatic biota even in very low concentrations this study focused on freshwater ponds and reservoirs affected by water blooms and determined the estrogenic activity of water by in vitro bioassay as well as concentrations of several important groups of estrogenic compounds estrogenic hormones alkylphenols and phytoestrogens by lc ms ms analyses estrogenic hormones were found at concentrations up to 7 1 ng l 1 similarly to flavonoids whose concentrations did not exceed 12 5 ng l 1 among alkylphenols only bisphenol a and 4 tert octylphenol were detected in levels reaching 100 ng l 1 at maximum estrogenic activity of water samples varied from below the quantification limit to 1 95 ng l 1 there does not seem to be any general causal link of the massive phytoplankton occurrence with the estrogenicity of water or concentration of phytoestrogens since they showed no direct relationship with the phytoplankton abundance or composition across sites the contribution of the analysed compounds to the estrogenic activity was calculated in three scenarios in minimum scenario just the compounds above quantification limit loq were taken into account and for most samples only minor part 6 of the biological activity could be explained in the mean and maximum scenarios we included also compounds below loq into the calculations at the level of loq 2 and loq respectively in these cases a considerable part of the estrogenic activity could be attributed to the possible presence of steroid estrogens below loq however for the samples with estrogenic activity greater than 1 ng l 1 more than 50 of the estrogenic activity remained unexplained even in the maximum scenario probably other compounds or possible interactions between individual substances cause the estrogenic activity in these types of water bodies and in this case the results of lc ms ms analyses cannot sufficiently predict the biological effects a complex approach including bioassays is needed when assessing the estrogenicity of these types of surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords estrogenicity surface water flavonoids alkylphenols estrogens 1 introduction endocrine disruptive compounds that can cause a disturbance in hormone signalling and adverse effects in biota even at very low concentrations received much attention in recent years in surface waters namely potential presence of estrogenic compounds has been investigated as it has been associated with the occurrence of intersex in fish in numerous studies reviewed e g in söffker and tyler 2012 main attention was paid to rivers and wastewater treatment plant effluents as important sources of estrogens to the environment steroid estrogenic hormones were found to be the main contributors to the estrogenicity in these waters sumpter and jobling 2013 therefore three estrogens estrone 17β estradiol and 17α ethynylestradiol have been included in the european water framework directive wfd watch list com 2011 876 for 17β estradiol and 17α ethynylestradiol the annual average environmental quality standards were proposed to be 400 pg l 1 and 35 pg l 1 respectively with chemical analytical techniques it is often very difficult to establish methods with detection limits low enough to enable reliable monitoring in these concentration levels in complex environmental samples on the other hand biodetection systems have the advantage of detecting these extremely low concentrations of estrogens they also integrate the effects of all compounds in the sample and possible interactions in the mixture charles et al 2002 frische et al 2009 this is especially important as many more compounds than just estrogenic hormones were found to interfere with estrogen signalling industrial chemicals like alkylphenols ddt pcbs parabens or phthalates and phytochemicals flavonoids lignans can also induce the estrogenic response giesy et al 2002 some compounds bind to the estrogen receptor but do not activate it and so they exert antiestrogenic effects these include for example polycyclic musks organic ultraviolet absorbents or textile dyes ihara et al 2014 all these compounds can occur together in a complex mixture and contribute to the overall activity however they are rarely measured simultaneously and for flavonoids data on a broader spectrum of compounds are missing endocrine disruptive potential has been recently associated also with phytoplankton biomass and water blooms which could possibly contribute to elevated levels of phytoestrogens gong et al 2014 observed a correlation between the estrogenicity of sea water and phytoplankton concentration and they also reported the estrogenic activity of two isolated phytoplankton species stepankova et al 2011 described the estrogenic activity of environmental cyanobacterial water bloom extracts in the in vitro bioassay the induction of vitellogenin a protein whose synthesis is under the control of estrogen receptor was also described after the exposure to cyanobacterial biomass in zebrafish danio rerio and medaka oryzias latipes marie et al 2012 rogers et al 2011 these studies did not identify the responsible compounds however cyanobacteria and algae were reported to contain estrogenic flavonoids goiris et al 2014 klejdus et al 2010 in stagnant waters massive development of phytoplankton can occur under suitable conditions potentially influencing the estrogenic activity of these waters however studies focusing on estrogenicity of stagnant waters and contributing compounds including flavonoids are missing therefore we aimed to investigate the estrogenic activity of freshwater ponds and lakes affected by massive occurrence of phytoplankton and estimate the contribution of various estrogenic compounds including flavonoids which could be potentially connected to the phytoplankton occurrence we have also examined the hypothesis that higher phytoplankton abundance can be associated with greater estrogenic activity and higher levels of flavonoids the specific goals of this study were to a evaluate the concentrations of a broad spectrum of estrogenic compounds from different structural groups and of different origin in the freshwater reservoirs and ponds affected by water blooms of cyanobacteria or massive development of other phytoplankton groups b determine the estrogenic activity of water samples from these localities in the in vitro bioassay and c calculate the potential contribution of individual compounds to the overall biological activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling water samples from ponds and reservoirs with water blooms were collected from 19 localities across the czech republic and hungary during summer 2013 and 2014 table 1 coordinates of sampling points and sampling dates are presented in supplementary material s1 samples were collected in 2 5l amber glass bottles transported on ice to the laboratory and stored before extraction in dark at 4 c for up to 24 h species determination and cell counting were done using microscope olympus bx 51 and bürker chamber cell counts were converted to biovolumes using databases of cell dimensions of individual species skácelová and lepš 2014 on the basis of the commonly used method described by hillebrand et al 1999 the composition of phytoplankton is expressed as a share of biovolume in particular sample concentration of phytoplankton in cell numbers per millilitre 2 2 sample preparation from each locality 4 l of water were centrifuged 3910 g room temperature centrifuge hanilcombi 514r hanilbiomed inc gwangju korea and vacuum filtered through 0 6 μm paper filters macherey nagel dueren germany water samples were then subjected to solid phase extraction spe using oasis hlb sorbent 1g waters milford usa in two setups as previously described in procházková et al 2017 the first setup v1 is commonly used for the assessment of estrogenicity e g alvarez et al 2013 jugan et al 2009 and the second setup v2 was designed to increase the extraction efficiency of less polar compounds briefly sorbent was conditioned with 15 ml of methanol and 15 ml of distilled water and eluted with 15 ml of methanol in the v1 setup setup v2 consisted of sorbent conditioning with 6 ml of ethylacetate 6 ml of methanol and 12 ml of 20 2 propanol in water 2 propanol was also added to water samples before the extraction to achieve its 20 content elution was performed with 15 ml of ethylacetate the eluates were evaporated to near dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen labeva visible labicom czech republic and reconstituted in methanol to obtain extracts with a concentration factor of 4000x compared to the original water sample in the end we obtained two individual samples from each locality blank samples from the deionized water were also prepared for each spe setup to be analysed together with the environmental samples 2 3 chemical analyses concentrations of selected flavonoids alkylphenols and estrogenic hormones were assessed in all samples by lc ms ms methods limits of quantification loqs were derived as a concentration with a signal to noise ratio 10 1 2 3 1 analysis of flavonoids eight flavonoids biochanin a coumestrol daidzein equol formononetin genistein naringenin and apigenin were analysed using the lc ms ms method described in procházková et al 2017 2 3 2 analysis of estrogenic hormones concentrations of four compounds were determined natural estrogens estrone e1 17β estradiol e2 and estriol e3 and synthetic hormone 17α ethynylestradiol ee2 17α ethynylestradiol 2 4 16 16 d4 17β estradiol 2 4 16 16 d4 and 16α hydroxy 17β estradiol 2 4 d2 were used as instrumental internal standards the spe water extracts were evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen atmosphere twenty microliters of acetone were added and mixed after 1 min 50 μl of 0 1 mm nahco3 were added the ph of nahco3 solution was adjusted to 10 5 with naoh solution the mixtures were vortexed and then allowed to stand for 1 min fifty microliters of dansyl chloride solution 1 mg ml 1 in acetone were added mixed and incubated for 3 min at 60 c samples were then evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 1 ml of a methanol water 4 6 mixture an agilent 1200 series liquid chromatograph equipped with an ace3 c18 column 150 mm 2 1 mm 3 μm advanced chromatography technologies ltd coupled to an agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for the analysis the mobile phase consisted of water with 7 mm formic acid a and acetonitrile b the initial composition of the mobile phase used for gradient elution was 60 b held for 3 5 min then increased to 92 b in 13 5 min and finally decreased back to 60 b in 1 min the mobile phase flow rate was set at 0 3 ml min the column temperature was set to 25 c 10 μl were used for sample injection the ionization of analytes was performed using an esi source set in positive mode the drying gas temperature was 320 c the drying gas flow was 8 l min

were used for the quantification and confirmation of each analyte respectively 2 3 3 analysis of phenolic compounds concentrations of bisphenol a bisphenol f 4 tert octylphenol 4 octylphenol and 4 n nonylphenol were measured deuterated n nonylphenol was used as internal standard samples were derivatized with dansyl chloride using the procedure optimized by pernica et al 2015 concentrated spe extract in a 2 ml amber glass sample vial was evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 200 μl acetonitrile fifty microliters of 100 mm nahco3 in water were added and the content was mixed vortex mixer for 1 min then 200 μl of dansyl chloride in acetone 0 5 mg ml 1 were added and mixed again subsequently the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 60 c the reaction mixtures were then cooled to room

biotest with stably transfected herα hela 9903 cell line was used to determine total estrogenicity of the samples as well as relative potencies rps of individual steroid estrogens e1 e2 e3 and ee2 and alkylphenols bisphenol a bisphenol f 4 tert octylphenol 4 octylphenol and 4 n nonylphenol the procedure described in procházková et al 2017 was used briefly the cells were seeded in 96 well microplates and exposed to the dilution series of the tested compounds environmental samples and e2 as a reference estrogen and blank and solvent controls exposure was conducted in three replicates for each sample concentration after the 24 h exposure the intensity of luminescence was measured detected induction of luminescence was related to the maximal response of e2 e2max and converted into percentages of e2max while solvent control and blank provided a baseline nonlinear logarithmic regression of concentration effect curve of steroid estrogens alkylphenols as well as environmental samples and calibration standard was calculated in graphpad prism graphpad software san diego usa for determination of ecx effective concentration of x of maximal response environmental samples were tested in the range 2 5 20x of concentration factor compared to the original water sample the estrogenic equivalent eeq was derived as the ratio of ec50 of e2 and ec50 of the sample for samples whose response did not reach 50 the ec20 values were used for the calculations the dilution series of standard compounds were tested up to 3 3 10 7 m for ee2 5 10 7 m for e1 and e3 and up to 5 10 5 m for alkylphenols rps were then determined as the ratio of molar ec50 of the e2 and ec50 of the compound except for 4 octylphenol and 4 n nonylphenol whose response did not reach 50 and therefore the ec20 was used for the calculation of their rps rps of flavonoids were assessed previously procházková et al 2017 and the reported values were used for calculations of their contribution to the estrogenic activity also in this study estrogenic equivalents derived from chemical analyses ceeqs were calculated from molar concentrations determined by lc ms ms analyses and relative potencies obtained from the in vitro assay using following equation ceeq ci rpi three scenarios were considered to evaluate the potential impact of the quantification limits on the explicability of the effects by the studied compounds they were designed to show the whole range of estrogenicity the analysed compounds could account for in the minimum scenario the compounds that were below loq were not included in the calculations of ceeq this scenario shows the minimum contribution of the analysed compounds as it considers only positively detected and quantified compounds the mean scenario includes the compounds below loq to the contribution calculations at the theoretical level of loq 2 to indicate the average estimate of the estrogenicity that can be explained by the analysed compounds in the maximum scenario the concentration of compounds below loq was set as loq for the calculation of ceeq this scenario demonstrates the maximum theoretical contribution of the analysed compounds and the impact of loqs on the contribution calculations 3 results and discussion generally relatively little attention is paid to pollution of stagnant waters although they can integrate pollutants from different sources e g domestic wastewaters animal waste from farms and field fertilising field runoff decaying plant material or metabolites produced by water bloom forming organisms in this study we focused on three groups of estrogenic compounds flavonoids a group of phytoestrogens alkylphenols anthropogenic contaminants and estrogenic hormones including natural e1 e2 e3 and synthetic ee2 and we assessed their concentrations and potential contribution to the estrogenicity of stagnant waters with massive occurrence of phytoplankton sampled localities are listed in table 1 along with the area of sampled water bodies cell densities and species composition of phytoplankton this study covers different types of stagnant water bodies from small ponds to large reservoirs various phytoplankton species dominated at individual sites from well known toxic cyanobacteria like microcystis aeruginosa at locality 13 to green microalgae like desmodesmus communis at locality 14 3 1 occurrence of flavonoids in stagnant waters flavonoids were detected at all localities fig 1 a for detailed concentrations see supplementary material s2 different concentrations of compounds in v1 and v2 samples could be anticipated from different recoveries of the two extraction methods reported in procházková et al 2017 detected concentrations of flavonoids were generally in the order of ng l 1 with a maximum of 18 ng l 1 for the sum of all detected compounds at reservoir vranov locality 4 these levels are similar to the previously reported content of flavonoids in freshwater reservoirs as well as rivers jarošová et al 2015 procházková et al 2017 of particular interest are the concentrations of equol at jamský lake and záhřebský pond localities 10 and 12 where it exceeded 5 8 ng l 1 these levels were recently shown to induce intersex in medaka fish oryzias latipes after exposure from hatching for 100 days wang et al 2016 3 2 occurrence of alkylphenols in stagnant waters among the studied alkylphenols 4 octylphenol 4 n nonylphenol and bisphenol f were below loq 0 07 0 03 and 0 04 ng l 1 respectively in all samples 4 tert octylphenol was detected at 5 localities but its concentration reached only 1 15 ng l 1 at maximum the most abundant was bisphenol a which was detected at 18 out of 19 localities fig 1b for detailed concentrations see supplementary material s2 its concentrations ranged from 3 to 100 ng l 1 similar concentration range 0 5 410 ng l 1 of bisphenol a was reported also by fromme et al 2002 from german surface waters with no difference observed between rivers and lakes these levels seem to be common in surface waters around the world as reviewed by careghini et al 2015 bisphenol a is mainly used in the production of polymers which have wide applications e g in water pipes bottles medical equipment or electronic devices it is also used in thermal paper production or tin coatings michałowicz 2014 all these products can be a source of bisphenol a as it can leach from the materials industrial as well as household wastewaters were reported to contain concentrations of bisphenol a in the order of μg l 1 fürhacker et al 2000 nonylphenol and octylphenol were previously found in surface waters in concentrations similar to bisphenol a careghini et al 2015 jin et al 2004 however these reports may cover all isomers of these compounds nevertheless most data are available for rivers and there is very limited knowledge related to stagnant waters 3 3 occurrence of estrogenic hormones in stagnant waters steroid estrogens were found at 11 localities fig 1c for detailed concentrations see supplementary material s2 their concentration range was similar to flavonoids with the highest amount of 7 1 ng l 1 of estrogens at gravel pit šutrák locality 1 these levels are in agreement with previously published studies on the presence of steroid estrogens in surface waters although they focused on rivers and provided no data for stagnant waters esteban et al 2014 laganà et al 2004 miege et al 2009 patrolecco et al 2015 the most common estrogen in our samples was e1 which was detected at 10 localities e1 is also the most commonly reported estrogen in rivers this is attributed to the fact that it can also be formed as a transformation product of e2 ternes et al 1999 as for the other three estrogens e2 e3 and ee2 they were present only rarely in our samples at 1 2 localities and at lower concentrations than e1 0 7 ng l 1 close to their loqs 0 2 ng l 1 these loqs correspond to the sensitivity of other recently published methods conley et al 2017 čelić et al 2017 česen and heath 2017 when compared with the proposed environmental quality standards from the european wfd watch list com 2011 876 concentrations of e2 were always below this threshold of 0 4 ng l 1 for ee2 it is not possible to assess the exceedance since the loq of our method 0 2 ng l 1 was higher than the proposed environmental quality standard 35 pg l 1 however the concentrations of ee2 on locality 10 jamský lake were in both samples higher than our loq and also more than 10 times higher than the proposed environmental quality standard 3 4 relative potencies of analysed compounds relative estrogenic potencies rps of individual compounds can vary greatly between different in vitro bioassays for example rps of estriol reported in literature ranged from undetectable estrogenic response in yes assay alvarez et al 2013 to 0 4 in bioassay with hgeln cell line gutendorf and westendorf 2001 similarly rp of 4 octylphenol derived in mvln cells was 8 3 10 5 whereas it was 8 0 10 4 in hgeln cells gutendorf and westendorf 2001 therefore in order to calculate the contribution of individual compounds to the overall estrogenic activity of water samples we determined rps of all analysed estrogenic hormones and alkylphenols using the same bioassay as for the assessment of estrogenicity of field water samples rps of flavonoids were established previously procházková et al 2017 and these values were used also in this study fig 2 shows representative concentration response curves obtained in the in vitro herα hela 9903 bioassay for all analysed alkylphenols and estrogenic hormones estrogenic hormones were the most potent among the studied compounds with rps 0 02 1 36 ee2 with rp 1 36 induced the estrogenic response in similar concentrations to e2 e1 and e3 were less active in our bioassay and their rps were 0 02 and 0 06 respectively alkylphenols had generally lower estrogenic activity similar to flavonoids with rps in the range of 6 1 10 7 5 5 10 5 rps of 4 tert octylphenol and bisphenols a and f were all in a close range being 4 2 10 5 5 5 10 5 and 3 3 10 5 respectively 4 octylphenol and 4 n nonylphenol had considerably lower rps of 8 4 10 7 and 6 1 10 7 respectively all rps are listed also in supplementary material s2 takeyoshi 2006 reported ec50s of a few compounds analysed also in our study using the same cell line although they used a different approach to calculate these ec50s as they did not normalize the response to e2max rps that could be derived from those values were in good agreement with our results namely there was a very good correspondence in case of ee2 e1 4 tert octylphenol and bisphenol a while some difference occurred for e3 and 4 nonylphenol 3 5 estrogenic activity of water samples and relative contribution of analysed compounds estrogenicity of stagnant waters is largely unexplored even though they can receive polluting estrogenic compounds of different origin and from various sources in our case estrogenic activity was commonly detected in studied stagnant water samples 32 out of 38 samples induced estrogenic response in in vitro assay with the herα hela 9903 cell line eeqs of water samples shown in table 2 ranged from below 0 02 ng l 1 to 1 95 ng l 1 the differences between eeqs of samples v1 and v2 from one locality were up to 0 55 ng l 1 however none of the two spe setups showed systematically higher estrogenic activities in the samples setup v1 is generally used to extract various polar compounds including estrogenic hormones with good recoveries labadie and budzinski 2005 setup v2 was on the other hand designed to give better recoveries of less polar compounds e g sterols as reported in our previous study procházková et al 2017 the results indicate at some sites contribution to estrogenic activity also from less polar compounds that can only be extracted by more complex extraction approaches covering compounds with wider polarity range to our knowledge the only study on estrogenic activity in ponds and wetlands was conducted in the usa and 13 out of 20 selected sites showed eeq e screen assay in the range of 0 03 0 27 ng l 1 shappell 2006 most information on the estrogenic activity of surface waters comes from rivers affected by wastewaters their eeqs were reported to reach up to 78 8 ng l 1 in liao river wang et al 2011 and 9 4 ng l 1 in yellow river in china wang et al 2012 jugan et al 2009 determined that eeqs of river seine were 2 5 ng l 1 at maximum in swiss rivers observed estrogenicity was up to 7 ng l 1 vermeirssen et al 2005 and in american streams up to 4 6 ng l 1 alvarez et al 2013 leusch et al 2010 found the estrogenic activity of australian river water below 1 ng l 1 of eeq at all studied sites comparing to our results estrogenic activity at some sites in waterbodies with high phytoplankton biomass including cyanobacterial blooms can reach levels in the same order of magnitude as estrogenicity of river water under wastewater treatment plants it is difficult to generalize the potential sources of estrogenicity in our samples as estrogenic activity was detected in small village water tanks and gravel pits that can receive run offs from the surrounding surfaces households or septic tanks e g localities 13 14 or 15 and also in lakes in the vicinity of animal farms e g localities 1 or 2 or agricultural fields e g localities 10 or 18 interestingly the localities with the highest eeqs localities 3 11 12 and 19 are managed as breeding ponds lakes where next to adjacent agricultural activities also some management interventions could influence the observed pollution the predicted no effect concentration pnec of e2 was derived by caldwell et al 2012 to be 2 ng l 1 for the assessment of pnec they considered effects on fish reproduction e g feminization egg production fertilization or hatching as the most sensitive endpoints in our study only one sample reached similar level of eeq 1 95 ng l 1 sample v1 from dolní lužický lake however lahnsteiner et al 2006 described significant decrease of semen fertility of rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss also after exposure to concentration 1 ng l 1 of e2 this level of estrogenic activity was observed in 4 lakes ponds from our study in at least one sample table 2 when we compare the eeqs with the proposed environmental quality standard for e2 from the european wfd watch list com 2011 876 the level 0 4 ng l 1 was exceeded on 11 out of 19 localities ten sites also exceeded the recently suggested effect based trigger value for in vitro estrogenicity assessment of 0 5 ng l 1 eeq van der oost et al 2017 unlike the above mentioned levels which were derived specifically for e2 and therefore considered only the studies focusing on this compound the effect based trigger value of van der oost et al 2017 was estimated for the effect observed in the bioassay so in the process of derivation of this value ec50 values of different estrogenic compounds were converted to equivalent concentrations of the reference compound e2 and included in the assessment this trigger value was derived as a concentration that will adversely affect 5 of the species and was meant to prioritize the localities where detailed chemical analyses for characterisation of the responsible compounds are required from concentrations of individual compounds and their rps we calculated the ceeqs considering 3 scenarios minimum scenario takes into account only the concentrations above loq and simulates the lowest potential estrogenicity contributed by the analysed estrogenic compounds however also the compounds below loq could be present in the samples in the concentration range 0 loq to demonstrate the potential contribution of the compounds below loq and relative importance of their limits of quantification we have calculated also the hypothetical mean and maximum scenarios mean scenario shows the average estimate of the contribution of all compounds analysed in this study as we set the concentration of compounds below loq to the level of loq 2 in the maximum scenario we set the concentration of analytes below loq to the level of loq to demonstrate the highest potential contribution of the compounds to the estrogenicity of water it is not probable that all the unquantified compounds would be present at loq levels but this maximum scenario demonstrates the impact of lc ms ms method loqs on the explicability of biological effects it also helps to estimate the minimal part of bioactivity that cannot be explained by the presence of analysed compounds in a simple additive model the results of minimum scenario ceeqs are shown in table 2 the comparison of all three scenarios is shown in supplementary material s2 contributions of individual compounds to ceeqs are presented in supplementary materials s3 s5 the mass balance calculations are frequently used to assess the potential contribution of analysed compounds to detected bioactivities e g chou et al 2015 grund et al 2011 miege et al 2009 in these calculations the compounds below the loq are frequently not considered thus only the minimum scenario is presented and discussed however as is demonstrated by our results even the values below loqs could play a significant role especially in case of highly potent compounds e g natural and synthetic steroid estrogens or too high loqs of less potent compounds we observed large differences between the minimum mean and maximum scenario ceeqs of estrogenic hormones and flavonoids the largest differences were in the ceeqs of estrogenic hormones especially due to e2 and ee2 these two compounds are the most potent rps 1 and 1 36 respectively but were rarely detected above their loq of 200 pg l 1 despite the applied sensitive analytical methods with relatively low loqs of e2 and ee2 which are comparable or better than for other recently published methods conley et al 2017 čelić et al 2017 česen and heath 2017 even the levels below loq could be significant together they add 248 pg l 1 to the mean scenario ceeq and 496 pg l 1 to the maximum scenario ceeq of samples where they were found below the loq in case of flavonoids ceeqs were sometimes up to 56 and 100 times higher for the mean and maximum scenario respectively when compared with the minimum scenario despite this the difference between the minimum and maximum scenarios was less than 1 pg l 1 in all cases ceeqs of alkylphenols were almost the same in all scenarios as the rps of these compounds 5 45 10 5 and also their loqs 70 pg l 1 are very low therefore their influence on maximum scenario ceeq is negligible in the next step eeqs of water samples determined in the biotest were compared with ceeqs calculated for the studied groups of estrogenic compounds expressed as a contribution to the eeq in table 2 and supplementary material s2 and s5 using the minimum scenario eeqs estimated from in vitro assay were higher or comparable to ceeqs ceeqs corresponded to 0 022 112 of eeqs in this scenario the contribution of all analysed compounds was mostly very low for 26 samples from 14 localities more than 94 of the total estrogenic activity remained unexplained only in jamský lake locality 10 concentrations of analysed compounds completely explained the observed activity in v1 and v2 sample and in both cases the estrogenic hormones were entirely responsible for the estrogenic effects table 2 alkylphenols and flavonoids generally accounted for less than 1 of the estrogenic activity of water samples with the maximum contribution of 3 from both these groups of compounds in the mean scenario compounds below loq could add up to 260 pg l 1 to the ceeq this of course significantly increased the part of bioactivity attributable to our analytes the estrogenicity observed in bioassay could be entirely explained in 12 samples and the lowest contribution of ceeq to the eeq was 16 using the maximum scenario on the other hand all analysed compounds at their loq level would together account for 510 pg l 1 which would entirely explain the activity of 14 out of the 32 samples that showed detectable estrogenic activity for the samples with the eeq below 1 ng l 1 the maximum scenario ceeq shows that with the contribution of the compounds at their loq levels the estrogenic activity would be explained by more than 50 however for the samples with eeq 1 ng l 1 the higher the eeq determined from the biotest the lower was the contribution of the analysed compounds for the sample with the highest estrogenic activity locality 3 sample v1 eeq 1950 pg l 1 the maximum scenario ceeq accounted for only 29 of the eeq this indicates that other compounds or possible interactions between individual estrogenic substances play an important role in estrogenic activity of stagnant surface waters other studies also report estrogenic hormones as the main contributors to the estrogenic activity of surface waters but all these studies were conducted on rivers for example in the study of miege et al 2009 concentrations of estrogenic hormones determined by lc ms ms method explained at least about 50 of eeqs observed in the bioassay for river water samples chou et al 2015 explored the contribution of estrogenic hormones and alkylphenols to the estrogenicity of taiwanese rivers and attributed from 28 to more than 100 of the estrogenic activity to these compounds with e1 and e2 being the most significant chemical lc ms ms and biological yes assay analyses of danube river sediments also revealed e1 as the main contributor to the estrogenic activity from the selected set of compounds e1 e2 ee2 bisphenol a and nonylphenol grund et al 2011 still in comparison with the biologically determined estrogenicity of sediment extracts the lc ms ms analyses explained about 55 of the activity on one locality and less than 6 on the other four these studies chou et al 2015 grund et al 2011 miege et al 2009 therefore report considerable part of the biological activity of some samples 45 98 as unexplained however they also did not consider compounds below quantification limits which could increase the part of estrogenicity attributed to the analysed estrogens although estrogenic hormones are often reported as the main contributing compounds oh et al 2009 associated also alkylphenols with a considerable portion of estrogenic activity of river water they found alkylphenols at concentrations up to 2 μg l 1 in samples that exhibited estrogenic activity and these levels explained 34 of the total estrogenicity phytoestrogens in surface waters usually do not reach concentrations that could cause an observable estrogenic effect however in specific cases like drainage water from fields of plants rich in phytoestrogens their concentrations can be up to several μg l 1 and in such high levels they can be also relevant and dominant drivers of estrogenicity hoerger et al 2011 nevertheless there were relatively low levels of both phytoestrogens and alkylphenols with no significant contribution to estrogenicity across all different stagnant waters in our study the analysed compounds did not fully explain the observed in vitro estrogenic activity at some sites even when the maximum uncertainty connected with the in ability of chemical analytical methods to detect the low concentrations of estrogenic compounds was taken into account this indicates that other unidentified compounds are probably contributing to the observed estrogenicity and to identify them e g the effect directed analysis to isolate these compounds would be needed compounds that could contribute to the total estrogenicity and were not analysed in this study include for example estrogens produced by fungi mycoestrogen zearalenone and its metabolites have rps in the range of 5 10 4 6 8 10 1 and their concentrations can reach up to tens or hundreds of ng l 1 in surface waters jarošová et al 2015 cyanobacteria and algae could be another potential source of estrogenic substances it was reported that their biomass can contain low concentrations of phytoestrogens goiris et al 2014 klejdus et al 2010 their metabolites can also induce in vivo estrogenic activity marie et al 2012 rogers et al 2011 however in this study there does not seem to be any direct relationship between the estrogenicity of water or occurrence of phytoestrogens and phytoplankton concentration or composition the site with the highest and the second least density of phytoplankton locality 4 90 8 106 cells ml 1 and locality 5 0 04 106 cells ml 1 respectively had both eeq below loq 20 pg l 1 on the other hand the site with the second highest density locality 3 38 9 106 cells ml 1 had the highest eeqs 1950 and 1530 pg l 1 in sample v1 and v2 respectively the estrogenic activity does not seem to be connected with a specific group of phytoplankton either for example cyanobacteria dominate at localities 12 and 16 at similar densities around 2 106 cells ml 1 yet the eeqs at locality 12 1120 and 570 pg l 1 are at least 5 times higher than at locality 16 90 and 100 pg l 1 similarly phytoplankton on localities 14 and 19 is dominated by green microalgae and the eeqs at site 14 140 and 170 pg l 1 are 5 times lower than at site 19 1250 and 920 pg l 1 phytoestrogens generally occurred at low levels across all studied water bodies the two sites with greatest biomass densities locality 3 4 belong to those with the greatest phytoestrogen concentrations but comparable levels were found at sites 10 and 16 with much lower cell densities and very different species composition 4 conclusions stagnant freshwaters are under multiple pressures especially in urbanized and agricultural areas which leads to co occurrence of various anthropogenic and natural estrogenic compounds since estrogenic activities in these ecosystems can reach levels comparable to wwtp affected rivers greater attention needs to be paid to the endocrine disruptive potency of present compound mixtures the major contributors and their sources need to be identified mass balance calculations of the contribution of analyzed compounds to detected bioactivities need to take into consideration their limits of quantification especially in the case of highly potent compounds the contribution to the detected bioactivities might be significant even below these limits a complex approach including bioassays is needed when assessing the estrogenicity of these types of surface waters as it could be underestimated if predicted from the concentrations of analysed estrogenic hormones alkylphenols or phytoestrogens organisms in stagnant waters affected by cyanobacterial water blooms can be next to the different groups of estrogenic compounds co exposed to other bioactive and toxic compounds from cyanobacteria as well as to other stressors associated with massive blooms such as decreased oxygen levels or reduced light penetration this can increase the vulnerability of exposed organisms and lead to adverse effects even below effective levels of the individual stressors mitigation actions should be implemented on the stagnant water bodies with longer term pollution and water bloom problems including reduction of input of both nutrients and endocrine

19643,stagnant water bodies have generally received little attention regarding the presence of endocrine disruptive compounds although they can integrate diverse pollutants from multiple different sources many compounds of anthropogenic as well as natural origin can contribute to the overall estrogenicity of surface waters and some of them can exhibit adverse effects on aquatic biota even in very low concentrations this study focused on freshwater ponds and reservoirs affected by water blooms and determined the estrogenic activity of water by in vitro bioassay as well as concentrations of several important groups of estrogenic compounds estrogenic hormones alkylphenols and phytoestrogens by lc ms ms analyses estrogenic hormones were found at concentrations up to 7 1 ng l 1 similarly to flavonoids whose concentrations did not exceed 12 5 ng l 1 among alkylphenols only bisphenol a and 4 tert octylphenol were detected in levels reaching 100 ng l 1 at maximum estrogenic activity of water samples varied from below the quantification limit to 1 95 ng l 1 there does not seem to be any general causal link of the massive phytoplankton occurrence with the estrogenicity of water or concentration of phytoestrogens since they showed no direct relationship with the phytoplankton abundance or composition across sites the contribution of the analysed compounds to the estrogenic activity was calculated in three scenarios in minimum scenario just the compounds above quantification limit loq were taken into account and for most samples only minor part 6 of the biological activity could be explained in the mean and maximum scenarios we included also compounds below loq into the calculations at the level of loq 2 and loq respectively in these cases a considerable part of the estrogenic activity could be attributed to the possible presence of steroid estrogens below loq however for the samples with estrogenic activity greater than 1 ng l 1 more than 50 of the estrogenic activity remained unexplained even in the maximum scenario probably other compounds or possible interactions between individual substances cause the estrogenic activity in these types of water bodies and in this case the results of lc ms ms analyses cannot sufficiently predict the biological effects a complex approach including bioassays is needed when assessing the estrogenicity of these types of surface waters graphical abstract image 1 keywords estrogenicity surface water flavonoids alkylphenols estrogens 1 introduction endocrine disruptive compounds that can cause a disturbance in hormone signalling and adverse effects in biota even at very low concentrations received much attention in recent years in surface waters namely potential presence of estrogenic compounds has been investigated as it has been associated with the occurrence of intersex in fish in numerous studies reviewed e g in söffker and tyler 2012 main attention was paid to rivers and wastewater treatment plant effluents as important sources of estrogens to the environment steroid estrogenic hormones were found to be the main contributors to the estrogenicity in these waters sumpter and jobling 2013 therefore three estrogens estrone 17β estradiol and 17α ethynylestradiol have been included in the european water framework directive wfd watch list com 2011 876 for 17β estradiol and 17α ethynylestradiol the annual average environmental quality standards were proposed to be 400 pg l 1 and 35 pg l 1 respectively with chemical analytical techniques it is often very difficult to establish methods with detection limits low enough to enable reliable monitoring in these concentration levels in complex environmental samples on the other hand biodetection systems have the advantage of detecting these extremely low concentrations of estrogens they also integrate the effects of all compounds in the sample and possible interactions in the mixture charles et al 2002 frische et al 2009 this is especially important as many more compounds than just estrogenic hormones were found to interfere with estrogen signalling industrial chemicals like alkylphenols ddt pcbs parabens or phthalates and phytochemicals flavonoids lignans can also induce the estrogenic response giesy et al 2002 some compounds bind to the estrogen receptor but do not activate it and so they exert antiestrogenic effects these include for example polycyclic musks organic ultraviolet absorbents or textile dyes ihara et al 2014 all these compounds can occur together in a complex mixture and contribute to the overall activity however they are rarely measured simultaneously and for flavonoids data on a broader spectrum of compounds are missing endocrine disruptive potential has been recently associated also with phytoplankton biomass and water blooms which could possibly contribute to elevated levels of phytoestrogens gong et al 2014 observed a correlation between the estrogenicity of sea water and phytoplankton concentration and they also reported the estrogenic activity of two isolated phytoplankton species stepankova et al 2011 described the estrogenic activity of environmental cyanobacterial water bloom extracts in the in vitro bioassay the induction of vitellogenin a protein whose synthesis is under the control of estrogen receptor was also described after the exposure to cyanobacterial biomass in zebrafish danio rerio and medaka oryzias latipes marie et al 2012 rogers et al 2011 these studies did not identify the responsible compounds however cyanobacteria and algae were reported to contain estrogenic flavonoids goiris et al 2014 klejdus et al 2010 in stagnant waters massive development of phytoplankton can occur under suitable conditions potentially influencing the estrogenic activity of these waters however studies focusing on estrogenicity of stagnant waters and contributing compounds including flavonoids are missing therefore we aimed to investigate the estrogenic activity of freshwater ponds and lakes affected by massive occurrence of phytoplankton and estimate the contribution of various estrogenic compounds including flavonoids which could be potentially connected to the phytoplankton occurrence we have also examined the hypothesis that higher phytoplankton abundance can be associated with greater estrogenic activity and higher levels of flavonoids the specific goals of this study were to a evaluate the concentrations of a broad spectrum of estrogenic compounds from different structural groups and of different origin in the freshwater reservoirs and ponds affected by water blooms of cyanobacteria or massive development of other phytoplankton groups b determine the estrogenic activity of water samples from these localities in the in vitro bioassay and c calculate the potential contribution of individual compounds to the overall biological activity 2 materials and methods 2 1 sampling water samples from ponds and reservoirs with water blooms were collected from 19 localities across the czech republic and hungary during summer 2013 and 2014 table 1 coordinates of sampling points and sampling dates are presented in supplementary material s1 samples were collected in 2 5l amber glass bottles transported on ice to the laboratory and stored before extraction in dark at 4 c for up to 24 h species determination and cell counting were done using microscope olympus bx 51 and bürker chamber cell counts were converted to biovolumes using databases of cell dimensions of individual species skácelová and lepš 2014 on the basis of the commonly used method described by hillebrand et al 1999 the composition of phytoplankton is expressed as a share of biovolume in particular sample

usa in two setups as previously described in procházková et al 2017 the first setup v1 is commonly used for the assessment of estrogenicity e g alvarez et al 2013 jugan et al 2009 and the second setup v2 was designed to increase the extraction efficiency of less polar compounds briefly sorbent was conditioned with 15 ml of methanol and 15 ml of distilled water and eluted with 15 ml of methanol in the v1 setup setup v2 consisted of sorbent conditioning with 6 ml of ethylacetate 6 ml of methanol and 12 ml of 20 2 propanol in water 2 propanol was also added to water samples before the extraction to achieve its 20 content elution was performed with 15 ml of ethylacetate the eluates were evaporated to near dryness under a gentle stream of nitrogen labeva visible labicom czech republic and reconstituted in methanol to obtain extracts with a concentration factor of 4000x compared to the original water sample in the end we obtained two individual samples from each locality blank samples from the deionized water were also prepared for each spe setup to be analysed together with the environmental samples 2 3 chemical analyses concentrations of selected flavonoids alkylphenols and estrogenic hormones were assessed in all samples by lc ms ms methods limits of quantification loqs were derived as a concentration with a signal to noise ratio 10 1 2 3 1 analysis of flavonoids eight flavonoids biochanin a coumestrol daidzein equol formononetin genistein naringenin and apigenin were analysed using the lc ms ms method described in procházková et al 2017 2 3 2 analysis of estrogenic

17β estradiol 2 4 16 16 d4 and 16α hydroxy 17β estradiol 2 4 d2 were used as instrumental internal standards the spe water extracts were evaporated to dryness under a nitrogen atmosphere twenty microliters of acetone were added and mixed after 1 min 50 μl of 0 1 mm nahco3 were added the ph of nahco3 solution was adjusted to 10 5 with naoh solution the mixtures were vortexed and then allowed to stand for 1 min fifty microliters of dansyl chloride solution 1 mg ml 1 in acetone were added mixed and incubated for 3 min at 60 c samples were then evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 1 ml of a methanol water 4 6 mixture an agilent 1200 series liquid chromatograph equipped with an ace3 c18 column 150 mm 2 1 mm 3 μm advanced chromatography technologies ltd coupled to an agilent 6410 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was used for the analysis the mobile phase consisted of water with 7 mm formic acid a and acetonitrile b the initial composition of the mobile phase used for gradient elution was 60 b held for 3 5 min then increased to 92 b in 13 5 min and finally decreased back to 60 b in 1 min the mobile phase flow rate was set at 0 3 ml min the column temperature was set to 25 c 10 μl were used for sample injection the ionization of analytes was performed using an esi source set in positive mode the drying gas temperature was 320 c the drying gas flow was 8 l min

were used for the quantification and confirmation of each analyte respectively 2 3 3 analysis of phenolic compounds concentrations of bisphenol a bisphenol f 4 tert octylphenol 4 octylphenol and 4 n nonylphenol were measured deuterated n nonylphenol was used as internal standard samples were derivatized with dansyl chloride using the procedure optimized by pernica et al 2015 concentrated spe extract in a 2 ml amber glass sample vial was evaporated to dryness and redissolved in 200 μl acetonitrile fifty microliters of 100 mm nahco3 in water were added and the content was mixed vortex mixer for 1 min then 200 μl of dansyl chloride in acetone 0 5 mg ml 1 were added and mixed again subsequently the mixture was incubated for 60 min at 60 c the reaction mixtures were then cooled to room

separations and ms detection were performed as described in pernica et al 2015 product ions used for the detection of bisphenol f were 433 and 171 2 4 assessment of estrogenic activity the in vitro biotest with stably transfected herα hela 9903 cell line was used to determine total estrogenicity of the samples as well as relative potencies rps of individual steroid estrogens e1 e2 e3 and ee2 and alkylphenols bisphenol a bisphenol f 4 tert octylphenol 4 octylphenol and 4 n nonylphenol the procedure described in procházková et al 2017 was used briefly the cells were seeded in 96 well microplates and exposed to the dilution series of the tested compounds environmental samples and e2 as a reference estrogen and blank and solvent controls exposure was conducted in three replicates for each sample concentration after the 24 h exposure the intensity of luminescence was measured detected induction of luminescence was related to the maximal response of e2 e2max and converted into percentages of e2max while solvent control and blank provided a baseline nonlinear logarithmic regression of concentration effect curve of steroid estrogens alkylphenols as well as environmental samples and calibration standard was calculated in graphpad prism graphpad software san diego usa for determination of ecx effective concentration of x of maximal response environmental samples were tested in the range 2 5 20x of concentration factor compared to the original water sample the estrogenic equivalent eeq was derived as the ratio of ec50 of e2 and ec50 of the sample for samples whose response did not reach 50 the ec20 values were used for the calculations the dilution series of standard compounds were tested up to 3 3 10 7 m for ee2 5 10 7 m for e1 and e3 and up to 5 10 5 m for alkylphenols rps were then determined as the ratio of molar ec50 of the e2 and ec50 of the compound except for 4 octylphenol and 4 n nonylphenol whose response did not reach 50 and therefore the ec20 was used for the calculation of their rps rps of flavonoids were assessed previously procházková et al 2017 and the reported values were used for calculations of their contribution to the estrogenic activity also in this study estrogenic equivalents derived from chemical analyses ceeqs were calculated from molar concentrations determined by lc ms ms analyses and relative potencies obtained from the in vitro assay using following equation ceeq ci rpi three scenarios were considered to evaluate the potential impact of the quantification limits on the explicability of the effects by the studied compounds they were designed to show the whole range of estrogenicity the analysed compounds could account for in the minimum scenario the compounds that were below loq were not included in the calculations of ceeq this scenario shows the minimum contribution of the analysed compounds as it considers only positively detected and quantified compounds the mean scenario includes the compounds below loq to the contribution calculations at the theoretical level of loq 2 to indicate the average estimate of the estrogenicity that can be explained by the analysed compounds in the maximum scenario the concentration of compounds below loq was set as loq for the calculation of ceeq this scenario demonstrates the maximum theoretical contribution of the analysed compounds and the impact of loqs on the contribution calculations 3 results and discussion generally relatively little attention is paid to pollution of stagnant waters although they can integrate pollutants from different sources e g domestic wastewaters animal waste from farms and field fertilising field runoff decaying plant material or metabolites produced by water bloom forming organisms in this study we focused on three groups of estrogenic compounds flavonoids a group of phytoestrogens alkylphenols anthropogenic contaminants and estrogenic hormones including natural e1 e2 e3 and synthetic ee2 and we assessed their concentrations and potential contribution to the estrogenicity of stagnant waters with massive occurrence of phytoplankton sampled localities are listed in table 1 along with the area of sampled water bodies cell densities and species composition of phytoplankton this study covers different types of stagnant water bodies from small ponds to large reservoirs various phytoplankton species dominated at individual sites from well known toxic cyanobacteria like microcystis aeruginosa at locality 13 to green microalgae like desmodesmus communis at locality 14 3 1 occurrence of flavonoids in stagnant waters flavonoids were detected at all localities fig 1 a for detailed concentrations see supplementary material s2 different concentrations of compounds in v1 and v2 samples could be anticipated from different recoveries of the two extraction methods reported in procházková et al 2017 detected concentrations of flavonoids were generally in the order of ng l 1 with a maximum of 18 ng l 1 for the sum of all detected compounds at reservoir vranov locality 4 these levels are similar to the previously reported content of flavonoids in freshwater reservoirs as well as rivers jarošová et al 2015 procházková et al 2017 of particular interest are the concentrations of equol at jamský lake and záhřebský pond localities 10 and 12 where it exceeded 5 8 ng l 1 these levels were recently shown to induce intersex in medaka fish oryzias latipes after exposure from hatching for 100 days wang et al 2016 3 2 occurrence of alkylphenols in stagnant waters among the studied alkylphenols 4 octylphenol 4 n nonylphenol and bisphenol f were below loq 0 07 0 03 and 0 04 ng l 1 respectively in all samples 4 tert octylphenol was detected at 5 localities but its concentration reached only 1 15 ng l 1 at maximum the most abundant was bisphenol a which was detected at 18 out of 19 localities fig 1b for detailed concentrations see supplementary material s2 its concentrations ranged from 3 to 100 ng l 1 similar concentration range 0 5 410 ng l 1 of bisphenol a was reported also by fromme et al 2002 from german surface waters with no difference observed between rivers and lakes these levels seem to be common in surface waters around the world as reviewed by careghini et al 2015 bisphenol a is mainly used in the production of polymers which have wide applications e g in water pipes bottles medical equipment or electronic devices it is also used in thermal paper production or tin coatings michałowicz 2014 all these products can be a source of bisphenol a as it can leach from the materials industrial as well as household wastewaters were reported to contain concentrations of bisphenol a in the order of μg l 1 fürhacker et al 2000 nonylphenol and octylphenol were previously found in surface waters in concentrations similar to bisphenol a careghini et al 2015 jin et al 2004 however these reports may cover all isomers of these compounds nevertheless most data are available for rivers and there is very limited knowledge related to stagnant waters 3 3 occurrence of estrogenic hormones in stagnant waters steroid estrogens were found at 11 localities fig 1c for detailed concentrations see supplementary material s2 their concentration range was similar to flavonoids with the highest amount of 7 1 ng l 1 of estrogens at gravel pit šutrák locality 1 these levels are in agreement with previously published studies on the presence of steroid estrogens in surface waters although they focused on rivers and provided no data for stagnant waters esteban et al 2014 laganà et al 2004 miege et al 2009 patrolecco et al 2015 the most common estrogen in our samples was e1 which was detected at 10 localities e1 is also the most commonly reported estrogen in rivers this is attributed to the fact that it can also be formed as a transformation product of e2 ternes et al 1999 as for the other three estrogens e2 e3 and ee2 they were present only rarely in our samples at 1 2 localities and at lower concentrations than e1 0 7 ng l 1 close to their loqs 0 2 ng l 1 these loqs correspond to the sensitivity of other recently published methods conley et al 2017 čelić et al 2017 česen and heath 2017 when compared with the proposed environmental quality standards from the european wfd watch list com 2011 876 concentrations of e2 were always below this threshold of 0 4 ng l 1 for ee2 it is not possible to assess the exceedance since the loq of our method 0 2 ng l 1 was higher than the proposed environmental quality standard 35 pg l 1 however the concentrations of ee2 on locality 10 jamský lake were in both samples higher than our loq and also more than 10 times higher than the proposed environmental quality standard 3 4 relative potencies of analysed compounds relative estrogenic potencies rps of individual compounds can vary greatly between different in vitro bioassays for example rps of estriol reported in literature ranged from undetectable estrogenic response in yes assay alvarez et al 2013 to 0 4 in bioassay with hgeln cell line gutendorf and westendorf 2001 similarly rp of 4 octylphenol derived in mvln cells was 8 3 10 5 whereas it was 8 0 10 4 in hgeln cells gutendorf and westendorf 2001 therefore in order to calculate the contribution of individual compounds to the overall estrogenic activity of water samples we determined rps of all analysed estrogenic hormones and alkylphenols using the same bioassay as for the assessment of estrogenicity of field water samples rps of flavonoids were established previously procházková et al 2017 and these values were used also in this study fig 2 shows representative concentration response curves obtained in the in vitro herα hela 9903 bioassay for all analysed alkylphenols and estrogenic hormones estrogenic hormones were the most potent among the studied compounds with rps 0 02 1 36 ee2 with rp 1 36 induced the estrogenic response in similar concentrations to e2 e1 and e3 were less active in our bioassay and their rps were 0 02 and 0 06 respectively alkylphenols had generally lower estrogenic activity similar to flavonoids with rps in the range of 6 1 10 7 5 5 10 5 rps of 4 tert octylphenol and bisphenols a and f were all in a close range being 4 2 10 5 5 5 10 5 and 3 3 10 5 respectively 4 octylphenol and 4 n nonylphenol had considerably lower rps of 8 4 10 7 and 6 1 10 7 respectively all rps are listed also in supplementary material s2 takeyoshi 2006 reported ec50s of a few compounds analysed also in our study using the same cell line although they used a different approach to calculate these ec50s as they did not normalize the response to e2max rps that could be derived from those values were in good agreement with our results namely there was a very good correspondence in case of ee2 e1 4 tert octylphenol and bisphenol a while some difference occurred for e3 and 4 nonylphenol 3 5 estrogenic activity of water samples and relative contribution of analysed compounds estrogenicity of stagnant waters is largely unexplored even though they can receive polluting estrogenic compounds of different origin and from various sources in our case estrogenic activity was commonly detected in studied stagnant water samples 32 out of 38 samples induced estrogenic response in in vitro assay with the herα hela 9903 cell line eeqs of water samples shown in table 2 ranged from below 0 02 ng l 1 to 1 95 ng l 1 the differences between eeqs of samples v1 and v2 from one locality were up to 0 55 ng l 1 however none of the two spe setups showed systematically higher estrogenic activities in the samples setup v1 is generally used to extract various polar compounds including estrogenic hormones with good recoveries labadie and budzinski 2005 setup v2 was on the other hand designed to give better recoveries of less polar compounds e g sterols as reported in our previous study procházková et al 2017 the results indicate at some sites contribution to estrogenic activity also from less polar compounds that can only be extracted by more complex extraction approaches covering compounds with wider polarity range to our knowledge the only study on estrogenic activity in ponds and wetlands was conducted in the usa and 13 out of 20 selected sites showed eeq e screen assay in the range of 0 03 0 27 ng l 1 shappell 2006 most information on the estrogenic activity of surface waters comes from rivers affected by wastewaters their eeqs were reported to reach up to 78 8 ng l 1 in liao river wang et al 2011 and 9 4 ng l 1 in yellow river in china wang et al 2012 jugan et al 2009 determined that eeqs of river seine were 2 5 ng l 1 at maximum in swiss rivers observed estrogenicity was up to 7 ng l 1 vermeirssen et al 2005 and in american streams up to 4 6 ng l 1 alvarez et al 2013 leusch et al 2010 found the estrogenic activity of australian river water below 1 ng l 1 of eeq at all studied sites comparing to our results estrogenic activity at some sites in waterbodies with high phytoplankton biomass including cyanobacterial blooms can reach levels in the same order of magnitude as estrogenicity of river water under wastewater treatment plants it is difficult to generalize the potential sources of estrogenicity in our samples as estrogenic activity was detected in small village water tanks and gravel pits that can receive run offs from the surrounding surfaces households or septic tanks e g localities 13 14 or 15 and also in lakes in the vicinity of animal farms e g localities 1 or 2 or agricultural fields e g localities 10 or 18 interestingly the localities with the highest eeqs localities 3 11 12 and 19 are managed as breeding ponds lakes where next to adjacent agricultural activities also some management interventions could influence the observed pollution the predicted no effect concentration pnec of e2 was derived by caldwell et al 2012 to be 2 ng l 1 for the assessment of pnec they considered effects on fish reproduction e g feminization egg production fertilization or hatching as the most sensitive endpoints in our study only one sample reached similar level of eeq 1 95 ng l 1 sample v1 from dolní lužický lake however lahnsteiner et al 2006 described significant decrease of semen fertility of rainbow trout oncorhynchus mykiss also after exposure to concentration 1 ng l 1 of e2 this level of estrogenic activity was observed in 4 lakes ponds from our study in at least one sample table 2 when we compare the eeqs with the proposed environmental quality standard for e2 from the european wfd watch list com 2011 876 the level 0 4 ng l 1 was exceeded on 11 out of 19 localities ten sites also exceeded the recently suggested effect based trigger value for in vitro estrogenicity assessment of 0 5 ng l 1 eeq van der oost et al 2017 unlike the above mentioned levels which were derived specifically for e2 and therefore considered only the studies focusing on this compound the effect based trigger value of van der oost et al 2017 was estimated for the effect observed in the bioassay so in the process of derivation of this value ec50 values of different estrogenic compounds were converted to equivalent concentrations of the reference compound e2 and included in the assessment this trigger value was derived as a concentration that will adversely affect 5 of the species and was meant to prioritize the localities where detailed chemical analyses for characterisation of the responsible compounds are required from concentrations of individual compounds and their rps we calculated the ceeqs considering 3 scenarios minimum scenario takes into account only the concentrations above loq and simulates the lowest potential estrogenicity contributed by the analysed estrogenic compounds however also the compounds below loq could be present in the samples in the concentration range 0 loq to demonstrate the potential contribution of the compounds below loq and relative importance of their limits of quantification we have calculated also the hypothetical mean and maximum scenarios mean scenario shows the average estimate of the contribution of all compounds analysed in this study as we set the concentration of compounds below loq to the level of loq 2 in the maximum scenario we set the concentration of analytes below loq to the level of loq to demonstrate the highest potential contribution of the compounds to the estrogenicity of water it is not probable that all the unquantified compounds would be present at loq levels but this maximum scenario demonstrates the impact of lc ms ms method loqs on the explicability of biological effects it also helps to estimate the minimal part of bioactivity that cannot be explained by the presence of analysed compounds in a simple additive model the results of minimum scenario ceeqs are shown in table 2 the comparison of all three scenarios is shown in supplementary material s2 contributions of individual compounds to ceeqs are presented in supplementary materials s3 s5 the mass balance calculations are frequently used to assess the potential contribution of analysed compounds to detected bioactivities e g chou et al 2015 grund et al 2011 miege et al 2009 in these calculations the compounds below the loq are frequently not considered thus only the minimum scenario is presented and discussed however as is demonstrated by our results even the values below loqs could play a significant role especially in case of highly potent compounds e g natural and synthetic steroid estrogens or too high loqs of less potent compounds we observed large differences between the minimum mean and maximum scenario ceeqs of estrogenic hormones and flavonoids the largest differences were in the ceeqs of estrogenic hormones especially due to e2 and ee2 these two compounds are the most potent rps 1 and 1 36 respectively but were rarely detected above their loq of 200 pg l 1 despite the applied sensitive analytical methods with relatively low loqs of e2 and ee2 which are comparable or better than for other recently published methods conley et al 2017 čelić et al 2017 česen and heath 2017 even the levels below loq could be significant together they add 248 pg l 1 to the mean scenario ceeq and 496 pg l 1 to the maximum scenario ceeq of samples where they were found below the loq in case of flavonoids ceeqs were sometimes up to 56 and 100 times higher for the mean and maximum scenario respectively when compared with the minimum scenario despite this the difference between the minimum and maximum scenarios was less than 1 pg l 1 in all cases ceeqs of alkylphenols were almost the same in all scenarios as the rps of these compounds 5 45 10 5 and also their loqs 70 pg l 1 are very low therefore their influence on maximum scenario ceeq is negligible in the next step eeqs of water samples determined in the biotest were compared with ceeqs calculated for the studied groups of estrogenic compounds expressed as a contribution to the eeq in table 2 and supplementary material s2 and s5 using the minimum scenario eeqs estimated from in vitro assay were higher or comparable to ceeqs ceeqs corresponded to 0 022 112 of eeqs in this scenario the contribution of all analysed compounds was mostly very low for 26 samples from 14 localities more than 94 of the total estrogenic activity remained unexplained only in jamský lake locality 10 concentrations of analysed compounds completely explained the observed activity in v1 and v2 sample and in both cases the estrogenic hormones were entirely responsible for the estrogenic effects table 2 alkylphenols and flavonoids generally accounted for less than 1 of the estrogenic activity of water samples with the maximum contribution of 3 from both these groups of compounds in the mean scenario compounds below loq could add up to 260 pg l 1 to the ceeq this of course significantly increased the part of bioactivity attributable to our analytes the estrogenicity observed in bioassay could be entirely explained in 12 samples and the lowest contribution of ceeq to the eeq was 16 using the maximum scenario on the other hand all analysed compounds at their loq level would together account for 510 pg l 1 which would entirely explain the activity of 14 out of the 32 samples that showed detectable estrogenic activity for the samples with the eeq below 1 ng l 1 the maximum scenario ceeq shows that with the contribution of the compounds at their loq levels the estrogenic activity would be explained by more than 50 however for the samples with eeq 1 ng l 1 the higher the eeq determined from the biotest the lower was the contribution of the analysed compounds for the sample with the highest estrogenic activity locality 3 sample v1 eeq 1950 pg l 1 the maximum scenario ceeq accounted for only 29 of the eeq this indicates that other compounds or possible interactions between individual estrogenic substances play an important role in estrogenic activity of stagnant surface waters other studies also report estrogenic hormones as the main contributors to the estrogenic activity of surface waters but all these studies were conducted on rivers for example in the study of miege et al 2009 concentrations of estrogenic hormones determined by lc ms ms method explained at least about 50 of eeqs observed in the bioassay for river water samples chou et al 2015 explored the contribution of estrogenic hormones and alkylphenols to the estrogenicity of taiwanese rivers and attributed from 28 to more than 100 of the estrogenic activity to these compounds with e1 and e2 being the most significant chemical lc ms ms and biological yes assay analyses of danube river sediments also revealed e1 as the main contributor to the estrogenic activity from the selected set of compounds e1 e2 ee2 bisphenol a and nonylphenol grund et al 2011 still in comparison with the biologically determined estrogenicity of sediment extracts the lc ms ms analyses explained about 55 of the activity on one locality and less than 6 on the other four these studies chou et al 2015 grund et al 2011 miege et al 2009 therefore report considerable part of the biological activity of some samples 45 98 as unexplained however they also did not consider compounds below quantification limits which could increase the part of estrogenicity attributed to the analysed estrogens although estrogenic hormones are often reported as the main contributing compounds oh et al 2009 associated also alkylphenols with a considerable portion of estrogenic activity of river water they found alkylphenols at concentrations up to 2 μg l 1 in samples that exhibited estrogenic activity and these levels explained 34 of the total estrogenicity phytoestrogens in surface waters usually do not reach concentrations that could cause an observable estrogenic effect however in specific cases like drainage water from fields of plants rich in phytoestrogens their concentrations can be up to several μg l 1 and in such high levels they can be also relevant and dominant drivers of estrogenicity hoerger et al 2011 nevertheless there were relatively low levels of both phytoestrogens and alkylphenols with no significant contribution to estrogenicity across all different stagnant waters in our study the analysed compounds did not fully explain the observed in vitro estrogenic activity at some sites even when the maximum uncertainty connected with the in ability of chemical analytical methods to detect the low concentrations of estrogenic compounds was taken into account this indicates that other unidentified compounds are probably contributing to the observed estrogenicity and to identify them e g the effect directed analysis to isolate these compounds would be needed compounds that could contribute to the total estrogenicity and were not analysed in this study include for example estrogens produced by fungi mycoestrogen zearalenone and its metabolites have rps in the range of 5 10 4 6 8 10 1 and their concentrations can reach up to tens or hundreds of ng l 1 in surface waters jarošová et al 2015 cyanobacteria and algae could be another potential source of estrogenic substances it was reported that their biomass can contain low concentrations of phytoestrogens goiris et al 2014 klejdus et al 2010 their metabolites can also induce in vivo estrogenic activity marie et al 2012 rogers et al 2011 however in this study there does not seem to be any direct relationship between the estrogenicity of water or occurrence of phytoestrogens and phytoplankton concentration or composition the site with the highest and the second least density of phytoplankton locality 4 90 8 106 cells ml 1 and locality 5 0 04 106 cells ml 1 respectively had both eeq below loq 20 pg l 1 on the other hand the site with the second highest density locality 3 38 9 106 cells ml 1 had the highest eeqs 1950 and 1530 pg l 1 in sample v1 and v2 respectively the estrogenic activity does not seem to be connected with a specific group of phytoplankton either for example cyanobacteria dominate at localities 12 and 16 at similar densities around 2 106 cells ml 1 yet the eeqs at locality 12 1120 and 570 pg l 1 are at least 5 times higher than at locality 16 90 and 100 pg l 1 similarly phytoplankton on localities 14 and 19 is dominated by green microalgae and the eeqs at site 14 140 and 170 pg l 1 are 5 times lower than at site 19 1250 and 920 pg l 1 phytoestrogens generally occurred at low levels across all studied water bodies the two sites with greatest biomass densities locality 3 4 belong to those with the greatest phytoestrogen concentrations but comparable levels were found at sites 10 and 16 with much lower cell densities and very different species composition 4 conclusions stagnant freshwaters are under multiple pressures especially in urbanized and agricultural areas which leads to co occurrence of various anthropogenic and natural estrogenic compounds since estrogenic activities in these ecosystems can reach levels comparable to wwtp affected rivers greater attention needs to be paid to the endocrine disruptive potency of present compound mixtures the major contributors and their sources need to be identified mass balance calculations of the contribution of analyzed compounds to detected bioactivities need to take into consideration their limits of quantification especially in the case of highly potent compounds the contribution to the detected bioactivities might be significant even below these limits a complex approach including bioassays is needed when assessing the estrogenicity of these types of surface waters as it could be underestimated if predicted from the concentrations of analysed estrogenic hormones alkylphenols or phytoestrogens organisms in stagnant waters affected by cyanobacterial water blooms can be next to the different groups of estrogenic compounds co exposed to other bioactive and toxic compounds from cyanobacteria as well as to other stressors associated with massive blooms such as decreased oxygen levels or reduced light penetration this can increase the vulnerability of exposed organisms and lead to adverse effects even below effective levels of the individual stressors mitigation actions should be implemented on the stagnant water bodies with longer term pollution and water bloom problems including reduction of input of both nutrients and endocrine

19644,although many knowledge models describing the rejection of ionic compounds by nanofiltration membranes are available in literature they are all used in full recycling mode indeed both permeate and retentate streams are recycled in order to maintain constant concentrations in the feed solution however nanofiltration of real effluents is implemented either in concentration or diafiltration modes for which the permeate stream is collected in these conditions concentrations progressively evolve during filtration and classical models fail to predict performances in this paper an improvement of the so called donnan steric pore model which includes both volume and concentration variations over time is proposed this dynamic model is used here to predict the evolution of volumes and concentrations in both permeate and retentate streams during the filtration of salt solutions this model was found to predict accurately the filtration performances with various salts whether the filtration is performed in concentration or diafiltration modes the parameters of the usual model can be easily assessed from full batch experiments before being used in the dynamic version nevertheless it is also highlighted that the variation of the membrane charge due to the evolution of feed concentration over time has to be taken into account in the model through the use of adsorption isotherms graphical abstract image 1 keywords nanofiltration ion rejection dynamic model real modes of operation donnan steric pore model 1 introduction the treatment of effluents before their discharge in environment is a key issue due to the steady growth of contaminated wastewaters released by urban and industrial communities lefebvre and moletta 2006 in this context the remediation of waters containing ionic pollutants such as heavy metals and especially the development of cutting edge technologies to remove ions are an overriding issue for many types of industries kentish and stevens 2001 van der bruggen et al 2003 efligenir et al 2014 from this standpoint membrane technology and especially nanofiltration emerged as a suitable option to remove ionic compounds due to rejection mechanisms governed by both size and electrical charge schaep et al 1998 wang et al 2007 van der bruggen et al 2008 déon et al 2017 during the last decades many researchers have tried to develop relevant mathematical tools to predict the performances of the nanofiltration process with a view to their use for the development of new processes as well as the diagnostic scale up or optimization of existing processes bowen and welfoot 2002b kovács et al 2008 déon et al 2014 for this purpose several approaches have been proposed in literature based on either phenomenological permeances ahmad et al 2005 chaudhari and murthy 2010 fridman bishop et al 2015 yaroshchuk and bruening 2017 or mechanistic description of mass transfer wang et al 1995 bowen et al 2002 bargeman et al 2005 all the approaches exhibit strengths and weaknesses but models based on the coupling between transport within the membrane pores by convection diffusion and electro migration and an equilibrium partitioning at the membrane solution interfaces steric electric and dielectric exclusions have demonstrated a strong robustness and an outstanding potential for performance prediction bowen et al 2002 bandini and vezzani 2003 déon et al 2013a in particular they allow a link between the various transfer mechanisms and several physicochemical parameters characteristic of the membrane solution couple labbez et al 2003 déon et al 2013b silva et al 2016 indeed rejection of ions is found to strongly depend on membrane charge density and dielectric constant inside pores which can be experimentally assessed for instance by streaming potential current measurements afonso et al 2001 lanteri et al 2012 or impedance spectroscopy bason et al 2007 efligenir et al 2015 respectively these models which were improved over the years have displayed their ability to describe and even predict the ion rejection performances of salts solutions and multi component ionic mixtures geraldes and brites alves 2008 silva et al 2011 déon et al 2012 nevertheless simulations are always carried out for a given feed concentration so that mechanisms can be understood and discussed with cross flow filtration experiments for fitting or comparison with simulations are always implemented by recycling permeate solution in the feed tank to keep constant ion concentrations unfortunately this operating condition does not allow the users to collect a large volume of permeate solution during filtration batch filtration carried out in real conditions wastewater treatment for instance is performed by retrieving the permeate stream over the filtration time in this case two operating modes are possible depending on the aim of the filtration step with the classical concentration mode the volume of feed solution progressively decreases and its concentration therefore increases over filtration time with the diafiltration mode the decrease of feed volume due to permeation is balanced by adding the same quantity of pure water consequently the feed volume is kept constant during filtration and concentrations progressively decrease over time in both cases rejection performances being strongly governed by the concentration of the feed solution a classical model cannot be adequately used to predict performances similarly dead end filtration modules are often used to investigate the performances of synthesized membranes or to adjust model parameters on rejections however concentrations within the feed compartment increase very quickly and differently depending on solute rejection with such a filtration mode classical models are also unreliable and an alternative has to be found for these reasons a dynamic model that describes evolution of volumes and concentrations over filtration time was developed and the predicted performances are compared to those measured during filtration in real conditions the parameters of the transport model were firstly identified by fitting experimental results at constant concentrations before being used to predict the performance evolutions over time the trends are then compared to experimental filtration to observe and discuss the influence of the feed progressive concentration on overall performances in both concentration and diafiltration modes 2 experimental description 2 1 solutions and analyses synthetic solutions were made with demineralized water with a residual conductivity lower than 0 1 μs cm salts used to prepare ionic solutions were provided by acros organics concentration of the various ions was measured by ionic chromatography 883 basic ic plus metrohm courtaboeuf france 2 2 filtration experiments filtration experiments were carried out with a semi industrial pilot plant for cross flow nanofiltration see fig 1 the feed tank can contain 50 l of feed solution that are pumped in various available filtration modules the dead volume being estimated at 2 l irrespective of the module used in this study solutions were filtered with a tubular thin film polyamide membrane afc40 d 12 7 mm l 1 22 m supplied by pci membrane systems ltd basingtoke uk the process operates in batch mode and retentate stream is recycled into the feed tank temperature of the feed solution is regulated at 25 1 c by a cooling unit experiments were carried out at the maximum feed flow rate 2000 l h corresponding to re 55 000 to limit the ion accumulation at the membrane surface indeed previous studies have demonstrated that a velocity increase tends to reduce concentration polarization layer and minimize its impact on rejection déon et al 2013a before the experimental campaign the membrane was washed following a cleaning sequence to remove preservatives this was done by filtering ultrasil 53 solution 5 g l at 40 c followed by an ultrasil 75 solution 3 ml l at room temperature as recommended by the supplier then water was permeated at 25 bar until water flux remains constant before hydraulic permeability estimation three specific operating procedures were implemented for filtration experiments as it is illustrated in fig 2 full batch mode for which permeate stream is recycled into the feed tank except for sampling to keep feed concentration constant for parameter estimations concentration mode for which permeate stream is progressively collected over filtration time and feed volume progressively decreases for an applied pressure of 15 bar diafiltration mode for which permeate stream is progressively collected over filtration time for an applied pressure of 15 bar however the same quantity of pure water is added into the feed tank to keep feed volume constant a salt concentration nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 of 10 mol m 3 was chosen for filtration in concentration mode since feed concentration strongly increases during filtration conversely the feed concentration was set at 100 mol m 3 for diafiltration since feed concentration decreases over time 3 mathematical modeling of dynamic nf the proposed model is an improvement of a usual pore transport model déon et al 2011b which takes the variation of concentrations over filtration time into account performances are predicted by transport model which is accurately detailed hereafter throughout filtration by considering concentrations obtained up to the time considered the modeling of ion transport through the membrane is similar to those usually used in literature dspm dspm de sede but its resolution is iterated over time considering the evolution of feed properties during the filtration the resolution procedure is provided by the diagram in fig 3 with the dynamic part in red and the main equations are detailed hereinafter the nomenclature used in this study is provided as supplementary material 3 1 transport modeling the transport model used in this study consists in linking equilibrium partitioning at the two membrane interfaces i e at the pore inlet and outlet to the transport within homogeneous pores the transport within nanopores is described by the so called extended nernst planck equation eq 1 whereas equilibrium partitioning is described by a combination of steric electric and dielectric exclusion and non ideality correction eq 2 the extended nernst planck enp relation defines the molar flux in the axial direction x as resulting of three contributions namely diffusion convection electro migration bowen and welfoot 2002a 1 j i k i d d i c i z i c i k i d d i r t f ψ k i c c i v with d i z i and c i the diffusivity at infinite dilution the valence and the local concentration within the pores of the ith ion respectively k i c and k i d are the hindrance factors for convection and diffusion respectively anderson and quinn 1974 deen et al 1980 the resolution of the transport equation requires the knowledge of the concentration at the pore inlet indeed ions are differently distributed on both sides of the interfaces between external and internal solutions according to an equilibrium partitioning the equilibrium is based on the electrochemical potential equality on both sides of the interface donnan exclusion modified to take account of the steric and dielectric exclusions hence the ratio between concentrations on both sides of the interface can be calculated by bowen and welfoot 2002a 2 c i c i γ i s o l γ i p o r e φ i exp δ w i exp z i f r t δ ψ d where δψ d denotes the so called donnan potential whereas c i represents the concentration of the external solution in the permeate stream c i p or at the membrane wall in the retentate feed stream c i f depending on the interface considered and c i that at the internal side of the interface c i 0 or c i δx with δx the membrane effective thickness the terms ϕ i and δw i represent the steric exclusion and the solvation energy barrier due to difference in solution dielectric properties on both sides of the interface respectively their contribution to partitioning can be estimated for cylindrical pores by 3 φ i 1 λ i 2 1 r i r p 2 4 δ w i b o r n z i 2 e 2 8 π ε 0 k t r i 1 ε p 1 ε b these expressions are coupled with expression of the permeate volume flux j v that is calculated by the darcy s law 5 j v l p η δ p δ π where η is the solution viscosity l p the membrane hydraulic permeability l p 1 r m with r m the hydraulic resistance and δπ the osmotic pressure difference which can be evaluated by the van t hoff relation this mechanistic approach has shown an outstanding ability to describe and eventually predict the performances obtained by nanofiltration of salt or multi ionic solutions although several versions were proposed in literature the one used in this study was proved to be relevant due to its accuracy combined with robustness all the equations of the model are given as supplementary material table s1 with the values considered for ion diffusivities and stokes radii table s2 the numerical resolution of these equations which was accurately detailed in previous papers déon et al 2009 can be summarized as follows concentrations at the pore inlet c i 0 are calculated from feed concentrations c i f with equilibrium partitioning at the feed pore interface concentration profile along the pore including pore outlet concentrations c i δx are determined by the enp equation concentrations in the permeate stream c i p are calculated with equilibrium partitioning at the pore permeate interface and the values are reused after relaxation in the step 2 for iteration steps 2 and 3 are iterated until permeate concentrations c i p converge to constant values 3 2 modeling of performance evolution over filtration time simulations were carried out with a time step δt of 5 min for which it is considered that the variation of performances is almost negligible for each time t the usual transport model described in 3 1 is used to predict the one time performances at the next time t δt from the feed concentration c f t and the corresponding membrane charge density x d t these one time performances namely the permeate flux j v t δt and concentration of the permeate stream c p t δt are then used in mass balances to calculate the cumulated or overall values and especially the feed concentration c f t δt which is required for the next iteration the volumes of feed solution v f t δt permeate stream during this time step v p t δt and cumulated permeate solution v p cum t δt as well as the volume reduction factor vrf t δt are calculated from mass balances with the following equations 6 d v f d t s m j v which means that 7 v p t δ t j v t δ t s m δ t 8 v p c u m t δ t v p c u m t v p t δ t 9 v f t δ t v f t v p t δ t 10 v r f t δ t v f 0 v f t δ t additionally concentrations of feed c f t δt and cumulated permeate c p cum t δt solutions are calculated according to eqs 11 and 12 11 c f t δ t c f t v f t c p t δ t v p t δ t v f t δ t 12 c p c u m t δ t c p c u m t v p c u m t c p t δ t v p t δ t v p c u m t δ t in diafiltration mode feed volume is kept constant by water addition and eqs 7 12 are therefore identical except eq 9 that becomes 13 v f t δ t v f t v f t 0 finally rejection can be calculated for each time step irrespective of the mode considered by 14 r t 1 c p t δ t c f t δ t the overall rejection performance of the process after a filtration time t is estimated by 15 r c u m t 1 c p c u m t δ t c f 0 all these performances are collected at the end of the numerical step and the feed properties c f t δt and v f t δt obtained at this step are used as input values c f t and v f t for the next time iteration all the procedure is iterated until the filtration duration t f is achieved cf fig 3 it should be stressed that the contribution of the concentration polarization phenomenon is not considered in this model since the purpose of this dynamic model is to propose a simple tool to predict evolution of performances during filtration the resolution of a dynamic version of the 2 d pore and polarization transport model pptm which was previously developed déon et al 2011a would have been too unwieldy and especially when the aim is a potential application for industrial purposes 4 results discussion before investigating the simulation with the dynamic model parameters of the transport model are required and their estimation from full batch filtration is described in the following section before investigating concentration and diafiltration modes 4 1 determination of model parameters the classical transport model described above requires the assessment of 4 input parameters characterizing the structural and physicochemical properties of the couple membrane solution the membrane hydraulic permeability l p the mean pore radius r p the dielectric constant within membrane pores ε p the membrane volume charge density x d the hydraulic permeability and mean pore radius were estimated by adjusting their values in eqs 5 and 16 to fit the evolutions of pure water flux and glucose rejection respectively cavaco morão et al 2008 16 r g l u 1 φ i k i c 1 1 φ i k i c exp k i c δ p 8 k i d d i η r p 2 the experimental and simulated curves with the adjusted r p value are provided as supplementary material fig s1 for illustration this membrane afc 40 was already investigated in previous studies with solutions containing various salt contents the estimated hydraulic permeability and mean pore radius obtained in this study are given in table 1 and their values agree with those reported in other studies otero et al 2008 déon et al 2012 for the sake of simplicity the values of the dielectric constant of the confined solution ε p for each salt were collected from previous papers in the adequate conditions the ε p values for nacl and mgcl2 were taken from fig 6 in déon et al 2012 by extrapolating to pure salt solutions the linear trend with mg2 proportion obtained from nacl mgcl2 mixtures with the afc 40 same membrane than that used in this study the ε p value for na2so4 was obtained similarly from values estimated for various proportions of so4 2 in mixtures of nacl na2so4 déon et al 2009 finally the membrane charge density was numerically adjusted on salt rejection curves to ensure that the rejection at constant feed concentration is correctly described by the transport model the experimental salt rejections and the simulated curves obtained by adjusting the membrane charge density summarized in table 1 are provided in fig 4 the values of the various input parameters corresponding to the various salt solutions are summarized in table 1 4 2 filtration in concentration mode 4 2 1 evolution of the one time performances during filtration in concentration mode it is obvious that performances evolve over time since the feed volume decreases due to permeation fig 5 a depicts the evolution of salt rejection and permeate flux over time for a solution of nacl 10 mol m 3 by considering the membrane charge estimated for the initial feed concentration all along the filtration experiment trends should not be discussed further since experimental curves are not correctly predicted by the model indeed fig 5 shows that rejection is supposed to decrease more sharply that it was observed experimentally consequently the decline of the permeate flux is underestimated by the model and it would be expected that the experimental value decreases more softly than it is measured this discrepancy may be imputed to the fact that membrane charge density was considered constant during filtration whereas feed concentration progressively increases over filtration time indeed it is well known that membrane charge is linked to concentration so that it is more rigorous to consider that the negative membrane charge progressively increases during filtration due to adsorption hence the membrane charge density x d estimated by fitting the experimental curves cf fig 4 and table 1 in 4 1 was linked to salt concentration by means of adsorption isotherms provided in fig 6 so that the evolution of membrane charge with feed concentration can be taken into account in the model fig 6 shows that evolution of x d value with salt concentration can be described by freundlich isotherms the value of the membrane charge density can thus be calculated over time knowing the evolution of feed concentration then simulations are run by considering adsorption isotherms and the corresponding curves for the three investigated salts are provided in fig 7 and compared with experimental data the agreement between experimental and predicted curves provided in fig 7 compared with disagreement highlighted in fig 5 demonstrates the need to consider a charge variation during filtration moreover the use of adsorption isotherms that are previously assessed from the filtration of salt solutions in full recycling mode appears fully efficient for predictive purposes this means that changes in adsorption equilibrium due to the slight variation of concentration over time are sufficiently rapid so that the membrane charge remains linked to feed concentration all along the filtration process fig 7 also show that the salt rejection evolves differently according to the type of salt indeed when the concentration of the feed solution increases the increase of ionic strength leads to a reduction of the electrical double layer edl thickness hence the ratio of debye length to membrane pore radius is lowered which leads to lower electric interactions at the pore entry shang et al 2014 this decrease of electrostatic interactions induced by the concentration increase has a different impact with mgcl2 due to the higher valence of magnesium ion compared to sodium ion the progressive increase of feed concentration therefore tends to decrease mg2 electrostatic attraction leading to a gradual increase in salt rejection which can be observed from both experimental and simulated curves conversely the permeate flux always decreases when feed concentration increases irrespective of the filtered solution it is worthwhile to understand that the permeate flux evolution is mainly governed by the evolution of the osmotic pressure difference δπ osmotic pressure is linked to concentration by the van t hoff relation and δπ is thus governed by the concentration difference between feed and permeate streams c f c p therefore osmotic pressure difference increases when feed concentration increases at constant rejection whereas it decreases when rejection decreases at constant feed concentration consequently the decrease observed with nacl tends to show that the impact of the concentration increase outweighs the impact of rejection decrease this conclusion seems relevant in the light of the ranges of variation observed for these two parameters in the case of mgcl2 the increase of both feed concentration and rejection necessarily leads to a decline of permeate flux it should be noted that the experimental permeate flux decreases more sharply at the end of the filtration time than predicted by the model cf fig 7a and b this discrepancy could perhaps be explained by a reasonable increase of the solution viscosity around 3 4 due to the high salt amount which is not considered in the model nevertheless it is probable that such a deviation leads to a weak discordance on the overall performances feed and permeate properties which will be investigated in the following sections 4 2 2 evolution of the vrf and feed properties during filtration as mentioned above the feed volume decreases over filtration time in concentration mode due to permeate stream retrieval fig 8 shows the evolution of the vrf during filtration for the various salt solutions investigated and the trends are compared with those measured during filtration experiments from fig 8 it can be seen that vrf does not increase linearly although the feed volume decreases almost linearly cf fig 9 indeed the profile firstly increases slightly during the 6 first hours followed by an abrupt growth within the last three hours this evolution is comparable to that of the feed concentration fig 9 which means that vrf is more an indicator of a concentration increase than an indicator of a volume reduction strictly speaking the evolution of vrf over time is similar irrespective of the solution considered since it is only governed by the permeation which is almost the same for all the solutions filtered however it can be noticed that the vrf value increases more sharply in the last hours with nacl than mgcl2 and even more than na2so4 due to the lower permeation flux observed with multivalent ions comparison between experimental and predicted values of vrf confirms that the model correctly predicts the reduction of feed volume this trend is corroborated by fig 9 that depict the theoretical and experimental evolutions of feed volume and concentration throughout the filtration of various salt solutions fig 9 show that feed volume decreases linearly in all the time that filtration lasts oppositely the feed concentration increases sharply when only few liters remain in the feed tank this abrupt rise of concentration cannot be checked experimentally since the corresponding feed volume is too small for a correct functioning however the evolution of feed concentration is accurately predicted by the model over the investigated time interval contrary to vrf concentration increase is more abrupt for na2so4 than mgcl2 due to the combined effect of both permeation and rejection indeed the very high rejection of na2so4 leads to a faster concentration increase in the feed tank even though volume is reduced more slowly than with mgcl2 4 2 3 evolution of the overall performances for an industrial application in concentration mode the key is the properties of the cumulated permeate stream for this reason the evolutions of the volume and salt concentration of the permeate recovered solution over filtration time are shown in fig 10 fig 10 clearly show that both volume and concentration of the permeate stream increase over time and the experimental values are correctly predicted by the dynamic model this means that the overall rejection considering initial feed concentration decreases which can be seen in fig 11 the slight discrepancy observable during filtration of mgcl2 solution can probably be attributed to a higher sensitivity of rejection and permeate concentration to membrane charge with this salt i e lower x d variation with concentration or to a contribution of the concentration polarization phenomenon which is not considered here therefore if the purpose of this filtration step is the salt or ionic contaminant removal it is obvious that the permeate concentration should be as low as possible and rejection high and so filtration time should be minimized and especially it should not exceed 5 h agreement between predictions and experiences emphasizes that the proposed dynamic model is a perfect tool to define the best conditions and especially the more adequate filtration time to achieve set overall removal performances since permeate volume increases linearly with time the duration of filtration has therefore no influence on volume performance evolution however the model can predict the volume of polluted solution that can be treated in a given filtration time 4 3 diafiltration mode diafiltration mode is used when the purpose of the filtration step is to remove a weakly retained compound from the feed solution for instance it can be usually used to remove salt from an effluent and recover a high added value product which is almost fully retained by the membrane for this purpose pure water is progressively added to the feed tank to keep feed volume constant in this case the concentration of the fully rejected compound remains constant whereas that of the partially rejected compound evolves over filtration time the latter being progressively removed from feed solution in this study only the partially retained salt is studied to ease experiments and discussion since concentration of fully rejected species remains constant over time the reliability of the proposed modeling is therefore investigated by using diafiltration mode to progressively remove concentrated solution of nacl which is weakly rejected by the nf membrane the evolutions of nacl rejection and permeate flux during diafiltration of a solution initially containing 100 mol m 3 of nacl are provided in fig 12 fig 12 shows that the slight increase of the nacl rejection over diafiltration time is perfectly predicted by the dynamic model even if permeate flux is somewhat underestimated for the first hours of filtration this discrepancy can probably be attributed to the high concentration of nacl used in this experiment which could explain why discrepancy decreases over time when feed concentration progressively decreases this discrepancy could perhaps be imputed to concentration polarization although it was previously shown that this phenomenon has a little impact on permeate flux déon et al 2007 it is also possible that osmotic pressure difference is more roughly described by the van t hoff relation with such a high concentration however it should be noted that this deviation is lower than 8 and its impact on overall performances is very weak as it is proved in the further course of the discussion figs 13 and 14 the evolution of feed concentration and permeate volume and concentration over time are depicted in fig 13 as expected with such a filtration mode both feed and permeate concentrations notably decrease over time due to the low rejection of nacl moreover it is also highlighted that these decreases are perfectly predicted by the model additionally fig 13b also confirms that the discrepancy between predicted and experimental permeate flux during the first hours has no profound influence on the prediction of overall performances and the deviation progressively declines from 8 to 5 finally comparison between predicted and experimental overall nacl rejection considering initial feed concentration which can be done from fig 14 corroborates the reliability of the dynamic model proposed in this study it is worth mentioning that the aim of diafiltration being to remove salt from feed solution the rejection increase observed during filtration tends to diminish the performance of the process 5 conclusion in this paper it was highlighted that classical models fail to predict the performances of nanofiltration in real conditions of water treatment due to the variation of feed concentration throughout the filtration to overcome this issue a dynamic model that takes the variation of volume and concentration as well as membrane charge density over time into account is proposed this model based on a classical transport model coupled with mass balances succeeds in predicting the one time and overall performances of a nanofiltration process during the filtration of various salt solutions either in concentration or diafiltration modes it was especially shown that evolution of concentrations and volumes are different depending on the salt considered and the mode of filtration nonetheless the predicted performances are accurate and the model appears suitable irrespective of the experimental conditions and especially the valence of ions its successful use only needs few experiments to assess the input parameters required for fully predictive purposes to conclude such a tool turns out to be a perfect solution to predict all the filtration performances required to develop new membrane processes or determine the optimal conditions for given application nevertheless its potential use towards the resolution of real issues involves the investigation of more complex ionic mixtures especially the influence of competitive adsorption between the various ions in solution on the membrane charge should be elucidated before being applied to the treatment of complex mixtures acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the region of bourgogne franche comté grant number 2016y 04563

kentish and stevens 2001 van der bruggen et al 2003 efligenir et al 2014 from this standpoint membrane technology and especially nanofiltration emerged as a suitable option to remove ionic compounds due to rejection mechanisms governed by both size and electrical charge schaep et al 1998 wang et al 2007 van der bruggen et al 2008 déon et al 2017 during the last decades many researchers have tried to develop relevant mathematical tools to predict the performances of the nanofiltration process with a view to their use for the development of new processes as well as the diagnostic scale up or optimization of existing processes bowen and welfoot 2002b kovács et al 2008 déon et al 2014 for this purpose several approaches have been proposed in literature based on either phenomenological permeances ahmad et al 2005 chaudhari and murthy 2010 fridman bishop et al 2015 yaroshchuk and bruening 2017 or mechanistic description of mass transfer wang et al 1995 bowen et al 2002 bargeman et al 2005 all the approaches exhibit strengths and weaknesses but models based on the coupling between transport within the membrane pores by convection diffusion and electro migration and an equilibrium partitioning at the membrane solution interfaces steric electric and dielectric exclusions have demonstrated a strong robustness and an outstanding potential for performance prediction bowen et al 2002 bandini and vezzani 2003 déon et al 2013a in particular they allow a link between the various transfer mechanisms and several physicochemical parameters characteristic of the membrane solution couple labbez et al 2003 déon et al 2013b silva et al 2016 indeed rejection of ions is found to strongly depend on membrane charge density and dielectric constant inside pores which can be experimentally assessed for instance by streaming potential current measurements afonso et al 2001 lanteri et al 2012 or impedance spectroscopy bason et al 2007 efligenir et al 2015 respectively these models which were improved over the years have displayed their ability to describe and even predict the ion rejection performances of salts solutions and multi component ionic mixtures geraldes and brites alves 2008 silva et al 2011 déon et al 2012 nevertheless simulations are always carried out for a given feed concentration so that mechanisms can be understood and discussed with cross flow filtration experiments for fitting or comparison with simulations are always implemented by recycling permeate solution in the feed tank to keep constant ion concentrations unfortunately this operating condition does not allow the users to collect a large volume of permeate solution during filtration batch filtration carried out in real conditions wastewater treatment for instance is performed by retrieving the permeate stream over the filtration time in this case two operating modes are possible depending on the aim of the filtration step with the classical concentration mode the volume of feed solution progressively decreases and its concentration therefore increases over filtration time with the diafiltration mode the decrease of feed volume due to permeation is balanced by adding the same quantity of pure water consequently the feed volume is kept constant during filtration and concentrations progressively decrease over time in both cases rejection performances being strongly governed by the concentration of the feed solution a classical model cannot be adequately used to predict performances similarly dead end filtration modules are often used to investigate the performances of synthesized membranes or to adjust model parameters on rejections however concentrations within the feed compartment increase very quickly and differently depending on solute rejection with such a filtration mode classical models are also unreliable and an alternative has to be found for these reasons a dynamic model that describes evolution of volumes and concentrations over filtration time was developed and the predicted performances are compared to those measured during filtration in real conditions the parameters of the transport model were firstly identified by fitting experimental results at constant concentrations before being used to predict the performance evolutions over time the trends are then compared to experimental filtration to observe and discuss the influence of the feed progressive concentration on overall performances in both concentration and diafiltration modes 2 experimental description 2 1 solutions and analyses synthetic solutions were made with demineralized water with a residual conductivity lower than 0 1 μs cm salts used to prepare ionic solutions were provided by acros organics concentration of the various ions was measured by ionic chromatography 883 basic ic plus metrohm courtaboeuf france 2 2 filtration experiments filtration experiments were carried out with a semi industrial pilot plant for cross flow nanofiltration see fig 1 the feed tank can contain 50 l of feed solution that are pumped in various available filtration modules the dead volume being estimated at 2 l irrespective of the module used in this study solutions were filtered with a tubular thin film polyamide membrane afc40 d 12 7 mm l 1 22 m supplied by pci membrane systems ltd basingtoke uk the process operates in batch mode and retentate stream is recycled into the feed tank temperature of the feed solution is regulated at 25 1 c by a cooling unit experiments were carried out at the maximum feed flow rate 2000 l h corresponding to re 55 000 to limit the ion accumulation at the membrane surface indeed previous studies have demonstrated that a velocity increase tends to reduce concentration polarization layer and minimize its impact on rejection déon et al 2013a before the experimental campaign the membrane was washed following a cleaning sequence to remove preservatives this was done by filtering ultrasil 53 solution 5 g l at 40 c followed by an ultrasil 75 solution 3 ml l at room temperature as recommended by the supplier then water was permeated at 25 bar until water flux remains constant before hydraulic permeability estimation three specific operating procedures were implemented for filtration experiments as it is illustrated in fig 2 full batch mode for which permeate stream is recycled into the feed tank except for sampling to keep feed concentration constant for parameter estimations concentration mode for which permeate stream is progressively collected over filtration time and feed volume progressively decreases for an applied pressure of 15 bar diafiltration mode for which permeate stream is progressively collected over filtration time for an applied pressure of 15 bar however the same quantity of pure water is added into the feed tank to keep feed volume constant a salt concentration nacl mgcl2 and na2so4 of 10 mol m 3 was chosen for filtration in concentration mode since feed concentration strongly increases during filtration conversely the feed concentration was set at 100 mol m 3 for diafiltration since feed concentration decreases over time 3 mathematical modeling of dynamic nf the proposed model is an improvement of a usual pore transport model déon et al 2011b which takes the variation of concentrations over filtration time into account performances are predicted by transport model which is accurately detailed hereafter throughout filtration by considering concentrations obtained up to the time considered the modeling of ion transport through the membrane is similar to those usually used in literature dspm dspm de sede but its resolution is iterated over time considering the evolution of feed properties during the filtration the resolution procedure is provided by the diagram in fig 3 with the dynamic part in red and the main equations are detailed hereinafter the nomenclature used in this study is provided as supplementary material 3 1 transport modeling the transport model used in this study consists in linking equilibrium partitioning at the two membrane interfaces i e at the pore inlet and outlet to the transport within homogeneous pores the transport within nanopores is described by the so called extended nernst planck equation eq 1 whereas equilibrium partitioning is described by a combination of steric electric and dielectric exclusion and non ideality correction eq 2 the extended nernst planck enp relation defines the molar flux in the axial direction x as resulting of three contributions namely diffusion convection electro migration bowen and welfoot 2002a 1 j i k i d d i c i z i c i k i d d i r t f ψ k i c c i v with d i z i and c i the diffusivity at infinite dilution the valence and the local concentration within the pores of the ith ion respectively k i c and k i d are the hindrance factors for convection and diffusion respectively anderson and quinn 1974 deen et al 1980 the resolution of the transport equation requires the knowledge of the concentration at the pore inlet indeed ions are differently distributed on both sides of the interfaces between external and internal solutions according to an equilibrium partitioning the equilibrium is based on the electrochemical potential equality on both sides of the interface donnan exclusion modified to take account of the steric and dielectric exclusions hence the ratio between concentrations on both sides of the interface can be calculated by bowen and welfoot 2002a 2 c i c i γ i s o l γ i p o r e φ i exp δ w i exp z i f r t δ ψ d where δψ d denotes the so called donnan potential whereas c i represents the concentration of the external solution in the permeate stream c i p or at the membrane wall in the retentate feed stream c i f depending on the interface considered and c i that at the internal side of the interface c i 0 or c i δx with δx the membrane effective thickness the terms ϕ i and δw i represent the steric exclusion and the solvation energy barrier due to difference in solution dielectric properties on both sides of the interface respectively their contribution to partitioning can be estimated for cylindrical pores by 3 φ i 1 λ i 2 1 r i r p 2 4 δ w i b o r n z i 2 e 2 8 π ε 0 k t r i 1 ε p 1 ε b these expressions are coupled with expression of the permeate volume flux j v that is calculated by the darcy s law 5 j v l p η δ p δ π where η is the solution viscosity l p the membrane hydraulic permeability l p 1 r m with r m the hydraulic resistance and δπ the osmotic pressure difference which can be evaluated by the van t hoff relation this mechanistic approach has shown an outstanding ability to describe and eventually predict the performances obtained by nanofiltration of salt or multi ionic solutions although several versions were proposed in literature the one used in this study was proved to be relevant due to its accuracy combined with robustness all the equations of the model are given as supplementary material table s1 with the values considered for ion diffusivities and stokes radii table s2 the numerical resolution of these equations which was accurately detailed in previous papers déon et al 2009 can be summarized as follows concentrations at the pore inlet c i 0 are calculated from feed concentrations c i f with equilibrium partitioning at the feed pore interface concentration profile along the pore including pore outlet concentrations c i δx are determined by the enp equation concentrations in the permeate stream c i p are calculated with equilibrium partitioning at the pore permeate interface and the values are reused after relaxation in the step 2 for iteration steps 2 and 3 are iterated until permeate concentrations c i p converge to constant values 3 2 modeling of performance evolution over filtration time simulations were carried out with a time step δt of 5 min for which it is considered that the variation of performances is almost negligible for each time t the usual transport model described in 3 1 is used to predict the one time performances at the next time t δt from the feed concentration c f t and the corresponding membrane charge density x d t these one time performances namely the permeate flux j v t δt and concentration of the permeate stream c p t δt are then used in mass balances to calculate the cumulated or overall values and especially the feed concentration c f t δt which is required for the next iteration the volumes of feed solution v f t δt permeate stream during this time step v p t δt and cumulated permeate solution v p cum t δt as well as the volume reduction factor vrf t δt are calculated from mass balances with the following equations 6 d v f d t s m j v which means that 7 v p t δ t j v t δ t s m δ t 8 v p c u m t δ t v p c u m t v p t δ t 9 v f t δ t v f t v p t δ t 10 v r f t δ t v f 0 v f t δ t additionally concentrations of feed c f t δt and cumulated permeate c p cum t δt solutions are calculated according to eqs 11 and 12 11 c f t δ t c f t v f t c p t δ t v p t δ t v f t δ t 12 c p c u m t δ t c p c u m t v p c u m t c p t δ t v p t δ t v p c u m t δ t in diafiltration mode feed volume is kept constant by water addition and eqs 7 12 are therefore identical except eq 9 that becomes 13 v f t δ t v f t v f t 0 finally rejection can be calculated for each time step irrespective of the mode considered by 14 r t 1 c p t δ t c f t δ t the overall rejection performance of the process after a filtration time t is estimated by 15 r c u m t 1 c p c u m t δ t c f 0 all these performances are collected at the end of the numerical step and the feed properties c f t δt and v f t δt obtained at this step are used as input values c f t and v f t for the next time iteration all the procedure is iterated until the filtration duration t f is achieved cf fig 3 it should be stressed that the contribution of the concentration polarization phenomenon is not considered in this model since the purpose of this dynamic model is to propose a simple tool to predict evolution of performances during filtration the resolution of a dynamic version of the 2 d pore and polarization transport model pptm which was previously developed déon et al 2011a would have been too unwieldy and especially when the aim is a potential application for industrial purposes 4 results discussion before investigating the simulation with the dynamic model parameters of the transport model are required and their estimation from full batch filtration is described in the following section before investigating concentration and diafiltration modes 4 1 determination of model parameters the classical transport model described above requires the assessment of 4 input parameters characterizing the structural and physicochemical properties of the couple membrane solution the membrane hydraulic permeability l p the mean pore radius r p the dielectric constant within membrane pores ε p the membrane volume charge density x d the hydraulic permeability and mean pore radius were estimated by adjusting their values in eqs 5 and 16 to fit the evolutions of pure water flux and glucose rejection respectively cavaco morão et al 2008 16 r g l u 1 φ i k i c 1 1 φ i k i c exp k i c δ p 8 k i d d i η r p 2 the experimental and simulated curves with the adjusted r p value are provided as supplementary material fig s1 for illustration this membrane afc 40 was already investigated in previous studies with solutions containing various salt contents the estimated hydraulic permeability and mean pore radius obtained in this study are given in table 1 and their values agree with those reported in other studies otero et al 2008 déon et al 2012 for the sake of simplicity the values of the dielectric constant of the confined solution ε p for each salt were collected from previous papers in the adequate conditions the ε p values for nacl and mgcl2 were taken from fig 6 in déon et al 2012 by extrapolating to pure salt solutions the linear trend with mg2 proportion obtained from nacl mgcl2 mixtures with the afc 40 same membrane than that used in this study the ε p value for na2so4 was obtained similarly from values estimated for various proportions of so4 2 in mixtures of nacl na2so4 déon et al 2009 finally the membrane charge density was numerically adjusted on salt rejection curves to ensure that the rejection at constant feed concentration is correctly described by the transport model the experimental salt rejections and the simulated curves obtained by adjusting the membrane charge density summarized in table 1 are provided in fig 4 the values of the various input parameters corresponding to the various salt solutions are summarized in table 1 4 2 filtration in concentration mode 4 2 1 evolution of the one time performances during filtration in concentration mode it is obvious that performances evolve over time since the feed volume decreases due to permeation fig 5 a depicts the evolution of salt rejection and permeate flux over time for a solution of nacl 10 mol m 3 by considering the membrane charge estimated for the initial feed concentration all along the filtration experiment trends should not be discussed further since experimental curves are not correctly predicted by the model indeed fig 5 shows that rejection is supposed to decrease more sharply that it was observed experimentally consequently the decline of the permeate flux is underestimated by the model and it would be expected that the experimental value decreases more softly than it is measured this discrepancy may be imputed to the fact that membrane charge density was considered constant during filtration whereas feed concentration progressively increases over filtration time indeed it is well known that membrane charge is linked to concentration so that it is more rigorous to consider that the negative membrane charge progressively increases during filtration due to adsorption hence the membrane charge density x d estimated by fitting the experimental curves cf fig 4 and table 1 in 4 1 was linked to salt concentration by means of adsorption isotherms provided in fig 6 so that the evolution of membrane charge with feed concentration can be taken into account in the model fig 6 shows that evolution of x d value with salt concentration can be described by freundlich isotherms the value of the membrane charge density can thus be calculated over time knowing the evolution of feed concentration then simulations are run by considering adsorption isotherms and the corresponding curves for the three investigated salts are provided in fig 7 and compared with experimental data the agreement between experimental and predicted curves provided in fig 7 compared with disagreement highlighted in fig 5 demonstrates the need to consider a charge variation during filtration moreover the use of adsorption isotherms that are previously assessed from the filtration of salt solutions in full recycling mode appears fully efficient for predictive purposes this means that changes in adsorption equilibrium due to the slight variation of concentration over time are sufficiently rapid so that the membrane charge remains linked to feed concentration all along the filtration process fig 7 also show that the salt rejection evolves differently according to the type of salt indeed when the concentration of the feed solution increases the increase of ionic strength leads to a reduction of the electrical double layer edl thickness hence the ratio of debye length to membrane pore radius is lowered which leads to lower electric interactions at the pore entry shang et al 2014 this decrease of electrostatic interactions induced by the concentration increase has a different impact with mgcl2 due to the higher valence of magnesium ion compared to sodium ion the progressive increase of feed concentration therefore tends to decrease mg2 electrostatic attraction leading to a gradual increase in salt rejection which can be observed from both experimental and simulated curves conversely the permeate flux always decreases when feed concentration increases irrespective of the filtered solution it is worthwhile to understand that the permeate flux evolution is mainly governed by the evolution of the osmotic pressure difference δπ osmotic pressure is linked to concentration by the van t hoff relation and δπ is thus governed by the concentration difference between feed and permeate streams c f c p therefore osmotic pressure difference increases when feed concentration increases at constant rejection whereas it decreases when rejection decreases at constant feed concentration consequently the decrease observed with nacl tends to show that the impact of the concentration increase outweighs the impact of rejection decrease this conclusion seems relevant in the light of the ranges of variation observed for these two parameters in the case of mgcl2 the increase of both feed concentration and rejection necessarily leads to a decline of permeate flux it should be noted that the experimental permeate flux decreases more sharply at the end of the filtration time than predicted by the model cf fig 7a and b this discrepancy could perhaps be explained by a reasonable increase of the solution viscosity around 3 4 due to the high salt amount which is not considered in the model nevertheless it is probable that such a deviation leads to a weak discordance on the overall performances feed and permeate properties which will be investigated in the following sections 4 2 2 evolution of the vrf and feed properties during filtration as mentioned above the feed volume decreases over filtration time in concentration mode due to permeate stream retrieval fig 8 shows the evolution of the vrf during filtration for the various salt solutions investigated and the trends are compared with those measured during filtration experiments from fig 8 it can be seen that vrf does not increase linearly although the feed volume decreases almost linearly cf fig 9 indeed the profile firstly increases slightly during the 6 first hours followed by an abrupt growth within the last three hours this evolution is comparable to that of the feed concentration fig 9 which means that vrf is more an indicator of a concentration increase than an indicator of a volume reduction strictly speaking the evolution of vrf over time is similar irrespective of the solution considered since it is only governed by the permeation which is almost the same for all the solutions filtered however it can be noticed that the vrf value increases more sharply in the last hours with nacl than mgcl2 and even more than na2so4 due to the lower permeation flux observed with multivalent ions comparison between experimental and predicted values of vrf confirms that the model correctly predicts the reduction of feed volume this trend is corroborated by fig 9 that depict the theoretical and experimental evolutions of feed volume and concentration throughout the filtration of various salt solutions fig 9 show that feed volume decreases linearly in all the time that filtration lasts oppositely the feed concentration increases sharply when only few liters remain in the feed tank this abrupt rise of concentration cannot be checked experimentally since the corresponding feed volume is too small for a correct functioning however the evolution of feed concentration is accurately predicted by the model over the investigated time interval contrary to vrf concentration increase is more abrupt for na2so4 than mgcl2 due to the combined effect of both permeation and rejection indeed the very high rejection of na2so4 leads to a faster concentration increase in the feed tank even though volume is reduced more slowly than with mgcl2 4 2 3 evolution of the overall performances for an industrial application in concentration mode the key is the properties of the cumulated permeate stream for this reason the evolutions of the volume and salt concentration of the permeate recovered solution over filtration time are shown in fig 10 fig 10 clearly show that both volume and concentration of the permeate stream increase over time and the experimental values are correctly predicted by the dynamic model this means that the overall rejection considering initial feed concentration decreases which can be seen in fig 11 the slight discrepancy observable during filtration of mgcl2 solution can probably be attributed to a higher sensitivity of rejection and permeate concentration to membrane charge with this salt i e lower x d variation with concentration or to a contribution of the concentration polarization phenomenon which is not considered here therefore if the purpose of this filtration step is the salt or ionic contaminant removal it is obvious that the permeate concentration should be as low as possible and rejection high and so filtration time should be minimized and especially it should not exceed 5 h agreement between predictions and experiences emphasizes that the proposed dynamic model is a perfect tool to define the best conditions and especially the more adequate filtration time to achieve set overall removal performances since permeate volume increases linearly with time the duration of filtration has therefore no influence on volume performance evolution however the model can predict the volume of polluted solution that can be treated in a given filtration time 4 3 diafiltration mode diafiltration mode is used when the purpose of the filtration step is to remove a weakly retained compound from the feed solution for instance it can be usually used to remove salt from an effluent and recover a high added value product which is almost fully retained by the membrane for this purpose pure water is progressively added to the feed tank to keep feed volume constant in this case the concentration of the fully rejected compound remains constant whereas that of the partially rejected compound evolves over filtration time the latter being progressively removed from feed solution in this study only the partially retained salt is studied to ease experiments and discussion since concentration of fully rejected species remains constant over time the reliability of the proposed modeling is therefore investigated by using diafiltration mode to progressively remove concentrated solution of nacl which is weakly rejected by the nf membrane the evolutions of nacl rejection and permeate flux during diafiltration of a solution initially containing 100 mol m 3 of nacl are provided in fig 12 fig 12 shows that the slight increase of the nacl rejection over diafiltration time is perfectly predicted by the dynamic model even if permeate flux is somewhat underestimated for the first hours of filtration this discrepancy can probably be attributed to the high concentration of nacl used in this experiment which could explain why discrepancy decreases over time when feed concentration progressively decreases this discrepancy could perhaps be imputed to concentration polarization although it was previously shown that this phenomenon has a little impact on permeate flux déon et al 2007 it is also possible that osmotic pressure difference is more roughly described by the van t hoff relation with such a high concentration however it should be noted that this deviation is lower than 8 and its impact on overall performances is very weak as it is proved in the further course of the discussion figs 13 and 14 the evolution of feed concentration and permeate volume and concentration over time are depicted in fig 13 as expected with such a filtration mode both feed and permeate concentrations notably decrease over time due to the low rejection of nacl moreover it is also highlighted that these decreases are perfectly predicted by the model additionally fig 13b also confirms that the discrepancy between predicted and experimental permeate flux during the first hours has no profound influence on the prediction of overall performances and the deviation progressively declines from 8 to 5 finally comparison between predicted and experimental overall nacl rejection considering initial feed concentration which can be done from fig 14 corroborates the reliability of the dynamic model proposed in this study it is worth mentioning that the aim of diafiltration being to remove salt from feed solution the rejection increase observed during filtration tends to diminish the performance of the process 5 conclusion in this paper it was highlighted that classical models fail to predict the performances of nanofiltration in real conditions of water treatment due to the variation of feed concentration throughout the filtration to overcome this issue a dynamic model that takes the variation of volume and concentration as well as membrane charge density over time into account is proposed this model based on a classical transport model coupled with mass balances succeeds in predicting the one time and overall performances of a nanofiltration process during the filtration of various salt solutions either in concentration or diafiltration modes it was especially shown that evolution of concentrations and volumes are different depending on the salt considered and the mode of filtration nonetheless the predicted performances are accurate and the model appears suitable irrespective of the experimental conditions and especially the valence of ions its successful use only needs few experiments to assess the input parameters required for fully predictive purposes to conclude such a tool turns out to be a perfect solution to predict all the filtration performances required to develop new membrane processes or determine the optimal conditions for given application nevertheless its potential use towards the resolution of real issues involves the investigation of more complex ionic mixtures especially the influence of competitive adsorption between the various ions in solution on the membrane charge should be elucidated before being applied to the treatment of complex mixtures acknowledgements the authors would like to thank the region of bourgogne franche comté grant number 2016y 04563
