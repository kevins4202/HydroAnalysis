10590,irrigation water accounting iwa plays a key role in irrigation management in arid or semi arid environments currently water managers perform iwa through indirect or direct measurements such as statistical methods or flow meters however they have a high maintenance cost and great efforts must be done when large irrigated areas must be covered the presented framework based on the dual crop coefficient fao56 methodology introduces an operative application of a remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb to obtain a remote sensing based irrigation water accounting rs iwa a basic input of the model is the time series of basal crop coefficient and fractional vegetation cover it has been implemented in a large water user association 100 000 ha along three years 2010 2012 the results are analysed from the perspective of two water management scales the plot and the water user association at plot scale the rs iwa of maize and wheat as primary crops irrigated on demand show a root square mean error rmse of about 12 compared with the records from local farmers at water user association management scale the results from rs iwa show an rmse of about 15 for a comprehensive range of irrigated crops group such as spring crops summer crops double harvest alfalfa and vineyards hence rs iwa based on rs swb offers reproducible and reliable mapped estimations that can be used for different water managers as they are being required from actual agro environmental laws that are pushing these actors to better knowledge in time and space of those water resources applied keywords fao56 applications remote sensing remote sensing based irrigation water accounting 1 introduction latest figures on global water resources from the fao s global water information system fao 2016 accounts for 260 mha of the total irrigated area that implies around 70 2700 km3 of global withdrawal water with an important range of variations depending on the continent country or region ranging from 25 in europe to 85 in asia or africa irrigated agriculture is the main water consumer in southern europe where it uses up to 80 of water resources eea 2009 besides the continuous increase in irrigated surface areas parallel to the world population will impact on more pressure on water withdrawals fao 2011 in such a context world leaders are facing up the forthcoming situation by promoting legal instruments that provide precise control frameworks on water allocation and use nowadays the third implementation review of the water framework directive wfd on european union emphasizes water accounting as a key instrument for sustainable water use european commission 2012 furthermore public or private water authorities are responsible for the application of those regulations so far water authorities are commonly using indirect or direct measurements such as statistical methods or flow meters respectively to account and allocate water resources when they elaborate the river basin management plans however the same authorities recognize limitations in actual irrigation water accounting approaches as an example some spanish river basin water managers have been expressing their concern about abstraction monitoring networks that are only based on flow meters they generally emphasize the complexity of installation and maintenance due to lack of awareness on the users side and quite specifically describe evidence of incorrect hydraulic settings high cost deterioration and incorrect management bayó dalmau and loaso vierbücher 1999 díaz mora 1999 which all lead to deviations between authorized and actual abstractions the same evidence is listed by fao water report nº 28 cornish et al 2004 a complete report that brings actual knowledge on existing approaches to account for the resource and then price water regarding their advantages or disadvantages in that sense a comprehensive study conducted by the spanish national centre of irrigation technology shows that each flow meter requires a specific installation to provide reliable results and it also concludes that the functioning of any flow meter deteriorates with time due to residues in the water on the other hand statistical approaches bring the opportunity to account for water demand over large territories using tabulated thresholds of annual crop water demand assigned to estimated irrigated surface areas however and regarding water manager s knowledge there is a lack of distributed spatio temporal information at field plot scale that ranges from irrigation schemes to river basin districts nevertheless the fao56 approach has been largely applied for crop water requirements estimation at field plot spatial scale allen et al 1998 to that end no matter which crop coefficient approach the user is applying single or dual fao56 offers both equations or tabulates values for crop coefficient kc basal crop coefficient kcb and even the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc at different crop stages initial development middle season and late season however the same authors strongly recommend implementing local adaptations consequently in many countries scientific community or irrigation advisory services adapted the original tabulate values at their local crop varieties under particular climatic conditions and even added new kc or kcb values for crops that were not originally covered pereira et al 2015 however when big and diverse irrigated surface areas are fully monitored huge and continuous efforts to achieve correct local adaptations must be taken into consideration different crop species cultivated their sowing dates or even their crop architectural developments across time among many other parameters are necessarily achieved to obtain the whole and complete geodatabase that allows applying tabulated values over such areas notwithstanding the use of remote sensing rs data has become a powerful link to apply the fao56 approach in the last decades showing that rs products offer the capacity to monitor crop growth over large areas tasumi and allen 2007 and providing time series of information that allows for near real time decision support moran et al 1997 regarding fao56 approach estimations of crop evapotranspiration etc can be achieved by using the optical or thermal spectrum data from satellite sensors or even a combination thereof gilabert et al 2010 glenn et al 2011 generally classified into surface energy balances seb and soil water balances swb both categories differ in the nature of the input data the physics of the processes analysed and the models ability to reproduce the different processes the seb approach is based on the capability to obtain the surface latent heat flux even under water stress conditions by using as primary input the surface temperature supplied by the rs methodologies allen et al 2007 in parallel the swb approach takes advantage of the demonstrated capability of spectral vegetation indices jackson and huete 1991 to provide a precise estimation of the canopy potential transpiration gonzalez dugo et al 2009 then it balances the other water budget components to achieve the net irrigation requirements nir to maintain the crop under the desired water conditions methodologies to obtain crop coefficients from vegetation indices has been demonstrated and validated for a wide range of herbaceous crops bausch and neale 1987 choudhury et al 1994 d urso and calera belmonte 2006 duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 gonzález piqueras 2006 hunsaker et al 2003 jayanthi et al 2007 and several important perennials campos et al 2010b odi lara et al 2016 samani et al 2009 in consequence rs operative applications are being offered to different water managers as it introduces the advantage of monitoring large areas at plot spatial scale different studies have been published showing the operational use of the methodology e g the monitoring of crops reporting maps to users accounting water withdrawal at different spatial scales that are based on thermal data anderson et al 2011 karimi et al 2013 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 or in optical spectrum cherif et al 2012 gonzález dugo et al 2013 hornbuckle et al 2009 le page et al 2009 melton et al 2012 pereira et al 2003 vuolo et al 2015 therefore rs techniques are sufficiently mature to be used as required and requested by the water managers calera et al 2017 gowda et al 2008 and even through global free platforms that allow public access to satellite data products and algorithms gorelick et al 2017 the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and validate an operational approach to obtain remote sensing based irrigation water accounting rs iwa across large and diverse irrigation surface areas after computing a remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb to that goal the methodology applied is the well known fao56 model allen et al 1998 but assisted by vegetation indices vi derived from remote sensing time series to monitor crop development in a pixel based scale pôças et al 2020 this special issue the combination across time of such vegetation information daily agrometeorological variables and soil properties plus the water available for crops at their root depth by means of a soil water balance allows computing daily estimations of crop transpiration and soil evaporation these parameters configure the adjusted crop evapotranspiration etc adj which is the most detailed and main component that extracts water at roots soil depth therefore to maintain crops under commercially beneficial conditions over irrigated surface areas irrigation practices are necessary to replenish the soil water depletion after all the estimated nir computed at pixel based scale by means of rs swb is the key parameter that allows computing the rs iwa after spatial and temporal aggregation to the adequate scale the software that allows spatial and temporal distribution of the rs swb following fao56 approach with the goal to obtain a rs iwa is called hidromore lately this model has been demonstrated over irrigation surface areas at larger and different spatial and water resource scales like the aquifer garrido rubio et al 2019 and in the spanish mainland river basins garrido rubio et al 2018 however in the following paper we afford the opportunity to demonstrate its reliability regarding a ground truth data set infrequently found in the literature irrigation volumes at two water and agricultural management scales the plot and the water user association wua hence this paper focused on the operational application of the rs swb based on fao56 methodology to fully monitor large and diverse irrigation surface areas 2 methodology this section describes the methodology for obtaining and validating indirect measurements of remote sensing based irrigation water accounting rs iwa over big and diverse irrigation surface areas by means of an operative tool called hidromore that performs a remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb applying the dual crop coefficient fao56 approach fig 1 the details of methodological steps and data sources are given in the sections below the starting point is a time series of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1973 derived from satellite images which serves for two purposes on the one hand a map of irrigated crops is produced by supervised multi temporal classification on the other hand the biophysical components such as the basal crop coefficient kcb and the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc are obtained applying linear relationships from ndvi in parallel local data meteorology soil hydrology and crop characteristics are gathered from direct observations and geodatabases the workflows continue by feeding the hidromore model with the geodatabases and the ndvi time series to obtain temporal and spatially distributed pixel based maps of nir at daily and pixel based scale managed at different spatial water management scales plot and water user association the rs iwa is then validated through the irrigation volumes obtained from in situ data gathered at those same scales for this study case the validation has been carried out along three consecutive irrigation campaigns 2010 2012 covering dry and humid years consisting of a comprehensive comparison of the nir computed through the rs swb model and ground truth data provided at plot and water user association scale for seasonal herbaceous wheat maize and barley and permanent crops mainly vineyards 2 1 study area and climatic context the test site is located at the mancha oriental central irrigation water board jcrmo junta central de regantes de la mancha oriental located in the júcar river basin southeast of spain fig 2 the jcrmo is a large irrigation water users association wua mainly dependent on groundwater resources and involved in the use of remote sensing techniques for water management around 92 of the water resources used are withdrawal from the groundwater mancha oriental system sanz et al 2009 the wua is the authority in charge of the 900 water management units plots farms or groups of farms served by the same resource e g pumping station or pond covering a total of 100 000 ha of irrigated land it has become known for its singular model of collective self regulating water management having sustained stable aquifer levels for the past 20 years esteban and albiac 2012 on the finest management scale there are individual farm holdings members of the wua the most common irrigation systems in cereals are sprinkler 41 and centre pivot 39 with drip irrigation 15 being mostly used in perennials the average plot size is 5 ha the study area is characterized by the mediterranean and semi arid climate unep 1997 with an aridity index of 0 26 between 2000 and 2013 the mean annual rainfall for the reference period of 1981 2010 is 353 mm regarding the spanish meteorological agency aemet precipitation p is highly variable with seasonal peaks in spring and fall daily climatic conditions and seasonal variations of eto and p have a significant impact on crop water requirements the bottom panel on fig 2 shows similar behaviour of eto in the three years of study but different p patterns and cumulative values table 1 regarding the spanish meteorological agency aemet table 1 indicates the year 2010 as very humid 2011 as dry and 2012 as humid compared to the period 1981 2010 this would a priori mean that crop water requirements would be highest in 2011 however only the seasonal and monthly data can show the true situation the most crucial influencing factor is mean spring rain followed by mean summer precipitation the high value of mean summer precipitation in 2012 is misleading since most of the rain 63 out of 65 mm was falling in september i e beyond the main irrigation season period 2 2 field data for irrigation water accounting at two water management scales on one hand the wua provided the following data irrigated surface areas and annual net irrigation requirements for both spring and summer crops double harvest group crops alfalfa and vine crop types data on irrigated surface areas are taken from the annual cultivation plan that each water management unit must submit at the beginning of each irrigation season in parallel annual net irrigation requirements have been calculated by wua based on average values of the past five years provided to the wua by the local irrigation advisory service on the other hand data for the plot scale analysis provided by the individual farm holdings include records of irrigated surface areas per crop and the annual irrigation water applied as measured by flow meters regarding annual applied irrigation water a total of 49 records has been provided while regarding irrigated surface areas a total of 47 records besides among these farm holdings a smaller but quite similar group of farm holdings also provided their irrigation calendar with a total of 41 records table 2 shows these data disaggregated by year crop and type of data 2 3 methodology to obtain remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb the well known fao56 root zone depletion model allen et al 1998 eq 85 was used for that reason the following methodological description avoids redundant explanations on such balance and focuses on how rs data is used to assist the model eq 1 describes the soil water balance at root depth on one hand water inputs into the balance do not confuse with input model parameters are precipitation p net irrigation depth i and capillary rise cr in our approach the latter is negligible in the study area due to the depth of its vadose zone torres 2010 on the other hand the water outputs from the balance do not confuse with output model products are crop evapotranspiration etc root zone deep percolation dp and surface runoff ro in the present study the model starts simulation on 1 january 2010 with a soil profile considered fully watered initial dr i 1 0 mm according to a normal to the humid previous year 2009 regarding the spanish meteorological agency then the soil water content is calculated at pixel based scale in a daily iteration as the root zone depletion dr at the end of the day i from 1 to 365 1 d r i d r i 1 p r o i i i c r i e t c i d p i in the case of etc the methodology follows the dual crop coefficient approach eq 2 wright 1982 recommended also for crops with partial ground cover like perennial crops or herbaceous at its first stages present in the study zone or under frequent irrigation like onion or garlic quite present in the study zone as well allen et al 2005 1998 such approach splits the crop coefficient kc into the soil evaporation coefficient ke which describes soil evaporation e and the basal crop coefficient kcb which describes potential crop transpiration t the model also includes the water stress coefficient ks which accounts for crop transpiration decreasing with water availability hence the approach estimates crop adjusted evapotranspiration etc adj 2 e t c a d j e t o k c b k s k e e t in that equation the development of crops determines t and e components while kcb allows estimating t the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc allows estimating the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to solar radiation and is wetted few after a precipitation or irrigation event and hence e through the ke despite the use of tabulated values proposed in the literature the soil water balance uses remote sensing data particularly vi so it turns into a rs swb vi are one of the basic rs products huete 1988 jackson and huete 1991 the most commonly used vi is ndvi which is also used here for vegetation monitoring ndvi is the key to obtaining linear relations that allows for kcb and fc estimations pôças et al 2020 this special issue since these parameters derived by rs data show the actual vegetation cover conditions they should be referred to as kcb act and fc act to differentiate them from fao56 nomenclature kcb and fc which refers to standard vegetation pereira et al 2015 eqs 3 and 4 provide the linear relations used here and obtained in the study area for ndvi kcb act campos et al 2010a and ndvi fc act gonzález piqueras 2006 respectively 3 k c b a c t 1 44 n d v i 0 1 4 f c a c t 1 19 n d v i 0 16 both equations were conceived after field experiments and ground truth data and showed strong relationships the first one eq 3 originally developed for irrigated vineyard crops does not differ from other ndvi kcb act linear relationship specifically developed for herbaceous crops like maize bausch and neale 1987 gonzalez piqueras et al 2004 or sorghum lópez urrea et al 2016 besides that relationship has been positively evaluated for other authors under different climatic areas like the case of wine grapes in australia hornbuckle et al 2014 or it has been compared in a case of apple trees in the south of chile where authors did not find strong differences in the kcb act behaviour when the linear relationship is based in a different vi like the savi odi lara et al 2016 finally it has been validated for other uses different than irrigated crops like savahan dehesa campos et al 2013 on the other hand the second relationship eq 4 was originally developed for herbaceous crops like maize and wheat and has been positively evaluated against other linear relationships developed for vineyards campos et al 2014 furthermore this relationship has been implemented into hidromore to run the rs swb to quantify the soil water content below fields of rain fed cereals summer irrigated crops and vineyards in comparison with ground truth data from the remedhus network of 23 stations located in the central semi arid zone of the spanish duero river basin sánchez et al 2010 finally we highlight the use of this ndvi fc act relationship among others to obtain through remote sensing data a full vegetation development monitoring including the critical green up stage for maize wheat and barley gonzález gómez et al 2018 in parallel today s discussion on the use or non use of non dependent vi linear relationships to estimate biophysical parameters has several authors that agree on its use when operational applications are run calera et al 2017 good examples of this include the application of the top sims in california melton et al 2012 and use in australia for citrus crops and vineyards hornbuckle et al 2009 besides the use of vi linear relationships to include in the rs swb the model also follows a modification on how daily e is calculated in fao56 approach in that sense the calculation of ke uses a modified eq 5 to apply a correction coefficient m to the reduction coefficient kr which has been shown necessary in areas with high atmospheric demand torres and calera 2010 kr is obtained from eq 6 as the minimum of ratios involving the parameters readily evaporable water rew eto total evaporable water tew soil surface layer depletion de and the correction coefficient m 5 k e k r k c m a x k c b 1 f c k c m a x 6 k r min r e w e t o m t e w d e i t e w r e w through the estimation of daily etc adj eq 1 can be inverted to eq 7 to estimate the temporal and spatially distributed pixel based net irrigation requirements nir defined as that needed to maintain the crop at potential transpiration rates except for perennials therefore in the case of herbaceous crops the model maintains dr values above readily available water raw i e keeping ks around 1 value by means of irrigation events as soon as the stress is shown up the assumption of no water stress conditions in herbaceous crops is reasonable based on i the 2012 spanish national annual statistics report accounts that average production for the irrigated crops in albacete province majority location of the study area were higher to the national average in case of wheat barley and maize magrama 2012 and ii local irrigation practices and collective collaboration on sustainable groundwater management has been recognized as a successful case esteban and albiac 2012 in opposite when the model deals with vineyards perennials an irrigation event is triggered when the ks is reached 7 n i r i d r i 1 d r i p r o i e t c a d j i d p i in accordance with the water use concept of perry perry 2011 the available individual plot data collected from flow meters cover both the consumed and non consumed fraction of the water applied in parallel the model calculated nir refer to the net irrigation depth placed at soil roots depth and hence does not account for non beneficial consumed fraction or non consumed fraction consequently to achieve a consistent comparison between flow meters records and nir at least the differences between gross and net irrigation volumes must be addressed for this purpose the model calculated nir have been increased by 15 or 20 depending on the irrigation system in place average system efficiencies obtained by the local irrigation advisory service for sprinkler and centre pivot respectively 2 4 the model hidromore a tool for rs swb over large areas the methodology to estimate rs swb described above has been implemented in the latest version of hidromore software moreno et al 2017 which integrates rs derived products and meteorological edaphological and crop data in the dual crop coefficient model of fao56 its innovative features are on the one hand the assimilation of multispectral rs data by means of the ndvi kcb act and ndvi fc act relations on the other hand the spatial distribution of the fao56 model by means of a distributed hydrological model torres 2010 the model runs at a daily time step and pixel based scale the spatial coverage and resolution are defined by the footprint of the satellite images over the terrain and their pixel size respectively the hidromore software and its different outputs have been validated at different scenarios one commented before section 2 3 which used in situ soil moisture data from the remehdus network for the application and validation of the rs swb sánchez et al 2010 sánchez et al 2012 moreover groundwater withdrawals for irrigation purposes recorded by the spanish official piezometers network were compared against nir at the aquifer scale garrido rubio et al 2019 besides in the same way to provide validations against the nir annual model estimations at river basin scale along 4 consecutive years 2014 2017 were compared against irrigation needs at 12 river basin management plans 2nd cycle over the spanish mainland scale garrido rubio et al 2018 nowadays previous data at monthly and annual scale is being collected by the spanish ministry for the ecological transition for further validations against in situ data with the purpose to include those results for management and planning of water resources ortega et al 2019 furthermore 3 doctoral theses used the model for different purposes i the use of remote sensing data to assist the soil water balance model and achieve a distributed spatio temporal data of percolation and nir at the aquifer scale torres 2010 ii the validation of soil moisture output data from the rs swb model against in situ data sánchez 2009 sánchez et al 2010 and iii the spatio temporal validation of ndvi kcb act linear relationship at the aquifer scale for vineyards campos 2012 furthermore two eu funded projects used hidromore for operative applications providing distributed spatio temporal thematic cartography etc nir at monthly time scale i to generate services on water management to water users at different levels sirius eu project ga nº 262902 http sirius gmes es and ii to detect non authorized irrigation water abstractions in comparison with the local water authorities data diana eu project ga nº 703109 https diana h2020 eu en besides hidromore tool has been playing an important role in the coquimbo region south chile reporting among other parameters nir spatio temporal maps for irrigation management and information services to different water authorities and end users http www inia cl proyecto 502145 capra project in practical terms the input data for hidromore is a set of geospatial data like a time series of ndvi images b maps of edaphological data for the calculation of soil hydrological parameters c annual maps of irrigated areas per crop type and d daily agrometeorological data from the national network of agrometeorological stations in irrigated areas the advisory service to the irrigator network siar table 3 gives the list of input parameters and the corresponding data sources running hidromore at each pixel with a daily time step requires interpolation of some input data the daily rs derived biophysical parameters are calculated interpolating between the time series of ndvi images while the pixel values of climatic parameters were obtained from spatial interpolation inverse distance squared of point observations the daily outputs of hidromore are the spatially and temporally distributed terms of the soil water balance etc adj nir p dp dr ro and maps of further parameters of interest eto kcb act ks kc in the first step the output data have been temporally aggregated to monthly and annual accumulated values then the spatial aggregation has been performed by extracting the vector layers statistics over the raster maps at the spatial scales of the plots and the wua 2 5 rs satellite data a total of 76 images has been processed to obtain ndvi maps bottom panel of fig 2 the images have been selected to monitor crop growth during the irrigation campaign the time series consists of images from a constellation of sensors thematic mapper tm on board of the landsat 5 satellite 13 images in 2010 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm on board landsat 7 7 images in 2012 in either case using pathrows 199 033 and 200 033 and images from deimos 1 satellite 20 24 12 images in 2010 2011 2012 respectively all landsat images have been radiometrically corrected chander et al 2009 while deimos 1 images are delivered with completed correction an absolute normalization procedure has been applied to each image to achieve atmospheric correction and inter sensor cross calibration this method uses at least two invariant surfaces chen et al 2005 to determine the regression line for ndvi values any pixels contaminated with clouds have been eliminated given the different spatial resolution of the different satellite sensors 30 m for landsat 5 and 7 20 m for deimos 1 pixels have been re scaled through the nearest neighbour approach to 25 m for 2010 data and to 20 m for 2011 and 2012 the spatial accuracy of the ndvi time series when using different satellites in a virtual constellation is obtained by using a minimum 3 3 pixel spatial aggregation martínez beltrán et al 2009 therefore this resolution obtained allowed for monitoring plots larger than 0 5 ha enough for the study area where the average plot size is 5 ha 2 6 irrigated surfaces areas classification by remote sensing crop mapping of irrigated areas has been carried out using multi temporal supervised classification of rs images the classification maps belong as a core part of the ermot project the more than 20 years old project that monitors irrigated surface areas across the study area through remote sensing techniques hence the knowledge of the territory and its crop types cultivated allow recognising and using different temporal dynamics of vegetation development as expressed in a time series of ndvi maps these profiles exhibit the characteristic vegetation periods which are used to classify the crops in consequence threshold criteria are included in decision tree methodologies based on the different growing and phenological development rates which can be studied in the ndvi across the time series this classification by vegetative periods yields crop classes with similar irrigation requirements and cover structure calera et al 1999 for subsequent estimation of nir the main classes are defined as herbaceous spring crops summer crops double harvest and perennials vineyards classification accuracy was computed by an independent commission supplying overall accuracy values after computing the error matrix and consequently by dividing the total correct by the total number of pixels congalton 1991 to that goal maps of irrigated areas have been extensively validated through strategic field visits to 5 of the total area all plots selected for the study are larger than 0 5 ha thus maintaining an inner core unaffected by potential effects of pixels on the border periphery annual overall accuracy classification for spring crops is 85 96 and 98 in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively in the case of summer crops and with similar chronological order the accuracy values are 96 97 and 96 respectively while for the double harvest ones 83 74 and 63 finally in perennials crop group vineyards accuracy values range from 84 in 2010 and 2011 to 90 in 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of irrigated areas the crop inventory is based on a set of irrigated crop types with similar vegetative development as evidenced in their ndvi profiles fig 3 spring crops e g wheat barley summer crops with high ground cover e g maize summer crops with low ground cover e g onion double harvest e g annual rotation of wheat and maize alfalfa and vineyards the ndvi profiles for each crop class on fig 3 show slight differences between years this is due to the influence of meteorological conditions on local agricultural practices like sowing date or crop evolution tasumi and allen 2007 the alfalfa profiles play a special role here since the temporal frequency of the satellites used does not allow for determining the highly dynamic crop behaviour very rapid growth and cut every 28 days approximately however the profiles are still quite characteristic and allow their discrimination from the other covers 3 2 irrigated surface area and rs iwa at plot scale fig 4 and table 4 show the comparison of irrigated surface area left panel and annual rs iwa right panel by individual plots and per crop type the irrigated surface area results agree with the field values with a root mean square error rmse around 6 in 2010 and 2012 rising to 15 in 2011 detailed per plot analysis of the 2011 data reveals a special situation where 71 of all plots were used for mixed cultivation crop rotation and sub plots e g wheat garlic maize onion in the same plot in comparison with 2010 and 2012 years 25 and 35 respectively hence the irrigated surfaces areas classification for 2011 produced weakest results so it is reflected in the increase in rmse value for that year in contrast with rmse values for 2010 and 2012 years the comparison of rs iwa has been performed by crop type the right panel of fig 4 shows the annual mean values and standard deviations per year for wheat barley and maize rs assisted values for wheat and maize are slightly lower than those declared by farmers whereas those for barley are significantly higher fig 4 shows that the model is able to respond to different climatic conditions rs iwa values in 2012 are higher than those in 2010 and 2011 in agreement with the records of the farmers the dispersion in the iwa values right panel of fig 4 is consistently and significantly lower in the rs assisted results standard deviation ranges from 15 22 and 43 mm year for wheat in 2010 2011 and 2012 17 19 mm year for maize in 2011 and 2012 and 20 mm year in barley in 2012 than in those obtained from farmers standard deviation ranges from 65 26 and 104 mm year for wheat in 2010 2011 and 2012 58 73 mm year for maize in 2011 and 2012 and 72 mm year for barley in 2012 this apparent lack of sensitivity of the rs based approach is due to the resolution of the available soil map 1 1 100 000 which does not show much of the heterogeneities at a finer scale the available soil water content depends among other factors on the maximum root depth zrmax and the limiting soil depth zs the latter is extracted from the soil map it plays a key role in irrigation requirements but it is difficult to obtain torres 2010 the range of mean zs values in the study plots ranges on 0 3 0 6 m thus limiting zrmax consequently the model averages out the heterogeneities as it is using the best soil map description available however regarding the standard deviation analysis previously described it was expected that the modelled variability would not capture the full complexity of the soil profiles in the field plots at crop type level the best agreement of values is found in maize rsme around 7 followed by wheat 15 in contrast barley shows a remarkably high rmse 76 comparing the mean over all plots of the same crop yields rsmes in maize of 3 in wheat 6 and in barley 72 respectively the high rmse shown for barley are discussed further below mainly regarding agricultural practices and market prices at this area furthermore a detailed comparison of per crop mean values of cumulative nir along with the irrigation campaign fig 5 provides a first step towards explaining these differences the time axis in fig 5 has been normalized with the total duration of the irrigation campaigns the results for wheat and maize show a good agreement with a slight overestimation of the model at the end of the crop cycle in contrast farmer applied irrigation in barley is lower than the calculated requirements during most of the campaign the reasons for this are discussed in the following two additional external information sources have been used to explore the achieved results annual irrigation recommendations that do not account for non consumed water fraction provided by the local irrigation advisory services lias table 5 and literature values for the study area lias issues weekly irrigation recommendations based on the single crop coefficient allen et al 1998 from fieldwork the available literature sources either use directly the same etc data provided by lias martín de santa olalla et al 1999 peña haro et al 2010 or apply the same methodology to calculate etc ortega et al 2004 however none of the literature studies deals with the same period as this study so they can be considered only as a rough approximation and therefore not included in the following discussion in wheat the differences between lias recommendation and rs iwa are minor with a maximum deviation of 15 mm in the dry year 2012 the 3 year mean values differ by as little as 4 mm this indicates good agreement between the two approaches the comparison for maize with lias recommendations shows the largest differences in 2011 56 mm 9 and the smallest in 2012 18 mm 3 which is a generally good agreement of the rs approach the case of barley with only one year of available data does not allow for an in depth comparison although results indicate strong differences between estimations and in situ data resulting in higher estimated irrigation doses than farmer practices in agreement with such findings local research concluded that farmers usually irrigate barley below recommended rates as it is more resistant to drought than other spring crops martín de santa olalla et al 1999 which is in concordance with drought effects on barley regarding stage crop period particularly water stress during early crop development stages reduces grain number and filled grain number while at the terminal crop stage the grain number is reduced to a lesser degree rajala et al 2011 furthermore barley is the cereal over mediterranean areas with better water use conservative strategies acevedo 1987 this agrees with central plot data in fig 5 where irrigation application by farmers remains almost constant in the first half of the irrigation campaign but it is reduced at the final stages this would suggest that barley is water stressed and etc is overestimated at least during such final period and hence higher nir were calculated a further reason for reduced irrigation rates lies in the lower market value of barley as compared to wheat in the same area previous issues would explain why estimated nir are significantly higher than actual irrigation from field records and hence why the resultant calculated rmse are so high in summary the worst value differences between recommendations and rs iwa range from 15 mm wheat 5 to 56 mm maize 9 which means 1 3 irrigation events over the campaign period the rmse differences in the plot scale analysis are of similar magnitude it is important taking into account that in contrast to rs swb the fao56 based recommendations were based on statistical general tables per crop type not considering particular conditions of vegetation at plot level in contrast to rs derived biophysical variables the one year data for barley represent a special case as explained above considering only the data for wheat and maize with a full three and two year period of available data the analysis shows that rs swb is able to estimate properly the irrigation water management requirements rs iwa for a range of special climatic conditions with an overall 3 year rmse of 12 3 3 irrigated surface and rs iwa at water user association scale fig 6 and table 6 show the same comparison as in the previous section but now at wua scale like the plot scale comparison the mapping of irrigated areas shows results in better agreement than the net irrigation requirements the rmse for irrigated area mapping ranges from 10 for summer crops to 17 for vineyards the rs based multi temporal classification slightly underestimates the irrigated areas of spring and summer crops while identifying at acceptable accuracy the alfalfa double harvest and vineyard in this context it is important to know that spring crops cover the largest area fraction 52 followed by summer crops 24 vineyard 13 alfalfa 5 and double harvest 5 these fractions remain constant from year to year with only slight variations in the total irrigated area largest in 2011 with 102 000 ha and smallest in 2010 with 95 000 ha on the other hand the dynamic in soil water balance and irrigation requirements are pronounced due to the annual variations in climatic conditions the year 2010 with its abundant rainfall shows the lowest irrigation requirements while the dry year 2012 has the highest despite being even drier than 2012 the year 2011 exhibits similar irrigation requirements to 2010 due to the rainfall concentration in the critical spring months table 1 the analysis by crop classes reveals the best agreement of net irrigation requirements for summer crops rmse 5 closely followed by spring crops 9 the major disagreement found for alfalfa overestimation by 29 comes from the difficulty to determine the periodic multiple cuts reducing net irrigation requirements from the satellite images used double harvests also present difficulties albeit to a lesser degree vineyard is a special case since the wua defines a fixed irrigation requirement in its annual cultivation plan yet rs iwa provides quite similar values for the three years with annual values varying according to climatic variations further context for discussing these findings is again provided by two sources the lias table 5 and literature values for the study area spring and summer crops show good agreement with values 35 mm and 42 mm higher than lias recommendations in the year of largest deviations 2012 the overall mean value is 17 mm spring and 5 mm summer higher than lias values the comparison looks quite different for the double harvest class where rs iwa values are 221 mm above the lias recommendation the wide range of vegetative cycles involved in double harvest plots may play an important role here see fig 3 in summary rs iwa is in particularly good agreement with lias for spring and summer crops with slight differences in annual recommendations this again as in the case of plot scale analysis translates into 1 3 additional irrigation doses per year the largest differences are found for the year 2012 that is the driest of the studied period the total three year rmse is 15 considering that the alfalfa crop introduces the largest uncertainty due to the satellite overpass frequency does not show adequately the rapid growth and cut cycles in the case of non considering the alfalfa plots this uncertainty is reduced to 11 4 conclusions the use of remote sensing time series data allows irrigation land monitoring the combination of such data and ancillary data agrometeorological soil types and crop characteristics into a remote sensing based soil water balance provides temporal and spatially distribution pixel based maps of net irrigation requirements temporal and spatial aggregations into plot and water user association scale provide a remote sensing based irrigation water accounting rs iwa the remote sensing driven fao56 application presented in this article following the previous statements provides very useful information to water managers to monitoring and design of the river basin management plans in the frame of the water framework directive besides the framework presented is not private water manager dependent as it does not require data provided by them to run the model into the software hidromore used to obtain the results the presented methodology has been validated along with three successive irrigation campaigns 2010 2012 against different spatial and water management scales and implemented by end users the plot and the water user association the rs iwa results were compared with data provided by private water managers at different working scales show good agreement considering the different agrometeorological conditions of each year achieving a rmse about 12 and 15 for plot and water user association spatial scale respectively moreover local agronomic practices like the shortage of water for barley shows the effect of additional criteria that determine irrigation water application decisions such as stress resistance or economic considerations of market value on the other hand rs iwa operates well in crops managed through established deficit irrigation practices like vineyard these results confirm the reliability of the remote sensing based irrigation water accounting as a tool for transparent water management it responds to requirements expressed by basin scale water managers derived from their own experiences with flow meter only networks as such it can be integrated into large scale irrigation control networks providing independent indirect measurements over large areas and complementing a reference set of well calibrated and maintained flow meters finally the actual european satellite constellations including the more recently introduced sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b could further improve crop development monitoring at a much higher image frequency acquisition hence such capabilities should also contribute to significantly improved the results declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that

10590,irrigation water accounting iwa plays a key role in irrigation management in arid or semi arid environments currently water managers perform iwa through indirect or direct measurements such as statistical methods or flow meters however they have a high maintenance cost and great efforts must be done when large irrigated areas must be covered the presented framework based on the dual crop coefficient fao56 methodology introduces an operative application of a remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb to obtain a remote sensing based irrigation water accounting rs iwa a basic input of the model is the time series of basal crop coefficient and fractional vegetation cover it has been implemented in a large water user association 100 000 ha along three years 2010 2012 the results are analysed from the perspective of two water management scales the plot and the water user association at plot scale the rs iwa of maize and wheat as primary crops irrigated on demand show a root square mean error rmse of about 12 compared with the records from local farmers at water user association management scale the results from rs iwa show an rmse of about 15 for a comprehensive range of irrigated crops group such as spring crops summer crops double harvest alfalfa and vineyards hence rs iwa based on rs swb offers reproducible and reliable mapped estimations that can be used for different water managers as they are being required from actual agro environmental laws that are pushing these actors to better knowledge in time and space of those water resources applied keywords fao56 applications remote sensing remote sensing based irrigation water accounting 1 introduction latest figures on global water resources from the fao s global water information system fao 2016 accounts for 260 mha of the total irrigated area that implies around 70 2700 km3 of global withdrawal water with an important range of variations depending on the continent country or region ranging from 25 in europe to 85 in asia or africa irrigated agriculture is the main water consumer in southern europe where it uses up to 80 of water resources eea 2009 besides the continuous increase in irrigated surface areas parallel to the world population will impact on more pressure on water withdrawals fao 2011 in such a context world leaders are facing up the forthcoming situation by promoting legal instruments that provide precise control frameworks on water allocation and use nowadays the third implementation review of the water framework directive wfd on european union emphasizes water accounting as a key instrument for sustainable water use european commission 2012 furthermore public or private water authorities are responsible for the application of those regulations so far water authorities are commonly using indirect or direct measurements such as statistical methods or flow meters respectively to account and allocate water resources when they elaborate the river basin management plans however the same authorities recognize limitations in actual irrigation water accounting approaches as an example some spanish river basin water managers have been expressing their concern about abstraction monitoring networks that are only based on flow meters they generally emphasize the complexity of installation and maintenance due to lack of awareness on the users side and quite specifically describe evidence of incorrect hydraulic settings high cost deterioration and incorrect management bayó dalmau and loaso vierbücher 1999 díaz mora 1999 which all lead to deviations between authorized and actual abstractions the same evidence is listed by fao water report nº 28 cornish et al 2004 a complete report that brings actual knowledge on existing approaches to account for the resource and then price water regarding their advantages or disadvantages in that sense a comprehensive study conducted by the spanish national centre of irrigation technology shows that each flow meter requires a specific installation to provide reliable results and it also concludes that the functioning of any flow meter deteriorates with time due to residues in the water on the other hand statistical approaches bring the opportunity to account for water demand over large territories using tabulated thresholds of annual crop water demand assigned to estimated irrigated surface areas however and regarding water manager s knowledge there is a lack of distributed spatio temporal information at field plot scale that ranges from irrigation schemes to river basin districts nevertheless the fao56 approach has been largely applied for crop water requirements estimation at field plot spatial scale allen et al 1998 to that end no matter which crop coefficient approach the user is applying single or dual fao56 offers both equations or tabulates values for crop coefficient kc basal crop coefficient kcb and even the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc at different crop stages initial development middle season and late season however the same authors strongly recommend implementing local adaptations consequently in many countries scientific community or irrigation advisory services adapted the original tabulate values at their local crop varieties under particular climatic conditions and even added new kc or kcb values for crops that were not originally covered pereira et al 2015 however when big and diverse irrigated surface areas are fully monitored huge and continuous efforts to achieve correct local adaptations must be taken into consideration different crop species cultivated their sowing dates or even their crop architectural developments across time among many other parameters are necessarily achieved to obtain the whole and complete geodatabase that allows applying tabulated values over such areas notwithstanding the use of remote sensing rs data has become a powerful link to apply the fao56 approach in the last decades showing that rs products offer the capacity to monitor crop growth over large areas tasumi and allen 2007 and providing time series of information that allows for near real time decision support moran et al 1997 regarding fao56 approach estimations of crop evapotranspiration etc can be achieved by using the optical or thermal spectrum data from satellite sensors or even a combination thereof gilabert et al 2010 glenn et al 2011 generally classified into surface energy balances seb and soil water balances swb both categories differ in the nature of the input data the physics of the processes analysed and the models ability to reproduce the different processes the seb approach is based on the capability to obtain the surface latent heat flux even under water stress conditions by using as primary input the surface temperature supplied by the rs methodologies allen et al 2007 in parallel the swb approach takes advantage of the demonstrated capability of spectral vegetation indices jackson and huete 1991 to provide a precise estimation of the canopy potential transpiration gonzalez dugo et al 2009 then it balances the other water budget components to achieve the net irrigation requirements nir to maintain the crop under the desired water conditions methodologies to obtain crop coefficients from vegetation indices has been demonstrated and validated for a wide range of herbaceous crops bausch and neale 1987 choudhury et al 1994 d urso and calera belmonte 2006 duchemin et al 2006 er raki et al 2007 gonzález dugo and mateos 2008 gonzález piqueras 2006 hunsaker et al 2003 jayanthi et al 2007 and several important perennials campos et al 2010b odi lara et al 2016 samani et al 2009 in consequence rs operative applications are being offered to different water managers as it introduces the advantage of monitoring large areas at plot spatial scale different studies have been published showing the operational use of the methodology e g the monitoring of crops reporting maps to users accounting water withdrawal at different spatial scales that are based on thermal data anderson et al 2011 karimi et al 2013 ramírez cuesta et al 2017 or in optical spectrum cherif et al 2012 gonzález dugo et al 2013 hornbuckle et al 2009 le page et al 2009 melton et al 2012 pereira et al 2003 vuolo et al 2015 therefore rs techniques are sufficiently mature to be used as required and requested by the water managers calera et al 2017 gowda et al 2008 and even through global free platforms that allow public access to satellite data products and algorithms gorelick et al 2017 the purpose of this paper is to demonstrate and validate an operational approach to obtain remote sensing based irrigation water accounting rs iwa across large and diverse irrigation surface areas after computing a remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb to that goal the methodology applied is the well known fao56 model allen et al 1998 but assisted by vegetation indices vi derived from remote sensing time series to monitor crop development in a pixel based scale pôças et al 2020 this special issue the combination across time of such vegetation information daily agrometeorological variables and soil properties plus the water available for crops at their root depth by means of a soil water balance allows computing daily estimations of crop transpiration and soil evaporation these parameters configure the adjusted crop evapotranspiration etc adj which is the most detailed and main component that extracts water at roots soil depth therefore to maintain crops under commercially beneficial conditions over irrigated surface areas irrigation practices are necessary to replenish the soil water depletion after all the estimated nir computed at pixel based scale by means of rs swb is the key parameter that allows computing the rs iwa after spatial and temporal aggregation to the adequate scale the software that allows spatial and temporal distribution of the rs swb following fao56 approach with the goal to obtain a rs iwa is called hidromore lately this model has been demonstrated over irrigation surface areas at larger and different spatial and water resource scales like the aquifer garrido rubio et al 2019 and in the spanish mainland river basins garrido rubio et al 2018 however in the following paper we afford the opportunity to demonstrate its reliability regarding a ground truth data set infrequently found in the literature irrigation volumes at two water and agricultural management scales the plot and the water user association wua hence this paper focused on the operational application of the rs swb based on fao56 methodology to fully monitor large and diverse irrigation surface areas 2 methodology this section describes the methodology for obtaining and validating indirect measurements of remote sensing based irrigation water accounting rs iwa over big and diverse irrigation surface areas by means of an operative tool called hidromore that performs a remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb applying the dual crop coefficient fao56 approach fig 1 the details of methodological steps and data sources are given in the sections below the starting point is a time series of normalized difference vegetation index ndvi rouse et al 1973 derived from satellite images which serves for two purposes on the one hand a map of irrigated crops is produced by supervised multi temporal classification on the other hand the biophysical components such as the basal crop coefficient kcb and the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc are obtained applying linear relationships from ndvi in parallel local data meteorology soil hydrology and crop characteristics are gathered from direct observations and geodatabases the workflows continue by feeding the hidromore model with the geodatabases and the ndvi time series to obtain temporal and spatially distributed pixel based maps of nir at daily and pixel based scale managed at different spatial water management scales plot and water user association the rs iwa is then validated through the irrigation volumes obtained from in situ data gathered at those same scales for this study case the validation has been carried out along three consecutive irrigation campaigns 2010 2012 covering dry and humid years consisting of a comprehensive comparison of the nir computed through the rs swb model and ground truth data provided at plot and water user association scale for seasonal herbaceous wheat maize and barley and permanent crops mainly vineyards 2 1 study area and climatic context the test site is located at the mancha oriental central irrigation water board jcrmo junta central de regantes de la mancha oriental located in the júcar river basin southeast of spain fig 2 the jcrmo is a large irrigation water users association wua mainly dependent on groundwater resources and involved in the use of remote sensing techniques for water management around 92 of the water resources used are withdrawal from the groundwater mancha oriental system sanz et al 2009 the wua is the authority in charge of the 900 water management units plots farms or groups of farms served by the same resource e g pumping station or pond covering a total of 100 000 ha of irrigated land it has become known for its singular model of collective self regulating water management having sustained stable aquifer levels for the past 20 years esteban and albiac 2012 on the finest management scale there are individual farm holdings members of the wua the most common irrigation systems in cereals are sprinkler 41 and centre pivot 39 with drip irrigation 15 being mostly used in perennials the average plot size is 5 ha the study area is characterized by the mediterranean and semi arid climate unep 1997 with an aridity index of 0 26 between 2000 and 2013 the mean annual rainfall for the reference period of 1981 2010 is 353 mm regarding the spanish meteorological agency aemet precipitation p is highly variable with seasonal peaks in spring and fall daily climatic conditions and seasonal variations of eto and p have a significant impact on crop water requirements the bottom panel on fig 2 shows similar behaviour of eto in the three years of study but different p patterns and cumulative values table 1 regarding the spanish meteorological agency aemet table 1 indicates the year 2010 as very humid 2011 as dry and 2012 as humid compared to the period 1981 2010 this would a priori mean that crop water requirements would be highest in 2011 however only the seasonal and monthly data can show the true situation the most crucial influencing factor is mean spring rain followed by mean summer precipitation the high value of mean summer precipitation in 2012 is misleading since most of the rain 63 out of 65 mm was falling in september i e beyond the main irrigation season period 2 2 field data for irrigation water accounting at two water management scales on one hand the wua provided the following data irrigated surface areas and annual net irrigation requirements for both spring and summer crops double harvest group crops alfalfa and vine crop types data on irrigated surface areas are taken from the annual cultivation plan that each water management unit must submit at the beginning of each irrigation season in parallel annual net irrigation requirements have been calculated by wua based on average values of the past five years provided to the wua by the local irrigation advisory service on the other hand data for the plot scale analysis provided by the individual farm holdings include records of irrigated surface areas per crop and the annual irrigation water applied as measured by flow meters regarding annual applied irrigation water a total of 49 records has been provided while regarding irrigated surface areas a total of 47 records besides among these farm holdings a smaller but quite similar group of farm holdings also provided their irrigation calendar with a total of 41 records table 2 shows these data disaggregated by year crop and type of data 2 3 methodology to obtain remote sensing based soil water balance rs swb the well known fao56 root zone depletion model allen et al 1998 eq 85 was used for that reason the following methodological description avoids redundant explanations on such balance and focuses on how rs data is used to assist the model eq 1 describes the soil water balance at root depth on one hand water inputs into the balance do not confuse with input model parameters are precipitation p net irrigation depth i and capillary rise cr in our approach the latter is negligible in the study area due to the depth of its vadose zone torres 2010 on the other hand the water outputs from the balance do not confuse with output model products are crop evapotranspiration etc root zone deep percolation dp and surface runoff ro in the present study the model starts simulation on 1 january 2010 with a soil profile considered fully watered initial dr i 1 0 mm according to a normal to the humid previous year 2009 regarding the spanish meteorological agency then the soil water content is calculated at pixel based scale in a daily iteration as the root zone depletion dr at the end of the day i from 1 to 365 1 d r i d r i 1 p r o i i i c r i e t c i d p i in the case of etc the methodology follows the dual crop coefficient approach eq 2 wright 1982 recommended also for crops with partial ground cover like perennial crops or herbaceous at its first stages present in the study zone or under frequent irrigation like onion or garlic quite present in the study zone as well allen et al 2005 1998 such approach splits the crop coefficient kc into the soil evaporation coefficient ke which describes soil evaporation e and the basal crop coefficient kcb which describes potential crop transpiration t the model also includes the water stress coefficient ks which accounts for crop transpiration decreasing with water availability hence the approach estimates crop adjusted evapotranspiration etc adj 2 e t c a d j e t o k c b k s k e e t in that equation the development of crops determines t and e components while kcb allows estimating t the fraction of soil surface covered by vegetation fc allows estimating the fraction of the soil that is both exposed to solar radiation and is wetted few after a precipitation or irrigation event and hence e through the ke despite the use of tabulated values proposed in the literature the soil water balance uses remote sensing data particularly vi so it turns into a rs swb vi are one of the basic rs products huete 1988 jackson and huete 1991 the most commonly used vi is ndvi which is also used here for vegetation monitoring ndvi is the key to obtaining linear relations that allows for kcb and fc estimations pôças et al 2020 this special issue since these parameters derived by rs data show the actual vegetation cover conditions they should be referred to as kcb act and fc act to differentiate them from fao56 nomenclature kcb and fc which refers to standard vegetation pereira et al 2015 eqs 3 and 4 provide the linear relations used here and obtained in the study area for ndvi kcb act campos et al 2010a and ndvi fc act gonzález piqueras 2006 respectively 3 k c b a c t 1 44 n d v i 0 1 4 f c a c t 1 19 n d v i 0 16 both equations were conceived after field experiments and ground truth data and showed strong relationships the first one eq 3 originally developed for irrigated vineyard crops does not differ from other ndvi kcb act linear relationship specifically developed for herbaceous crops like maize bausch and neale 1987 gonzalez piqueras et al 2004 or sorghum lópez urrea et al 2016 besides that relationship has been positively evaluated for other authors under different climatic areas like the case of wine grapes in australia hornbuckle et al 2014 or it has been compared in a case of apple trees in the south of chile where authors did not find strong differences in the kcb act behaviour when the linear relationship is based in a different vi like the savi odi lara et al 2016 finally it has been validated for other uses different than irrigated crops like savahan dehesa campos et al 2013 on the other hand the second relationship eq 4 was originally developed for herbaceous crops like maize and wheat and has been positively evaluated against other linear relationships developed for vineyards campos et al 2014 furthermore this relationship has been implemented into hidromore to run the rs swb to quantify the soil water content below fields of rain fed cereals summer irrigated crops and vineyards in comparison with ground truth data from the remedhus network of 23 stations located in the central semi arid zone of the spanish duero river basin sánchez et al 2010 finally we highlight the use of this ndvi fc act relationship among others to obtain through remote sensing data a full vegetation development monitoring including the critical green up stage for maize wheat and barley gonzález gómez et al 2018 in parallel today s discussion on the use or non use of non dependent vi linear relationships to estimate biophysical parameters has several authors that agree on its use when operational applications are run calera et al 2017 good examples of this include the application of the top sims in california melton et al 2012 and use in australia for citrus crops and vineyards hornbuckle et al 2009 besides the use of vi linear relationships to include in the rs swb the model also follows a modification on how daily e is calculated in fao56 approach in that sense the calculation of ke uses a modified eq 5 to apply a correction coefficient m to the reduction coefficient kr which has been shown necessary in areas with high atmospheric demand torres and calera 2010 kr is obtained from eq 6 as the minimum of ratios involving the parameters readily evaporable water rew eto total evaporable water tew soil surface layer depletion de and the correction coefficient m 5 k e k r k c m a x k c b 1 f c k c m a x 6 k r min r e w e t o m t e w d e i t e w r e w through the estimation of daily etc adj eq 1 can be inverted to eq 7 to estimate the temporal and spatially distributed pixel based net irrigation requirements nir defined as that needed to maintain the crop at potential transpiration rates except for perennials therefore in the case of herbaceous crops the model maintains dr values above readily available water raw i e keeping ks around 1 value by means of irrigation events as soon as the stress is shown up the assumption of no water stress conditions in herbaceous crops is reasonable based on i the 2012 spanish national annual statistics report accounts that average production for the irrigated crops in albacete province majority location of the study area were higher to the national average in case of wheat barley and maize magrama 2012 and ii local irrigation practices and collective collaboration on sustainable groundwater management has been recognized as a successful case esteban and albiac 2012 in opposite when the model deals with vineyards perennials an irrigation event is triggered when the ks is reached 7 n i r i d r i 1 d r i p r o i e t c a d j i d p i in accordance with the water use concept of perry perry 2011 the available individual plot data collected from flow meters cover both the consumed and non consumed fraction of the water applied in parallel the model calculated nir refer to the net irrigation depth placed at soil roots depth and hence does not account for non beneficial consumed fraction or non consumed fraction consequently to achieve a consistent comparison between flow meters records and nir at least the differences between gross and net irrigation volumes must be addressed for this purpose the model calculated nir have been increased by 15 or 20 depending on the irrigation system in place average system efficiencies obtained by the local irrigation advisory service for sprinkler and centre pivot respectively 2 4 the model hidromore a tool for rs swb over large areas the methodology to estimate rs swb described above has been implemented in the latest version of hidromore software moreno et al 2017 which integrates rs derived products and meteorological edaphological and crop data in the dual crop coefficient model of fao56 its innovative features are on the one hand the assimilation of multispectral rs data by means of the ndvi kcb act and ndvi fc act relations on the other hand the spatial distribution of the fao56 model by means of a distributed hydrological model torres 2010 the model runs at a daily time step and pixel based scale the spatial coverage and resolution are defined by the footprint of the satellite images over the terrain and their pixel size respectively the hidromore software and its different outputs have been validated at different scenarios one commented before section 2 3 which used in situ soil moisture data from the remehdus network for the application and validation of the rs swb sánchez et al 2010 sánchez et al 2012 moreover groundwater withdrawals for irrigation purposes recorded by the spanish official piezometers network were compared against nir at the aquifer scale garrido rubio et al 2019 besides in the same way to provide validations against the nir annual model estimations at river basin scale along 4 consecutive years 2014 2017 were compared against irrigation needs at 12 river basin management plans 2nd cycle over the spanish mainland scale garrido rubio et al 2018 nowadays previous data at monthly and annual scale is being collected by the spanish ministry for the ecological transition for further validations against in situ data with the purpose to include those results for management and planning of water resources ortega et al 2019 furthermore 3 doctoral theses used the model for different purposes i the use of remote sensing data to assist the soil water balance model and achieve a distributed spatio temporal data of percolation and nir at the aquifer scale torres 2010 ii the validation of soil moisture output data from the rs swb model against in situ data sánchez 2009 sánchez et al 2010 and iii the spatio temporal validation of ndvi kcb act linear relationship at the aquifer scale for vineyards campos 2012 furthermore two eu funded projects used hidromore for operative applications providing distributed spatio temporal thematic cartography etc nir at monthly time scale i to generate services on water management to water users at different levels sirius eu project ga nº 262902 http sirius gmes es and ii to detect non authorized irrigation water abstractions in comparison with the local water authorities data diana eu project ga nº 703109 https diana h2020 eu en besides hidromore tool has been playing an important role in the coquimbo region south chile reporting among other parameters nir spatio temporal maps for irrigation management and information services to different water authorities and end users http www inia cl proyecto 502145 capra project in practical terms the input data for hidromore is a set of geospatial data like a time series of ndvi images b maps of edaphological data for the calculation of soil hydrological parameters c annual maps of irrigated areas per crop type and d daily agrometeorological data from the national network of agrometeorological stations in irrigated areas the advisory service to the irrigator network siar table 3 gives the list of input parameters and the corresponding data sources running hidromore at each pixel with a daily time step requires interpolation of some input data the daily rs derived biophysical parameters are calculated interpolating between the time series of ndvi images while the pixel values of climatic parameters were obtained from spatial interpolation inverse distance squared of point observations the daily outputs of hidromore are the spatially and temporally distributed terms of the soil water balance etc adj nir p dp dr ro and maps of further parameters of interest eto kcb act ks kc in the first step the output data have been temporally aggregated to monthly and annual accumulated values then the spatial aggregation has been performed by extracting the vector layers statistics over the raster maps at the spatial scales of the plots and the wua 2 5 rs satellite data a total of 76 images has been processed to obtain ndvi maps bottom panel of fig 2 the images have been selected to monitor crop growth during the irrigation campaign the time series consists of images from a constellation of sensors thematic mapper tm on board of the landsat 5 satellite 13 images in 2010 enhanced thematic mapper plus etm on board landsat 7 7 images in 2012 in either case using pathrows 199 033 and 200 033 and images from deimos 1 satellite 20 24 12 images in 2010 2011 2012 respectively all landsat images have been radiometrically corrected chander et al 2009 while deimos 1 images are delivered with completed correction an absolute normalization procedure has been applied to each image to achieve atmospheric correction and inter sensor cross calibration this method uses at least two invariant surfaces chen et al 2005 to determine the regression line for ndvi values any pixels contaminated with clouds have been eliminated given the different spatial resolution of the different satellite sensors 30 m for landsat 5 and 7 20 m for deimos 1 pixels have been re scaled through the nearest neighbour approach to 25 m for 2010 data and to 20 m for 2011 and 2012 the spatial accuracy of the ndvi time series when using different satellites in a virtual constellation is obtained by using a minimum 3 3 pixel spatial aggregation martínez beltrán et al 2009 therefore this resolution obtained allowed for monitoring plots larger than 0 5 ha enough for the study area where the average plot size is 5 ha 2 6 irrigated surfaces areas classification by remote sensing crop mapping of irrigated areas has been carried out using multi temporal supervised classification of rs images the classification maps belong as a core part of the ermot project the more than 20 years old project that monitors irrigated surface areas across the study area through remote sensing techniques hence the knowledge of the territory and its crop types cultivated allow recognising and using different temporal dynamics of vegetation development as expressed in a time series of ndvi maps these profiles exhibit the characteristic vegetation periods which are used to classify the crops in consequence threshold criteria are included in decision tree methodologies based on the different growing and phenological development rates which can be studied in the ndvi across the time series this classification by vegetative periods yields crop classes with similar irrigation requirements and cover structure calera et al 1999 for subsequent estimation of nir the main classes are defined as herbaceous spring crops summer crops double harvest and perennials vineyards classification accuracy was computed by an independent commission supplying overall accuracy values after computing the error matrix and consequently by dividing the total correct by the total number of pixels congalton 1991 to that goal maps of irrigated areas have been extensively validated through strategic field visits to 5 of the total area all plots selected for the study are larger than 0 5 ha thus maintaining an inner core unaffected by potential effects of pixels on the border periphery annual overall accuracy classification for spring crops is 85 96 and 98 in 2010 2011 and 2012 respectively in the case of summer crops and with similar chronological order the accuracy values are 96 97 and 96 respectively while for the double harvest ones 83 74 and 63 finally in perennials crop group vineyards accuracy values range from 84 in 2010 and 2011 to 90 in 2012 3 results and discussion 3 1 identification of irrigated areas the crop inventory is based on a set of irrigated crop types with similar vegetative development as evidenced in their ndvi profiles fig 3 spring crops e g wheat barley summer crops with high ground cover e g maize summer crops with low ground cover e g onion double harvest e g annual rotation of wheat and maize alfalfa and vineyards the ndvi profiles for each crop class on fig 3 show slight differences between years this is due to the influence of meteorological conditions on local agricultural practices like sowing date or crop evolution tasumi and allen 2007 the alfalfa profiles play a special role here since the temporal frequency of the satellites used does not allow for determining the highly dynamic crop behaviour very rapid growth and cut every 28 days approximately however the profiles are still quite characteristic and allow their discrimination from the other covers 3 2 irrigated surface area and rs iwa at plot scale fig 4 and table 4 show the comparison of irrigated surface area left panel and annual rs iwa right panel by individual plots and per crop type the irrigated surface area results agree with the field values with a root mean square error rmse around 6 in 2010 and 2012 rising to 15 in 2011 detailed per plot analysis of the 2011 data reveals a special situation where 71 of all plots were used for mixed cultivation crop rotation and sub plots e g wheat garlic maize onion in the same plot in comparison with 2010 and 2012 years 25 and 35 respectively hence the irrigated surfaces areas classification for 2011 produced weakest results so it is reflected in the increase in rmse value for that year in contrast with rmse values for 2010 and 2012 years the comparison of rs iwa has been performed by crop type the right panel of fig 4 shows the annual mean values and standard deviations per year for wheat barley and maize rs assisted values for wheat and maize are slightly lower than those declared by farmers whereas those for barley are significantly higher fig 4 shows that the model is able to respond to different climatic conditions rs iwa values in 2012 are higher than those in 2010 and 2011 in agreement with the records of the farmers the dispersion in the iwa values right panel of fig 4 is consistently and significantly lower in the rs assisted results standard deviation ranges from 15 22 and 43 mm year for wheat in 2010 2011 and 2012 17 19 mm year for maize in 2011 and 2012 and 20 mm year in barley in 2012 than in those obtained from farmers standard deviation ranges from 65 26 and 104 mm year for wheat in 2010 2011 and 2012 58 73 mm year for maize in 2011 and 2012 and 72 mm year for barley in 2012 this apparent lack of sensitivity of the rs based approach is due to the resolution of the available soil map 1 1 100 000 which does not show much of the heterogeneities at a finer scale the available soil water content depends among other factors on the maximum root depth zrmax and the limiting soil depth zs the latter is extracted from the soil map it plays a key role in irrigation requirements but it is difficult to obtain torres 2010 the range of mean zs values in the study plots ranges on 0 3 0 6 m thus limiting zrmax consequently the model averages out the heterogeneities as it is using the best soil map description available however regarding the standard deviation analysis previously described it was expected that the modelled variability would not capture the full complexity of the soil profiles in the field plots at crop type level the best agreement of values is found in maize rsme around 7 followed by wheat 15 in contrast barley shows a remarkably high rmse 76 comparing the mean over all plots of the same crop yields rsmes in maize of 3 in wheat 6 and in barley 72 respectively the high rmse shown for barley are discussed further below mainly regarding agricultural practices and market prices at this area furthermore a detailed comparison of per crop mean values of cumulative nir along with the irrigation campaign fig 5 provides a first step towards explaining these differences the time axis in fig 5 has been normalized with the total duration of the irrigation campaigns the results for wheat and maize show a good agreement with a slight overestimation of the model at the end of the crop cycle in contrast farmer applied irrigation in barley is lower than the calculated requirements during most of the campaign the reasons for this are discussed in the following two additional external information sources have been used to explore the achieved results annual irrigation recommendations that do not account for non consumed water fraction provided by the local irrigation advisory services lias table 5 and literature values for the study area lias issues weekly irrigation recommendations based on the single crop coefficient allen et al 1998 from fieldwork the available literature sources either use directly the same etc data provided by lias martín de santa olalla et al 1999 peña haro et al 2010 or apply the same methodology to calculate etc ortega et al 2004 however none of the literature studies deals with the same period as this study so they can be considered only as a rough approximation and therefore not included in the following discussion in wheat the differences between lias recommendation and rs iwa are minor with a maximum deviation of 15 mm in the dry year 2012 the 3 year mean values differ by as little as 4 mm this indicates good agreement between the two approaches the comparison for maize with lias recommendations shows the largest differences in 2011 56 mm 9 and the smallest in 2012 18 mm 3 which is a generally good agreement of the rs approach the case of barley with only one year of available data does not allow for an in depth comparison although results indicate strong differences between estimations and in situ data resulting in higher estimated irrigation doses than farmer practices in agreement with such findings local research concluded that farmers usually irrigate barley below recommended rates as it is more resistant to drought than other spring crops martín de santa olalla et al 1999 which is in concordance with drought effects on barley regarding stage crop period particularly water stress during early crop development stages reduces grain number and filled grain number while at the terminal crop stage the grain number is reduced to a lesser degree rajala et al 2011 furthermore barley is the cereal over mediterranean areas with better water use conservative strategies acevedo 1987 this agrees with central plot data in fig 5 where irrigation application by farmers remains almost constant in the first half of the irrigation campaign but it is reduced at the final stages this would suggest that barley is water stressed and etc is overestimated at least during such final period and hence higher nir were calculated a further reason for reduced irrigation rates lies in the lower market value of barley as compared to wheat in the same area previous issues would explain why estimated nir are significantly higher than actual irrigation from field records and hence why the resultant calculated rmse are so high in summary the worst value differences between recommendations and rs iwa range from 15 mm wheat 5 to 56 mm maize 9 which means 1 3 irrigation events over the campaign period the rmse differences in the plot scale analysis are of similar magnitude it is important taking into account that in contrast to rs swb the fao56 based recommendations were based on statistical general tables per crop type not considering particular conditions of vegetation at plot level in contrast to rs derived biophysical variables the one year data for barley represent a special case as explained above considering only the data for wheat and maize with a full three and two year period of available data the analysis shows that rs swb is able to estimate properly the irrigation water management requirements rs iwa for a range of special climatic conditions with an overall 3 year rmse of 12 3 3 irrigated surface and rs iwa at water user association scale fig 6 and table 6 show the same comparison as in the previous section but now at wua scale like the plot scale comparison the mapping of irrigated areas shows results in better agreement than the net irrigation requirements the rmse for irrigated area mapping ranges from 10 for summer crops to 17 for vineyards the rs based multi temporal classification slightly underestimates the irrigated areas of spring and summer crops while identifying at acceptable accuracy the alfalfa double harvest and vineyard in this context it is important to know that spring crops cover the largest area fraction 52 followed by summer crops 24 vineyard 13 alfalfa 5 and double harvest 5 these fractions remain constant from year to year with only slight variations in the total irrigated area largest in 2011 with 102 000 ha and smallest in 2010 with 95 000 ha on the other hand the dynamic in soil water balance and irrigation requirements are pronounced due to the annual variations in climatic conditions the year 2010 with its abundant rainfall shows the lowest irrigation requirements while the dry year 2012 has the highest despite being even drier than 2012 the year 2011 exhibits similar irrigation requirements to 2010 due to the rainfall concentration in the critical spring months table 1 the analysis by crop classes reveals the best agreement of net irrigation requirements for summer crops rmse 5 closely followed by spring crops 9 the major disagreement found for alfalfa overestimation by 29 comes from the difficulty to determine the periodic multiple cuts reducing net irrigation requirements from the satellite images used double harvests also present difficulties albeit to a lesser degree vineyard is a special case since the wua defines a fixed irrigation requirement in its annual cultivation plan yet rs iwa provides quite similar values for the three years with annual values varying according to climatic variations further context for discussing these findings is again provided by two sources the lias table 5 and literature values for the study area spring and summer crops show good agreement with values 35 mm and 42 mm higher than lias recommendations in the year of largest deviations 2012 the overall mean value is 17 mm spring and 5 mm summer higher than lias values the comparison looks quite different for the double harvest class where rs iwa values are 221 mm above the lias recommendation the wide range of vegetative cycles involved in double harvest plots may play an important role here see fig 3 in summary rs iwa is in particularly good agreement with lias for spring and summer crops with slight differences in annual recommendations this again as in the case of plot scale analysis translates into 1 3 additional irrigation doses per year the largest differences are found for the year 2012 that is the driest of the studied period the total three year rmse is 15 considering that the alfalfa crop introduces the largest uncertainty due to the satellite overpass frequency does not show adequately the rapid growth and cut cycles in the case of non considering the alfalfa plots this uncertainty is reduced to 11 4 conclusions the use of remote sensing time series data allows irrigation land monitoring the combination of such data and ancillary data agrometeorological soil types and crop characteristics into a remote sensing based soil water balance provides temporal and spatially distribution pixel based maps of net irrigation requirements temporal and spatial aggregations into plot and water user association scale provide a remote sensing based irrigation water accounting rs iwa the remote sensing driven fao56 application presented in this article following the previous statements provides very useful information to water managers to monitoring and design of the river basin management plans in the frame of the water framework directive besides the framework presented is not private water manager dependent as it does not require data provided by them to run the model into the software hidromore used to obtain the results the presented methodology has been validated along with three successive irrigation campaigns 2010 2012 against different spatial and water management scales and implemented by end users the plot and the water user association the rs iwa results were compared with data provided by private water managers at different working scales show good agreement considering the different agrometeorological conditions of each year achieving a rmse about 12 and 15 for plot and water user association spatial scale respectively moreover local agronomic practices like the shortage of water for barley shows the effect of additional criteria that determine irrigation water application decisions such as stress resistance or economic considerations of market value on the other hand rs iwa operates well in crops managed through established deficit irrigation practices like vineyard these results confirm the reliability of the remote sensing based irrigation water accounting as a tool for transparent water management it responds to requirements expressed by basin scale water managers derived from their own experiences with flow meter only networks as such it can be integrated into large scale irrigation control networks providing independent indirect measurements over large areas and complementing a reference set of well calibrated and maintained flow meters finally the actual european satellite constellations including the more recently introduced sentinel 2a and sentinel 2b could further improve crop development monitoring at a much higher image frequency acquisition hence such capabilities

10591,this study aims at evaluating the impact of counterweighted spheres on evaporation loss in agricultural reservoirs to this end water temperatures were measured in two evaporators one covered with spheres and the other uncovered results reveal that during the irrigation period the average evaporation reduction rate under the coverage of counterweighted spheres equaled 70 6 average growth rate of the evaporation driving force equaled 19 2 and average rate of mass transfer coefficient reduction equaled 75 3 between april and august the observed difference in water surface temperature between the covered and uncovered groups was significant compared to that during other months likewise for both groups the water temperature was observed to increase between march and july and reduce between august and october for the covered group significant stratification of water temperature was observed between march to july and the observed difference between the surface temperature t 0w and that recorded by the lowest sensor t 7w was the largest 1 9 c in july between august and october the said water temperature stratification was observed to gradually disappear with the difference between t 0w and t 7w being the smallest 0 2 c in october for the uncovered group the observed water temperature stratification was not significant during the entire irrigation period as observed 33 6 of the net radiation of the covered group was used for evaporation consumption latent heat flux whereas the remaining 66 4 was transmitted to the atmosphere via heat transfer findings of this study reveal that sphere coverage serves to reduce evaporation and increase the amount of water required for irrigation although economic benefits of this technology were not observed to be significant the amount of water saved can be used for supplying to irrigated areas the proposed technology is economically feasible in terms of the net profit from crops produced per m3 of water keywords agricultural reservoir arid region counterweight sphere evaporation reduction rate microclimate energy balance 1 introduction located in the arid region of northwest china xinjiang exhibits large temperature differences rare precipitation high wind and strong evaporation mao et al 2018 chen et al 2014 as a region it suffers from one of the most serious water shortages globally jiang et al 2016 shi et al 2016 most of the irrigated areas in xinjiang are distributed in plain areas water used for agricultural irrigation accounts for 94 of total water consumption in the region zhang 2018 in order to meet irrigation demand more than 400 agricultural reservoirs with a total water surface area of about 2000 km2 have be built these agricultural reservoirs play an irreplaceable role in providing farmland irrigation however due to their characteristics namely their length width and shallowness these reservoirs have an annual evaporation loss of 26 1 108 m3 accounting for 40 of total reservoir water storage shi et al 2016 therefore minimizing evaporation loss from agricultural reservoirs is of great significance for improving the efficiency of agricultural reservoirs chemical and physical methods are the primary means for inhibiting the evaporation of water from the surface the chemical method involves freely dispersing a chemical reagent on the water surface to form a thin monolayer film molecular film coverage does not reduce solar energy entering the water body mainly by changing the diffusion channels of water vapor molecules to inhibit water surface evaporation mcjannet et al 2008 the molecular film is cheaper than physical methods and is suitable for large water surface areas but the evaporation reduction rate is lower 10 40 craig et al 2005 in the wind and wave environment the molecular film can be easily damaged the molecular chain is tilted macritchie 1968 1969 and the extrusion and stacking between the single layer molecules reduces the laying area on the water surface barnes 2008 physical methods reduce the energy or driving force solar or wind energy used for evaporation by changing the physical properties of the water or the atmosphere near the water surface the suspended system for example involves a horizontal sail shaped structure suspended by cables and railings on the water surface such as a porous shade net martínez alvarez et al 2006 or an impervious plastic sheet finn and barnes 2007 martínez alvarez et al 2006 evaluated the effect of different shading meshes on the evaporation of class a evaporators the results showed that the polyethylene double layer was the most effective material with an evaporation reduction rate of 83 5 gallego elvira et al 2011 studied evaporation loss and changes in energy components of large 2400 m2 agricultural reservoirs covered with shading meshes the results showed that the cover can provide a reduction of evaporation loss of 85 and the reduction in the net radiation was remarkable although the cost of suspended cover is high especially for structure installation and maintenance martínez alvarez et al 2009 it has been found to be significant for improving water quality and promoting crop growth maestre valero et al 2011 floating covers are another physical method for inhibiting the evaporation of water from reservoirs floating covers suppress evaporation by reflecting back part of the solar radiation that enters the water and act as a physical obstacle in the vertical and horizontal water vapor diffusion channels compared with suspended covers the greatest advantage of floating covers is that the covers are held on the water surface by the water s buoyancy assouline et al 2011 burston 2002 burston and akbarzadeh 1995 cooley 1983 yan 2004 which can save installation costs compared to the suspended system the float covers can be automatically assembled and re installed after the water level changes or the wind wave xinjiang s agricultural reservoir has a large surface area and the surface is prone to waves it is necessary to consider not only the water saving efficiency of the anti evaporation material but also the stability of the material given wind and wave conditions for agricultural reservoirs with large surface areas the span of the suspended cover and the installation of iron railings are significant factors to consider in the application of a suspended system reservoirs with large surface areas tend to have high wind speed while iron railings can easily cause damage to the geomembrane at the bottom of the reservoir yan 2004 conducted a wind resistant wave test on slab like covers benzene board used on a large scale agricultural reservoir in xinjiang it was found that floating slab like covers might be damaged in a windy environment i e broken scraped away from the reservoir or superimposed on each other in the los angeles reservoir in 2015 black spheres high density polyethylene were used as anti evaporation materials to reduce evaporation haghigi et al 2018 han et al 2019a 2019b studied the stability and water savings efficiency of homogeneous spheres and counterweighted spheres in wind and wave environments respectively the results showed that the stability and water savings efficiency of the counterweighted spheres were higher than homogeneous spheres at present few studies have considered the physical process of evaporation from water surfaces covered with spheres the main purpose of this study is to 1 describe and quantify the changes in evaporation loss and surface energy balance of water covered with counterweighted spheres through an experimental study conducted throughout the irrigation period 2 discuss the changes of evaporation loss and surface energy balance when the counterweighted spheres were used as an anti evaporation material in an agricultural reservoir and 3 evaluate the net profit of the counterweighted spheres per unit area of the reservoir according to the net profit per cubic meter of water water savings efficiency and the investment cost and life of the spheres 2 materials and methods 2 1 material selection the experimental area is located at the soil and water conservation reservoir east of turpan city 42 56 n 89 35 e in northwestern china the area is characterized by a typical continental arid desert climate with annual evaporation averaging 2845 mm a maximum temperature of 49 6 c in summer and minimum temperature of 29 2 c in winter the experiment was conducted from march 2018 to october 2018 covering the whole irrigation period two high density polyethylene material pans with a diameter of 1 2 m and a height of 0 8 m located on the dam of the reservoir were selected the pan walls and bottoms were thermally isolated using thermal insulation cotton and reflective film to minimize the energy exchange between the surface of the pan and the outside environment wind speed uv radiation and freeze thaw cycle in the test area are strong and the return period on the investment of reservoir anti evaporation is long which sets a high standard for material durability high density polyethylene hdpe is an ideal material to use since it is widely used in hydraulic engineering and aquaculture industries and is unlikely to cause water quality problems silver gray counterweighted spheres with good durability and wind resistance were selected as the coverage materials han et al 2019b in order to evaluate the impact of the spheres on evaporation loss from the water surface the water temperature of two evaporators located on the dam was measured one evaporator was completely covered using silver gray counterweighted spheres measuring 100 mm in diameter and the number of counterweighted spheres equal 110 the other evaporator was left uncovered 2 2 evaporation measurements the water level change in the two evaporators was measured using a water level stylus with an accuracy of 0 1 mm mounted on the evaporator the water levels in the evaporators were observed and recorded every day at 20 00 h the evaporation intensity of the water surface in the two evaporators differed and the water volume reduced to different extents thus the water in the two evaporators was supplemented to the same water level every four days after the water level was recorded 2 3 water temperature profile and microclimate measurements meteorological variables such as atmospheric temperature humidity wind speed and air density in the test area were monitored by the automatic weather station located near the reservoir water temperature in each evaporator was measured at different depths using temperature sensors spaced at approximately 0 10 m t 0w t 1w t 2w t 3w t 7w notably the sensor t 0w for monitoring water surface temperature floated below the water surface to prevent it from becoming exposed to air owing to changes in the water level air temperature t 150 and relative humidity rh 150 150 cm above the water surface were monitored using the same type of sensor used to monitor water temperature the relative position of these sensors to the water surface did not change owing to changes in water level a temperature sensor was also installed on the surface of one of the spheres to monitor changes in the surface temperature fig 1 2 4 the net profit analysis the net profit per unit area of the covered reservoir depends on the

particular the spheres covering the water surface reduce the evaporation area of the water surface floating covers moreover a plurality of space suspended covers is formed by the sphere sidewall above the water surface as these spaces are smaller it is difficult to study the balance of the energy radiation of the water surface in the present study the sphere surface and water surface were used as a whole surface to study the changes of energy balance components cooley 1970 the radiative balance at the whole surface can be expressed as 4 r n p 1 α s w p 2 α s c s p 1 α l w p 2 α l c l σ p 1 ε l w

4 mm while total evaporation from the uncovered group was 2010 mm table 1 evaporation from the covered group was closely related to the monthly change of that of the uncovered group ec 0 36 eu 16 64 r 2 0 98 from june to august summer the sum of the evaporation from the covered group accounted for 49 7 of the evaporation that took place across the whole irrigation period march to october while the sum of the evaporation from the uncovered group accounted for 47 1 the evaporation reduction rate of the spheres first decreased and then increased with time with the lowest value in july 67 3 and the highest value in october 77 the average evaporation reduction rate was 70 6 fig 3 in the covered group the spheres reduced the contact area between the water and the atmosphere with only 23 6 of the water surface uncovered the evaporation loss rate was 29 4 which is greater than the value of 23 6 we suggest two main explanations for this phenomenon 1 23 6 of the uncovered area consisted of multiple evenly distributed small openings assouline et al 2010 found that for the same coverage area the evaporation loss rate of multiple distributed small openings was higher than that of the single opening of the same area 2 compared with the uncovered group the water surface temperature of the covered group increased fig 4 and the water vapor pressure difference increased fig 5 resulting in an increase in the evaporation intensity of the adjacent sphere s pore water surface extant studies demonstrate that increasing water surface temperature and vapor pressure difference result in increased evaporation intensity of the pore water surface when transparent spheres and black foamed polystyrene discs cover the water surface ruskowitz et al 2014 silva et al 2017 aminzadeh et al 2018 4 2 change in the microclimate the spheres covering the water prevented direct radiation from the sun on the water body of the covered pans shifting the partitioning of energy to the water surface the energy of the covered water came from heat transfer taking place between the surface of the spheres and the sun s radiation of the uncovered water surface and depended mainly on the thermal conductivity of the cover from april to august the water surface temperature difference between the covered and uncovered groups was significant fig 4 especially the water surface temperature difference in july 2 8 c with increase in solar radiation both the energy concentrated on the sphere surface and heat transferred from the sphere to the water surface increase however the thermal conductivity of the sphere was lower than the heat absorption rate and the heat concentrated on the sphere surface slowly transmitted to the water surface and the surrounding air resulting in a significantly higher sphere surface temperature than the temperature of the covered surface and the temperature of the air the sphere temperature was 10 2 c higher than the temperature of covered water surface and 7 4 c higher than the air temperature in july extant studies demonstrate the surface temperature of black discs to exceed that of white discs covered by the same material under identical environments however the water surface temperature under their coverage is similar this can be mainly be attributed to the low thermal conductivity of these materials aminzadeh et al 2018 in other months the differences in water temperature were not significant because the solar radiation was not strong enough the energy absorbed by the spheres reduced and the heat transferred from the sphere surface to the water surface reduced fig 5 shows the change of evaporation driving force in each month under two conditions there is a tight correlation between monthly values δ e c 0 63 δ e u 0 33 r 2 0 93 due to strong solar radiation from april to september the amount of heat transferred to the water surface from spheres increased causing the water temperature to rise the evaporation driving force of the covered group was higher than that of the uncovered group during this time the reduction in the evaporation of the covered group was not due to a decrease in the evaporation driving force but mainly induced by a decrease in the mass transfer coefficient hv this means that the evaporation reduction of the covered group should be the same as the reduction of hv and may be slightly lower in fact it can be seen from table 1 that the evaporation reduction of the covered group during this time was slightly lower than the reduction of the mass transfer coefficient the difference between the two ranges from 0 65 to 8 45 in march and october due to the weak solar radiation and the small amount of heat transfer from the spheres to the water body the evaporation driving force of the covered group was slightly lower than that of the uncovered group compared with the uncovered group the evaporation driving force of the covered group decreased the reduction of 4 9 and 8 5 in march and october respectively but the reduction was much smaller than the reduction of the mass transfer coefficient 72 4 and 74 9 in march and october respectively across the whole irrigation period the influence of the spheres on the evaporation driving force the monthly mean value of evaporation driving force increases by about 19 2 and on the mass transfer coefficient the monthly mean value of mass transfer coefficient decreases by about 75 3 led to the monthly average evaporation reduction rate of 70 6 therefore the reduction of evaporation was not caused by the reduction of evaporation driving force but mainly by the reduction of mass transfer coefficient compared to suspended cover studies results obtained in this study are similar to those obtained under single layer aluminized mesh coverage martínez alvarez et al 2006 and different from those obtained under shading mesh coverage the observed decrease in evaporation from the water surface maintained under shading meshes can be attributed to the combined effect of the evaporation driving force and reduced mass transfer coefficient martínez alvarez et al 2006 gallego elvira et al 2011 the decrease of mass transfer coefficient was mainly due to the decrease in wind speed and turbulence intensity near the water surface martínez alvarez et al 2006 in this experiment the decrease in the mass transfer coefficient was mainly due to the reduction in contact area between the water surface and the atmosphere which reduced wind disturbance to the water surface 4 3 influence on the temperature of the water body for both the covered and uncovered groups from march to july solar radiation gradually increased and the water temperature rose fig 6 a from august to october due to the solar radiation gradually weakening and a corresponding decrease in the volume of heat entering the water the heat previously stored in the water body was released and the water body temperature decreased fig 6 b it was worth noting that in march august and august october the rate of change in solar radiation was faster increased or decreased compared to that in other months and the temperature of the water body changed greatly in a short period across the irrigation period the stratification of water temperature in the uncovered group was not significant the water temperature at different depths in evaporator b was almost isothermal for the covered group the water temperature stratification became significant from march to july with the difference between the surface temperature t 0w and that of the lowest sensor 0 7 m below surface t 7w was largest in july 1 9 c water temperature stratification gradually disappeared from august to october with the difference between t 0w and t 7w the smallest in october 0 2 c the water temperature stratification observed was a result of solar radiation absorption by the spheres entering the water body and the transmission of heat concentrated on the spheres to the surface and deep water layers the stronger the solar radiation the more significant the water temperature stratification fig 6a in addition the spheres reduced wind speed near the water surface and the mixing of water at different depths notably the main influence of the spheres on water evaporation and energy distribution was concentrated at the water surface of the covered group the stratification of water temperature in the covered group from april to august was mainly reflected in the water depth range of 0 0 30 m with temperature below 0 30 m approximately evenly distributed in other months due to lower radiant flux and lower air temperature heat convection the water temperature stratification gradually disappeared owing to availability of different covering methods and materials the range of water temperature stratification observed in this study in terms of water depth was small compared to that observed under shading meshes and transparent spheres gallego elvira et al 2011 silva et al 2017 aminzadeh et al 2018 reported that the observed water temperature stratification under foamed polystyrene discs cover is insignificant and that it mainly pertains to different thermal conductivity of materials 4 4 energy balance components fig 7 depicts the change in heat flux on surfaces of uncovered and covered water bodies between march and may the net radiation of the uncovered group was observed to exceed that of the covered group and vice versa between june and september in october the net radiation of the uncovered group exceeded that of the covered group fig 7 d between june and september water temperature of the covered group and sphere surface temperature were observed to exceed the water temperature of the uncovered group significantly fig 4 and the net radiation of the covered group was lower compared to that of the uncovered group formula 4 this trend was opposite to the phenomenon observed in fig 7 d this may be attributed to seasonal changes in the short wave albedo of the sphere corresponding reasons can be analyzed as follows short and long wave radiations s and l respectively pertaining to the two above mentioned surface group were observed to be identical at any given time according to extant researches gallego elvira et al 2011 burston 2002 ge and cao 2009 α s w 0 9 α l w 0 97 ε l w 0 97 ε l c 1 α l w 0 97 the long wave reflectance α l c demonstrates little effect on the net radiation and it can generally be omitted burston 2002 values of above parameters are considered constant when used in the net radiation equation however the value of the short wave reflectance γ s c 1 α s c of the cover can be related to those of instantaneous parameters such as the solar zenith angle amount of scattered radiation and surface environment the cover reflectivity γ s c varies greatly with changes in values of these instantaneous parameters cooley 1970 reported that the value of reflectivity difference δ γ s c pertaining to the same cover at different times lies in the range of 0 28 0 59 in this study values of these instantaneous parameters were observed to vary greatly owing to several reasons thereby resulting in great variation in short wave radiation absorption rates on the sphere surface these changes in short wave reflectance γ s c 1 α s c of spheres in different seasons can therefore be considered the main factor resulting in manifestation of the above phenomenon as summarized in table 2 the net radiation of the covered group was reduced by only 2 8 which is comparatively low compared to extant researches pertaining to energy components cooley 1970 aminzadeh et al 2018 for example aminzadeh et al 2018 observed that the net radiation of the surface covered by foamed polystyrene discs was reduced by 17 4 black and 63 0 white according to the net radiation equation reasons pertaining to the observed small decrease in net radiation in this study are as follows on one hand the material color and surface smoothness of covers used in this study differ significantly whereas on the other hand cooley 1970 and aminzadeh et al 2018 used slab like floating covers for the coverage rate per unit area p 1 the surface area p 2 2 16 of spheres for absorption of long and short wave radiations exceeded the surface area of the plate cover p 2 1 the latter area may be considered the main reason for the observed lower rate of net radiation on the sphere surface after covering water the net radiation absorbed by the surface of the covered and uncovered groups can be divided into three parts latent heat flux sensible heat flux and heat storage flux according to the curve of fig 7 c the heat storage flux of the two groups was small with the maximum values only 7 70 w m 2 in the covered group and 6 43 w m 2 in the uncovered group the annual average value was 0 01 w m 2 and 0 02 w m 2 of the covered and uncovered groups respectively compared with latent heat flux and sensible heat flux the heat storage flux g value was negligible previous studies demonstrated that the average rate of heat storage of uncovered agricultural reservoirs and average annual heat storage rate of covered agricultural reservoirs with shading meshes approximately equal zero gallego elvira et al 2011 for the uncovered group the atmospheric temperature was lower than the water surface temperature from march to may indicating that energy was transferred from the water body to the atmosphere reducing the energy available for evaporation from june to october the atmospheric temperature was higher than the water surface temperature indicating that energy was transferred from the atmosphere to the water body that could be used for water surface evaporation for the covered group the surface absorbed solar radiation during the whole irrigation period and the temperature of the surface was higher than the atmospheric temperature indicating that energy was transferred from the surface to the atmosphere reducing the energy available for evaporation due to higher sensible heat flux caused by higher surface temperature and the lower latent heat flux the bowen ratio of the covered group was higher than that of the uncovered group the higher the absolute value of sensible heat flux the greater the absolute value of the difference of the latent heat flux between the covered and uncovered groups fig 7 the absolute values of sensible heat flux in the covered and uncovered groups were the largest in july at 67 28 w m 2 and 213 59 w m 2 respectively the difference between the two latent heat fluxes was 205 21 w m 2 during the irrigation period the absolute value of sensible heat flux monthly average of the covered group was significantly higher than that of the uncovered group and the absolute value of the latent heat flux of the covered group monthly average was significantly lower than that of the uncovered group table 2 the average value of the covered group was 1 97 while the average value of the uncovered group was 0 10 therefore the absolute value of the covered group was about 20 times that of the uncovered group extant studies demonstrate that the low evaporation flux and high sensible heat flux high temperature of covered surface of the covered group results in attainment of a higher bowen ratio for the covered group compared to the uncovered group priestley and taylor 1972 aminzadeh et al 2018 part of the net radiation on the water surface of both groups was used for latent heat flux and the other part was used for sensible heat flux for the covered group the net radiation absorbed by the whole surface was 203 80 w m 2 the sensible heat flux was 135 27 w m 2 which accounted for 66 4 of the net radiation the latent heat flux was 68 51 w m 2 which accounted for 33 6 of the net radiation for the uncovered group the net radiation absorbed was 209 61 w m 2 the sensible heat flux was 23 25 w m 2 the energy was transferred from the atmosphere to the water surface and the latent heat flux was 232 85 w m 2 this shows that the net radiation and sensible heat flux for the uncovered group were used for water surface evaporation 4 5 economic viability taking the main crop grapes in turpan as an example according to local farmers the average annual net profit of grapes was 150 000 hm2 and the grape irrigation quota was calculated at 7800 m3 hm2 that is the crop net profit produced per cubic meter of water can be pc 19 23 m 3 yr 1 at present commercial firms have determined costs pertaining to installation of counterweighted spheres to approximately equal 50 m 2 along with a guaranteed useful life of 20 years n 20 yr according to the above the evaporation reduction rate was η 70 6 and the annual evaporation amount during the irrigation period was e 2 01 m according to formula 1 the net profit per unit area of the covered reservoir was α 495 77 m 2 and the water cost per unit area of the reservoir can be generated β 0 5η e 0 5 70 6 2 01 0 71 m 2 yr 1 considering a small agricultural reservoir area 17 4 hm2 located in the eastern part of the turpan city as an example when the coverage area s 17 4 hm2 76 4 13 2936 hm2 the total amount of water saved q 17 4 hm2 2 01 m yr 1 20 yr 70 6 4 938 328 m3 in 20 years which in turn can guarantee irrigation of a grape farmland spanning 4938328 m3 7800 m3 hm2 yr 20yr 31 66 hm2 the net profit generated by the system operation for 20 years was 65 9057 million and the water fee can be generated by 0 71 m 2 yr 1 132936 m2 20yr 1 8877 million 5 discussion 5 1 application in the reservoir net radiation and sensible heat flux sphere surface temperature are mainly affected by the optical properties of the sphere long and short wave absorption rates etc whatever the dimensions of the water body the optical properties of the sphere are identical as they do not change with the reservoir size using formula 8 it can be observed that the change in heat storage flux can be related to the rate of change of water depth and water temperature and that this change in heat flux is less affected by water area additionally the value of heat storage flux is much smaller in energy balance components compared to others and it can therefore be ignored the factors affecting evaporation are evaporation driving force and mass transfer coefficient whatever the dimensions of the water body the optical properties of the sphere are identical thus when the spheres are applied to an agricultural reservoir variation in water vapor pressure difference evaporation driving force near the water surface caused by the optical properties and thermal conductivity net radiation and sensible heat flux of the spheres is not affected by the dimensions of the water body however the influence of the spheres covering the water surface on wind speed and water vapor mass transfer coefficient near large areas of water was not easy to evaluate and few studies have focused on wind speed reduction under sphere coverage the large water surface readily formed waves owing to wind sphere coverage may cause a reduction in wind speed near the water surface due to the reduction in water surface waves by the spheres for example han et al 2019a 2019b studied the surface wetting rate of homogeneous and counterweighted spheres under different coverage areas in wind and wave environments the results showed that the larger the coverage area the smaller the surface wetting rate of the spheres indicating that the wave reduction effect of the spheres was more significant in large areas thus with an increase in coverage area the influence of wind on the fluctuation of the water surface was reduced with sphere coverage able to significantly reduce the wind speed near the water surface when the reservoir surface was covered by a large number of closely arranged spheres fluctuations in water surface were generally small under normal wind speed it can be approximated that the mass transfer coefficient was likely similar to the mass transfer coefficient in the evaporator in this study observed changes in energy balance components mainly occurred on the water surface combining energy balance component equations formula 4 7 it can be observed that changes in net radiation sensible heat flux and latent heat flux mainly occur on the surface and that these can be related to optical characteristics and thermal conductivity of spheres whilst being less affected by water depth additionally the heat storage flux in energy balance components can be exclusively related to the rate of change of water temperature at different water depths formula 8 however the value and range of heat storage flux before and after sphere coverage during the entire irrigation period were observed to be much smaller compared to other energy balance components the average value of heat storage flux of the covered group equaled only 0 01 w m 2 whereas that of the uncovered group equaled only 0 02 w m 2 table 2 both of which can be ignored therefore it can be considered that the change in energy balance components is hardly affected by water depth to summarize our results indicate that the evaporation reduction rate under sphere coverage was likely only minimally affected by water surface area and depth but was largely affected by the evaporation driving force and the mass transfer coefficient which depended on the optical properties of the sphere therefore the value of the evaporation reduction rate determined in the present study can be applied to the reservoirs 5 2 other benefits analysis in xinjiang agricultural reservoirs sphere coverage can reduce evaporation and increase the amount of water needed for irrigation based on the currently low price of agricultural water the return period on the investment is long han et al 2019b however saved agricultural water can increase the water supply to irrigated areas and the technology is economically feasible when calculated according to the net profit of crops produced per cubic meter of water this study only analyzed the net profit from crops produced per m3 of water when the coverage rate is 76 4 the breakeven point for this technology to be economically viable and the cost function with respect to surface area of the reservoir require further detailed research in addition other related advantages of this technology have been not considered suppressing the evaporation from an agricultural reservoir can improve the salinity of the water at the water source martínez alvarez et al 2006 maestre valero et al 2011 thereby reducing the cost of soil salinization treatment in irrigated areas the saved water from agricultural reservoirs due to sphere coverage can supplement rainwater on the basis of meeting the irrigation needs of existing irrigated areas therefore from the perspective of the sustainable development of the ecological environment the ecological benefits of this technology far exceed their economic benefits 5 3 advantages of counterweighted spheres covering reservoirs in xinjiang agricultural reservoirs contain large amounts of water surfaces of which are prone to waves this makes it necessary to not only consider the water saving efficiency of anti evaporation materials but also their stability under conditions characterized by winds and waves since 2015 the authors have observed the operation of polyvinyl chloride board ordinary spheres high density polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride and counterweighted spheres high density polyethylene in the soil and water conservation reservoir it has been observed that counterweighted spheres are ideal anti evaporation materials owing mainly to following aspects 1 in high wind and wave environments the curved structure of a sphere reduces the contact area between spheres and other objects reduces collision wear thereby enhancing material durability each sphere is lightweight and incident waves only wet small parts of their surfaces that measure less compared to the maximum horizontal area of the sphere via slight up and down movements due to wind and waves 2 under the action of non sustained winds spheres return to the water under the action of gravity they do not blow away from the reservoir area however floating boards are either scraped off the reservoir or superimposed on each other 3 an ordinary sphere would easily flip up and down easily under wind and wave actions additionally it accelerates water evaporation owing to its wetted surface being exposed to air counterweighted spheres possess their own moments of gravity owing to strong resistance to external forces compared to ordinary spheres counterweighted spheres cannot be easily flipped up and down under wind and wave actions 6 conclusions this paper presents a detailed experimental study performed to assess the effects of silver gray counterweighted spheres on evaporation and energy balance components of an agricultural reservoir as observed in this study sphere coverage alters the original microclimate near the water surface wherein 1 water surface temperature of the covered group increases 2 sphere coverage reduces both the contact area between the water surface and atmosphere as well as turbulence intensity near the water surface on the inside thereby greatly reducing the mass transfer coefficient 3 the evaporation driving force increases owing to increase in water surface temperature in the covered group these microclimate changes reduce evaporation of the water surface covered by spheres 70 6 the main reason for which can be considered the reduction in mass transfer coefficient during the irrigation period there exists a seasonal difference in evaporation reduction between march and october the evaporation reduction rate first decreases followed by a subsequent increase the lowest and highest reduction rates were observed in july 67 3 and months of march and october 73 7 and 77 0 respectively an isothermal profile was observed to prevail in the uncovered group throughout the irrigation period owing to the wind shielding effect and low thermal conductivity of spheres the stratification of water temperature in the water depth range of 0 0 30 m for the covered group was significant between april and august the observed difference between the surface temperature and that recorded by the lowest sensor was the largest in july 1 9 c in addition sphere coverage blocks radiant heat flux to the water body and transfers part of this energy to the water surface of the covered group mainly on sphere surfaces thus sphere coverage destroys the original energy balance on the water surface and establishes a new surface energy balance on the water surface compared to the uncovered group the heat storage flux being an exception several significant modifications were observed in the magnitude trend sign and relative weight of other energy components the change in sign and weight of the sensible heat flux substantially reduces the energy available for evaporation latent heat flux the proposed study analyzes the evaporation and energy balance of water reservoirs covered by counterweighted spheres from both experimental and theoretical aspects the analyzed approaches provide a solid foundation for describing and explaining the physical process for realization of a high water saving efficiency via use of counterweighted spheres from the perspectives of practical applications and based on the net profit from crops produced per cubic meter of water counterweighted spheres considered in this study are representative of an effective water saving technique for agricultural reservoirs in xinjiang declaration of

10591,this study aims at evaluating the impact of counterweighted spheres on evaporation loss in agricultural reservoirs to this end water temperatures were measured in two evaporators one covered with spheres and the other uncovered results reveal that during the irrigation period the average evaporation reduction rate under the coverage of counterweighted spheres equaled 70 6 average growth rate of the evaporation driving force equaled 19 2 and average rate of mass transfer coefficient reduction equaled 75 3 between april and august the observed difference in water surface temperature between the covered and uncovered groups was significant compared to that during other months likewise for both groups the water temperature was observed to increase between march and july and reduce between august and october for the covered group significant stratification of water temperature was observed between march to july and the observed difference between the surface temperature t 0w and that recorded by the lowest sensor t 7w was the largest 1 9 c in july between august and october the said water temperature stratification was observed to gradually disappear with the difference between t 0w and t 7w being the smallest 0 2 c in october for the uncovered group the observed water temperature stratification was not significant during the entire irrigation period as observed 33 6 of the net radiation of the covered group was used for evaporation consumption latent heat flux whereas the remaining 66 4 was transmitted to the atmosphere via heat transfer findings of this study reveal that sphere coverage serves to reduce evaporation and increase the amount of water required for irrigation although economic benefits of this technology were not observed to be significant the amount of water saved can be used for supplying to irrigated areas the proposed technology is economically feasible in terms of the net profit from crops produced per m3 of water keywords agricultural reservoir arid region counterweight sphere evaporation reduction rate microclimate energy balance 1 introduction located in the arid region of northwest china xinjiang exhibits large temperature differences rare precipitation high wind and strong evaporation mao et al 2018 chen et al 2014 as a region it suffers from one of the most serious water shortages globally jiang et al 2016 shi et al 2016 most of the irrigated areas in xinjiang are distributed in plain areas water used for agricultural irrigation accounts for 94 of total water consumption in the region zhang 2018 in order to meet irrigation demand more than 400 agricultural reservoirs with a total water surface area of about 2000 km2 have be built these agricultural reservoirs play an irreplaceable role in providing farmland irrigation however due to their characteristics namely their length width and shallowness these reservoirs have an annual evaporation loss of 26 1 108 m3 accounting for 40 of total reservoir water storage shi et al 2016 therefore minimizing evaporation loss from agricultural reservoirs is of great significance for improving the efficiency of agricultural reservoirs chemical and physical methods are the primary means for inhibiting the evaporation of water from the surface the chemical method involves freely dispersing a chemical reagent on the water surface to form a thin monolayer film molecular film coverage does not reduce solar energy entering the water body mainly by changing the diffusion channels of water vapor molecules to inhibit water surface evaporation mcjannet et al 2008 the molecular film is cheaper than physical methods and is suitable for large water surface areas but the evaporation reduction rate is lower 10 40 craig et al 2005 in the wind and wave environment the molecular film can be easily damaged the molecular chain is tilted macritchie 1968 1969 and the extrusion and stacking between the single layer molecules reduces the laying area on the water surface barnes 2008 physical methods reduce the energy or driving force solar or wind energy used for evaporation by changing the physical properties of the water or the atmosphere near the water surface the suspended system for example involves a horizontal sail shaped structure suspended by cables and railings on the water surface such as a porous shade net martínez alvarez et al 2006 or an impervious plastic sheet finn and barnes 2007 martínez alvarez et al 2006 evaluated the effect of different shading meshes on the evaporation of class a evaporators the results showed that the polyethylene double layer was the most effective material with an evaporation reduction rate of 83 5 gallego elvira et al 2011 studied evaporation loss and changes in energy components of large 2400 m2 agricultural reservoirs covered with shading meshes the results showed that the cover can provide a reduction of evaporation loss of 85 and the reduction in the net radiation was remarkable although the cost of suspended cover is high especially for structure installation and maintenance martínez alvarez et al 2009 it has been found to be significant for improving water quality and promoting crop growth maestre valero et al 2011 floating covers are another physical method for inhibiting the evaporation of water from reservoirs floating covers suppress evaporation by reflecting back part of the solar radiation that enters the water and act as a physical obstacle in the vertical and horizontal water vapor diffusion channels compared with suspended covers the greatest advantage of floating covers is that the covers are held on the water surface by the water s buoyancy assouline et al 2011 burston 2002 burston and akbarzadeh 1995 cooley 1983 yan 2004 which can save installation costs compared to the suspended system the float covers can be automatically assembled and re installed after the water level changes or the wind wave xinjiang s agricultural reservoir has a large surface area and the surface is prone to waves it is necessary to consider not only the water saving efficiency of the anti evaporation material but also the stability of the material given wind and wave conditions for agricultural reservoirs with large surface areas the span of the suspended cover and the installation of iron railings are significant factors to consider in the application of a suspended system reservoirs with large surface areas tend to have high wind speed while iron railings can easily cause damage to the geomembrane at the bottom of the reservoir yan 2004 conducted a wind resistant wave test on slab like covers benzene board used on a large scale agricultural reservoir in xinjiang it was found that floating slab like covers might be damaged in a windy environment i e broken scraped away from the reservoir or superimposed on each other in the los angeles reservoir in 2015 black spheres high density polyethylene were used as anti evaporation materials to reduce evaporation haghigi et al 2018 han et al 2019a 2019b studied the stability and water savings efficiency of homogeneous spheres and counterweighted spheres in wind and wave environments respectively the results showed that the stability and water savings efficiency of the counterweighted spheres were higher than homogeneous spheres at present few studies have considered the physical process of evaporation from water surfaces covered with spheres the main purpose of this study is to 1 describe and quantify the changes in evaporation loss and surface energy balance of water covered with counterweighted spheres through an experimental study conducted throughout the irrigation period 2 discuss the changes of evaporation loss and surface energy balance when the counterweighted spheres were used as an anti evaporation material in an agricultural reservoir and 3 evaluate the net profit of the counterweighted spheres per unit area of the reservoir according to the net profit per cubic meter of water water savings efficiency and the investment cost and life of the spheres 2 materials and methods 2 1 material selection the experimental area is located at the soil and water conservation reservoir east of turpan city 42 56 n 89 35 e in northwestern china the area is characterized by a typical continental arid desert climate with annual evaporation averaging 2845 mm a maximum temperature of 49 6 c in summer and minimum temperature of 29 2 c in winter the experiment was conducted from march 2018 to october 2018 covering the whole irrigation period two high density polyethylene material pans with a diameter of 1 2 m and a height of 0 8 m located on the dam of the reservoir were selected the pan walls and bottoms were thermally isolated using thermal insulation cotton and reflective film to minimize the energy exchange between the surface of the pan and the outside environment wind speed uv radiation and freeze thaw cycle in the test area are strong and the return period on the investment of reservoir anti evaporation is long which sets a high standard for material durability high density polyethylene hdpe is an ideal material to use since it is widely used in hydraulic engineering and aquaculture industries and is unlikely to cause water quality problems silver gray counterweighted spheres with good durability and wind resistance were selected as the coverage materials han et al 2019b in order to evaluate the impact of the spheres on evaporation loss from the water surface the water temperature of two evaporators located on the dam was measured one evaporator was completely covered using silver gray counterweighted spheres measuring 100 mm in diameter and the number of counterweighted spheres equal 110 the other evaporator was left uncovered 2 2 evaporation measurements the water level change in the two evaporators was measured using a water level stylus with an accuracy of 0 1 mm mounted on the evaporator the water levels in the evaporators were observed and recorded every day at 20 00 h the evaporation intensity of the water surface in the two evaporators differed and the water volume reduced to different extents thus the water in the two evaporators was supplemented to the same water level every four days after the water level was recorded 2 3 water temperature profile and microclimate measurements meteorological variables such as atmospheric temperature humidity wind speed and air density in the test area were monitored by the automatic weather station located near the reservoir water temperature in each evaporator was measured at different depths using temperature sensors spaced at approximately 0 10 m t 0w t 1w t 2w t 3w t 7w notably the sensor t 0w for monitoring water surface temperature floated below the water surface to prevent it from becoming exposed to air owing to changes in the water level air temperature t 150 and relative humidity rh 150 150 cm above the water surface were monitored using the same type of sensor used to monitor water temperature the relative position of these sensors to the water surface did not change owing to changes in water level a temperature sensor was also installed on the surface of one of the spheres to monitor changes in the surface temperature fig 1 2 4 the net profit analysis the net profit per unit area of the covered reservoir depends on the

particular the spheres covering the water surface reduce the evaporation area of the water surface floating covers moreover a plurality of space suspended covers is formed by the sphere sidewall above the water surface as these spaces are smaller it is difficult to study the balance of the energy radiation of the water surface in the present study the sphere surface and water surface were used as a whole surface to study the changes of energy balance components cooley 1970 the radiative balance at the whole surface can be expressed as 4 r n p 1 α s w p 2 α s c s p 1 α l w p 2 α l c l σ p 1 ε l w

4 mm while total evaporation from the uncovered group was 2010 mm table 1 evaporation from the covered group was closely related to the monthly change of that of the uncovered group ec 0 36 eu 16 64 r 2 0 98 from june to august summer the sum of the evaporation from the covered group accounted for 49 7 of the evaporation that took place across the whole irrigation period march to october while the sum of the evaporation from the uncovered group accounted for 47 1 the evaporation reduction rate of the spheres first decreased and then increased with time with the lowest value in july 67 3 and the highest value in october 77 the average evaporation reduction rate was 70 6 fig 3 in the covered group the spheres reduced the contact area between the water and the atmosphere with only 23 6 of the water surface uncovered the evaporation loss rate was 29 4 which is greater than the value of 23 6 we suggest two main explanations for this phenomenon 1 23 6 of the uncovered area consisted of multiple evenly distributed small openings assouline et al 2010 found that for the same coverage area the evaporation loss rate of multiple distributed small openings was higher than that of the single opening of the same area 2 compared with the uncovered group the water surface temperature of the covered group increased fig 4 and the water vapor pressure difference increased fig 5 resulting in an increase in the evaporation intensity of the adjacent sphere s pore water surface extant studies demonstrate that increasing water surface temperature and vapor pressure difference result in increased evaporation intensity of the pore water surface when transparent spheres and black foamed polystyrene discs cover the water surface ruskowitz et al 2014 silva et al 2017 aminzadeh et al 2018 4 2 change in the microclimate the spheres covering the water prevented direct radiation from the sun on the water body of the covered pans shifting the partitioning of energy to the water surface the energy of the covered water came from heat transfer taking place between the surface of the spheres and the sun s radiation of the uncovered water surface and depended mainly on the thermal conductivity of the cover from april to august the water surface temperature difference between the covered and uncovered groups was significant fig 4 especially the water surface temperature difference in july 2 8 c with increase in solar radiation both the energy concentrated on the sphere surface and heat transferred from the sphere to the water surface increase however the thermal conductivity of the sphere was lower than the heat absorption rate and the heat concentrated on the sphere surface slowly transmitted to the water surface and the surrounding air resulting in a significantly higher sphere surface temperature than the temperature of the covered surface and the temperature of the air the sphere temperature was 10 2 c higher than the temperature of covered water surface and 7 4 c higher than the air temperature in july extant studies demonstrate the surface temperature of black discs to exceed that of white discs covered by the same material under identical environments however the water surface temperature under their coverage is similar this can be mainly be attributed to the low thermal conductivity of these materials aminzadeh et al 2018 in other months the differences in water temperature were not significant because the solar radiation was not strong enough the energy absorbed by the spheres reduced and the heat transferred from the sphere surface to the water surface reduced fig 5 shows the change of evaporation driving force in each month under two conditions there is a tight correlation between monthly values δ e c 0 63 δ e u 0 33 r 2 0 93 due to strong solar radiation from april to september the amount of heat transferred to the water surface from spheres increased causing the water temperature to rise the evaporation driving force of the covered group was higher than that of the uncovered group during this time the reduction in the evaporation of the covered group was not due to a decrease in the evaporation driving force but mainly induced by a decrease in the mass transfer coefficient hv this means that the evaporation reduction of the covered group should be the same as the reduction of hv and may be slightly lower in fact it can be seen from table 1 that the evaporation reduction of the covered group during this time was slightly lower than the reduction of the mass transfer coefficient the difference between the two ranges from 0 65 to 8 45 in march and october due to the weak solar radiation and the small amount of heat transfer from the spheres to the water body the evaporation driving force of the covered group was slightly lower than that of the uncovered group compared with the uncovered group the evaporation driving force of the covered group decreased the reduction of 4 9 and 8 5 in march and october respectively but the reduction was much smaller than the reduction of the mass transfer coefficient 72 4 and 74 9 in march and october respectively across the whole irrigation period the influence of the spheres on the evaporation driving force the monthly mean value of evaporation driving force increases by about 19 2 and on the mass transfer coefficient the monthly mean value of mass transfer coefficient decreases by about 75 3 led to the monthly average evaporation reduction rate of 70 6 therefore the reduction of evaporation was not caused by the reduction of evaporation driving force but mainly by the reduction of mass transfer coefficient compared to suspended cover studies results obtained in this study are similar to those obtained under single layer aluminized mesh coverage martínez alvarez et al 2006 and different from those obtained under shading mesh coverage the observed decrease in evaporation from the water surface maintained under shading meshes can be attributed to the combined effect of the evaporation driving force and reduced mass transfer coefficient martínez alvarez et al 2006 gallego elvira et al 2011 the decrease of mass transfer coefficient was mainly due to the decrease in wind speed and turbulence intensity near the water surface martínez alvarez et al 2006 in this experiment the decrease in the mass transfer coefficient was mainly due to the reduction in contact area between the water surface and the atmosphere which reduced wind disturbance to the water surface 4 3 influence on the temperature of the water body for both the covered and uncovered groups from march to july solar radiation gradually increased and the water temperature rose fig 6 a from august to october due to the solar radiation gradually weakening and a corresponding decrease in the volume of heat entering the water the heat previously stored in the water body was released and the water body temperature decreased fig 6 b it was worth noting that in march august and august october the rate of change in solar radiation was faster increased or decreased compared to that in other months and the temperature of the water body changed greatly in a short period across the irrigation period the stratification of water temperature in the uncovered group was not significant the water temperature at different depths in evaporator b was almost isothermal for the covered group the water temperature stratification became significant from march to july with the difference between the surface temperature t 0w and that of the lowest sensor 0 7 m below surface t 7w was largest in july 1 9 c water temperature stratification gradually disappeared from august to october with the difference between t 0w and t 7w the smallest in october 0 2 c the water temperature stratification observed was a result of solar radiation absorption by the spheres entering the water body and the transmission of heat concentrated on the spheres to the surface and deep water layers the stronger the solar radiation the more significant the water temperature stratification fig 6a in addition the spheres reduced wind speed near the water surface and the mixing of water at different depths notably the main influence of the spheres on water evaporation and energy distribution was concentrated at the water surface of the covered group the stratification of water temperature in the covered group from april to august was mainly reflected in the water depth range of 0 0 30 m with temperature below 0 30 m approximately evenly distributed in other months due to lower radiant flux and lower air temperature heat convection the water temperature stratification gradually disappeared owing to availability of different covering methods and materials the range of water temperature stratification observed in this study in terms of water depth was small compared to that observed under shading meshes and transparent spheres gallego elvira et al 2011 silva et al 2017 aminzadeh et al 2018 reported that the observed water temperature stratification under foamed polystyrene discs cover is insignificant and that it mainly pertains to different thermal conductivity of materials 4 4 energy balance components fig 7 depicts the change in heat flux on surfaces of uncovered and covered water bodies between march and may the net radiation of the uncovered group was observed to exceed that of the covered group and vice versa between june and september in october the net radiation of the uncovered group exceeded that of the covered group fig 7 d between june and september water temperature of the covered group and sphere surface temperature were observed to exceed the water temperature of the uncovered group significantly fig 4 and the net radiation of the covered group was lower compared to that of the uncovered group formula 4 this trend was opposite to the phenomenon observed in fig 7 d this may be attributed to seasonal changes in the short wave albedo of the sphere corresponding reasons can be analyzed as follows short and long wave radiations s and l respectively pertaining to the two above mentioned surface group were observed to be identical at any given time according to extant researches gallego elvira et al 2011 burston 2002 ge and cao 2009 α s w 0 9 α l w 0 97 ε l w 0 97 ε l c 1 α l w 0 97 the long wave reflectance α l c demonstrates little effect on the net radiation and it can generally be omitted burston 2002 values of above parameters are considered constant when used in the net radiation equation however the value of the short wave reflectance γ s c 1 α s c of the cover can be related to those of instantaneous parameters such as the solar zenith angle amount of scattered radiation and surface environment the cover reflectivity γ s c varies greatly with changes in values of these instantaneous parameters cooley 1970 reported that the value of reflectivity difference δ γ s c pertaining to the same cover at different times lies in the range of 0 28 0 59 in this study values of these instantaneous parameters were observed to vary greatly owing to several reasons thereby resulting in great variation in short wave radiation absorption rates on the sphere surface these changes in short wave reflectance γ s c 1 α s c of spheres in different seasons can therefore be considered the main factor resulting in manifestation of the above phenomenon as summarized in table 2 the net radiation of the covered group was reduced by only 2 8 which is comparatively low compared to extant researches pertaining to energy components cooley 1970 aminzadeh et al 2018 for example aminzadeh et al 2018 observed that the net radiation of the surface covered by foamed polystyrene discs was reduced by 17 4 black and 63 0 white according to the net radiation equation reasons pertaining to the observed small decrease in net radiation in this study are as follows on one hand the material color and surface smoothness of covers used in this study differ significantly whereas on the other hand cooley 1970 and aminzadeh et al 2018 used slab like floating covers for the coverage rate per unit area p 1 the surface area p 2 2 16 of spheres for absorption of long and short wave radiations exceeded the surface area of the plate cover p 2 1 the latter area may be considered the main reason for the observed lower rate of net radiation on the sphere surface after covering water the net radiation absorbed by the surface of the covered and uncovered groups can be divided into three parts latent heat flux sensible heat flux and heat storage flux according to the curve of fig 7 c the heat storage flux of the two groups was small with the maximum values only 7 70 w m 2 in the covered group and 6 43 w m 2 in the uncovered group the annual average value was 0 01 w m 2 and 0 02 w m 2 of the covered and uncovered groups respectively compared with latent heat flux and sensible heat flux the heat storage flux g value was negligible previous studies demonstrated that the average rate of heat storage of uncovered agricultural reservoirs and average annual heat storage rate of covered agricultural reservoirs with shading meshes approximately equal zero gallego elvira et al 2011 for the uncovered group the atmospheric temperature was lower than the water surface temperature from march to may indicating that energy was transferred from the water body to the atmosphere reducing the energy available for evaporation from june to october the atmospheric temperature was higher than the water surface temperature indicating that energy was transferred from the atmosphere to the water body that could be used for water surface evaporation for the covered group the surface absorbed solar radiation during the whole irrigation period and the temperature of the surface was higher than the atmospheric temperature indicating that energy was transferred from the surface to the atmosphere reducing the energy available for evaporation due to higher sensible heat flux caused by higher surface temperature and the lower latent heat flux the bowen ratio of the covered group was higher than that of the uncovered group the higher the absolute value of sensible heat flux the greater the absolute value of the difference of the latent heat flux between the covered and uncovered groups fig 7 the absolute values of sensible heat flux in the covered and uncovered groups were the largest in july at 67 28 w m 2 and 213 59 w m 2 respectively the difference between the two latent heat fluxes was 205 21 w m 2 during the irrigation period the absolute value of sensible heat flux monthly average of the covered group was significantly higher than that of the uncovered group and the absolute value of the latent heat flux of the covered group monthly average was significantly lower than that of the uncovered group table 2 the average value of the covered group was 1 97 while the average value of the uncovered group was 0 10 therefore the absolute value of the covered group was about 20 times that of the uncovered group extant studies demonstrate that the low evaporation flux and high sensible heat flux high temperature of covered surface of the covered group results in attainment of a higher bowen ratio for the covered group compared to the uncovered group priestley and taylor 1972 aminzadeh et al 2018 part of the net radiation on the water surface of both groups was used for latent heat flux and the other part was used for sensible heat flux for the covered group the net radiation absorbed by the whole surface was 203 80 w m 2 the sensible heat flux was 135 27 w m 2 which accounted for 66 4 of the net radiation the latent heat flux was 68 51 w m 2 which accounted for 33 6 of the net radiation for the uncovered group the net radiation absorbed was 209 61 w m 2 the sensible heat flux was 23 25 w m 2 the energy was transferred from the atmosphere to the water surface and the latent heat flux was 232 85 w m 2 this shows that the net radiation and sensible heat flux for the uncovered group were used for water surface evaporation 4 5 economic viability taking the main crop grapes in turpan as an example according to local farmers the average annual net profit of grapes was 150 000 hm2 and the grape irrigation quota was calculated at 7800 m3 hm2 that is the crop net profit produced per cubic meter of water can be pc 19 23 m 3 yr 1 at present commercial firms have determined costs pertaining to installation of counterweighted spheres to approximately equal 50 m 2 along with a guaranteed useful life of 20 years n 20 yr according to the above the evaporation reduction rate was η 70 6 and the annual evaporation amount during the irrigation period was e 2 01 m according to formula 1 the net profit per unit area of the covered reservoir was α 495 77 m 2 and the water cost per unit area of the reservoir can be generated β 0 5η e 0 5 70 6 2 01 0 71 m 2 yr 1 considering a small agricultural reservoir area 17 4 hm2 located in the eastern part of the turpan city as an example when the coverage area s 17 4 hm2 76 4 13 2936 hm2 the total amount of water saved q 17 4 hm2 2 01 m yr 1 20 yr 70 6 4 938 328 m3 in 20 years which in turn can guarantee irrigation of a grape farmland spanning 4938328 m3 7800 m3 hm2 yr 20yr 31 66 hm2 the net profit generated by the system operation for 20 years was 65 9057 million and the water fee can be generated by 0 71 m 2 yr 1 132936 m2 20yr 1 8877 million 5 discussion 5 1 application in the reservoir net radiation and sensible heat flux sphere surface temperature are mainly affected by the optical properties of the sphere long and short wave absorption rates etc whatever the dimensions of the water body the optical properties of the sphere are identical as they do not change with the reservoir size using formula 8 it can be observed that the change in heat storage flux can be related to the rate of change of water depth and water temperature and that this change in heat flux is less affected by water area additionally the value of heat storage flux is much smaller in energy balance components compared to others and it can therefore be ignored the factors affecting evaporation are evaporation driving force and mass transfer coefficient whatever the dimensions of the water body the optical properties of the sphere are identical thus when the spheres are applied to an agricultural reservoir variation in water vapor pressure difference evaporation driving force near the water surface caused by the optical properties and thermal conductivity net radiation and sensible heat flux of the spheres is not affected by the dimensions of the water body however the influence of the spheres covering the water surface on wind speed and water vapor mass transfer coefficient near large areas of water was not easy to evaluate and few studies have focused on wind speed reduction under sphere coverage the large water surface readily formed waves owing to wind sphere coverage may cause a reduction in wind speed near the water surface due to the reduction in water surface waves by the spheres for example han et al 2019a 2019b studied the surface wetting rate of homogeneous and counterweighted spheres under different coverage areas in wind and wave environments the results showed that the larger the coverage area the smaller the surface wetting rate of the spheres indicating that the wave reduction effect of the spheres was more significant in large areas thus with an increase in coverage area the influence of wind on the fluctuation of the water surface was reduced with sphere coverage able to significantly reduce the wind speed near the water surface when the reservoir surface was covered by a large number of closely arranged spheres fluctuations in water surface were generally small under normal wind speed it can be approximated that the mass transfer coefficient was likely similar to the mass transfer coefficient in the evaporator in this study observed changes in energy balance components mainly occurred on the water surface combining energy balance component equations formula 4 7 it can be observed that changes in net radiation sensible heat flux and latent heat flux mainly occur on the surface and that these can be related to optical characteristics and thermal conductivity of spheres whilst being less affected by water depth additionally the heat storage flux in energy balance components can be exclusively related to the rate of change of water temperature at different water depths formula 8 however the value and range of heat storage flux before and after sphere coverage during the entire irrigation period were observed to be much smaller compared to other energy balance components the average value of heat storage flux of the covered group equaled only 0 01 w m 2 whereas that of the uncovered group equaled only 0 02 w m 2 table 2 both of which can be ignored therefore it can be considered that the change in energy balance components is hardly affected by water depth to summarize our results indicate that the evaporation reduction rate under sphere coverage was likely only minimally affected by water surface area and depth but was largely affected by the evaporation driving force and the mass transfer coefficient which depended on the optical properties of the sphere therefore the value of the evaporation reduction rate determined in the present study can be applied to the reservoirs 5 2 other benefits analysis in xinjiang agricultural reservoirs sphere coverage can reduce evaporation and increase the amount of water needed for irrigation based on the currently low price of agricultural water the return period on the investment is long han et al 2019b however saved agricultural water can increase the water supply to irrigated areas and the technology is economically feasible when calculated according to the net profit of crops produced per cubic meter of water this study only analyzed the net profit from crops produced per m3 of water when the coverage rate is 76 4 the breakeven point for this technology to be economically viable and the cost function with respect to surface area of the reservoir require further detailed research in addition other related advantages of this technology have been not considered suppressing the evaporation from an agricultural reservoir can improve the salinity of the water at the water source martínez alvarez et al 2006 maestre valero et al 2011 thereby reducing the cost of soil salinization treatment in irrigated areas the saved water from agricultural reservoirs due to sphere coverage can supplement rainwater on the basis of meeting the irrigation needs of existing irrigated areas therefore from the perspective of the sustainable development of the ecological environment the ecological benefits of this technology far exceed their economic benefits 5 3 advantages of counterweighted spheres covering reservoirs in xinjiang agricultural reservoirs contain large amounts of water surfaces of which are prone to waves this makes it necessary to not only consider the water saving efficiency of anti evaporation materials but also their stability under conditions characterized by winds and waves since 2015 the authors have observed the operation of polyvinyl chloride board ordinary spheres high density polyethylene and polyvinyl chloride and counterweighted spheres high density polyethylene in the soil and water conservation reservoir it has been observed that counterweighted spheres are ideal anti evaporation materials owing mainly to following aspects 1 in high wind and wave environments the curved structure of a sphere reduces the contact area between spheres and other objects reduces collision wear thereby enhancing material durability each sphere is lightweight and incident waves only wet small parts of their surfaces that measure less compared to the maximum horizontal area of the sphere via slight up and down movements due to wind and waves 2 under the action of non sustained winds spheres return to the water under the action of gravity they do not blow away from the reservoir area however floating boards are either scraped off the reservoir or superimposed on each other 3 an ordinary sphere would easily flip up and down easily under wind and wave actions additionally it accelerates water evaporation owing to its wetted surface being exposed to air counterweighted spheres possess their own moments of gravity owing to strong resistance to external forces compared to ordinary spheres counterweighted spheres cannot be easily flipped up and down under wind and wave actions 6 conclusions this paper presents a detailed experimental study performed to assess the effects of silver gray counterweighted spheres on evaporation and energy balance components of an agricultural reservoir as observed in this study sphere coverage alters the original microclimate near the water surface wherein 1 water surface temperature of the covered group increases 2 sphere coverage reduces both the contact area between the water surface and atmosphere as well as turbulence intensity near the water surface on the inside thereby greatly reducing the mass transfer coefficient 3 the evaporation driving force increases owing to increase in water surface temperature in the covered group these microclimate changes reduce evaporation of the water surface covered by spheres 70 6 the main reason for which can be considered the reduction in mass transfer coefficient during the irrigation period there exists a seasonal difference in evaporation reduction between march and october the evaporation reduction rate first decreases followed by a subsequent increase the lowest and highest reduction rates were observed in july 67 3 and months of march and october 73 7 and 77 0 respectively an isothermal profile was observed to prevail in the uncovered group throughout the irrigation period owing to the wind shielding effect and low thermal conductivity of spheres the stratification of water temperature in the water depth range of 0 0 30 m for the covered group was significant between april and august the observed difference between the surface temperature and that recorded by the lowest sensor was the largest in july 1 9 c in addition sphere coverage blocks radiant heat flux to the water body and transfers part of this energy to the water surface of the covered group mainly on sphere surfaces thus sphere coverage destroys the original energy balance on the water surface and establishes a new surface energy balance on the water surface compared to the uncovered group the heat storage flux being an exception several significant modifications were observed in the magnitude trend sign and relative weight of other energy components the change in sign and weight of the sensible heat flux substantially reduces the energy available for evaporation latent heat flux the proposed study analyzes the evaporation and energy balance of water reservoirs covered by counterweighted spheres from both experimental and theoretical aspects the analyzed approaches provide a solid foundation for describing and explaining the physical process for realization of a high water saving efficiency via use of counterweighted spheres from the perspectives of practical applications and based on the net profit from crops produced per cubic meter of water counterweighted spheres considered in this study are representative of an effective water saving technique for agricultural reservoirs in xinjiang declaration of

10592,climate change has already and will continue to exert a vital impact on crop yield and water use in the north china plain ncp currently this plain is facing a dilemma between groundwater depletion and grain production demand it is urgent to identify the impact of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption and then develop efficient adaptation strategies in the region in this study we used statistically downscaled daily climate data from 33 global climate models gcms and two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for 61 stations distributed across the ncp and drove the well validated apsim model to simulate crop yield and water use for two future periods of 2031 2060 2040s and 2071 2100 2080s data from all 33 gcms show an increase in annual mean temperature and almost all the gcms also show increases in annual mean solar radiation and annual total precipitation across the ncp future climate warming led to an advance in phenology for both winter wheat and summer maize two typical crops in the ncp however the length of the reproductive growth period rgp of winter wheat was prolonged while that of summer maize was shortened under future climate scenarios across the ncp our simulated results show that future climate change had negative impacts on maize yield but positive impacts on wheat yield across the ncp mainly due to the shortening of the whole growth period crop water consumption was largely decreased under future climate scenarios the amount of irrigation required was also reduced mainly due to increased precipitation and decreased et although future climate change would likely mitigate groundwater overdraft in most part of ncp some areas in the northern ncp still had groundwater over pumping in the future therefore we suggest that it might be a good choice to change cropping system for reducing planting area of water consuming crop e g winter wheat in those over pumping areas to balance groundwater use and crop yield keywords crop yield groundwater overdraft future climate change scenario apsim model north china plain 1 introduction global climate change characterized by rising temperatures in response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases has become an indisputable fact ipcc 2013 undoubtedly the change has already and will continue to exert vital impacts on agricultural production and agricultural water resources on which crop growth depends piao et al 2010 ipcc et al 2014 global food security threatened by climate change is one of the most serious challenges in the 21 st century fao et al 2013 changes in air temperature precipitation patterns and atmospheric co2 concentration co2 are key drivers of the responses of crop productivity to climate change lobell et al 2011 while many studies have focused on evaluating the effects of climate change on agriculture during the past decades liu et al 2010 wang et al 2012 tao et al 2016 the impacts of future climate change on crop production and water use have drawn world wide concern and recently they have been assessed by studies that have jointly applied crop simulation models and future climate scenarios from global climate models gcms mo et al 2009 xiong et al 2010 tao and zhang 2011 2013 dixit et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the north china plain ncp is one of the most important crop production bases in china xiao and tao 2014 the typical cropping system is a double crop rotation of winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l and the plain supplies approximately 50 of the wheat and 33 of the maize in china wang et al 2012 the ncp is a typical semi humid region with annual average rainfall ranging from 400 to 1000 mm only 20 30 of this precipitation occurs during the winter wheat growing season meng et al 2012 since natural precipitation cannot meet the water requirements of crops especially for winter wheat an average amount of more than 400 mm of supplementary irrigation for one rotation year is applied to guarantee a high and stable grain yield xiao et al 2017 groundwater is the main source for agricultural irrigation due to the lack of surface water resources in the ncp gao et al 2015 however the long term over pumping of groundwater to maintain high intensity cropping system has caused a continuous decline in groundwater table in this area especially in the northern part of the plain zhao et al 2018 of the groundwater that is exploited more than 70 is used for crop irrigation sun et al 2019 therefore the ncp is facing a dilemma between groundwater depletion and crop production demand xiao et al 2017 it is of particular concern that water shortage on the plain could develop into a major social crisis if sustainable counter measures are not implemented in the future moiwo et al 2009 climate change has exerted an important impact on crop production and agricultural water use in the ncp over the past few decades xiao and tao 2014 some studies have suggested that climate change characterized by elevated temperature accelerates the growth and development of crops and ultimately exerted an important impact on crop yields chen et al 2010 liu et al 2010 asseng et al 2015 tao et al 2016 crop growth period changes combined with climate warming will inevitably affect crop water requirement and consumption guo et al 2010 in general the impacts of climate change on crop water use is complex rising temperatures will act to increase daily crop water consumption but a shortened crop growth period will act to reduce total growing season crop water use tao and zhang 2013 therefore for the ncp which is dominated by irrigated agriculture it is urgent to determine the impact of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption in order to devise suitable adaptation options mo et al 2009 moreover quantitative estimation of spatiotemporal variability of crop yield irrigation and groundwater overdraft under the future climate change scenarios is an important basis for reasonably planning agricultural systems and managing groundwater resources in the ncp recent global climate modelling projects have provided a wealth of data about different climate scenarios to study climate change and its effects in the future flato et al 2013 process based crop models are very useful tools to assess and quantify the likely impacts of climate change as they can simultaneously consider the effects of different climatic factors and co2 on crop production gaydon et al 2017 therefore crop simulation models combined with future climate scenario data from gcms are widely used to assess crop response and adaptation to future climate change balkovic et al 2014 in this study climate simulations from 33 gcms and two representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used we firstly calibrated and validated the apsim agricultural production systems simulator model using field experiment data for winter wheat and summer maize in three representative stations the well validated apsim model was used to simulate crop yield and water use under recent baseline climate conditions and different future climate change scenarios the objectives of the study were to 1 investigate spatiotemporal changes of future climate in ncp based on multiple gcms under two rcps 2 assess the impact of future climate change on crop phenology yield irrigation water use and groundwater overdraft 3 identify the contribution of climate changes to crop yields and water use in ncp we endeavor to provide useful knowledge for those interested in understanding the effects of future climate change on irrigated agriculture and food security and to develop possible adaptation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area crop and soil data the ncp 32 17 41 03 n 112 44 122 42 e is bounded by the yan mountains in the north the taihang mountains in the west the bohai sea and yellow sea in the east and the huaihe river and the north jiangsu irrigation canal in the south fig 1 this plain has a warm and semi humid continental monsoon climate with abundant light and heat resources and precipitation concentrated in summer season june august loam of aeolian origin a soil type deposited by rivers over geological periods is the main soil type in ncp in this study we selected 61 meteorological stations which are fairly distributed across the ncp fig 1 according to the differences in climate condition the meteorological stations were grouped into three zones separated by 38 n and 35 n i e zone1 zone2 and zone3 fig 1 these zones were created to reflect differences in biophysical conditions such as climate soil and crop cultivars selected we selected three representative agro meteorological stations one for each zone tangshan station in zone1 taian station in zone2 and zhumadian station in zone3 see fig 1 for calibration and validation of apsim field experimental data at the three stations for 2001 2009 were obtained from china s meteorological administration cma detailed records included phenology sowing flowering and maturity dates grain yield and agronomic management soil profile data for the three representative stations and other investigated meteorological stations were obtained from the 1 1 million scale soil map of china included in the harmonized world soil database hwsd version 1 2 fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2012 the soil database included soil texture bulk density ph organic matter content and cation ex change capacity which were required to run the model zhang et al 2019 total nitrogen content data were obtained from the china soil database cssd http vdb3 soil csdb cn specifically the hydraulic parameters required in apsim for the three stations are shown in table s1 2 2 observed and future climate data the observed daily climate data used included maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin precipitation prec and sunshine hours all the 61 meteorological stations selected in this study have detailed daily records of these variables during 1971 2015 these data also were obtained from cma https data cma cn daily solar radiation rad which is required as an input to apsim was estimated from bright sunshine hours using the angstom prescott equation prescott 1940 as 1 r a d a b n n r a where ra is extraterrestrial rad mj m 2 d 1 n and n are actual and theoretical sunshine durations respectively the terms a and b are coefficients calibrated using observed radiation for the investigated stations tao et al 2017 gridded monthly climate data from gcms were obtained from the world climate research program s wcrp s coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 dataset taylor et al 2012 these were downscaled to daily data for the locations of the 61 stations using a statistical method the downscaling process is mainly divided into spatial downscaling and temporal downscaling firstly we interpolate monthly values of the different climate variables on the gcm grids to the site of interest using the inverse distance weighted method idw secondly we bias correct the model derived monthly data for 1961 2005 to match with the observed data zhang 2007 for each climate variable and calendar month the 61 site observations and 61 spatially interpolated gcm values are sorted separately the observed and gcm data are then paired according to their rank and plotted to yield a q q plot liu and zuo 2012 finally we disaggregated the monthly data to daily data via the modified wgen stochastic weather generator liu and zuo 2012 future climate data generated in this way have been widely used in future climate impact studies liu et al 2017a wang et al 2019 to deal with some of the uncertainties associated with gcms data from an ensemble of multiple gcms were used liu et al 2017a the gcm models and corresponding modelling centers are shown in table 1 two rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and the two future periods of 2031 2060 2040s and 2071 2100 2080s were considered in our study rcp4 5 is consistent with annual global co2 emissions that peak in around 2040 and then decline throughout the latter 21 st century and stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by the end of the century rcp8 5 is a particularly challenging scenario for adapting to climate change jones et al 2013 this is because annual greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase throughout the 21 st century leading to the highest temperature rise over the century for any of the rcps 2 3 apsim model and simulation setting the apsim model is a crop simulation model developed in australia holzworth et al 2018 this crop model is a biophysical model designed to simulate crop growth and production at the field scale apsim considers the response of crop growth to climate conditions including solar radiation temperature precipitation and co2 soil properties mainly soil water and nitrogen conditions and management practices sowing date decision cultivar selection irrigation setting nitrogen fertilization applying tillage operation and residue management apsim also integrates predictions of grain yield and biomass for many crop species in response to climate change and management practices brown et al 2018 a detailed introduction of apsim is documented on http www apsim info the apsim model has been widely calibrated and validated for various cropping system simulations under different climate conditions across the world gaydon et al 2017 to evaluate irrigation amount under past climatic conditions and different future climate scenarios in the ncp we set up the irrigation measures according to local irrigation experience xiao et al 2017 as 2 i r 0 p a w c s w today 80 mm p a w c s w today p a w c s w today 80 mm where i r is the amount of irrigation pawc is plant available water holding capacity in 0 2 m soil layer and sw today is soil water of each day in 0 2 m soil layer due to the relatively flat land in the ncp runoff after small precipitation events does not generally occur and excess water in soil surface will infiltrate into soil based on the local precipitation runoff characteristics we set crop model simulated runoff less than 50 mm to reenter the soil as irrigation if simulated runoff was above 50 mm we set the proportion of runoff to serve as irrigation xiao et al 2020 the specific calculation equation is as follows 3 i r r u n o f f r u n o f f r u n o f f 50 0 mm 87 5 r u n o f f 37 5 r u n o f f r u n o f f 50 0 mm where i r r u n o f f is the amount of irrigation from runoff groundwater overdraft od was used to evaluate the impacts of the cropping systems on groundwater the specific equation is as follows 4 o d i r d r where od is net water use from groundwater and dr is the amount of drainage water to groundwater we fitted yearly co2 values for integration into apsim simulation procedures using an empirical equation obtained by nonlinear least squares regression liu et al 2017b according to concentration pathway for each rcp scenario of cmip5 reported by the international institute for applied systems

history records for crop phenology in the ncp sowing dates of winter wheat and summer were set as table 2 for three different zones the specific harvesting times of wheat and maize were based on the crop physiological maturity dates simulated by the apsim model for the long term simulations the planting densities of winter wheat and summer maize referred to current field management and were set to 300 and 6 plants m 2 respectively for field fertilizer management about 210 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was used at sowing of winter wheat and 120 kg ha 1 at jointing stage then for summer maize 150 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was used at sowing and 90 kg ha 1 at jointing stage xiao et al 2017 apsim was run for baseline 1981 2010 and two future time periods 2031 2060 2040s and 2071 2100 2080s under two rcp rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the 61 investigated stations in the ncp finally in order to analyze the spatial characteristics of the impacts of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption in the ncp we interpolated values of the simulation variables of 61 investigated stations to the whole ncp using the inverse distance weighted method idw 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the apsim model we selected the typical cultivars in the three representative stations for the three zones table 2 the field trial data of the first 1 2 years were used to calibrate the apsim wheat and apsim maize models and remaining data from the other years were used for validation overall the model simulated and field observed dates of flowering and maturity agreed well for all investigated stations fig 2 the difference between the simulated and observed dates of flowering and maturity was on average less than 5 days furthermore the simulated yield agreed well with the observed values the average difference between the simulated and observed yields was less than 500 kg ha 1 or less than 10 of the observed values fig 2 thus the results of the apsim model simulation of wheat phenology and yield were reliable and therefore applicable the parameter values used in apsim model for winter wheat and summer maize are given in table s2 and table s3 respectively 3 2 projected climate change future period simulations were conducted using data from 33 gcms and two rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the climate variables i e tmax tmin radiation and precipitation in the ncp show obvious regional pattern for the baseline 1981 2010 fig 3 overall annual mean temperature including tmax and tmin and mean total precipitation increased from north to south while annual mean daily radiation decreased during the baseline period the annual mean tmax and tmin across the ncp were 19 1 and 8 8 c respectively and annual radiation and mean precipitation were 13 8 mj m 2 per day and 681 mm respectively fig 3a1 d1 fig 3 also shows the multi gcm ensemble mean changes in temperature radiation and precipitation for 2040s and the 2080s under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 relative to the baseline across the ncp the projected future temperatures increased the spatial mean results showed that tmax increased by 1 34 1 98 1 76 and 3 80 c and tmin rose by 1 35 2 01 1 79 and 3 91 c in the rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively fig 3a2 a5 and b2 b5 for radiation the simulations also showed increasing trends across the ncp with average radiation increasing by 1 91 and 3 99 in the 2040s and 1 66 and 3 66 in the 2080s under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 3c2 c5 the simulated precipitation showed an increasing trend in the future across the ncp precipitation increased by 9 1 14 2 10 0 and 20 4 under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively fig 3d2 d5 moreover the amount of increased radiation decreased from high latitudes to low latitudes which was opposite with spatial patterns of increased precipitation fig 3c2 c5 and d2 d5 the largest increase in maximum temperature was found in zone 2 under rcp8 5 2080s fig 4 a and the greatest increase in minimum temperature occurred in zone 1 under rcp8 5 2080s fig 4b the variation of both projected tmax and tmin was larger in 2080s than that in 2040s regardless of rcps and subregions fig 4a b by contrast zone 3 was expected to experience the largest increase in radiation under rcp8 5 2080s fig 4c while zone 1 would likely have greatest rainfall increase under rcp8 5 in 2080s fig 4d similarly the variation of projected radiation and rainfall from 33 gcms was largest under rcp8 5 by the end of 21 st century across three zones fig 4c d 3 3 phenology change under future climate change scenarios generally due to differences in climate conditions especially temperature fig 3 phenological dates of crops including winter wheat and summer maize in the northern part of the ncp were later than that in the southern part fig 5 a1 b1 and fig 6 a1 b1 future climate change has important impacts on the phenology of wheat and maize in the ncp under all the future climate scenarios the flowering and maturity dates of wheat and maize showed significant advance trends for winter wheat flower and maturity dates respectively advanced by 9 9 30 9 d and 7 4 24 9 d under future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 5a2 a5 and b2 b5 the number of days ahead of maize phenology was much lower than that of wheat flower dates of maize advanced by 3 1 6 2 d while its maturity dates shifted earlier by 6 2 12 6 d under future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 6a2 a5 and b2 b5 moreover the duration of reproductive growth period rgp was determined by the magnitude of advance in flower and maturity dates the results show that rgp of summer maize shortened by 3 1 6 4 d under future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 6c2 c5 however because the days in advance for maturity date of winter wheat were less than that for flower date rgp of winter wheat was extended by 2 6 6 0 d under future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 5c2 c5 under the future climate scenarios trends in crop phenology are similar across the three zones and the advance of winter wheat phenology is much larger than that of summer maize fig 7 for the different climate scenarios the phenology changes under rcp8 5 2080s are considerably higher than that under other three climate scenarios i e rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s and rcp8 5 2040s fig 7 3 4 yield change under future climate change scenarios under the future climate scenarios the impact of climate change on yield of winter wheat and summer maize is opposite future climate change has a positive impact on wheat yield but it has negative impact on maize yield fig 8 a2 a5 and b2 b5 the results show that the wheat yield increased by 7 7 12 0 while the maize yield decreased by 4 1 14 0 under the future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 8a2 a5 and b2 b5 although future climate change results in an increase in wheat yield across for all three zones the increase amount of wheat yield under future climate scenarios is highest in zone1 followed by zone2 and is smallest in zone3 fig 9 a moreover the positive impact of climate change on wheat yield is highest under rcp8 5 2080s in zone1 while it is biggest under rcp8 5 2040s in zone2 and zone3 multi gcm ensemble means show that wheat yield increased by 14 2 25 8 10 3 13 6 and 3 8 9 4 in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 9a for maize yield the negative impacts of future climate change are not significantly different across three zones the decrease amount of maize yield is highest under the rcp8 5 2080s across the three zones multi gcm ensemble means show that maize yield decreased by 5 4 17 2 3 5 9 8 and 4 9 19 7 in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 9b we used regression analysis to reflect the relationship between crop maize and wheat yield change and climatic variables change including radiation mean temperature precipitation and co2 all the value of determination coefficient r2 was above 0 65 as the regression coefficient show in table 3 both of maize and wheat yields were significantly positively correlated with solar radiation precipitation and co2 across the three zones while maize yield was significantly negatively correlated with temperature wheat yield was significantly positively correlated with temperature table 3 3 5 water use change under future climate change scenarios averaged across the ncp the simulated amount of water use for rotation of wheat and maize i e annual et during the baseline fig 10 a1 is about 793 mm though higher in the southern part of the plain than in the northern part ncp average et significantly decreased in the future relative to baseline and is 772 765 756 and 692 mm under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively fig 10a2 a5 due to higher et and less precipitation irrigation water requirement in the northern part of the ncp is significantly greater than that in the southern part the amount of irrigation across the ncp is 317 mm in the baseline and it declined to 189 279 mm under the future climate change scenarios fig 10b1 b5 in the baseline the amount of drainage for recharging groundwater was about 196 mm across the ncp and it considerably increased to 237 295 mm under the different future climate change scenarios fig 10c1 c5 in the ncp the overdraft of groundwater shows an obvious spatial pattern in the baseline in the northern part of the ncp the amount of overdraft is more than 300 mm but there is no overdraft and could recharge groundwater in the southern part of ncp fig 10d1 d5 in the future since the irrigation decreased and drainage increased the overdraft of groundwater is significantly declined the amount of overdraft is 42 2 and 19 mm under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s and rcp8 5 2040s respectively and it even could recharge the groundwater by 106 mm under rcp8 5 2080s across the ncp fig 10d2 d5 moreover under future climate change scenarios the place where the overdraft occurred is still in the northern part of the ncp but the area was declined fig 10d2 d5 as shown in fig 11 in all three zones water use changed significantly under all the future climate change scenarios considered with by far the biggest changes occurring under rcp8 5 2080s as shown in fig 11a the et was significantly decreased multi gcm ensemble means show that irrigation decreased by 21 117 mm 19 108 mm and 16 73 mm in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 11a similar to et the amount of irrigation declined considerably multi gcm ensemble means show that irrigation decreased by 42 143 mm 38 135 mm and 26 90 mm in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 11b the amount of drainage was increased fig 11c as a result the overdraft of groundwater declined significantly multi gcm ensemble means show that overdraft decreased by 87 248 mm 76 227 mm and 73 208 mm in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 11d as shown in table 4 the amounts of et irrigation and groundwater overdraft were significantly positively correlated with solar radiation but significantly negatively correlated with mean temperature and co2 moreover et was significantly positively correlated with precipitation while irrigation and overdraft were significantly negatively correlated with precipitation table 4 the value of determination coefficients r2 for all regression equations were above 0 71 table 4 4 discussions 4 1 impact of future climate change on crop phenology and yield data from all 33 gcms show an increase in annual mean temperature and almost all the gcms also show increases in annual mean solar radiation and precipitation across the ncp in the future such changes would be expected to impact crop growth generally elevated temperatures tend to accelerate crop growth and lead to shorter crop growth periods asseng et al 2015 in this study the future climate warming directly leads to the flower and maturity dates of crops occurring in earlier in the year but the degree of advance of winter wheat phenology is much greater than that of summer maize the main reason may be due to the warming of winter which significantly shortens the dormancy period of winter wheat tao et al 2014 however the rgps of winter wheat and summer maize showed opposite trends under the future climate change scenarios while the rgp of summer maize is shortened due to future climate change that of winter wheat is prolonged the main reason is that earlier flowering leads the rgp of winter wheat to occur under lower temperatures xiao et al 2013 generally accelerated crop growth exerts a negative impact on crop yield xiao and tao 2014 2016 asseng et al 2015 in this study future climate change had quite different effects on the yield of winter wheat and summer maize tao and zhang 2011 2013 gcm ensemble mean data show wheat yield increasing 3 8 25 8 but maize yield decreasing by 3 5 19 7 across the ncp under the future climate scenarios respectively this is consistent with the prolonged rgp for winter wheat and reduced rgp for maize our findings are consistent with the positive effects of increased tmin on the wheat yield based on observed data from tao et al 2017 furthermore tao and zhang 2011 also found maize yield without adaptation would decrease by 13 2 19 1 in the ncp under future climate change in addition our regression models show that changes in other climate variables i e radiation precipitation and co2 had greater positive impacts on yield for wheat than for maize table 2 the sensitivity of wheat yield to radiation temperature and rainfall increases decreased from zone1 in the north of the ncp to zone3 in the south table 2 and hence zone1 showed the greatest future increase in wheat yield for example when growing season temperature increase by 1 c wheat yield would increase by 917 236 and 141 kg ha 1 in zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively table 2 the wheat yield benefits from warming temperature in zone1 are highest because the temperature in zone1 during baseline period is lower and less optimal for the wheat crop than in zone2 and zone3 conversely the increase in temperature has a negative effect on maize in the ncp as shown in table 2 if the mean temperature during maize growth period rise by 1 c the yields of maize decrease by 490 564 and 642 kg ha 1 in zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively solar radiation is the source of energy for crop growth and its changes are important for crop yields according to the regression equation table 2 for every 1 mj m 2 increase in radiation the yield of maize and wheat increased by 17 6 and 45 1 kg ha 1 respectively therefore increased solar radiation under future climate scenarios will benefit crop yield via increases photosynthesis crop yield benefit from increase radiation could mitigate some negative effects of other climate factors xiao and tao 2014 elevated atmospheric co2 might boost crop yield by improving the rate of photosynthesis ainsworth and long 2005 kheir et al 2019 our regression analyses in this study suggested that rising co2 contributed notably to crop yield table 3 however as a c3 crop the response of wheat yield to elevated co2 was much greater than that of maize c4 crop table 2 these results are similar to the findings by free air carbon dioxide enrichment experiments which indicate that yields increase by 10 25 for c3 crops such as wheat and by 0 10 for c4 crops such as maize when co2 reach 550 ppm without other stressed conditions ipcc 2007 tao and zhang 2011 overall considering the positive response of wheat yield and negative response of maize yield to climate change in the future it can be found that wheat will be more efficient in the future 4 2 impact of future climate change on crop water use due to different climatic and environmental conditions fig 3 the amount of crop evapotranspiration et in the northern part of the ncp is significantly greater than that in the south in addition precipitation in the north of the ncp is less than that in the south therefore the irrigation water requirement in the north is much larger than in the south and the groundwater overdraft in the north is far more serious than in the south yuan and shen 2013 the simulation results in this study show the groundwater overdraft in the north reaching more than 300 mm fig 10d1 whereas there is no groundwater over pumping in some parts of the south a significant decrease in crop water consumption et is shown for almost all gcms rcps time periods and zones within the ncp generally the increasing temperature will act to increase daily crop water consumption however our regression models show that warming temperature would reduce the crop et over the year table 3 the main reason for this may be the shortening of the crop growth length due to warming temperature under the future climate change mo et al 2009 moreover elevated co2 could reduce stomatal conductance and subsequently reduce et ainsworth and long 2005 there is a significant negative correlation between co2 and et table 3 due to the reduction of crop water consumption i e et the amount of irrigation during the crop growth period under the future climate scenarios is also significantly reduced moreover precipitation as an important climate factor to determine crop water consumption increased across the ncp in the future from the majority of gcms tao and zhang 2011 also noted the precipitation would rise in the 2050s in the ncp projected by previous ipcc accessment report therefore the decrease in irrigation in the future should be attributed to the combined effect of increased precipitation and shortened growth period it is vital for a sustainable agricultural water management to explicitly quantify the groundwater consumption for crops in the ncp in the future xiao et al 2017 as the amount of irrigation reduces the amount of groundwater overdraft across the ncp will decrease under future climate scenarios however although groundwater overdraft under the conventional double cropping system will be mitigated in the ncp under the future climate scenario groundwater over pumping still exists in parts of the northern part of the ncp fig 10 therefore we need to change the current cropping system and to some extent reduce the cultivation of water consuming crops i e winter wheat to achieve sustainable use of agricultural water resources in these over exploited areas of ncp xiao et al 2017 4 3 uncertainty and limitation of the study the joint application of crop models and future climate data is an important approach to assess the impacts of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption liu et al 2017a b however there are uncertainties in future climate conditions related to imperfections in gcms future greenhouse gas emissions and other factors to address such uncertainties previous studies have run impact assessment models e g crop model hydrological model etc with future climate data from multiple gcms for multiple emissions scenario liu et al 2017a wang et al 2017 dixit et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in this study 33 gcms and two rcps were used to explore uncertainties in future climate conditions though we do not claim to have explored this uncertainty fully for example our sampling of uncertainty may be limited by our use of a single downscaling method and by imperfections common to all 33 gcms generally crop models can simulate grain yield and other yield components accurately under diverse environments if input information data is enough asseng et al 2019 for example the apsim model has been shown to accurately reflect grain yield under various environments chen et al 2010 wang et al 2012 xiao and tao 2014 however simulated future yields is likely to be overestimated because the model does not fully consider the yield loss caused by weeds pests diseases and the effects of extreme weather events such as heat waves and drought wang et al 2017 moreover the uncertainty for the response of crops to climate change may also result from different model structures and parameters values tao et al 2018 these impact uncertainties can be better quantified through use of multi crop model ensembles asseng et al 2019 however selecting a set of crop models does not reduce uncertainty in assessing climate change impacts we can only reduce these impact uncertainties by improving the relationship between crop growth and climatic factors temperature co2 etc in the crop model itself in the future asseng et al 2019 our simulation was undertaken at a multi decadal timescale on the assumption that adaptation to climate changes do not take place in our study the sowing date crop cultivars and fertilization management were assumed to be constant during the historical baseline and future period although automatic application of irrigation including irrigation times and irrigation amount was considered however the adaptation measures need to be considered in the future to test their capacity to cope with climate change in ncp xiao and tao 2014 these could include the selection of new crop varieties such as heat or drought tolerant cultivars and later maturing cultivar xiao et al 2020 these could play an important role in adapting cropping to climate change tao et al 2018 wang et al 2019 for example asseng et al 2019 indicated that introducing genotypes adapted to climate change warming temperature and changing in co2 and precipitation could boost global wheat yield by 7 5 conclusions in this study we adopted a crop simulation model combined with future climate data downscaled from 33 gcms to simulate changes in crop yield and water use in response to different future climate scenarios the results showed that crop phenology yield and water use are affected by future climate change across the ncp although the extent of impact is different in different locations overall future climate change exerted negative impacts on maize yield but had a positive impact on wheat yield across the ncp moreover the amount of irrigation and groundwater overdraft reduced under future climate scenarios mainly due to increased precipitation and decreased et as the simulated results in this study from the prospective of climate change increased precipitation and elevated co2 sowing wheat would be a good choice as it requires less irrigation in the future however groundwater overdraft still exists in the northern part of the ncp under the conventional double cropping system although the overdraft will be largely mitigated under the future climate scenario therefore we should change cropping system in those over pumping areas to reduce and even eliminate the occurrence of groundwater overdraft our results about future climate change and their implications for crop production will be important for policy makers to make future agricultural sustainable development strategy and water resources planning we have no financial and

10592,climate change has already and will continue to exert a vital impact on crop yield and water use in the north china plain ncp currently this plain is facing a dilemma between groundwater depletion and grain production demand it is urgent to identify the impact of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption and then develop efficient adaptation strategies in the region in this study we used statistically downscaled daily climate data from 33 global climate models gcms and two representative concentration pathways rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 for 61 stations distributed across the ncp and drove the well validated apsim model to simulate crop yield and water use for two future periods of 2031 2060 2040s and 2071 2100 2080s data from all 33 gcms show an increase in annual mean temperature and almost all the gcms also show increases in annual mean solar radiation and annual total precipitation across the ncp future climate warming led to an advance in phenology for both winter wheat and summer maize two typical crops in the ncp however the length of the reproductive growth period rgp of winter wheat was prolonged while that of summer maize was shortened under future climate scenarios across the ncp our simulated results show that future climate change had negative impacts on maize yield but positive impacts on wheat yield across the ncp mainly due to the shortening of the whole growth period crop water consumption was largely decreased under future climate scenarios the amount of irrigation required was also reduced mainly due to increased precipitation and decreased et although future climate change would likely mitigate groundwater overdraft in most part of ncp some areas in the northern ncp still had groundwater over pumping in the future therefore we suggest that it might be a good choice to change cropping system for reducing planting area of water consuming crop e g winter wheat in those over pumping areas to balance groundwater use and crop yield keywords crop yield groundwater overdraft future climate change scenario apsim model north china plain 1 introduction global climate change characterized by rising temperatures in response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases has become an indisputable fact ipcc 2013 undoubtedly the change has already and will continue to exert vital impacts on agricultural production and agricultural water resources on which crop growth depends piao et al 2010 ipcc et al 2014 global food security threatened by climate change is one of the most serious challenges in the 21 st century fao et al 2013 changes in air temperature precipitation patterns and atmospheric co2 concentration co2 are key drivers of the responses of crop productivity to climate change lobell et al 2011 while many studies have focused on evaluating the effects of climate change on agriculture during the past decades liu et al 2010 wang et al 2012 tao et al 2016 the impacts of future climate change on crop production and water use have drawn world wide concern and recently they have been assessed by studies that have jointly applied crop simulation models and future climate scenarios from global climate models gcms mo et al 2009 xiong et al 2010 tao and zhang 2011 2013 dixit et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 the north china plain ncp is one of the most important crop production bases in china xiao and tao 2014 the typical cropping system is a double crop rotation of winter wheat triticum aestivum l and summer maize zea mays l and the plain supplies approximately 50 of the wheat and 33 of the maize in china wang et al 2012 the ncp is a typical semi humid region with annual average rainfall ranging from 400 to 1000 mm only 20 30 of this precipitation occurs during the winter wheat growing season meng et al 2012 since natural precipitation cannot meet the water requirements of crops especially for winter wheat an average amount of more than 400 mm of supplementary irrigation for one rotation year is applied to guarantee a high and stable grain yield xiao et al 2017 groundwater is the main source for agricultural irrigation due to the lack of surface water resources in the ncp gao et al 2015 however the long term over pumping of groundwater to maintain high intensity cropping system has caused a continuous decline in groundwater table in this area especially in the northern part of the plain zhao et al 2018 of the groundwater that is exploited more than 70 is used for crop irrigation sun et al 2019 therefore the ncp is facing a dilemma between groundwater depletion and crop production demand xiao et al 2017 it is of particular concern that water shortage on the plain could develop into a major social crisis if sustainable counter measures are not implemented in the future moiwo et al 2009 climate change has exerted an important impact on crop production and agricultural water use in the ncp over the past few decades xiao and tao 2014 some studies have suggested that climate change characterized by elevated temperature accelerates the growth and development of crops and ultimately exerted an important impact on crop yields chen et al 2010 liu et al 2010 asseng et al 2015 tao et al 2016 crop growth period changes combined with climate warming will inevitably affect crop water requirement and consumption guo et al 2010 in general the impacts of climate change on crop water use is complex rising temperatures will act to increase daily crop water consumption but a shortened crop growth period will act to reduce total growing season crop water use tao and zhang 2013 therefore for the ncp which is dominated by irrigated agriculture it is urgent to determine the impact of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption in order to devise suitable adaptation options mo et al 2009 moreover quantitative estimation of spatiotemporal variability of crop yield irrigation and groundwater overdraft under the future climate change scenarios is an important basis for reasonably planning agricultural systems and managing groundwater resources in the ncp recent global climate modelling projects have provided a wealth of data about different climate scenarios to study climate change and its effects in the future flato et al 2013 process based crop models are very useful tools to assess and quantify the likely impacts of climate change as they can simultaneously consider the effects of different climatic factors and co2 on crop production gaydon et al 2017 therefore crop simulation models combined with future climate scenario data from gcms are widely used to assess crop response and adaptation to future climate change balkovic et al 2014 in this study climate simulations from 33 gcms and two representative concentration pathways rcps moss et al 2010 rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 were used we firstly calibrated and validated the apsim agricultural production systems simulator model using field experiment data for winter wheat and summer maize in three representative stations the well validated apsim model was used to simulate crop yield and water use under recent baseline climate conditions and different future climate change scenarios the objectives of the study were to 1 investigate spatiotemporal changes of future climate in ncp based on multiple gcms under two rcps 2 assess the impact of future climate change on crop phenology yield irrigation water use and groundwater overdraft 3 identify the contribution of climate changes to crop yields and water use in ncp we endeavor to provide useful knowledge for those interested in understanding the effects of future climate change on irrigated agriculture and food security and to develop possible adaptation strategies 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area crop and soil data the ncp 32 17 41 03 n 112 44 122 42 e is bounded by the yan mountains in the north the taihang mountains in the west the bohai sea and yellow sea in the east and the huaihe river and the north jiangsu irrigation canal in the south fig 1 this plain has a warm and semi humid continental monsoon climate with abundant light and heat resources and precipitation concentrated in summer season june august loam of aeolian origin a soil type deposited by rivers over geological periods is the main soil type in ncp in this study we selected 61 meteorological stations which are fairly distributed across the ncp fig 1 according to the differences in climate condition the meteorological stations were grouped into three zones separated by 38 n and 35 n i e zone1 zone2 and zone3 fig 1 these zones were created to reflect differences in biophysical conditions such as climate soil and crop cultivars selected we selected three representative agro meteorological stations one for each zone tangshan station in zone1 taian station in zone2 and zhumadian station in zone3 see fig 1 for calibration and validation of apsim field experimental data at the three stations for 2001 2009 were obtained from china s meteorological administration cma detailed records included phenology sowing flowering and maturity dates grain yield and agronomic management soil profile data for the three representative stations and other investigated meteorological stations were obtained from the 1 1 million scale soil map of china included in the harmonized world soil database hwsd version 1 2 fao iiasa isric iss cas jrc 2012 the soil database included soil texture bulk density ph organic matter content and cation ex change capacity which were required to run the model zhang et al 2019 total nitrogen content data were obtained from the china soil database cssd http vdb3 soil csdb cn specifically the hydraulic parameters required in apsim for the three stations are shown in table s1 2 2 observed and future climate data the observed daily climate data used included maximum temperature tmax minimum temperature tmin precipitation prec and sunshine hours all the 61 meteorological stations selected in this study have detailed daily records of these variables during 1971 2015 these data also were obtained from cma https data cma cn daily solar radiation rad which is required as an input to apsim was estimated from bright sunshine hours using the angstom prescott equation prescott 1940 as 1 r a d a b n n r a where ra is extraterrestrial rad mj m 2 d 1 n and n are actual and theoretical sunshine durations respectively the terms a and b are coefficients calibrated using observed radiation for the investigated stations tao et al 2017 gridded monthly climate data from gcms were obtained from the world climate research program s wcrp s coupled model inter comparison project phase 5 cmip5 dataset taylor et al 2012 these were downscaled to daily data for the locations of the 61 stations using a statistical method the downscaling process is mainly divided into spatial downscaling and temporal downscaling firstly we interpolate monthly values of the different climate variables on the gcm grids to the site of interest using the inverse distance weighted method idw secondly we bias correct the model derived monthly data for 1961 2005 to match with the observed data zhang 2007 for each climate variable and calendar month the 61 site observations and 61 spatially interpolated gcm values are sorted separately the observed and gcm data are then paired according to their rank and plotted to yield a q q plot liu and zuo 2012 finally we disaggregated the monthly data to daily data via the modified wgen stochastic weather generator liu and zuo 2012 future climate data generated in this way have been widely used in future climate impact studies liu et al 2017a wang et al 2019 to deal with some of the uncertainties associated with gcms data from an ensemble of multiple gcms were used liu et al 2017a the gcm models and corresponding modelling centers are shown in table 1 two rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 and the two future periods of 2031 2060 2040s and 2071 2100 2080s were considered in our study rcp4 5 is consistent with annual global co2 emissions that peak in around 2040 and then decline throughout the latter 21 st century and stabilization of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations by the end of the century rcp8 5 is a particularly challenging scenario for adapting to climate change jones et al 2013 this is because annual greenhouse gas emissions continue to increase throughout the 21 st century leading to the highest temperature rise over the century for any of the rcps 2 3 apsim model and simulation setting the apsim model is a crop simulation model developed in australia holzworth et al 2018 this crop model is a biophysical model designed to simulate crop growth and production at the field scale apsim considers the response of crop growth to climate conditions including solar radiation temperature precipitation and co2 soil properties mainly soil water and nitrogen conditions and management practices sowing date decision cultivar selection irrigation setting nitrogen fertilization applying tillage operation and residue management apsim also integrates predictions of grain yield and biomass for many crop species in response to climate change and management practices brown et al 2018 a detailed introduction of apsim is documented on http www apsim info the apsim model has been widely calibrated and validated for various cropping system simulations under different climate conditions across the world gaydon et al 2017 to evaluate irrigation amount under past climatic conditions and different future climate scenarios in the ncp we set up the irrigation measures according to local irrigation experience xiao et al 2017 as 2 i r 0 p a w c s w today 80 mm p a w c s w today p a w c s w today 80 mm where i r is the amount of irrigation pawc is plant available water holding capacity in 0 2 m soil layer and sw today is soil water of each day in 0 2 m soil layer due to the relatively flat land in the ncp runoff after small precipitation events does not generally occur and excess water in soil surface will infiltrate into soil based on the local precipitation runoff characteristics we set crop model simulated runoff less than 50 mm to reenter the soil as irrigation if simulated runoff was above 50 mm we set the proportion of runoff to serve as irrigation xiao et al 2020 the specific calculation equation is as follows 3 i r r u n o f f r u n o f f r u n o f f 50 0 mm 87 5 r u n o f f 37 5 r u n o f f r u n o f f 50 0 mm where i r r u n o f f is the amount of irrigation from runoff groundwater overdraft od was used to evaluate the impacts of the cropping systems on groundwater the specific equation is as follows 4 o d i r d r where od is net water use from groundwater and dr is the amount of drainage water to groundwater we fitted yearly co2 values for integration into apsim simulation procedures using an empirical equation obtained by nonlinear least squares regression liu et al 2017b according to concentration pathway for each rcp scenario of cmip5 reported by the international institute for applied systems

history records for crop phenology in the ncp sowing dates of winter wheat and summer were set as table 2 for three different zones the specific harvesting times of wheat and maize were based on the crop physiological maturity dates simulated by the apsim model for the long term simulations the planting densities of winter wheat and summer maize referred to current field management and were set to 300 and 6 plants m 2 respectively for field fertilizer management about 210 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was used at sowing of winter wheat and 120 kg ha 1 at jointing stage then for summer maize 150 kg ha 1 of n fertilizer was used at sowing and 90 kg ha 1 at jointing stage xiao et al 2017 apsim was run for baseline 1981 2010 and two future time periods 2031 2060 2040s and 2071 2100 2080s under two rcp rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 scenarios in the 61 investigated stations in the ncp finally in order to analyze the spatial characteristics of the impacts of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption in the ncp we interpolated values of the simulation variables of 61 investigated stations to the whole ncp using the inverse distance weighted method idw 3 results 3 1 calibration and validation of the apsim model we selected the typical cultivars in the three representative stations for the three zones table 2 the field trial data of the first 1 2 years were used to calibrate the apsim wheat and apsim maize models and remaining data from the other years were used for validation overall the model simulated and field observed dates of flowering and maturity agreed well for all investigated stations fig 2 the difference between the simulated and observed dates of flowering and maturity was on average less than 5 days furthermore the simulated yield agreed well with the observed values the average difference between the simulated and observed yields was less than 500 kg ha 1 or less than 10 of the observed values fig 2 thus the results of the apsim model simulation of wheat phenology and yield were reliable and therefore applicable the parameter values used in apsim model for winter wheat and summer maize are given in table s2 and table s3 respectively 3 2 projected climate change future period simulations were conducted using data from 33 gcms and two rcps rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 the climate variables i e tmax tmin radiation and precipitation in the ncp show obvious regional pattern for the baseline 1981 2010 fig 3 overall annual mean temperature including tmax and tmin and mean total precipitation increased from north to south while annual mean daily radiation decreased during the baseline period the annual mean tmax and tmin across the ncp were 19 1 and 8 8 c respectively and annual radiation and mean precipitation were 13 8 mj m 2 per day and 681 mm respectively fig 3a1 d1 fig 3 also shows the multi gcm ensemble mean changes in temperature radiation and precipitation for 2040s and the 2080s under rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 relative to the baseline across the ncp the projected future temperatures increased the spatial mean results showed that tmax increased by 1 34 1 98 1 76 and 3 80 c and tmin rose by 1 35 2 01 1 79 and 3 91 c in the rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively fig 3a2 a5 and b2 b5 for radiation the simulations also showed increasing trends across the ncp with average radiation increasing by 1 91 and 3 99 in the 2040s and 1 66 and 3 66 in the 2080s under the rcp4 5 and rcp8 5 respectively fig 3c2 c5 the simulated precipitation showed an increasing trend in the future across the ncp precipitation increased by 9 1 14 2 10 0 and 20 4 under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively fig 3d2 d5 moreover the amount of increased radiation decreased from high latitudes to low latitudes which was opposite with spatial patterns of increased precipitation fig 3c2 c5 and d2 d5 the largest increase in maximum temperature was found in zone 2 under rcp8 5 2080s fig 4 a and the greatest increase in minimum temperature occurred in zone 1 under rcp8 5 2080s fig 4b the variation of both projected tmax and tmin was larger in 2080s than that in 2040s regardless of rcps and subregions fig 4a b by contrast zone 3 was expected to experience the largest increase in radiation under rcp8 5 2080s fig 4c while zone 1 would likely have greatest rainfall increase under rcp8 5 in 2080s fig 4d similarly the variation of projected radiation and rainfall from 33 gcms was largest under rcp8 5 by the end of 21 st century across three zones fig 4c d 3 3 phenology change under future climate change scenarios generally due to differences in climate conditions especially temperature fig 3 phenological dates of crops including winter wheat and summer maize in the northern part of the ncp were later than that in the southern part fig 5 a1 b1 and fig 6 a1 b1 future climate change has important impacts on the phenology of wheat and maize in the ncp under all the future climate scenarios the flowering and maturity dates of wheat and maize showed significant advance trends for winter wheat flower and maturity dates respectively advanced by 9 9 30 9 d and 7 4 24 9 d under future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 5a2 a5 and b2 b5 the number of days ahead of maize phenology was much lower than that of wheat flower dates of maize advanced by 3 1 6 2 d while its maturity dates shifted earlier by 6 2 12 6 d under future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 6a2 a5 and b2 b5 moreover the duration of reproductive growth period rgp was determined by the magnitude of advance in flower and maturity dates the results show that rgp of summer maize shortened by 3 1 6 4 d under future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 6c2 c5 however because the days in advance for maturity date of winter wheat were less than that for flower date rgp of winter wheat was extended by 2 6 6 0 d under future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 5c2 c5 under the future climate scenarios trends in crop phenology are similar across the three zones and the advance of winter wheat phenology is much larger than that of summer maize fig 7 for the different climate scenarios the phenology changes under rcp8 5 2080s are considerably higher than that under other three climate scenarios i e rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s and rcp8 5 2040s fig 7 3 4 yield change under future climate change scenarios under the future climate scenarios the impact of climate change on yield of winter wheat and summer maize is opposite future climate change has a positive impact on wheat yield but it has negative impact on maize yield fig 8 a2 a5 and b2 b5 the results show that the wheat yield increased by 7 7 12 0 while the maize yield decreased by 4 1 14 0 under the future climate scenarios across the ncp fig 8a2 a5 and b2 b5 although future climate change results in an increase in wheat yield across for all three zones the increase amount of wheat yield under future climate scenarios is highest in zone1 followed by zone2 and is smallest in zone3 fig 9 a moreover the positive impact of climate change on wheat yield is highest under rcp8 5 2080s in zone1 while it is biggest under rcp8 5 2040s in zone2 and zone3 multi gcm ensemble means show that wheat yield increased by 14 2 25 8 10 3 13 6 and 3 8 9 4 in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 9a for maize yield the negative impacts of future climate change are not significantly different across three zones the decrease amount of maize yield is highest under the rcp8 5 2080s across the three zones multi gcm ensemble means show that maize yield decreased by 5 4 17 2 3 5 9 8 and 4 9 19 7 in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 9b we used regression analysis to reflect the relationship between crop maize and wheat yield change and climatic variables change including radiation mean temperature precipitation and co2 all the value of determination coefficient r2 was above 0 65 as the regression coefficient show in table 3 both of maize and wheat yields were significantly positively correlated with solar radiation precipitation and co2 across the three zones while maize yield was significantly negatively correlated with temperature wheat yield was significantly positively correlated with temperature table 3 3 5 water use change under future climate change scenarios averaged across the ncp the simulated amount of water use for rotation of wheat and maize i e annual et during the baseline fig 10 a1 is about 793 mm though higher in the southern part of the plain than in the northern part ncp average et significantly decreased in the future relative to baseline and is 772 765 756 and 692 mm under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s rcp8 5 2040s and rcp8 5 2080s respectively fig 10a2 a5 due to higher et and less precipitation irrigation water requirement in the northern part of the ncp is significantly greater than that in the southern part the amount of irrigation across the ncp is 317 mm in the baseline and it declined to 189 279 mm under the future climate change scenarios fig 10b1 b5 in the baseline the amount of drainage for recharging groundwater was about 196 mm across the ncp and it considerably increased to 237 295 mm under the different future climate change scenarios fig 10c1 c5 in the ncp the overdraft of groundwater shows an obvious spatial pattern in the baseline in the northern part of the ncp the amount of overdraft is more than 300 mm but there is no overdraft and could recharge groundwater in the southern part of ncp fig 10d1 d5 in the future since the irrigation decreased and drainage increased the overdraft of groundwater is significantly declined the amount of overdraft is 42 2 and 19 mm under rcp4 5 2040s rcp4 5 2080s and rcp8 5 2040s respectively and it even could recharge the groundwater by 106 mm under rcp8 5 2080s across the ncp fig 10d2 d5 moreover under future climate change scenarios the place where the overdraft occurred is still in the northern part of the ncp but the area was declined fig 10d2 d5 as shown in fig 11 in all three zones water use changed significantly under all the future climate change scenarios considered with by far the biggest changes occurring under rcp8 5 2080s as shown in fig 11a the et was significantly decreased multi gcm ensemble means show that irrigation decreased by 21 117 mm 19 108 mm and 16 73 mm in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 11a similar to et the amount of irrigation declined considerably multi gcm ensemble means show that irrigation decreased by 42 143 mm 38 135 mm and 26 90 mm in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 11b the amount of drainage was increased fig 11c as a result the overdraft of groundwater declined significantly multi gcm ensemble means show that overdraft decreased by 87 248 mm 76 227 mm and 73 208 mm in the zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively fig 11d as shown in table 4 the amounts of et irrigation and groundwater overdraft were significantly positively correlated with solar radiation but significantly negatively correlated with mean temperature and co2 moreover et was significantly positively correlated with precipitation while irrigation and overdraft were significantly negatively correlated with precipitation table 4 the value of determination coefficients r2 for all regression equations were above 0 71 table 4 4 discussions 4 1 impact of future climate change on crop phenology and yield data from all 33 gcms show an increase in annual mean temperature and almost all the gcms also show increases in annual mean solar radiation and precipitation across the ncp in the future such changes would be expected to impact crop growth generally elevated temperatures tend to accelerate crop growth and lead to shorter crop growth periods asseng et al 2015 in this study the future climate warming directly leads to the flower and maturity dates of crops occurring in earlier in the year but the degree of advance of winter wheat phenology is much greater than that of summer maize the main reason may be due to the warming of winter which significantly shortens the dormancy period of winter wheat tao et al 2014 however the rgps of winter wheat and summer maize showed opposite trends under the future climate change scenarios while the rgp of summer maize is shortened due to future climate change that of winter wheat is prolonged the main reason is that earlier flowering leads the rgp of winter wheat to occur under lower temperatures xiao et al 2013 generally accelerated crop growth exerts a negative impact on crop yield xiao and tao 2014 2016 asseng et al 2015 in this study future climate change had quite different effects on the yield of winter wheat and summer maize tao and zhang 2011 2013 gcm ensemble mean data show wheat yield increasing 3 8 25 8 but maize yield decreasing by 3 5 19 7 across the ncp under the future climate scenarios respectively this is consistent with the prolonged rgp for winter wheat and reduced rgp for maize our findings are consistent with the positive effects of increased tmin on the wheat yield based on observed data from tao et al 2017 furthermore tao and zhang 2011 also found maize yield without adaptation would decrease by 13 2 19 1 in the ncp under future climate change in addition our regression models show that changes in other climate variables i e radiation precipitation and co2 had greater positive impacts on yield for wheat than for maize table 2 the sensitivity of wheat yield to radiation temperature and rainfall increases decreased from zone1 in the north of the ncp to zone3 in the south table 2 and hence zone1 showed the greatest future increase in wheat yield for example when growing season temperature increase by 1 c wheat yield would increase by 917 236 and 141 kg ha 1 in zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively table 2 the wheat yield benefits from warming temperature in zone1 are highest because the temperature in zone1 during baseline period is lower and less optimal for the wheat crop than in zone2 and zone3 conversely the increase in temperature has a negative effect on maize in the ncp as shown in table 2 if the mean temperature during maize growth period rise by 1 c the yields of maize decrease by 490 564 and 642 kg ha 1 in zone1 zone2 and zone3 respectively solar radiation is the source of energy for crop growth and its changes are important for crop yields according to the regression equation table 2 for every 1 mj m 2 increase in radiation the yield of maize and wheat increased by 17 6 and 45 1 kg ha 1 respectively therefore increased solar radiation under future climate scenarios will benefit crop yield via increases photosynthesis crop yield benefit from increase radiation could mitigate some negative effects of other climate factors xiao and tao 2014 elevated atmospheric co2 might boost crop yield by improving the rate of photosynthesis ainsworth and long 2005 kheir et al 2019 our regression analyses in this study suggested that rising co2 contributed notably to crop yield table 3 however as a c3 crop the response of wheat yield to elevated co2 was much greater than that of maize c4 crop table 2 these results are similar to the findings by free air carbon dioxide enrichment experiments which indicate that yields increase by 10 25 for c3 crops such as wheat and by 0 10 for c4 crops such as maize when co2 reach 550 ppm without other stressed conditions ipcc 2007 tao and zhang 2011 overall considering the positive response of wheat yield and negative response of maize yield to climate change in the future it can be found that wheat will be more efficient in the future 4 2 impact of future climate change on crop water use due to different climatic and environmental conditions fig 3 the amount of crop evapotranspiration et in the northern part of the ncp is significantly greater than that in the south in addition precipitation in the north of the ncp is less than that in the south therefore the irrigation water requirement in the north is much larger than in the south and the groundwater overdraft in the north is far more serious than in the south yuan and shen 2013 the simulation results in this study show the groundwater overdraft in the north reaching more than 300 mm fig 10d1 whereas there is no groundwater over pumping in some parts of the south a significant decrease in crop water consumption et is shown for almost all gcms rcps time periods and zones within the ncp generally the increasing temperature will act to increase daily crop water consumption however our regression models show that warming temperature would reduce the crop et over the year table 3 the main reason for this may be the shortening of the crop growth length due to warming temperature under the future climate change mo et al 2009 moreover elevated co2 could reduce stomatal conductance and subsequently reduce et ainsworth and long 2005 there is a significant negative correlation between co2 and et table 3 due to the reduction of crop water consumption i e et the amount of irrigation during the crop growth period under the future climate scenarios is also significantly reduced moreover precipitation as an important climate factor to determine crop water consumption increased across the ncp in the future from the majority of gcms tao and zhang 2011 also noted the precipitation would rise in the 2050s in the ncp projected by previous ipcc accessment report therefore the decrease in irrigation in the future should be attributed to the combined effect of increased precipitation and shortened growth period it is vital for a sustainable agricultural water management to explicitly quantify the groundwater consumption for crops in the ncp in the future xiao et al 2017 as the amount of irrigation reduces the amount of groundwater overdraft across the ncp will decrease under future climate scenarios however although groundwater overdraft under the conventional double cropping system will be mitigated in the ncp under the future climate scenario groundwater over pumping still exists in parts of the northern part of the ncp fig 10 therefore we need to change the current cropping system and to some extent reduce the cultivation of water consuming crops i e winter wheat to achieve sustainable use of agricultural water resources in these over exploited areas of ncp xiao et al 2017 4 3 uncertainty and limitation of the study the joint application of crop models and future climate data is an important approach to assess the impacts of future climate change on crop yield and water consumption liu et al 2017a b however there are uncertainties in future climate conditions related to imperfections in gcms future greenhouse gas emissions and other factors to address such uncertainties previous studies have run impact assessment models e g crop model hydrological model etc with future climate data from multiple gcms for multiple emissions scenario liu et al 2017a wang et al 2017 dixit et al 2018 zhang et al 2019 in this study 33 gcms and two rcps were used to explore uncertainties in future climate conditions though we do not claim to have explored this uncertainty fully for example our sampling of uncertainty may be limited by our use of a single downscaling method and by imperfections common to all 33 gcms generally crop models can simulate grain yield and other yield components accurately under diverse environments if input information data is enough asseng et al 2019 for example the apsim model has been shown to accurately reflect grain yield under various environments chen et al 2010 wang et al 2012 xiao and tao 2014 however simulated future yields is likely to be overestimated because the model does not fully consider the yield loss caused by weeds pests diseases and the effects of extreme weather events such as heat waves and drought wang et al 2017 moreover the uncertainty for the response of crops to climate change may also result from different model structures and parameters values tao et al 2018 these impact uncertainties can be better quantified through use of multi crop model ensembles asseng et al 2019 however selecting a set of crop models does not reduce uncertainty in assessing climate change impacts we can only reduce these impact uncertainties by improving the relationship between crop growth and climatic factors temperature co2 etc in the crop model itself in the future asseng et al 2019 our simulation was undertaken at a multi decadal timescale on the assumption that adaptation to climate changes do not take place in our study the sowing date crop cultivars and fertilization management were assumed to be constant during the historical baseline and future period although automatic application of irrigation including irrigation times and irrigation amount was considered however the adaptation measures need to be considered in the future to test their capacity to cope with climate change in ncp xiao and tao 2014 these could include the selection of new crop varieties such as heat or drought tolerant cultivars and later maturing cultivar xiao et al 2020 these could play an important role in adapting cropping to climate change tao et al 2018 wang et al 2019 for example asseng et al 2019 indicated that introducing genotypes adapted to climate change warming temperature and changing in co2 and precipitation could boost global wheat yield by 7 5 conclusions in this study we adopted a crop simulation model combined with future climate data downscaled from 33 gcms to simulate changes in crop yield and water use in response to different future climate scenarios the results showed that crop phenology yield and water use are affected by future climate change across the ncp although the extent of impact is different in different locations overall future climate change exerted negative impacts on maize yield but had a positive impact on wheat yield across the ncp moreover the amount of irrigation and groundwater overdraft reduced under future climate scenarios mainly due to increased precipitation and decreased et as the simulated results in this study from the prospective of climate change increased precipitation and elevated co2 sowing wheat would be a good choice as it requires less irrigation in the future however groundwater overdraft still exists in the northern part of the ncp under the conventional double cropping system although the overdraft will be largely mitigated under the future climate scenario therefore we should change cropping system in those over pumping areas to reduce and even eliminate the occurrence of groundwater overdraft our results about future climate change and their implications for crop production will be important for policy makers to make future agricultural sustainable development strategy and water resources planning we have no financial and

10593,an experiment was conducted to evaluate the effect of irrigation cut off ico strategies on yield components water productivity wp and gas exchange in drip irrigated hazelnut corylus avellana l cv tonda di giffoni trees during two consecutive growing seasons the experimental design was completely randomized with four ico treatments and four replicates per treatment based on threshold values

curve until trees reached approximately the following ψstem thresholds 1 0 mpa in t2 1 3 mpa in t3 and 1 6 mpa in t4 once reached the specific thresholds irrigation was restored and maintained according to t1 in all treatments until harvest besides measurements of ψstem stomatal conductance gs net co2 assimilation rate an transpiration rate e yield components α tocopherol kernel content and wp were evaluated in this study results indicated that values of ψstem an gs and e observed in t3 and t4 were between 24 29 15 37 15 40 and 11 32 lower than those found in t1 respectively t4 significantly decreased yield kg tree 1 kernel kw and fruit fw weights but kw fw ratio and the α tocopherol kernel content μg g 1 were not significantly different among treatments also this study indicated that the t2 t3 and t4 treatments had 10 17 and 25 days without irrigation which produced water savings of 19 24 and 29 in comparison with t1 respectively finally wp was significantly affected by ico strategies with the minimum and maximum values observed in t1 0 51 kg m 3 and t4 0 86 kg m 3 respectively keywords regulated deficit irrigation plant water relations water productivity 1 introduction hazelnut corylus avellana l is one of the most important nut crops in the world as its kernel plays an essential role in nutrition and human health the composition of its nut is rich in monounsaturated fatty acids and α tocopherol content which makes it desirable for direct consumption in addition to cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries ghirardello et al 2016 liu et al 2018 pannico et al 2017 for these reasons the worldwide surface area planted with hazelnut orchards has increased significantly during recent years especially in southern hemisphere countries such as chile whose cultivated area has increased by approximately 80 faostat 2016 unlike to the traditional production areas having mean annual rainfall between 800 1000 mm distributed evenly throughout the year cristofori et al 2014 the new hazelnut plantations are located in mediterranean climate zones with rainfall mostly distributed during the winter and early spring deitch et al 2017 stolpe and undurraga 2016 uribe et al 2012 in this regard water scarcity in mediterranean areas due to climatic change has become the main limitation to maintaining hazelnut production garreaud et al 2017 roco et al 2016 ustaoglu and karaca 2014 under this scenario it is necessary to develop irrigation strategies to increase water productivity wp yield per unit of water applied by irrigation and maintain adequate yield fereres and soriano 2007 medrano et al 2015 ruiz sanchez et al 2010 regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been demonstrated to be an effective management strategy to improve wp with nonnegative effects on yield and quality in different soft fruit species such as citrus and blueberry gonzález altozano and castel 2000 lobos et al 2018 this technique consists of reducing the volume of water applied during a less sensitive phenological stage to water stress adu et al 2018 chai et al 2016 keen and slavich 2011 ortega farias et al 2012 several authors have noted that rdi strategies can reduce water application between 20 30 with minimal impact on pistachio olive and vineyard production carbonell barrachina et al 2015 girona et al 2006 gómez del campo 2013 iniesta et al 2009 romero et al 2015 in addition the rdi strategy using irrigation cut off ico has been suggested to be applied in prunes vineyards and olive orchards ahumada orellana et al 2017 2018 girona et al 2006 lampinen et al 2001 moriana et al 2012 trentacoste et al 2015 the ico strategy consists of suppressing irrigation completely during a less sensitive phenological period to water deficit and replenishing it once a predefined threshold of water deficit is reached the correct application of the ico strategy requires maintaining tree water status and gas exchange within an optimal range flexas et al 2004 galindo et al 2018 girona et al 2006 so that when water stress occurs the reduction of stomatal conductance gs does not cause a significant decrease in co2 net assimilation rate an cifre et al 2005 medrano et al 2002 for this reason the stem water potential ψstem has been suggested as a tool for monitoring irrigation management in a wide range of species such as sweet cherry peach pecan pistachio olive and grapes abrisqueta et al 2015 acevedo opazo et al 2010 ahumada orellana et al 2019 blanco et al 2018 jara rojas et al 2015 marino et al 2018 memmi et al 2016 othman et al 2014 williams and trout 2005 in this matter several reports have indicated that the ψstem is accurate enough to detect small but statistically significant differences among irrigation treatments compared to both predawn and leaf water potential measurements choné 2001 hernandez santana et al 2016 spinelli et al 2017 several studies indicated that ico strategies using ψstem as a threshold increased both water savings and wp between 20 30 and 25 40 respectively in prunes vineyards and olives girona et al 2006 lampinen et al 2001 moriana et al 2012 trentacoste et al 2015 furthermore the cumulative effects of water deficit throughout the growing season can be determined using the water stress integral siψ that has been well correlated with the wp in loquats olives and vineyards ahumada orellana et al 2017 fernández et al 2010 myers 1988 zúñiga et al 2018 however there are no studies for hazelnut trees regarding the application of ico strategies in combination with the monitoring of ψstem additionally the majority of studies about deficit irrigation in hazelnut trees has established the threshold as a percentage of the replenishment of the actual evapotranspiration eta bignami et al 2009 dias et al 2005 girona et al 1994 tombesi and rosati 1997 a sigmoid curve represents the growth of both fruits and kernels of hazelnut trees with three consecutive stages i beginning of fruit ovary growth ii the ovary attains full size and kernel growth starts and iii the growth of fruit becomes steady and the kernel begins to evolve rapidly reaching its final volume between 2 3 weeks valentini et al 2015 in this sense rdi strategy is required because severe water stress from stage i to near the harvest stage iii can reduce the final fruit size girona et al 1994 marsal et al 1997 mehlenbacher et al 1993 tombesi and rosati 1997 also cincera et al 2019 reported that the stomatal regulation by water stress causes the decrease of photosynthetic activity and the early cessation of the kernel filling some authors suggest that late water stress july and august may not have adverse effects on the yield grau and sandoval 2009 tombesi and rosati 1997 considering climate change the expansion of hazelnut cultivation in areas other than those of origin and the need to know how to save water without reducing the yield the principal aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of three ico strategies based on ψstem thresholds on yield water productivity and gas exchange of a drip irrigated hazelnut orchard under semiarid conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and plant material the experiment was carried out during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons in a drip irrigated commercial hazelnut cv tonda di gifonni orchard located in río claro maule region chile 35 18 21 1 s 71 21 33 4 w 219 m a s l the climate for this region is classified as mediterranean semiarid with an average daily temperature of 17 c and a mean annual rainfall of 516 mm poblete echeverría et al 2012 the summer period is usually cloudless dry and hot and only 3 of the annual rainfall occurs during this period while spring is considered wet 16 of the annual rainfall occurs during this period the soil of the hazelnut orchard is classified as the san rafael series mollisols fine mixed thermal from the aquic durixerolls with a clay loam texture for the effective rooting depth 0 50 cm the volumetric soil water content at field capacity θfc and wilting point θwp were 32 4 and 19 8 respectively the hazelnut orchard was established in 2009 with a spacing of 5 m 6 m 333 tree ha 1 and trained on a multiple stem shrub system two drip lines irrigated each tree with emitters supplying water at a rate of 1 8 l h 1 spaced at 1 0 m 10 emitters per tree the experimental site was managed according to conventional agricultural practices used in commercial hazelnut orchards in terms of fertilization pest and disease control and pruning during the two seasons the orchard irrigation was scheduled to replenish 100 of actual evapotranspiration eta et0 x kc where et0 and kc are reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 and crop coefficient dimensionless respectively from october bud break to march leaf fall et0 was estimated using the penman monteith equation which uses as input air temperature ta relative humidity rh solar radiation rs and wind speed ws allen et al 1998 near the experimental site an automatic weather station a733 adcon telemetry klosterneuburg austria was installed over a reference grass to measure ta rh rs ws and precipitation pp the kc values used in this study were 0 7 from september to november and 0 8 from december to april these values were obtained using an eddy covariance system installed above the commercial hazelnut orchard ortega farias et al unpublished data finally the effective rainfall r mm was calculated as r pp 5 0 75 where r and pp are in mm day 1 goodwin and victoria 1995 2 1 1 experimental design the experiment was conducted with four treatments and four replications where four continuous trees formed the experimental unit and the observation unit were the two central trees for treatment t1 the trees were irrigated according to 100 of eta which maintained a ψstem around 0 7 mpa the three remaining treatments corresponded to an rdi where the irrigation was cut off from the beginning of stage iii fruit growth curve until trees reached approximately the following ψstem thresholds 1 0 mpa in t2 1 3 mpa in t3 and 1 6 mpa in t4 once the treatments reached their respective ψstem thresholds the irrigation was re established in this case the irrigation cut off started on december 27th and december 21th for the first and second season respectively stage iii in the fruit growth curve was determined according to valentini et al 2015 and the stabilization of shell growth was observed on the day of the year doy 349 december 14th in 2016 2017 and doy 353 december 19th in 2017 2018 a completely randomized experimental design was used since the tree canopy and soil conditions in the experimental site were homogeneous in this case table 1 indicated that there were no significant differences among treatments for the tree height canopy width leaf area index lai and diameters of the stem shrubs this data was collected at the beginning of the experiment second week of dicember 2016 2 2 measurements of stem water potential and gas exchange parameters the ψstem was measured weekly at solar noon between 12 00 and 15 00 h coordinated universal time utc 3 from november to march using a pressure chamber pms instrument co model 600 corvallis oregon usa the used samples corresponded to fully mature and healthy leaves two per replication located in the middle third of the tree the leaves were covered with completely hermetic aluminum foil bags for at least 2 h before the measurement time the leaves were cut and immediately placed in the chamber additionally in order to describe the accumulated effect of the deficit irrigation treatments the water stress integral siψ was calculated as follows myers 1988 s i ψ ψ s t e m c n where ψ stem is the average stem water potential for any interval mpa day c is the maximum value of stem water potential during the season and n is the number of days in each interval moriana et al 2007 the measured values of c were 0 45 and 0 6 mpa for the first and second growing season respectively values of gs e and an were measured between 12 00 and 14 00 h coordinated universal time utc 3 using a portable infrared gas analyzer li 6400 licor inc lincoln nebraska usa equipped with a 6 cm2 transparent leaf chamber moreover water use efficiency wue was calculated as a ratio of an to e values of gs e and an were simultaneously measured with ψstem using completely sunny fully mature and healthy leaves two per replication located in the middle third of the trees finally the molar air flow rate was set at 500 μmol s 1 and the co2 concentration was kept constant at 400 μmol s 1 using a co2 injector system provided by the manufacturer 2 2 1 yield components α tocopherol kernel content and water productivity the fruit was harvested on doy 96 april 6th and doy 85 march 26th for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons respectively for this activity the two central trees of each replication were harvested separately using a specialized machine the yield components were yield per tree fruit weight fw kernel weight kw and kw fw ratio the measured yield per tree kg tree 1 was weighing the fruit in the field immediately after being harvested the kw and the kw fw ratio were estimated using a sample of 50 fruits per replication 200 fruits per treatment which were randomly collected to weigh them individually in the laboratory additionally a composite sample of 500 g from the same two harvested trees per replication was used to determined α tocopherol kernel content vitamin e using high performance liquid chromatography hplc with electrochemical detection podda et al 1996 wang et al 2018 2 3 data analysis a two way analysis of variance anova was used to test the treatment as well as the season and its interaction effects on tree water status gas exchange and yield components also the effects of different treatments on yield parameters for both seasons were evaluated by covariance analysis using fruit load number of fruits per tree as a covariate significant differences between treatments or seasonal means were evaluated with tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test α 0 05 data analyses was done using the student version of the statistical software infostat di rienzo et al 2017 finally a regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between siψ versus fw kw and wp 3 results 3 1 climatic conditions in general the atmospheric conditions during both study seasons were dry and hot without significant rainfall events the values of annual precipitation were 353 and 679 mm while those of seasonal rainfall from september to april were 35 and 56 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively fig 1 the daily values of ta ranged between 5 32 and 5 29 c while those of rh were between 24 95 and 22 94 for the first and second season respectively fig 2 the cumulative et0 ranged between 860 891 mm during the two growing seasons with maximum values observed during december and january fig 1 under these atmospheric conditions the mean water applications for t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments were 5494 4462 4201 and 3906 m3 ha 1 season 1 for the two seasons respectively fig 3 in this case the water savings were 19 in t2 24 in t3 and 29 in t4 3 2 physiological responses for both seasons there were no significant differences for ψstem among treatments at the beginning of the water restriction period however significant differences in ψstem were observed after a week of applying the ico treatment fig 4 throughout the two growing seasons the ѱstem values in t1 ranged between 0 90 and 0 54 mpa with minimum values observed on doy 24 for the first season and doy 10 for the second season for t2 t3 and t4 treatments ѱstem decreased until reaching the mean values of 1 0 1 3 and 1 6 mpa after 10 17 and 25 days without irrigation respectively the lowest values of ѱstem were observed in the t4 treatment on doy 18 and 20 for the first and second seasons respectively the siψ also reflects the effect of water stress experienced by trees during the ico period siψ was significantly increased by ico treatments with mean values at harvest of 105 98 and 89 mpa for t4 t3 and t2 respectively table 3 besides siψ presented a significant linear relationship with kw r2 0 77 and fw r2 0 75 which decreased as irrigation cut off was increased fig 5 a and b finally fig 5c indicates that there was a significant linear correlation between wp and siψ indicating that wp improved by the water restriction significant differences were observed for the mean seasonal values of an gs and e the t1 presented higher values than other treatments with 10 5 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 0 20 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and 5 7 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 respectively additionally an gs and e in t3 and t4 were significantly lower than those in t1 with mean values ranging between 7 5 6 6 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 0 16 0 12 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and 4 8 3 9 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 respectively the mean seasonal values of an gs and e for t2 did not show significant differences with t1 and t3 but they were significantly higher than those observed for t4 table 2 in addition there were not a significant effect of treatments on wue however the lowest mean seasonal values were observed during the 2017 18 growing season for a 3 year old hazelnut trees cv tonda di giffoni grown in pots tombesi 1994 observed that wue was between 0 82 0 84 μmol co2 mmol h2o from field capacity to 60 of available water after which it decrease to 0 57 μmol co2 mmol h2o 3 3 yield parameters α tocopherol kernel content and water productivity the statistical analysis indicates that there was a significant effect of ico strategies on yield with the highest and lowest values observed in t1 8 1 kg tree 1 and t4 7 5 kg tree 1 respectively additionally yields were significantly similar among t1 t2 and t3 and there was not significant interaction among treatments and growing seasons the kw and fw were significantly affected by ico treatments where t1 and t4 presented the highest and lowest values respectively in this case the kw of t1 1 52 g and t2 1 46 g did not present significant differences but they were statistically higher than those of t4 1 37 g and t3 1 41 g the fw only demonstrated significant differences between t1 and t4 whose average values were 3 32 g and 3 04 g respectively table 3 the kw fw ratios ranged between 0 42 0 45 and there was no significant effect among treatments and seasons moreover the season had a significant effect on α tocopherol content with values of 223 and 602 μg g 1 for the first and second season respectively finally the wp was significantly higher during the first growing season and average values of wp were significantly higher in t3 0 76 kg m 3 and t4 0 86 kg m 3 in comparison with t1 0 51 kg m 3 table 3 4 discussion the weather conditions during the two study seasons agreed with those of the expected climatic description of the area with a negligible level of precipitation less than 60 mm during the two growing seasons in these seasons the cumulative eta from october to march was between 628 686 mm which was higher than those reported by özmen 2016 on rainfed conditions 251 289 mm and those published by cristofori et al 2014 who observed eta and precipitation ranging between 124 315 mm and 89 537 mm respectively the ψstem values presented significant differences among treatments during the ico application for t1 ψstem remained higher than the other treatments and almost constant during both seasons with values greater than 0 7 mpa fig 4 similarly grau and sandoval 2009 observed values greater 0 9 mpa for three year old hazelnut trees under nonwater restriction for t2 treatment ψstem was reduced up to 1 0 mpa during the ico application which reduced the total irrigation volume by about 19 respect to t1 moreover a decrease up to 24 and 29 of the full irrigation treatment led to a minimum ψstem equal to 1 7 and 1 3 mpa for t4 and t3 respectively the results of this study showed a decline of 27 in tree water status which agrees with literature that shows water status reduction between 12 50 when using the ψleaf and ψpd awada and josiah 2007 catoni et al 2017 dias et al 2005 girona et al 1994 marsal et al 1997 about the response of gas exchange the ico treatments significantly reduced the an gs and e values between 15 37 15 40 and 11 32 of t1 respectively in this case the lowest gs and an values observed in t4 were 0 12 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and 6 6 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 respectively similar pattern was reported by marsal et al 1997 who observed that an application of 20 of eta during the fruit growing period from doy 190 240 for hazelnut trees reduced gs and an from 0 25 to 0 05 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and 8 8 to 1 4 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 respectively moreover the average values of an and gs obtained in t2 were not significantly different than those in t1 but they were significantly higher than those observed in t4 these results can explain the nonsignificant differences between t2 and t1 for yield fw and kw table 3 instead with a longer water stress period t3 and t4 an gs and e were reduced significantly this gas exchange response supports the reduction in the kw seen in t3 1 41 g and t4 1 37 g several studies have noted that this response is related to stomatal closure preventing water loss which reduces gs an and therefore the yield flexas et al 2004 flexas and medrano 2002 marino et al 2018 however the t3 treatment having even reduced its gas exchange parameters and water status did not result in a significant loss of yield fw or kw fw ratio which contrasts with previous studies carried out on hazelnut trees bignami et al 2009 cristofori et al 2008 grau and sandoval 2009 suggested that the impact of water restriction during stage iii would be minimized since there is only a translocation of dry matter however cristofori et al 2015 reported that the kw increased a lot due to oil accumulation during stage iii affecting the final yield in this study the physiological and yield responses suggested that t2 applied during stage iii could be used to save water without reducing significantly the hazelnut yield guerrero et al 2006 indicated that the application of rdi based on ψstem 1 5 mpa during the dry matter translocation stage of pistachio trees did not cause a significant decrease in yield respect to well watered trees according to catoni et al 2017 a ψstem threshold of 1 7 mpa t4 for this study resulted in a prolonged delay in the recovery of gs with concomitant negative effects on long term hazelnut fw and kw additional studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of different levels of water stress on oil and dry matter accumulation during stage iii on the other hand rao and chaitanya 2016 and hossain et al 2016 explained that under water stress the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as α tocopherol are modulated by genetic and environmental factors that could also vary every year the higher α tocopherol kernel content observed during the second season 601 5 μg g 1 was in agreement with those found in the literature with a large difference among years cristofori et al 2008 parcerisa et al 1999 in the same way zhu et al 2015 also reported similar results in almond trees where relative humidity and air temperature variation was the main factor to explain variation of α tocopherol content from 12 9 18 mg 100 g 1 among seasons bacchetta et al 2013 cristofori et al 2008 kodad et al 2018 sivakumar and bacchetta 2005 the reduction of irrigation generated significant increases on the wp for the ico treatments respect to the control similar results have been reported in vineyards where the reduction of water application generated an increase of wp in cabernet sauvignon intrigliolo et al 2016 and carménère zúñiga et al 2018 in contrast ahumada orellana et al 2017 found a reduction of wp in treatments that caused severe water stress in olive trees meanwhile treatments causing moderate water stress did not present any differences in comparison to well irrigated trees these results suggest that total irrigation t1 is not guaranteed to maximize commercial yield in hazelnut trees grown in semiarid climatic conditions and that it is possible to reduce up to 19 t2 of the water applied without affecting the yield and kw finally strong correlations between siψ versus yield components fruit and kernel weight and siψ versus wp were observed for the dataset these results are similar to those indicated by ahumada orellana et al 2017 who showed a linear relationship between siψ and fruit yield r2 0 6 in olive trees additionally zúñiga et al 2018 also found a nonlinear relationship between siψ and wp r2 0 74 5 conclusions results indicated that yield kw and fw and gas exchange were not affected by the ico strategy applied from the beginning of stage iii until trees reached a ψstem threshold of 1 0 mpa t2 in this treatment hazelnut trees had ten days without irrigation which produced a water savings of 19 on the other hand the ico treatments t3 and t4 with ψstem thresholds lower than 1 3 mpa improved water productivity wp but reducing significantly yield components and gas exchange parameters in this case maximum and minimum values of yield were 8 1 and 7 5 kg plant 1 for t1 and t4 respectively also kernel and fruit weights decreased as the water stress integral and irrigation cut off increased finally major studies about the effect of different levels of water stress on oil and dry matter accumulation during stage iii are needed for drip irrigated hazelnut orchards located in mediterranean climate zones declaration of competing interest the authors

cristofori et al 2014 the new hazelnut plantations are located in mediterranean climate zones with rainfall mostly distributed during the winter and early spring deitch et al 2017 stolpe and undurraga 2016 uribe et al 2012 in this regard water scarcity in mediterranean areas due to climatic change has become the main limitation to maintaining hazelnut production garreaud et al 2017 roco et al 2016 ustaoglu and karaca 2014 under this scenario it is necessary to develop irrigation strategies to increase water productivity wp yield per unit of water applied by irrigation and maintain adequate yield fereres and soriano 2007 medrano et al 2015 ruiz sanchez et al 2010 regulated deficit irrigation rdi has been demonstrated to be an effective management strategy to improve wp with nonnegative effects on yield and quality in different soft fruit species such as citrus and blueberry gonzález altozano and castel 2000 lobos et al 2018 this technique consists of reducing the volume of water applied during a less sensitive phenological stage to water stress adu et al 2018 chai et al 2016 keen and slavich 2011 ortega farias et al 2012 several authors have noted that rdi strategies can reduce water application between 20 30 with minimal impact on pistachio olive and vineyard production carbonell barrachina et al 2015 girona et al 2006 gómez del campo 2013 iniesta et al 2009 romero et al 2015 in addition the rdi strategy using irrigation cut off ico has been suggested to be applied in prunes vineyards and olive orchards ahumada orellana et al 2017 2018 girona et al 2006 lampinen et al 2001 moriana et al 2012 trentacoste et al 2015 the ico strategy consists of suppressing irrigation completely during a less sensitive phenological period to water deficit and replenishing it once a predefined threshold of water deficit is reached the correct application of the ico strategy requires maintaining tree water status and gas exchange within an optimal range flexas et al 2004 galindo et al 2018 girona et al 2006 so that when water stress occurs the reduction of stomatal conductance gs does not cause a significant decrease in co2 net assimilation rate an cifre et al 2005 medrano et al 2002 for this reason the stem water potential ψstem has been suggested as a tool for monitoring irrigation management in a wide range of species such as sweet cherry peach pecan pistachio olive and grapes abrisqueta et al 2015 acevedo opazo et al 2010 ahumada orellana et al 2019 blanco et al 2018 jara rojas et al 2015 marino et al 2018 memmi et al 2016 othman et al 2014 williams and trout 2005 in this matter several reports have indicated that the ψstem is accurate enough to detect small but statistically significant differences among irrigation treatments compared to both predawn and leaf water potential measurements choné 2001 hernandez santana et al 2016 spinelli et al 2017 several studies indicated that ico strategies using ψstem as a threshold increased both water savings and wp between 20 30 and 25 40 respectively in prunes vineyards and olives girona et al 2006 lampinen et al 2001 moriana et al 2012 trentacoste et al 2015 furthermore the cumulative effects of water deficit throughout the growing season can be determined using the water stress integral siψ that has been well correlated with the wp in loquats olives and vineyards ahumada orellana et al 2017 fernández et al 2010 myers 1988 zúñiga et al 2018 however there are no studies for hazelnut trees regarding the application of ico strategies in combination with the monitoring of ψstem additionally the majority of studies about deficit irrigation in hazelnut trees has established the threshold as a percentage of the replenishment of the actual evapotranspiration eta bignami et al 2009 dias et al 2005 girona et al 1994 tombesi and rosati 1997 a sigmoid curve represents the growth of both fruits and kernels of hazelnut trees with three consecutive stages i beginning of fruit ovary growth ii the ovary attains full size and kernel growth starts and iii the growth of fruit becomes steady and the kernel begins to evolve rapidly reaching its final volume between 2 3 weeks valentini et al 2015 in this sense rdi strategy is required because severe water stress from stage i to near the harvest stage iii can reduce the final fruit size girona et al 1994 marsal et al 1997 mehlenbacher et al 1993 tombesi and rosati 1997 also cincera et al 2019 reported that the stomatal regulation by water stress causes the decrease of photosynthetic activity and the early cessation of the kernel filling some authors suggest that late water stress july and august may not have adverse effects on the yield grau and sandoval 2009 tombesi and rosati 1997 considering climate change the expansion of hazelnut cultivation in areas other than those of origin and the need to know how to save water without reducing the yield the principal aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of three ico strategies based on ψstem thresholds on yield water productivity and gas exchange of a drip irrigated hazelnut orchard under semiarid conditions 2 materials and methods 2 1 experimental site and plant material the experiment was carried out during the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons in a drip irrigated commercial hazelnut cv tonda di gifonni orchard located in río claro maule region chile 35 18 21 1 s 71 21 33 4 w 219 m a s l the climate for this region is classified as mediterranean semiarid with an average daily temperature of 17 c and a mean annual rainfall of 516 mm poblete echeverría et al 2012 the summer period is usually cloudless dry and hot and only 3 of the annual rainfall occurs during this period while spring is considered wet 16 of the annual rainfall occurs during this period the soil of the hazelnut orchard is classified as the san rafael series mollisols fine mixed thermal from the aquic durixerolls with a clay loam texture for the effective rooting depth 0 50 cm the volumetric soil water content at field capacity θfc and wilting point θwp were 32 4 and 19 8 respectively the hazelnut orchard was established in 2009 with a spacing of 5 m 6 m 333 tree ha 1 and trained on a multiple stem shrub system two drip lines irrigated each tree with emitters supplying water at a rate of 1 8 l h 1 spaced at 1 0 m 10 emitters per tree the experimental site was managed according to conventional agricultural practices used in commercial hazelnut orchards in terms of fertilization pest and disease control and pruning during the two seasons the orchard irrigation was scheduled to replenish 100 of actual evapotranspiration eta et0 x kc where et0 and kc are reference evapotranspiration mm day 1 and crop coefficient dimensionless respectively from october bud break to march leaf fall et0 was estimated using the penman monteith equation which uses as input air temperature ta relative humidity rh solar radiation rs and wind speed ws allen et al 1998 near the experimental site an automatic weather station a733 adcon telemetry klosterneuburg austria was installed over a reference grass to measure ta rh rs ws and precipitation pp the kc values used in this study were 0 7 from september to november and 0 8 from december to april these values were obtained using an eddy covariance system installed above the commercial hazelnut orchard ortega farias et al unpublished data finally the effective rainfall r mm was calculated as r pp 5 0 75 where r and pp are in mm day 1 goodwin and victoria 1995 2 1 1 experimental design the experiment was conducted with four treatments and four replications where four continuous trees formed the experimental unit and the observation unit were the two central trees for treatment t1 the trees were irrigated according to 100 of eta which maintained a ψstem around 0 7 mpa the three remaining treatments corresponded to an rdi where the irrigation was cut off from the beginning of stage iii fruit growth curve until trees reached approximately the following ψstem thresholds 1 0 mpa in t2 1 3 mpa in t3 and 1 6 mpa in t4 once the treatments reached their respective ψstem thresholds the irrigation was re established in this case the irrigation cut off started on december 27th and december 21th for the first and second season respectively stage iii in the fruit growth curve was determined according to valentini et al 2015 and the stabilization of shell growth was observed on the day of the year doy 349 december 14th in 2016 2017 and doy 353 december 19th in 2017 2018 a completely randomized experimental design was used since the tree canopy and soil conditions in the experimental site were homogeneous in this case table 1 indicated that there were no significant differences among treatments for the tree height canopy width leaf area index lai and diameters of the stem shrubs this data was collected at the beginning of the experiment second week of dicember 2016 2 2 measurements of stem water potential and gas exchange parameters the ψstem was measured weekly at solar noon between 12 00 and 15 00 h coordinated universal time utc 3 from november to march using a pressure chamber pms instrument co model 600 corvallis oregon usa the used samples corresponded to fully mature and healthy leaves two per replication located in the middle third of the tree the leaves were covered with completely hermetic aluminum foil bags for at least 2 h before the measurement time the leaves were cut and immediately placed in the chamber additionally in order to describe the accumulated effect of the deficit irrigation treatments the water stress integral siψ was calculated as follows myers 1988 s i ψ ψ s t e m c n where ψ stem is the average stem water potential for any interval mpa day c is the maximum value of stem water potential during the season and n is the number of days in each interval moriana et al 2007 the measured values of c were 0 45 and 0 6 mpa for the first and second growing season respectively values of gs e and an were measured between 12 00 and 14 00 h coordinated universal time utc 3 using a portable infrared gas analyzer li 6400 licor inc lincoln nebraska usa equipped with a 6 cm2 transparent leaf chamber moreover water use efficiency wue was calculated as a ratio of an to e values of gs e and an were simultaneously measured with ψstem using completely sunny fully mature and healthy leaves two per replication located in the middle third of the trees finally the molar air flow rate was set at 500 μmol s 1 and the co2 concentration was kept constant at 400 μmol s 1 using a co2 injector system provided by the manufacturer 2 2 1 yield components α tocopherol kernel content and water productivity the fruit was harvested on doy 96 april 6th and doy 85 march 26th for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 growing seasons respectively for this activity the two central trees of each replication were harvested separately using a specialized machine the yield components were yield per tree fruit weight fw kernel weight kw and kw fw ratio the measured yield per tree kg tree 1 was weighing the fruit in the field immediately after being harvested the kw and the kw fw ratio were estimated using a sample of 50 fruits per replication 200 fruits per treatment which were randomly collected to weigh them individually in the laboratory additionally a composite sample of 500 g from the same two harvested trees per replication was used to determined α tocopherol kernel content vitamin e using high performance liquid chromatography hplc with electrochemical detection podda et al 1996 wang et al 2018 2 3 data analysis a two way analysis of variance anova was used to test the treatment as well as the season and its interaction effects on tree water status gas exchange and yield components also the effects of different treatments on yield parameters for both seasons were evaluated by covariance analysis using fruit load number of fruits per tree as a covariate significant differences between treatments or seasonal means were evaluated with tukey s honestly significant difference hsd test α 0 05 data analyses was done using the student version of the statistical software infostat di rienzo et al 2017 finally a regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between siψ versus fw kw and wp 3 results 3 1 climatic conditions in general the atmospheric conditions during both study seasons were dry and hot without significant rainfall events the values of annual precipitation were 353 and 679 mm while those of seasonal rainfall from september to april were 35 and 56 mm for the 2016 2017 and 2017 2018 seasons respectively fig 1 the daily values of ta ranged between 5 32 and 5 29 c while those of rh were between 24 95 and 22 94 for the first and second season respectively fig 2 the cumulative et0 ranged between 860 891 mm during the two growing seasons with maximum values observed during december and january fig 1 under these atmospheric conditions the mean water applications for t1 t2 t3 and t4 treatments were 5494 4462 4201 and 3906 m3 ha 1 season 1 for the two seasons respectively fig 3 in this case the water savings were 19 in t2 24 in t3 and 29 in t4 3 2 physiological responses for both seasons there were no significant differences for ψstem among treatments at the beginning of the water restriction period however significant differences in ψstem were observed after a week of applying the ico treatment fig 4 throughout the two growing seasons the ѱstem values in t1 ranged between 0 90 and 0 54 mpa with minimum values observed on doy 24 for the first season and doy 10 for the second season for t2 t3 and t4 treatments ѱstem decreased until reaching the mean values of 1 0 1 3 and 1 6 mpa after 10 17 and 25 days without irrigation respectively the lowest values of ѱstem were observed in the t4 treatment on doy 18 and 20 for the first and second seasons respectively the siψ also reflects the effect of water stress experienced by trees during the ico period siψ was significantly increased by ico treatments with mean values at harvest of 105 98 and 89 mpa for t4 t3 and t2 respectively table 3 besides siψ presented a significant linear relationship with kw r2 0 77 and fw r2 0 75 which decreased as irrigation cut off was increased fig 5 a and b finally fig 5c indicates that there was a significant linear correlation between wp and siψ indicating that wp improved by the water restriction significant differences were observed for the mean seasonal values of an gs and e the t1 presented higher values than other treatments with 10 5 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 0 20 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and 5 7 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 respectively additionally an gs and e in t3 and t4 were significantly lower than those in t1 with mean values ranging between 7 5 6 6 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 0 16 0 12 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and 4 8 3 9 mmol h2o m 2 s 1 respectively the mean seasonal values of an gs and e for t2 did not show significant differences with t1 and t3 but they were significantly higher than those observed for t4 table 2 in addition there were not a significant effect of treatments on wue however the lowest mean seasonal values were observed during the 2017 18 growing season for a 3 year old hazelnut trees cv tonda di giffoni grown in pots tombesi 1994 observed that wue was between 0 82 0 84 μmol co2 mmol h2o from field capacity to 60 of available water after which it decrease to 0 57 μmol co2 mmol h2o 3 3 yield parameters α tocopherol kernel content and water productivity the statistical analysis indicates that there was a significant effect of ico strategies on yield with the highest and lowest values observed in t1 8 1 kg tree 1 and t4 7 5 kg tree 1 respectively additionally yields were significantly similar among t1 t2 and t3 and there was not significant interaction among treatments and growing seasons the kw and fw were significantly affected by ico treatments where t1 and t4 presented the highest and lowest values respectively in this case the kw of t1 1 52 g and t2 1 46 g did not present significant differences but they were statistically higher than those of t4 1 37 g and t3 1 41 g the fw only demonstrated significant differences between t1 and t4 whose average values were 3 32 g and 3 04 g respectively table 3 the kw fw ratios ranged between 0 42 0 45 and there was no significant effect among treatments and seasons moreover the season had a significant effect on α tocopherol content with values of 223 and 602 μg g 1 for the first and second season respectively finally the wp was significantly higher during the first growing season and average values of wp were significantly higher in t3 0 76 kg m 3 and t4 0 86 kg m 3 in comparison with t1 0 51 kg m 3 table 3 4 discussion the weather conditions during the two study seasons agreed with those of the expected climatic description of the area with a negligible level of precipitation less than 60 mm during the two growing seasons in these seasons the cumulative eta from october to march was between 628 686 mm which was higher than those reported by özmen 2016 on rainfed conditions 251 289 mm and those published by cristofori et al 2014 who observed eta and precipitation ranging between 124 315 mm and 89 537 mm respectively the ψstem values presented significant differences among treatments during the ico application for t1 ψstem remained higher than the other treatments and almost constant during both seasons with values greater than 0 7 mpa fig 4 similarly grau and sandoval 2009 observed values greater 0 9 mpa for three year old hazelnut trees under nonwater restriction for t2 treatment ψstem was reduced up to 1 0 mpa during the ico application which reduced the total irrigation volume by about 19 respect to t1 moreover a decrease up to 24 and 29 of the full irrigation treatment led to a minimum ψstem equal to 1 7 and 1 3 mpa for t4 and t3 respectively the results of this study showed a decline of 27 in tree water status which agrees with literature that shows water status reduction between 12 50 when using the ψleaf and ψpd awada and josiah 2007 catoni et al 2017 dias et al 2005 girona et al 1994 marsal et al 1997 about the response of gas exchange the ico treatments significantly reduced the an gs and e values between 15 37 15 40 and 11 32 of t1 respectively in this case the lowest gs and an values observed in t4 were 0 12 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and 6 6 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 respectively similar pattern was reported by marsal et al 1997 who observed that an application of 20 of eta during the fruit growing period from doy 190 240 for hazelnut trees reduced gs and an from 0 25 to 0 05 mol h2o m 2 s 1 and 8 8 to 1 4 μmol co2 m 2 s 1 respectively moreover the average values of an and gs obtained in t2 were not significantly different than those in t1 but they were significantly higher than those observed in t4 these results can explain the nonsignificant differences between t2 and t1 for yield fw and kw table 3 instead with a longer water stress period t3 and t4 an gs and e were reduced significantly this gas exchange response supports the reduction in the kw seen in t3 1 41 g and t4 1 37 g several studies have noted that this response is related to stomatal closure preventing water loss which reduces gs an and therefore the yield flexas et al 2004 flexas and medrano 2002 marino et al 2018 however the t3 treatment having even reduced its gas exchange parameters and water status did not result in a significant loss of yield fw or kw fw ratio which contrasts with previous studies carried out on hazelnut trees bignami et al 2009 cristofori et al 2008 grau and sandoval 2009 suggested that the impact of water restriction during stage iii would be minimized since there is only a translocation of dry matter however cristofori et al 2015 reported that the kw increased a lot due to oil accumulation during stage iii affecting the final yield in this study the physiological and yield responses suggested that t2 applied during stage iii could be used to save water without reducing significantly the hazelnut yield guerrero et al 2006 indicated that the application of rdi based on ψstem 1 5 mpa during the dry matter translocation stage of pistachio trees did not cause a significant decrease in yield respect to well watered trees according to catoni et al 2017 a ψstem threshold of 1 7 mpa t4 for this study resulted in a prolonged delay in the recovery of gs with concomitant negative effects on long term hazelnut fw and kw additional studies are necessary to evaluate the effect of different levels of water stress on oil and dry matter accumulation during stage iii on the other hand rao and chaitanya 2016 and hossain et al 2016 explained that under water stress the activities of antioxidant enzymes such as α tocopherol are modulated by genetic and environmental factors that could also vary every year the higher α tocopherol kernel content observed during the second season 601 5 μg g 1 was in agreement with those found in the literature with a large difference among years cristofori et al 2008 parcerisa et al 1999 in the same way zhu et al 2015 also reported similar results in almond trees where relative humidity and air temperature variation was the main factor to explain variation of α tocopherol content from 12 9 18 mg 100 g 1 among seasons bacchetta et al 2013 cristofori et al 2008 kodad et al 2018 sivakumar and bacchetta 2005 the reduction of irrigation generated significant increases on the wp for the ico treatments respect to the control similar results have been reported in vineyards where the reduction of water application generated an increase of wp in cabernet sauvignon intrigliolo et al 2016 and carménère zúñiga et al 2018 in contrast ahumada orellana et al 2017 found a reduction of wp in treatments that caused severe water stress in olive trees meanwhile treatments causing moderate water stress did not present any differences in comparison to well irrigated trees these results suggest that total irrigation t1 is not guaranteed to maximize commercial yield in hazelnut trees grown in semiarid climatic conditions and that it is possible to reduce up to 19 t2 of the water applied without affecting the yield and kw finally strong correlations between siψ versus yield components fruit and kernel weight and siψ versus wp were observed for the dataset these results are similar to those indicated by ahumada orellana et al 2017 who showed a linear relationship between siψ and fruit yield r2 0 6 in olive trees additionally zúñiga et al 2018 also found a nonlinear relationship between siψ and wp r2 0 74 5 conclusions results indicated that yield kw and fw and gas exchange were not affected by the ico strategy applied from the beginning of stage iii until trees reached a ψstem threshold of 1 0 mpa t2 in this treatment hazelnut trees had ten days without irrigation which produced a water savings of 19 on the other hand the ico treatments t3 and t4 with ψstem thresholds lower than 1 3 mpa improved water productivity wp but reducing significantly yield components and gas exchange parameters in this case maximum and minimum values of yield were 8 1 and 7 5 kg plant 1 for t1 and t4 respectively also kernel and fruit weights decreased as the water stress integral and irrigation cut off increased finally major studies about the effect of different levels of water stress on oil and dry matter accumulation during stage iii are needed for drip irrigated hazelnut orchards located in mediterranean climate zones declaration of competing interest the authors

10594,the yield of crops is threatened significantly by drought in various parts of the world the purpose of this paper was to evaluate the potential of mycorrhiza fungi in reducing water stress effect on sesame sesamum indicum l by assessing antioxidant activity the experiment was carried out as a split plot based on a randomized complete block design in two cropping seasons the main factor consisted of different levels of irrigation whereas subplot included two different species of mycorrhiza fungi namely funneliformis mosseae and rhizophagus irregularis applied separately a non inoculated subplot served as the control one plant biomass grain yield amounts of chlorophyll a and b and relative water content decreased with the severity of water stress at the same time the amount of proline malondialdehyde level and enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants increased significantly severe water stress reduced the biomass and grain yield by approximately 51 and 65 respectively oxidative damage hydrogen peroxide and mda content induced by water stress was significantly reduced in colonized plants compared with the control plot using two species of mycorrhiza fungi caused an increase in biomass grain yield relative water content and all enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant activities however the improvement in plant water status led to significantly decreased proline obtained results indicated that mycorrhiza fungi can enhance the enzymatic antioxidant activities that resulted in scavenging free radicals and improving resistance to water stress keywords sesame root colonization proline photosynthetic pigments antioxidant enzymes 1 introduction sesame sesamum indicum l as the oldest oilseed plant is an annual plant and native to warm and semi warm areas improvement of appropriate cultivars has led to its cultivation in most areas worldwide weiss 2000 in iran the cultivated area of sesame and its production is substantial gholinezhad and darvishzadeh 2019 elevated level of biomass is a major issue for breeding targets in all crop plants the quantitative polygenic and composite characteristic products of several agents build up biomass emamgholizadeha et al 2015 the yield of crops is threatened significantly by drought in various parts of the world passioura 2007 sesame like other crops is affected by the shortage of water the growth of sesame and biomass is decreased by extended irrigation intervals as well as the heightened water deficiency mensah et al 2006 eskandari et al 2010 on the other hand providing favorable irrigation conditions brings about the maximum amount of sesame dry matter heidari et al 2011 in mid 80s the best scale to assess plant water situation was suggested to be relative water content rwc thus in place of plant water potential rwc was used to show the equilibrium between attracted water by plant and wasted via transpiration ganji arjenaki et al 2012 proline is capable of playing a protective role beside this it can combine with o2 and free radicals produced under water stress therefore resistance to water deficiency could be one of the functions performed by proline in plants dias et al 2014 enzymatic antioxidative defense system includes various antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat peroxidase pox and ascorbate peroxidase apx when oxidative stress is experienced by cells these enzymes act in several sub cellular sections to avert damage hussein et al 2016 water stress leads to heightened carotenoid concentration sod cat peroxidase and apx activities in sesame yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a fungus and a plant that is often observed even in dry soil rejali et al 2007 inoculation by am arbuscular mycorrhiza represents an eco friendly and beneficial biological technique aiming to enhance plant resistance to damaging environmental conditions for example drought stress the negative effects of water stress in plants can be modified by mycorrhiza and many authors have reported positive effects such as increase in morphological and physiological parameters compensation of the reduced biomass under water stress increased dry matter weight of mycorrhiza fungi on the symbiotic plants affected by water stress rahimi et al 2009 rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017 mycorrhiza alleviates oxidative stress triggered by water stress by producing more chlorophyll a and b pedranzani et al 2016 on the other hand mo et al 2016 have shown that diminished accumulation of mda h2o2 and o2 was observed in arbuscular mycorrhizal plants contrary to non mycorrhiza plants moreover in comparison to non mycorrhiza plants less sugar was observed in mycorrhiza associated plants under drought conditions porcel and ruiz lozano 2004 the amount of chlorophyll index grew with the inoculation by mycorrhizal fungi in comparison with the absence of mycorrhizal fungi askari 2018 the highest grain yield biomass and harvest index were connected to optimum irrigation compared with suitable irrigation conditions moderate to severe water stress decreased grain yield and biomass rate by 39 4 and 26 7 respectively mycorrhizal symbiosis enhanced all features in comparison with the control sample no mycorrhiza inoculation with funneliformis and rhizoglomus fungi under optimal irrigation and stress conditions enhanced grain yield and biological yield as well in comparison with the control sample askari et al 2019 in general plant inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is known to be a reasonable strategy to improve the resistance to water deficit stress since it can upgrade the plant water and nutritional status reducing the stress and thus improving the plant antioxidant activity fernández lizarazo and moreno fonseca 2016 lenoir et al 2016 bahadur et al 2019 despite the increasing interest research on the symbiosis of mycorrhiza fungi with sesame under water stress condition is rare hence this study was undertaken with the aim to explore how mycorrhiza affects seed yield biomass and physiology of sesame cultivar darab 2 under various levels of water stress with particular regard to the enzymatic and non enzymatic anti oxidant defense system 2 materials and methods 2 1 geographical location and study area description the research was conducted in two seasons 2015 and 2016 in the agricultural research center west azerbaijan saatloo station 45 10 53 e 37 44 18 n and 1338 m above sea level located 25 km from urmia city iran the experimental region is arid and semi arid in terms of climatic conditions with the average annual rainfall of 390 mm the average temperature of 11 3 c and the relative humidity of 75 some of the meteorological parameters from planting to harvesting for two years study are presented in table s1 supplementary material according to texture class the soil in the experimental station was classified as loam clay loam the physical and chemical characteristics of the soil in the experiment site are presented in table s2 supplementary material to ensure that the experimental area contains low mycorrhiza population the mycorrhiza colony formation was counted by standard methods habibzadeh et al 2012 2 2 crop cultivation disc ploughing is done first in one direction and then in the direction perpendicular to the previous one then by leveling and demarcating the plot for sowing the seed was done during the preparation of the land required mineral nutrients as described in table s3 were added to the soil the phosphorous was excluded in the treatment plots to substitute the same with selected species of mycorrhiza the first irrigation was done after 10 days and weeding was performed manually after 20 and 40 days of sowing the characteristics of the mycorrhiza species tested in this study are presented in table s4 smith and read 2008 2 3 experimental design and treatments the research was performed as a split plot using a randomized complete block design rcbd replicated three times the commercial cultivar of sesame darab 2 was used in the study the main

results 3 1 biomass and grain yield compared with the optimum irrigation severe and moderate water stress reduced the biomass by approximately 51 and 15 respectively fig 1 a a significant difference was observed between the biomass production of plants inoculated with mycorrhiza fungi and the control sample p 0 05 in comparison with the control sample inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis led to increased biomass by approximately 28 and 21 respectively fig 2 a the grain yield was higher in 2015 than in 2016 table 4 mean comparisons based on 2 years data of the traits pointed out that with increased severity of water stress the grain yield decreased significantly so that the severe and moderate water stress in comparison with optimum irrigation reduced grain yield by 65 and 23 respectively table 4 under favorable irrigation conditions inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi f mosseae and r irregularis compared to the non inoculated plants improved the grain yield by 32 and 19 respectively under moderate drought stress conditions inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis compared with the non inoculated plants increased the seed yield about 27 and 20 respectively in severe drought conditions inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis compared with the non inoculated plants increased the grain yield by 44 and 35 table 4 3 2 photosynthetic pigments the comparison of the means in two years indicate that with increased water stress chlorophylls a and b decreased but the total carotenoids increased significantly thus severe and moderate water stress significantly reduced chlorophyll a by 60 and 26 compared with the optimum irrigation respectively p 0 05 table 3 in comparison with the control sample inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis improved chlorophyll a b and carotenoid content in all different irrigation regimes the highest chlorophyll b content was observed under the optimum irrigation conditions and inoculation with the mycorrhiza fungus f mosseae was approximately 0 71 mg g 1 fw figs 1b and 2b respectively the lowest chlorophyll b content at 0 39 mg g 1 fw was observed in the control sample under severe water stress fig 1b the maximum carotenoid content at 4 00 mg g 1 fw was noticed under severe water stress and inoculation with the mycorrhiza fungus f mosseae the minimum carotenoid content at 0 89 mg g 1 fw was obtained under the optimum irrigation and the control non inoculated condition table 3 3 3 mycorrhiza colony formation the results of the mean comparisons based on two successive years data revealed that with increased water stress the mycorrhiza colony formation decreased significantly thus severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation conditions strongly reduced the mycorrhiza colony formation by 39 and 17 respectively on the other hand inoculation with f mosseae under the optimum irrigation conditions improved the mycorrhiza colony formation with the highest 71 08 of table 3 in both cases under moderate and severe water stress the mycorrhiza colony formation grew during inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis when compared with the control sample 3 4 relative water content with increased water stress rwc decreased significantly therefore severe and moderate water stress compared with optimum irrigation reduced rwc by 23 and 25 respectively fig 1c results indicated that compared with the control sample inoculation with the mycorrhiza fungus f mosseae and r irregularis caused an increase in rwc by approximately 35 and 26 respectively fig 2c 3 5 proline a significant difference between the different levels of irrigation on proline content was observed and the highest at 260 08 μmol l 1 and the lowest at 223 45 μmol l 1 of proline were observed under severe water stress and optimum irrigation conditions respectively fig 1d significant differences in proline content between the control sample and plants inoculated with mycorrhiza fungus were found p 0 05 fig 2d inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis decreased the proline content by 21 and 14 respectively compared with the control sample fig 2d 3 6 total soluble sugars content plants exposed to severe drought stress exhibited greater levels of tss compared with plants exposed to optimal irrigation the highest tss at 103 06 mg g 1 fw was noticed in plants inoculated with f mosseae under severe water stress the lowest leaf tss at 21 55 mg g 1 fw was obtained in the control sample under optimum irrigation table 3 with increased water stress soluble sugars increased significantly thus severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation raised the tss by approximately 70 and 49 respectively table 3 under the three different levels of moisture inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis caused an increase in tss compared with the control sample table 3 3 7 antioxidant activities the maximum activity of apx ppo and sod enzymes was achieved under severe water stress and inoculation with f mosseae whereas the minimum activity of apx was observed in the optimum irrigation and the control sample on the other hand there were no notable differences in the activity of apx under optimum irrigation conditions between inoculated plants and the control sample under severe water stress inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of apx by 30 and 4 respectively compared with the control sample table 3 compared with the control sample under severe water stress the use of the mycorrhiza fungi f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of ppo by approximately 38 and 15 respectively table 3 in this experiment with increased water stress the activity of gpx sod cat and pal enzymes and hp and mda increased significantly severe and moderate water stress increased the activity of gpx by 82 and 65 respectively under all different irrigation regimes the application with f mosseae and r irregularis raised the activity of the gpx the activity of sod was higher in the control sample than in the inoculated plants under severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation the activity of the sod enzyme increased by 54 and 35 respectively fig 1e inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of sod by 41 and 7 respectively compared with the control sample fig 2e in severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation cat activity increased by 56 and 32 respectively table 3 mycorrhiza inoculated plants included the highest content of non enzymatic protection combinations in their leaves under severe water stresses therefore inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of cat enzymes by 33 and 11 respectively compared with the control sample table 3 severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation conditions significantly increased the activity of hp by 17 and 11 respectively table 3 under the optimum irrigation conditions inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis reduced the activity of hp by 36 and 7 respectively compared with the control sample under severe water stress inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis decreased the activity of hp by 46 and 40 respectively compared with the control sample table 3 under severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation pal enzyme activity increased by 40 and 23 respectively table 3 under severe water stress application with the mycorrhizae fungi f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of pal enzyme by 36 and 8 respectively compared with the control sample table 3 under severe water stress compared with the optimum irrigation mda concentration increased by 27 fig 1f compared with the control sample inoculation with applied mycorrhiza fungus reduced mda concentration fig 2f taking the experimental data classified by year the higher concentrations of chlorophylls a and b mycorrhiza colony formation rwc and gpx were observed in the first year whereas the amount of biomass proline content and tss were higher in the second year of the study table 2 the results of the combined analysis of variance in the two year study are presented in table 1 4 discussion the obtained results indicated that biomass and grain yield significantly diminished with increased water stress fig 1a and table 4 the reduction of biomass and grain yield under water stress can be due to the closure of stomata increase in degrading enzymes protein and chlorophyll decomposition which reduces the rate and amount of photosynthesis photosynthetic materials and so on fayyaz and talebi 2009 gholinezhad et al 2010 on the other hand higher biomass and grain yield under the optimum irrigation conditions is probably due to increased spread and duration of the leaf surface resulting in a sufficient physiological source to use as much light as possible and to produce dry matter another reason for the decrease in biomass and grain yield is the reduction of leaf area index in water stress treatments which reduces the absorption of light in the plant community and consequently the dry matter production decreases mehrabi and ehsanzadeh 2011 ayeen 2013 compared with the control sample the amount of biomass and grain yield increased in plants inoculated with both mycorrhiza fungi nonetheless the effect of inoculation was significantly more pronounced for f mosseae fungi table 4 and fig 2a the increased biomass may be attributed to the effect of mycorrhiza on prolonging leaf retention on the plant maintaining and increasing the leaf size and improving the photosynthesis rate because of the increased amount of chlorophyll habibzadeh et al 2012 the effects of mycorrhiza in improving biomass and grain yield under severe water stress were more effective than the optimum irrigation conditions this finding shows that the inoculation of mycorrhiza fungi in sesame plant has improved the water retention status and the plant can modulate and neutralize severe water stress and less antioxidant enzymes are required to eliminate radicals and active oxygen it was observed that by increasing the severity of water stress chlorophylls a and b decreased whereas the concentration of carotenoids increased inoculation with amf as well as irrigation treatment had positive influence on chlorophyll a and b which resulted in the highest content table 3 according to the results plants with the highest biomass showed the maximum chlorophyll a and b content the leaves of amf plants showed higher chlorophyll content in comparison with non amf plants the increased chlorophyll content indicates that the photosynthesis and carbon fixation occur in an increased rate which enable the plant to afford the relationship with mycorrhiza as the cost for this relation is carbon hassanzadeh et al 2009 carotenoids play a crucial role and can facilitate water stress for plants jaleel et al 2009 the highest carotenoids content was observed in plants exposed to sever drought stress and inoculated with r irregularis table 3 which coincides with previously reported results bagheri et al 2013 yosefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 the maximum mycorrhiza colony formation was obtained in sesame plants inoculated by f mosseae and r irregularis under the optimum irrigation table 3 however a falling trend of colonization happened with the severity of water stress from irrigation after 70 110 mm of evaporation in all levels of irrigation application with f mosseae and r irregularis enhanced the mycorrhiza colony formation the decrease of mycorrhiza colony formation with increased water stress in this study was consistent with the literature al karaki et al 2004 by enhancing the severity of water deficit rwc decreased but the amount of proline increased significantly fig 1c d on the other hand inoculation with amf increased rwc but caused the decrease in proline significantly fig 2c d the obtained results agree the with study of mensah et al 2006 a plant with a great relative water content under water stress normally exhibits superior relative water content the less concentration of proline may be ascribed to either high tolerance to water stress or low damage of inoculated plants under water deficit and proline concentration was low in mycorrhizal fungi inoculated plants compared with non inoculated ones wu and xia 2006 it could be observed that the activity of all enzymes increased with the severity of water deficit table 2 the antioxidant activity of plants increases by the induction of oxidative stresses fazeli et al 2007 apx peroxidase and cat enzymes exhibit similar function in the plant s defense system thus removing toxicity effects and the decomposition of h2o2 are the responsibility of these enzymes in cells michiels et al 1994 these enzymes exhibit a substantial function in raising the resistance to oxidative stress in optimum conditions norani azad and chobineh 2008 the increased levels of antioxidants raise plant s tolerance to the stress of environment esfandiari et al 2008 sod converts o2 radicals into h2o2 and the concentration of the sod enzyme increases with tension in the plant an elevation in this enzyme s activity is due to its important role in counteracting the oxygen radicals caused by water stress that damages some of the cellular compositions such as lipids carbohydrates and proteins therefore this enzyme is one of the crucial elemnts of plant defense mechanism under water conditions and it increases under water stress manivannan et al 2008 in water stress treatment compared with optimum irrigation treatment the amount of cat enzyme increased table 3 the reason for the increase in the activity of cat under water stress is the decrease in available water for plant in such condition cat acts as one of the important components of the defense mechanism in the plant davoudi fard et al 2010 in our work under the optimum irrigation and water stress inoculated plants with two types of mycorrhiza fungi f mosseae and r irregularis exhibited the most activity of cat the cat enzyme converts h2o2 into water and oxygen and during this reaction ascorbate acts as a hydrogen receptor hegedus et al 2001 given the oxidative stress h2o2 is harmful and is destroyed by cat enzyme activity an increase in the activity of these enzymes in the leaf with increased water stress indicates that the sesame has benefited from the antioxidant defense mechanism to withstand stress caused by water shortage ajay et al 2002 water deficit leads to progress in the relative concentrations of free oxygen radicals especially hp filippou et al 2011 and the enlargement in catalase activity is a common response to water stress lum et al 2014 possessing great mda content under severe water stress may be attributed to the great mass of hp in plants subjected to water stress which can demonstrate the rate of membrane lipid peroxidation gill and tuteja 2010 however plants colonized with mycorrhiza fungi have lower mda than control plants fig 2f implying that both mycorrhiza fungi are involved in the metabolism of ros mo et al 2016 an enhancement in the tss concentration was observed when sesame plants were exposed to water deficit table 3 water stress can enrich the concentrations of tss in leaves vijayalakshmi et al 2012 the increase in tss may be due to a reduction in the requirement for photosynthetic materials owing to reduced growth the synthesis of these compounds from non photosynthetic pathways and the degradation of insoluble carbohydrates ehdaie et al 2006 under water stress tss can be used to keep the turgor pressure of leaf cells protection of cell membrane and inhibit protein degradation tss also prevents plants from certain deaths via the supply of necessary energy of plants xue et al 2008 it was also found that inoculation with mycorrhiza fungi can increase the amount of tss under three different irrigations regimes mycorrhiza plants using better nutritional relationships compared with non inoculated plants can escape temporary water stress and damage and enhanced photosynthesis resulting in more soluble sugars than non inoculated plants rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017 all enzyme activities were enhanced with increased water stress increased enzyme activities in plants inoculated with mycorrhiza fungi compared with the control sample showed that microorganisms reduced the oxidative injury resulting from water stress table 3 these findings were consistent with previous ones sandhya et al 2009 correlation coefficients among agro biochemical traits and enzymatic antioxidant activity are presented in table 5 significant positive correlations p 0 05 were noted between grain yield and biomass r 0 97 chlorophyll a r 0 57 and root colonization r 0 53 under the optimum and drought stress conditions table 5 the entire enzymatic antioxidant activity indicated significant negative correlations with the grain yield and biomass there were significant positive correlations among all enzymatic antioxidant activities table 5 similar results in some traits in sesame have been reported by kadkhodaie et al 2014 5 conclusions the water shortage had negative impact on biomass grain yield and relative water content on the other hand these traits were significantly enhanced by the inoculation of plants with both applied mycorrhiza fungi an enhancement in the tss concentration was observed in sesame plants inoculated with mycorrhiza fungi and exposed to water deficit all enzyme activities were enhanced with increased water stress increased enzyme activities in inoculated plants compared with the control sample showed that microorganisms reduced the oxidative injury which may help plants to manage the water deficit stress the application of f mosseae showed better properties in reducing the negative effects of

10594,the yield of crops is threatened significantly by drought in various parts of the world the purpose of this paper was to evaluate the potential of mycorrhiza fungi in reducing water stress effect on sesame sesamum indicum l by assessing antioxidant activity the experiment was carried out as a split plot based on a randomized complete block design in two cropping seasons the main factor consisted of different levels of irrigation whereas subplot included two different species of mycorrhiza fungi namely funneliformis mosseae and rhizophagus irregularis applied separately a non inoculated subplot served as the control one plant biomass grain yield amounts of chlorophyll a and b and relative water content decreased with the severity of water stress at the same time the amount of proline malondialdehyde level and enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidants increased significantly severe water stress reduced the biomass and grain yield by approximately 51 and 65 respectively oxidative damage hydrogen peroxide and mda content induced by water stress was significantly reduced in colonized plants compared with the control plot using two species of mycorrhiza fungi caused an increase in biomass grain yield relative water content and all enzymatic and non enzymatic antioxidant activities however the improvement in plant water status led to significantly decreased proline obtained results indicated that mycorrhiza fungi can enhance the enzymatic antioxidant activities that resulted in scavenging free radicals and improving resistance to water stress keywords sesame root colonization proline photosynthetic pigments antioxidant enzymes 1 introduction sesame sesamum indicum l as the oldest oilseed plant is an annual plant and native to warm and semi warm areas improvement of appropriate cultivars has led to its cultivation in most areas worldwide weiss 2000 in iran the cultivated area of sesame and its production is substantial gholinezhad and darvishzadeh 2019 elevated level of biomass is a major issue for breeding targets in all crop plants the quantitative polygenic and composite characteristic products of several agents build up biomass emamgholizadeha et al 2015 the yield of crops is threatened significantly by drought in various parts of the world passioura 2007 sesame like other crops is affected by the shortage of water the growth of sesame and biomass is decreased by extended irrigation intervals as well as the heightened water deficiency mensah et al 2006 eskandari et al 2010 on the other hand providing favorable irrigation conditions brings about the maximum amount of sesame dry matter heidari et al 2011 in mid 80s the best scale to assess plant water situation was suggested to be relative water content rwc thus in place of plant water potential rwc was used to show the equilibrium between attracted water by plant and wasted via transpiration ganji arjenaki et al 2012 proline is capable of playing a protective role beside this it can combine with o2 and free radicals produced under water stress therefore resistance to water deficiency could be one of the functions performed by proline in plants dias et al 2014 enzymatic antioxidative defense system includes various antioxidant enzymes like superoxide dismutase sod catalase cat peroxidase pox and ascorbate peroxidase apx when oxidative stress

activities in sesame yousefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 mycorrhiza is a symbiotic association between a fungus and a plant that is often observed even in dry soil rejali et al 2007 inoculation by am arbuscular mycorrhiza represents an eco friendly and beneficial biological technique aiming to enhance plant resistance to damaging environmental conditions for example drought stress the negative effects of water stress in plants can be modified by mycorrhiza and many authors have reported positive effects such as increase in morphological and physiological parameters compensation of the reduced biomass under water stress increased dry matter weight of mycorrhiza fungi on the symbiotic plants affected by water stress rahimi et al 2009 rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017 mycorrhiza alleviates oxidative stress triggered by water stress by producing more chlorophyll a and b pedranzani et al 2016 on the other hand mo et al 2016 have shown that diminished accumulation of mda h2o2 and o2 was observed in arbuscular mycorrhizal plants contrary to non mycorrhiza plants moreover in comparison to non mycorrhiza plants less sugar was observed in mycorrhiza associated plants under drought conditions porcel and ruiz lozano 2004 the amount of chlorophyll index grew with the inoculation by mycorrhizal fungi in comparison with the absence of mycorrhizal fungi askari 2018 the highest grain yield biomass and harvest index were connected to optimum irrigation compared with suitable irrigation conditions moderate to severe water stress decreased grain yield and biomass rate by 39 4 and 26 7 respectively mycorrhizal symbiosis enhanced all features in comparison with the control sample no mycorrhiza inoculation with funneliformis and rhizoglomus fungi under optimal irrigation and stress conditions enhanced grain yield and biological yield as well in comparison with the control sample askari et al 2019 in general plant inoculation with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi is known to be a reasonable strategy to improve the resistance to water deficit stress since it can upgrade the plant water and nutritional status reducing the stress and thus improving the plant antioxidant activity fernández lizarazo and moreno fonseca 2016 lenoir et al 2016 bahadur et al 2019 despite the increasing interest research on the symbiosis of mycorrhiza fungi with sesame

results 3 1 biomass and grain yield compared with the optimum irrigation severe and moderate water stress reduced the biomass by approximately 51 and 15 respectively fig 1 a a significant difference was observed between the biomass production of plants inoculated with mycorrhiza fungi and the control sample p 0 05 in comparison with the control sample inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis led to increased biomass by approximately 28 and 21 respectively fig 2 a the grain yield was higher in 2015 than in 2016 table 4 mean comparisons based on 2 years data of the traits pointed out that with increased severity of water stress the grain yield decreased significantly so that the severe and moderate water stress in comparison with optimum irrigation reduced grain yield by 65 and 23 respectively table 4 under favorable irrigation conditions inoculation with mycorrhizal fungi f mosseae and r irregularis compared to the non inoculated plants improved the grain yield by 32 and 19 respectively under moderate drought stress conditions inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis compared with the non inoculated plants increased the seed yield about 27 and 20 respectively in severe drought conditions inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis compared with the non inoculated plants increased the grain yield by 44 and 35 table 4 3 2 photosynthetic pigments the comparison of the means in two years indicate that with increased water stress chlorophylls a and b decreased but the total carotenoids increased significantly thus severe and moderate water stress significantly reduced chlorophyll a by 60 and 26 compared with the optimum irrigation respectively p 0 05 table 3 in comparison with the control sample inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis improved chlorophyll a b and carotenoid content in all different irrigation regimes the highest chlorophyll b content was observed under the optimum irrigation conditions and inoculation with the mycorrhiza fungus f mosseae was approximately 0 71 mg g 1 fw figs 1b and 2b respectively the lowest chlorophyll b content at 0 39 mg g 1 fw was observed in the control sample under severe water stress fig 1b the maximum carotenoid content at 4 00 mg g 1 fw was noticed under severe water stress and inoculation with the mycorrhiza fungus f mosseae the minimum carotenoid content at 0 89 mg g 1 fw was obtained under the optimum irrigation and the control non inoculated condition table 3 3 3 mycorrhiza colony formation the results of the mean comparisons based on two successive years data revealed that with increased water stress the mycorrhiza colony formation decreased significantly thus severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation conditions strongly reduced the mycorrhiza colony formation by 39 and 17 respectively on the other hand inoculation with f mosseae under the optimum irrigation conditions improved the mycorrhiza colony formation with the highest 71 08 of table 3 in both cases under moderate and severe water stress the mycorrhiza colony formation grew during inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis when compared with the control sample 3 4 relative water content with increased water stress rwc decreased significantly therefore severe and moderate water stress compared with optimum irrigation reduced rwc by 23 and 25 respectively fig 1c results indicated that compared with the control sample inoculation with the mycorrhiza fungus f mosseae and r irregularis caused an increase in rwc by approximately 35 and 26 respectively fig 2c 3 5 proline a significant difference between the different levels of irrigation on proline content was observed and the highest at 260 08 μmol l 1 and the lowest at 223 45 μmol l 1 of proline were observed under severe water stress and optimum irrigation conditions respectively fig 1d significant differences in proline content between the control sample and plants inoculated with mycorrhiza fungus were found p 0 05 fig 2d inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis decreased the proline content by 21 and 14 respectively compared with the control sample fig 2d 3 6 total soluble sugars content plants exposed to severe drought stress exhibited greater levels of tss compared with plants exposed to optimal irrigation the highest tss at 103 06 mg g 1 fw was noticed in plants inoculated with f mosseae under severe water stress the lowest leaf tss at 21 55 mg g 1 fw was obtained in the control sample under optimum irrigation table 3 with increased water stress soluble sugars increased significantly thus severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation raised the tss by approximately 70 and 49 respectively table 3 under the three different levels of moisture inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis caused an increase in tss compared with the control sample table 3 3 7 antioxidant activities the maximum activity of apx ppo and sod enzymes was achieved under severe water stress and inoculation with f mosseae whereas the minimum activity of apx was observed in the optimum irrigation and the control sample on the other hand there were no notable differences in the activity of apx under optimum irrigation conditions between inoculated plants and the control sample under severe water stress inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of apx by 30 and 4 respectively compared with the control sample table 3 compared with the control sample under severe water stress the use of the mycorrhiza fungi f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of ppo by approximately 38 and 15 respectively table 3 in this experiment with increased water stress the activity of gpx sod cat and pal enzymes and hp and mda increased significantly severe and moderate water stress increased the activity of gpx by 82 and 65 respectively under all different irrigation regimes the application with f mosseae and r irregularis raised the activity of the gpx the activity of sod was higher in the control sample than in the inoculated plants under severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation the activity of the sod enzyme increased by 54 and 35 respectively fig 1e inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of sod by 41 and 7 respectively compared with the control sample fig 2e in severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation cat activity increased by 56 and 32 respectively table 3 mycorrhiza inoculated plants included the highest content of non enzymatic protection combinations in their leaves under severe water stresses therefore inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of cat enzymes by 33 and 11 respectively compared with the control sample table 3 severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation conditions significantly increased the activity of hp by 17 and 11 respectively table 3 under the optimum irrigation conditions inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis reduced the activity of hp by 36 and 7 respectively compared with the control sample under severe water stress inoculation with f mosseae and r irregularis decreased the activity of hp by 46 and 40 respectively compared with the control sample table 3 under severe and moderate water stress compared with the optimum irrigation pal enzyme activity increased by 40 and 23 respectively table 3 under severe water stress application with the mycorrhizae fungi f mosseae and r irregularis increased the activity of pal enzyme by 36 and 8 respectively compared with the control sample table 3 under severe water stress compared with the optimum irrigation mda concentration increased by 27 fig 1f compared with the control sample inoculation with applied mycorrhiza fungus reduced mda concentration fig 2f taking the experimental data classified by year the higher concentrations of chlorophylls a and b mycorrhiza colony formation rwc and gpx were observed in the first year whereas the amount of biomass proline content and tss were higher in the second year of the study table 2 the results of the combined analysis of variance in the two year study are presented in table 1 4 discussion the obtained results indicated that biomass and grain yield significantly diminished with increased water stress fig 1a and table 4 the reduction of biomass and grain yield under water stress can be due to the closure of stomata increase in degrading enzymes protein and chlorophyll decomposition which reduces the rate and amount of photosynthesis photosynthetic materials and so on fayyaz and talebi 2009 gholinezhad et al 2010 on the other hand higher biomass and grain yield under the optimum irrigation conditions is probably due to increased spread and duration of the leaf surface resulting in a sufficient physiological source to use as much light as possible and to produce dry matter another reason for the decrease in biomass and grain yield is the reduction of leaf area index in water stress treatments which reduces the absorption of light in the plant community and consequently the dry matter production decreases mehrabi and ehsanzadeh 2011 ayeen 2013 compared with the control sample the amount of biomass and grain yield increased in plants inoculated with both mycorrhiza fungi nonetheless the effect of inoculation was significantly more pronounced for f mosseae fungi table 4 and fig 2a the increased biomass may be attributed to the effect of mycorrhiza on prolonging leaf retention on the plant maintaining and increasing the leaf size and improving the photosynthesis rate because of the increased amount of chlorophyll habibzadeh et al 2012 the effects of mycorrhiza in improving biomass and grain yield under severe water stress were more effective than the optimum irrigation conditions this finding shows that the inoculation of mycorrhiza fungi in sesame plant has improved the water retention status and the plant can modulate and neutralize severe water stress and less antioxidant enzymes are required to eliminate radicals and active oxygen it was observed that by increasing the severity of water stress chlorophylls a and b decreased whereas the concentration of carotenoids increased inoculation with amf as well as irrigation treatment had positive influence on chlorophyll a and b which resulted in the highest content table 3 according to the results plants with the highest biomass showed the maximum chlorophyll a and b content the leaves of amf plants showed higher chlorophyll content in comparison with non amf plants the increased chlorophyll content indicates that the photosynthesis and carbon fixation occur in an increased rate which enable the plant to afford the relationship with mycorrhiza as the cost for this relation is carbon hassanzadeh et al 2009 carotenoids play a crucial role and can facilitate water stress for plants jaleel et al 2009 the highest carotenoids content was observed in plants exposed to sever drought stress and inoculated with r irregularis table 3 which coincides with previously reported results bagheri et al 2013 yosefzadeh najafabadi and ehsanzadeh 2017 the maximum mycorrhiza colony formation was obtained in sesame plants inoculated by f mosseae and r irregularis under the optimum irrigation table 3 however a falling trend of colonization happened with the severity of water stress from irrigation after 70 110 mm of evaporation in all levels of irrigation application with f mosseae and r irregularis enhanced the mycorrhiza colony formation the decrease of mycorrhiza colony formation with increased water stress in this study was consistent with the literature al karaki et al 2004 by enhancing the severity of water deficit rwc decreased but the amount of proline increased significantly fig 1c d on the other hand inoculation with amf increased rwc but caused the decrease in proline significantly fig 2c d the obtained results agree the with study of mensah et al 2006 a plant with a great relative water content under water stress normally exhibits superior relative water content the less concentration of proline may be ascribed to either high tolerance to water stress or low damage of inoculated plants under water deficit and proline concentration was low in mycorrhizal fungi inoculated plants compared with non inoculated ones wu and xia 2006 it could be observed that the activity of all enzymes increased with the severity of water deficit table 2 the antioxidant activity of plants increases by the induction of oxidative stresses fazeli et al 2007 apx peroxidase and cat enzymes exhibit similar function in the plant s defense system thus removing toxicity effects and the decomposition of h2o2 are the responsibility of these enzymes in cells michiels et al 1994 these enzymes exhibit a substantial function in raising the resistance to oxidative stress in optimum conditions norani azad and chobineh 2008 the increased levels of antioxidants raise plant s tolerance to the stress of environment esfandiari et al 2008 sod converts o2 radicals into h2o2 and the concentration of the sod enzyme increases with tension in the plant an elevation in this enzyme s activity is due to its important role in counteracting the oxygen radicals caused by water stress that damages some of the cellular compositions such as lipids carbohydrates and proteins therefore this enzyme is one of the crucial elemnts of plant defense mechanism under water conditions and it increases under water stress manivannan et al 2008 in water stress treatment compared with optimum irrigation treatment the amount of cat enzyme increased table 3 the reason for the increase in the activity of cat under water stress is the decrease in available water for plant in such condition cat acts as one of the important components of the defense mechanism in the plant davoudi fard et al 2010 in our work under the optimum irrigation and water stress inoculated plants with two types of mycorrhiza fungi f mosseae and r irregularis exhibited the most activity of cat the cat enzyme converts h2o2 into water and oxygen and during this reaction ascorbate acts as a hydrogen receptor hegedus et al 2001 given the oxidative stress h2o2 is harmful and is destroyed by cat enzyme activity an increase in the activity of these enzymes in the leaf with increased water stress indicates that the sesame has benefited from the antioxidant defense mechanism to withstand stress caused by water shortage ajay et al 2002 water deficit leads to progress in the relative concentrations of free oxygen radicals especially hp filippou et al 2011 and the enlargement in catalase activity is a common response to water stress lum et al 2014 possessing great mda content under severe water stress may be attributed to the great mass of hp in plants subjected to water stress which can demonstrate the rate of membrane lipid peroxidation gill and tuteja 2010 however plants colonized with mycorrhiza fungi have lower mda than control plants fig 2f implying that both mycorrhiza fungi are involved in the metabolism of ros mo et al 2016 an enhancement in the tss concentration was observed when sesame plants were exposed to water deficit table 3 water stress can enrich the concentrations of tss in leaves vijayalakshmi et al 2012 the increase in tss may be due to a reduction in the requirement for photosynthetic materials owing to reduced growth the synthesis of these compounds from non photosynthetic pathways and the degradation of insoluble carbohydrates ehdaie et al 2006 under water stress tss can be used to keep the turgor pressure of leaf cells protection of cell membrane and inhibit protein degradation tss also prevents plants from certain deaths via the supply of necessary energy of plants xue et al 2008 it was also found that inoculation with mycorrhiza fungi can increase the amount of tss under three different irrigations regimes mycorrhiza plants using better nutritional relationships compared with non inoculated plants can escape temporary water stress and damage and enhanced photosynthesis resulting in more soluble sugars than non inoculated plants rahimzadeh and pirzad 2017 all enzyme activities were enhanced with increased water stress increased enzyme activities in plants inoculated with mycorrhiza fungi compared with the control sample showed that microorganisms reduced the oxidative injury resulting from water stress table 3 these findings were consistent with previous ones sandhya et al 2009 correlation coefficients among agro biochemical traits and enzymatic antioxidant activity are presented in table 5 significant positive correlations p 0 05 were noted between grain yield and biomass r 0 97 chlorophyll a r 0 57 and root colonization r 0 53 under the optimum and drought stress conditions table 5 the entire enzymatic antioxidant activity indicated significant negative correlations with the grain yield and biomass there were significant positive correlations among all enzymatic antioxidant activities table 5 similar results in some traits in sesame have been reported by kadkhodaie et al 2014 5 conclusions the water shortage had negative impact on biomass grain yield and relative water content on the other hand these traits were significantly enhanced by the inoculation of plants with both applied mycorrhiza fungi an enhancement in the tss concentration was observed in sesame plants inoculated with mycorrhiza fungi and exposed to water deficit all enzyme activities were enhanced with increased water stress increased enzyme activities in inoculated plants compared with the control sample showed that microorganisms reduced the oxidative injury which may help plants to manage the water deficit stress the application of f mosseae showed better properties in reducing the negative effects of
