8875,regulating the plastic film mulching duration was a good strategy to decrease plastic residues and to avoid the stress from low soil nitrate concentration snc however few studies focused on soil nitrogen dynamic under different mulching durations especially for the impacts of soil nitrogen loss on crop yield and comprehensive benefits have not been revealed in this study hydrus 2d 3d model was used to evaluate the differences of snc and no3 n leaching nl under no mulching nm mulching for the seedling stage pms mulching for the elongation stage pme mulching for the tasseling stage pmt and mulching for the entire corn growth season pmw additionally a two year 2019 2020 field experiment was carried out to measure snc nl n2o and nh3 emissions and to calibrate and validate the model accuracy the effect of soil nitrogen loss on the comprehensive benefits under different mulching durations was further analyzed using a comprehensive multi objective model the results showed that hydrus 2d 3d could well capture snc dynamic under different mulching treatments with average the normalized root mean square error of 16 5 in the validation period there was no apparent difference in snc n2o emission nh3 emission and nl under different mulching durations in the seedling stage however the corresponding difference markedly increased with corn growth and development especially in 2019 the average snc 0 20 cm soil depth under nm was higher by 9 2 25 0 21 2 and 19 4 than pms pme pmt and pmw respectively nitrogen emission n2o and nh3 showed an increase trend with the shortening of mulching duration i e nm pms pme pmt pmw while an opposite trend was found for nl in general pme was found to be the optimal mulching duration with the highest comprehensive evaluation score of 1782 7 therefore pme can be recommended to apply in this region to promote the developments of sustainable agriculture keywords plastic film mulching soil nitrogen dynamic corn yield hydrus 2d 3d comprehensive evaluation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic film mulching pm has been known to decrease ammonia nh3 volatilization loss by restricting gas transportation in the soil atmosphere continuous system chae et al 2022 chen et al 2022 fang et al 2022 núñez zofío et al 2011 also this improved the crop nitrogen uptake namaghi et al 2018 which eventually promoted crop development and assimilation thakur kumar 2020 lee et al 2021 worldwide the technology has been extensively applied in agricultural production especially in semi arid and arid regions with low air temperature ali et al 2021 blanco et al 2018 graefe et al 2005 however the cumulative plastic film use which is mostly made up of polyethylene may disperse plastic residues and micro plastic into the environment beriot et al 2020 furthermore this waste accumulation of hazardous materials may cause soil compaction and degradation iqbal et al 2020 liu et al 2021 studies showed that poor venting quality of the plastic film and long duration of usage increased nitrogen leaching and decreased soil nitrogen concentration that limited the crop nitrogen uptake reay et al 2023 therefore developing a plastic film mulching technology that could effectively solve this problem was highly anticipated although biodegradable film was the widely recommended alternative material to plastic film braunack et al 2021 chen et al 2023 immirzi et al 2009 their application was largely restricted by unpredictable disintegration rate and cost effectiveness presently owing to superior operability and low cost regulating the duration of pm was regarded as a much better strategy zhao et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 moreover plastic film after a long mulching duration was hard to recycle due to its weak strength resulting in a host of plastic residues and micro plastic storage in the field thus it was suggested that a short duration of pm decreased the plastic residual rate hu et al 2019 also the optimized mulching duration could effectively protect crop growth and root development from the stress caused by low soil nitrate concentration snc dong et al 2019 li et al 2014 li et al 2008 previous studies illustrated that mulching for the elongation stage could enhance microbial biomass and soil fertility reduce evapotranspiration and increase crop yield li et al 2004b hou et al 2010 wang et al 2009 although several previous studies revealed the variation of the agricultural ecosystem under different durations of plastic film mulching these studies were limited to the crop physiology li et al 2004a c wang et al 2009 the effects of mulching duration on snc nitrous oxide n2o emission nh3 emission and no3 n leaching nl dynamics were yet unknown furthermore the previous researches mainly carried out in the field experiment which was time consuming and costly and was difficult to obtain a series of continuous experimental data as an alternative mathematical models could be chosen to simulate soil nitrogen dynamic thereby providing further details on the dynamics of snc n2o emission nh3 emission and nl widely used mathematical models include the swap van dam et al 1997 the rzwq ma et al 2008 the dndc li 1992 and the hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 among these models the hydrus model has been widely used to capture soil water and nitrogen dynamics due to its flexibility in accommodating different types of boundary conditions kassaye et al 2021 del campo et al 2021 phogat et al 2020 a comprehensive evaluation from the economic and environmental perspective was lacking current comprehensive evaluation methods mainly include the analytic hierarchy process saaty and wong 1983 the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process azadeh zadeh 2015 and the entropy method wang et al 2021b among these the entropy method was often used for its convenience and speeded to estimate the risk activity of the objects especially for multi objective comprehensive analysis of the agriculture economy and environment however previous studies mainly evaluated the agriculture economy benefit under no mulching akbari et al 2020 few studies performed the comprehensive evaluation of multi objective i e economy and environment for agricultural production under different mulching durations notably the accuracy of estimation for agricultural benefits under different mulching durations was vital for the development of optimal mulching strategy and sustainable agriculture therefore the objectives of this study were to quantify the soil nitrogen dynamic using hydrus 2d 3d model and determine the appropriate mulching duration under different mulching durations by evaluating the comprehensive benefits of agricultural production we hypothesized that 1 nl may decrease as the shortening of mulching duration due to intense soil evaporation while snc and nitrogen emission may increase due to a decrease of corn nitrogen uptake 2 the highest comprehensive benefits may appear among mulching for the seedling stage pms mulching for the elongation stage pme and mulching for the tasseling stage pmt treatments since they have high environmental benefit the aim of this study was to seek an optimal mulching duration that could effectively promote the sustainable agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area and experiment all field

hydrus 2d 3d model 2 3 1 modeling introduction in this study hydrus 2d 3d model was used to simulate soil nitrogen dynamic under five different mulching durations the model was a multi purpose finite element model developed to simulate the movements of water temperature and solute in variably saturated porous media under various irregular and complex boundary conditions it mainly solved the richards equation for variably saturated water flow and advection dispersion equations for solute transport more theoretical part of the model could be found in šimůnek et al 2016 2 3 2 modeling parameters modeling domain was divided into three layers 0 20 20 40 and 40 100 cm soil hydraulic parameters for different layers were initially estimated using the neural network method schaap et al 2001 from the soil textural information and the bulk density table 1 these parameters were then adjusted using a marquart levenberg type parameter optimization algorithm in hydrus 2d 3d and the algorithm was directly implemented into the hydrus 2d 3d code this study assumed that only nh4 n adsorbed and no3 n existed only in the dissolved phase thus the distribution coefficient k d was set to 0 and 3 5 cm3 g 1 for no3 n and nh4 n respectively hanson et al 2006 the hydrolysis coefficient volatilization coefficient and nitrification coefficient in silt soil were set to 1 1 0 14 and 5 2 d 1 respectively castaldelli et al 2018 however the denitrification process was neglected in this study due to aerobic condition ravikumar et al 2011 additionally immobilization and mineralization in silt soil were also neglected similarly as in many other studies e g ramos et al 2012 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 soil longitudinal and transversal dispersivities d l and d t respectively were needed to determine the components of the dispersion tensor longitudinal dispersivities d l were set to 30 20 and 21 cm for 0 20 20 40 and 40 100 cm soil layers respectively and the transverse dispersivity d t was further taken as one tenth of d l hanson al 2006 ramos et al 2012 molecular dispersivity coefficient of no3 n was 0 068 cm2 h 1 hanson et al 2006 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the observed swc and snc in the 0 100 cm soil layer at the beginning of the simulation period were taken as the initial conditions in the model four boundaries were defined in hydrus 2d 3d i e the upper boundary the bottom boundary and two lateral boundaries fig 1 before removing the plastic film the upper boundary included up to one time variable flux no flow boundary condition and one atmospheric boundary condition to represent wetted area below the dripper mulching region and bare area respectively however after removing the plastic film the no flow boundary in the mulching region would be changed into the atmospheric boundary and the other boundary was not changed the time variable pressure head boundary condition was specified at the bottom of the flow domain in addition the no flow boundary condition was prescribed on the left and right sides of the domain the third type cauchy boundary condition and the second type neumann boundary condition were used for solute transport at the upper and bottom boundary respectively additionally potential evaporation e p and transpiration t p were needed in hydrus 2d 3d and they were calculated from potential evapotranspiration using beer s law based on leaf area index chen et al 2020 the emitter flux in hydrus 2d 3d was calculated using the following equation skaggs et al 2004 7 q q l 2 π r where q is the emitter flux q is the emitter discharge l is the distance between emitters and r is the radius of the emitter 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical difference under different mulching durations was determined by analysis of

pmw in 2019 were firstly used to calibrate model parameters and the corresponding data in 2020 were used to validate the model accuracy table 2 the results showed that hydrus 2d 3d could well capture soil water and nitrate dynamics under different mulching durations in calibration period 2019 the average r 2 d nmre nrmse under different mulching durations were 0 85 0 87 8 2 10 3 respectively for swc and r 2 d nmre nrmse were 0 85 0 91 11 5 14 1 respectively for snc the agreement between simulated and observed values was similarly good in the validation period with average r 2 d nmre nrmse of 0 80 0 84 10 2 and 14 2 respectively for swc and r 2 d nmre nrmse of 0 78 0 82 12 9 and 16 5 receptively for snc additionally the average error in both years between the simulated value and the measured value in terms of residual nitrogen in the soil was only 1 7 kg ha 1 under different mulching treatments table 3 in general hydrus 2d 3d could precisely capture the swc and snc dynamics under different mulching durations 3 2 effect of mulching duration on soil nitrate dynamic simulated snc within 0 100 cm soil layer increased with a decrease in mulching duration showing a trend of nm pms pmw pmt pme fig 5 in the growing season of 2019 the average snc 0 20 cm soil layer under nm was 16 34 mg kg 1 which was higher by 9 2 25 0 21 2 and19 4 than pms pme pmt and pmw respectively in the 20 40 cm soil layer snc under different mulching durations was close to pmw except for nm and pms fig 5 snc under pme and pmt was lower by 3 3 and 2 4 than pmw in 2019 respectively additionally the snc behaved the same between the 40 100 and 20 40 cm soil layers in the 40 100 cm soil layer snc under nm was significantly higher than other treatments except for pms especially in the maturity stage snc under nm was higher by 95 4 73 9 and 67 1 than pme pmt and pmw respectively interestingly in 2020 the difference in snc was observed only in the 0 20 cm soil layer here snc under nm and pms was higher by 12 1 and 10 5 than pmw respectively and snc under pme and pmt was lowered by 5 7 and 2 1 than pmw respectively there was no apparent difference in snc in the 20 40 and 40 100 cm soil layers average snc within 20 100 cm soil depth under nm pms pme pmt and pmw were 2 12 1 76 1 41 1 76 and 1 76 mg kg 1 respectively 3 3 observed n 2 o and nh 3 emissions under different mulching durations the apparent temporal differences in n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching durations were found in different corn growth stages fig 6 in the seedling stage there was no significant difference in n2o emission under different mulching durations however n2o emission under nm was significantly higher than that of mulching treatments and average n2o emission in both years under nm was higher by 41 7 41 6 45 0 and 42 8 than pms pme pmt and pmw p 0 05 respectively meanwhile the highest nh3 emission occurred in the pms among different mulching durations in the elongation stage average nh3 emission in both years under pms was higher by 17 0 16 5 and 19 0 than pme pmt and pmw respectively but it still was 21 7 lower than that of nm the significant differences in n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching treatments were found in the tasseling and filling stages the highest n2o and nh3 emissions occurred in pms treatment under different mulching duration average n2o emission in both years under pms was higher by 19 8 48 3 and 57 3 than pme pmt and pmw p 0 05 respectively and was higher by 18 8 30 7 and 37 0 for nh3 emission however n2o and nh3 emissions under pms were 17 3 and 18 8 significantly lower than that of nm in the maturity stage n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching durations were no significant difference p 0 05 except for pmw 3 4 simulated no 3 n leaching nl under different mulching durations an opposite trend in simulated nl was found compared with observed n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching durations and the highest nl occurred in pmw treatment fig 7 however there was a significantly temporal difference in nl in 2019 and 2020 in 2019 the difference in nl under different mulching durations mainly occurred in the elongation and tasseling stages average nl under pmw was higher by 64 8 37 7 21 1 and 12 8 than nm pms pme and pmt in 2019 respectively however the highest difference in nl under different mulching treatments mainly occurred in the seedling and elongation stages in 2020 average nl under pmw was higher by 87 9 74 5 33 4 and 18 1 than nm pms pme and pmt in 2020 respectively in general the average cumulative no3 n leaching in both years under pmw was higher by 41 5 27 6 15 3 and 9 9 than nm pms pme and pmt respectively fig 7 3 5 comprehensive benefits analysis for different mulching durations the result of comprehensive benefits analysis showed that among economic indicators the entropy value ej of y was the highest 0 72 while ej of nue was the lowest 0 65 table 4 also ej of nl was higher than that of n2o and nh3 emissions in general ej of nl was the highest 0 75 among all evaluation indicators but its weight wj was only 0 15 the largest wj occurred in nue 0 20 indicating the importance of nue over other indicators additionally the individual evaluation score si of nue y roi observed n2o emission observed nh3 emission and simulated nl under different mulching durations were 8 9 11 1 943 0 1766 9 0 10 0 31 0 06 0 17 2 8 5 1 and 0 42 0 70 respectively the highest and lowest comprehensive evaluation score sc occurred under pme 1782 7 and nm 957 6 respectively overall these results suggest that pme was the optimal mulching treatment in this region 4 discussion 4 1 mulching duration affected the dynamics of soil water and nitrogen to evade stress from low snc and obtain a higher yield the strategy of removing pm at the specific corn growth stage was a widely adopted agricultural practice li et al 2004a hou et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 the mulching duration has emerged as a crucial factor li et al 2004b li et al 2008 usually the stresses of low swc and high snc occurred in a shorter mulching duration condition due to weak root nitrogen uptake ability in the intense soil evaporation condition wang et al 2009 kader et al 2019 however the stresses of high swc and low snc may occur in a longer mulching duration condition due to low soil evaporation stronger root nitrogen uptake and low nitrogen fertilizer application amount especially in the maturity stage wang et al 2009 chen et al 2020 the main reason was that the plastic film mulching cut off the water vapor transport between surface soil and the atmosphere which dramatically increased the surface swc but decreased surface snc in the tasseling filling and maturity stages in this study we obtained similar results snc under nm and pms was higher by 12 1 and 10 5 than pmw p 0 05 in 2020 meanwhile n2o emissions would be limited due to the denitrification of surface snc giles et al 2012 mathieu et al 2006 niu et al 2019 also the higher soil water potential and snc promoted nl under longer mulching durations compared to shorter mulching durations especially in the seedling and elongation stages chen et al 2020 for instance this study found that nl under pmw was higher by 20 6 than nm fig 7 additionally the difference in snc among different treatments in the surface soil layer was higher than that in the deep soil layer the phenomenon was also caused by limitation the water vapor in surface soil layer under pm surface snc was migrated into the deeper soil layer along with the downward movement of surface swc and resulted in the difference of snc among different treatments in 20 40 cm soil layer however in the deep soil layer 40 100 cm the snc difference among different treatments was negligible since swc was not obviously affected by pm in general snc dynamics in the deep soil layer was mainly controlled by irrigation and rainfall events rather than mulching eneji et al 2013 hurtado et al 2011 mastrocicco et al 2019 furthermore snc under the protracted duration of mulching treatment pmt and pmw was higher than under pme however the significant differences in n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching treatments were found in the tasseling and filling stages since higher soil microbial and enzymatic activities promoted the soil nitrogen transformation in this stage chen et al 2021a 2021b in general a comparison of soil environment under different mulching treatments revealed that pme was the optimal mulching duration for corn pme could effectively increase corn nitrogen uptake by improving soil enzyme activity and root permeability jiang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 4 2 comprehensive benefits analysis the altered soil nitrogen dynamics under different mulching treatments affected the comprehensive benefits zhao et al 2012 in general only pme produced optimal snc for best root growth in corn under different mulching durations it not only provided the suitable snc for germ development in the seedling stage but also prevented the nitrogen stress in the tasseling and filling stages the cause of this phenomenon was that soil enzyme activity and root permeability were significantly improved under pme scenario which promoted the ability of corn roots to uptake nitrate jiang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 moreover although the evaluation score of environmental benefits under pme was not the highest among different mulching treatments table 4 it offered specific advantages compared with nm and pmw for example n2o and nh3 emissions under pme were lower by 34 9 and 28 2 than nm respectively since plastic film limited the gas emission by cutting off the gas transport between soil body and atmosphere due to its low gas permeability ali et al 2021 berger et al 2013 however nl under pme was lower by 24 4 than pmw due to relatively short mulching duration the phenomenon could be attributed to a decrease in surface soil water potential after removing the plastic film which reduced the water potential gradient between the shallow and deep soil depths meanwhile nl also decreased in response to a decline in water potential gradient chen et al 2020 for example nl increased in response to a decrease of groundwater level in the same corn growth season however there was an apparent difference in the nl in 2019 and 2020 although groundwater level in 2019 was deeper than 2020 nl in 2019 was higher than that of 2020 the reason was mainly attributed to higher irrigation depth in 2019 compared to 2020 the water potential gradient difference between shallow soil layer and groundwater in 2019 was apparently higher than 2020 which promoted nl along with drainage increasing however corn yield and corresponding benefit were not much different between pmt and pmw due to significantly prolonged mulching in pmt this decreased the water vapor flux in the soil plant atmosphere continuum and decreased n2o and nh3 emissions in the filling and maturity stages on similar lines hou et al 2010 reported that the crop yield was the same if mulching was prolonged pme pmt pmf and pmw all produced similar crop yields in general the comprehensive evaluation score sc of pme was the highest therefore we suggested that pme was the optimal mulching treatment in this region 5 conclusion the impacts of soil nitrogen loss on crop yield and comprehensive benefits have not been revealed to save the above problem hydrus 2d 3d model was used to evaluate the differences of soil nitrogen dynamics under different mulching durations this study found that hydrus 2d 3d model could well capture soil nitrate dynamics under different mulching treatments in the validation period there were no apparent differences in soil nitrate concentration n2o emission nh3 emission and no3 n leaching under different mulching treatments in the seedling stage due to the similar root nitrogen uptake ability however the corresponding difference markedly increased with corn growth and development since the difference of root nitrogen uptake increased especially in 2019 nitrogen emission n2o and nh3 showed an increase trend with the shortening of mulching duration while an opposite trend was found for no3 n leaching the phenomenon was caused by limitation the gas transport in surface soil layer under plastic film mulching in general mulching for the elongation stage pme treatment was found to be the optimal mulching duration with the highest comprehensive evaluation score therefore in this region pme could be applied to promote the development of sustainable agriculture the findings of this study improved the understanding of the mechanisms of nitrogen use for the corn field under plastic film

8875,regulating the plastic film mulching duration was a good strategy to decrease plastic residues and to avoid the stress from low soil nitrate concentration snc however few studies focused on soil nitrogen dynamic under different mulching durations especially for the impacts of soil nitrogen loss on crop yield and comprehensive benefits have not been revealed in this study hydrus 2d 3d model was used to evaluate the differences of snc and no3 n leaching nl under no mulching nm mulching for the seedling stage pms mulching for the elongation stage pme mulching for the tasseling stage pmt and mulching for the entire corn growth season pmw additionally a two year 2019 2020 field experiment was carried out to measure snc nl n2o and nh3 emissions and to calibrate and validate the model accuracy the effect of soil nitrogen loss on the comprehensive benefits under different mulching durations was further analyzed using a comprehensive multi objective model the results showed that hydrus 2d 3d could well capture snc dynamic under different mulching treatments with average the normalized root mean square error of 16 5 in the validation period there was no apparent difference in snc n2o emission nh3 emission and nl under different mulching durations in the seedling stage however the corresponding difference markedly increased with corn growth and development especially in 2019 the average snc 0 20 cm soil depth under nm was higher by 9 2 25 0 21 2 and 19 4 than pms pme pmt and pmw respectively nitrogen emission n2o and nh3 showed an increase trend with the shortening of mulching duration i e nm pms pme pmt pmw while an opposite trend was found for nl in general pme was found to be the optimal mulching duration with the highest comprehensive evaluation score of 1782 7 therefore pme can be recommended to apply in this region to promote the developments of sustainable agriculture keywords plastic film mulching soil nitrogen dynamic corn yield hydrus 2d 3d comprehensive evaluation data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction plastic film mulching pm has been known to decrease ammonia nh3 volatilization loss by restricting gas transportation in the soil atmosphere continuous system chae et al 2022 chen et al 2022 fang et al 2022 núñez zofío et al 2011 also this improved the crop nitrogen uptake namaghi et al 2018 which eventually promoted crop development and assimilation thakur kumar 2020 lee et al 2021 worldwide the technology has been extensively applied in agricultural production especially in semi arid and arid regions with low air temperature ali et al 2021 blanco et al 2018 graefe et al 2005 however the cumulative plastic film use which is mostly made up of polyethylene may disperse plastic residues and micro plastic into the environment beriot et al 2020 furthermore this waste accumulation of hazardous materials may cause soil compaction and degradation iqbal et al 2020 liu et al 2021 studies showed that poor venting quality of the plastic film and long duration of usage increased nitrogen leaching and decreased soil nitrogen concentration that limited the crop nitrogen uptake reay et al 2023 therefore developing a plastic film mulching technology that could effectively solve this problem was highly anticipated although biodegradable film was the widely recommended alternative material to plastic film braunack et al 2021 chen et al 2023 immirzi et al 2009 their application was largely restricted by unpredictable disintegration rate and cost effectiveness presently owing to superior operability and low cost regulating the duration of pm was regarded as a much better strategy zhao et al 2012 zhang et al 2014 moreover plastic film after a long mulching duration was hard to recycle due to its weak strength resulting in a host of plastic residues and micro plastic storage in the field thus it was suggested that a short duration of pm decreased the plastic residual rate hu et al 2019 also the optimized mulching duration could effectively protect crop growth and root development from the stress caused by low soil nitrate concentration snc dong et al 2019 li et al 2014 li et al 2008 previous studies illustrated that mulching for the elongation stage could enhance microbial biomass and soil fertility reduce evapotranspiration and increase crop yield li et al 2004b hou et al 2010 wang et al 2009 although several previous studies revealed the variation of the agricultural ecosystem under different durations of plastic film mulching these studies were limited to the crop physiology li et al 2004a c wang et al 2009 the effects of mulching duration on snc nitrous oxide n2o emission nh3 emission and no3 n leaching nl dynamics were yet unknown furthermore the previous researches mainly carried out in the field experiment which was time consuming and costly and was difficult to obtain a series of continuous experimental data as an alternative mathematical models could be chosen to simulate soil nitrogen dynamic thereby providing further details on the dynamics of snc n2o emission nh3 emission and nl widely used mathematical models include the swap van dam et al 1997 the rzwq ma et al 2008 the dndc li 1992 and the hydrus šimůnek et al 2016 among these models the hydrus model has been widely used to capture soil water and nitrogen dynamics due to its flexibility in accommodating different types of boundary conditions kassaye et al 2021 del campo et al 2021 phogat et al 2020 a comprehensive evaluation from the economic and environmental perspective was lacking current comprehensive evaluation methods mainly include the analytic hierarchy process saaty and wong 1983 the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process azadeh zadeh 2015 and the entropy method wang et al 2021b among these the entropy method was often used for its convenience and speeded to estimate the risk activity of the objects especially for multi objective comprehensive analysis of the agriculture economy and environment however previous studies mainly evaluated the agriculture economy benefit under no mulching akbari et al 2020 few studies performed the comprehensive evaluation of multi objective i e economy and environment for agricultural production under different mulching durations notably the accuracy of estimation for agricultural benefits under different mulching durations was vital for the development of optimal mulching strategy and sustainable agriculture therefore the objectives of this study were to quantify the soil nitrogen dynamic using hydrus 2d 3d model and determine the appropriate mulching duration under different mulching durations by evaluating the comprehensive benefits of agricultural production we hypothesized that 1 nl may decrease as the shortening of mulching duration due to intense soil evaporation while snc and nitrogen emission may increase due to a decrease of corn nitrogen uptake 2 the highest comprehensive benefits may appear among mulching for the seedling stage pms mulching for the elongation stage pme and mulching for the tasseling stage pmt treatments since they have high environmental benefit the aim of this study was to seek an optimal mulching duration that could effectively promote the sustainable agriculture 2 materials and methods 2 1 description of the study area and experiment all field

hydrus 2d 3d model 2 3 1 modeling introduction in this study hydrus 2d 3d model was used to simulate soil nitrogen dynamic under five different mulching durations the model was a multi purpose finite element model developed to simulate the movements of water temperature and solute in variably saturated porous media under various irregular and complex boundary conditions it mainly solved the richards equation for variably saturated water flow and advection dispersion equations for solute transport more theoretical part of the model could be found in šimůnek et al 2016 2 3 2 modeling parameters modeling domain was divided into three layers 0 20 20 40 and 40 100 cm soil hydraulic parameters for different layers were initially estimated using the neural network method schaap et al 2001 from the soil textural information and the bulk density table 1 these parameters were then adjusted using a marquart levenberg type parameter optimization algorithm in hydrus 2d 3d and the algorithm was directly implemented into the hydrus 2d 3d code this study assumed that only nh4 n adsorbed and no3 n existed only in the dissolved phase thus the distribution coefficient k d was set to 0 and 3 5 cm3 g 1 for no3 n and nh4 n respectively hanson et al 2006 the hydrolysis coefficient volatilization coefficient and nitrification coefficient in silt soil were set to 1 1 0 14 and 5 2 d 1 respectively castaldelli et al 2018 however the denitrification process was neglected in this study due to aerobic condition ravikumar et al 2011 additionally immobilization and mineralization in silt soil were also neglected similarly as in many other studies e g ramos et al 2012 tafteh and sepaskhah 2012 soil longitudinal and transversal dispersivities d l and d t respectively were needed to determine the components of the dispersion tensor longitudinal dispersivities d l were set to 30 20 and 21 cm for 0 20 20 40 and 40 100 cm soil layers respectively and the transverse dispersivity d t was further taken as one tenth of d l hanson al 2006 ramos et al 2012 molecular dispersivity coefficient of no3 n was 0 068 cm2 h 1 hanson et al 2006 2 3 3 initial and boundary conditions the observed swc and snc in the 0 100 cm soil layer at the beginning of the simulation period were taken as the initial conditions in the model four boundaries were defined in hydrus 2d 3d i e the upper boundary the bottom boundary and two lateral boundaries fig 1 before removing the plastic film the upper boundary included up to one time variable flux no flow boundary condition and one atmospheric boundary condition to represent wetted area below the dripper mulching region and bare area respectively however after removing the plastic film the no flow boundary in the mulching region would be changed into the atmospheric boundary and the other boundary was not changed the time variable pressure head boundary condition was specified at the bottom of the flow domain in addition the no flow boundary condition was prescribed on the left and right sides of the domain the third type cauchy boundary condition and the second type neumann boundary condition were used for solute transport at the upper and bottom boundary respectively additionally potential evaporation e p and transpiration t p were needed in hydrus 2d 3d and they were calculated from potential evapotranspiration using beer s law based on leaf area index chen et al 2020 the emitter flux in hydrus 2d 3d was calculated using the following equation skaggs et al 2004 7 q q l 2 π r where q is the emitter flux q is the emitter discharge l is the distance between emitters and r is the radius of the emitter 2 4 statistical analysis the statistical difference under different mulching durations was determined by analysis of

pmw in 2019 were firstly used to calibrate model parameters and the corresponding data in 2020 were used to validate the model accuracy table 2 the results showed that hydrus 2d 3d could well capture soil water and nitrate dynamics under different mulching durations in calibration period 2019 the average r 2 d nmre nrmse under different mulching durations were 0 85 0 87 8 2 10 3 respectively for swc and r 2 d nmre nrmse were 0 85 0 91 11 5 14 1 respectively for snc the agreement between simulated and observed values was similarly good in the validation period with average r 2 d nmre nrmse of 0 80 0 84 10 2 and 14 2 respectively for swc and r 2 d nmre nrmse of 0 78 0 82 12 9 and 16 5 receptively for snc additionally the average error in both years between the simulated value and the measured value in terms of residual nitrogen in the soil was only 1 7 kg ha 1 under different mulching treatments table 3 in general hydrus 2d 3d could precisely capture the swc and snc dynamics under different mulching durations 3 2 effect of mulching duration on soil nitrate dynamic simulated snc within 0 100 cm soil layer increased with a decrease in mulching duration showing a trend of nm pms pmw pmt pme fig 5 in the growing season of 2019 the average snc 0 20 cm soil layer under nm was 16 34 mg kg 1 which was higher by 9 2 25 0 21 2 and19 4 than pms pme pmt and pmw respectively in the 20 40 cm soil layer snc under different mulching durations was close to pmw except for nm and pms fig 5 snc under pme and pmt was lower by 3 3 and 2 4 than pmw in 2019 respectively additionally the snc behaved the same between the 40 100 and 20 40 cm soil layers in the 40 100 cm soil layer snc under nm was significantly higher than other treatments except for pms especially in the maturity stage snc under nm was higher by 95 4 73 9 and 67 1 than pme pmt and pmw respectively interestingly in 2020 the difference in snc was observed only in the 0 20 cm soil layer here snc under nm and pms was higher by 12 1 and 10 5 than pmw respectively and snc under pme and pmt was lowered by 5 7 and 2 1 than pmw respectively there was no apparent difference in snc in the 20 40 and 40 100 cm soil layers average snc within 20 100 cm soil depth under nm pms pme pmt and pmw were 2 12 1 76 1 41 1 76 and 1 76 mg kg 1 respectively 3 3 observed n 2 o and nh 3 emissions under different mulching durations the apparent temporal differences in n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching durations were found in different corn growth stages fig 6 in the seedling stage there was no significant difference in n2o emission under different mulching durations however n2o emission under nm was significantly higher than that of mulching treatments and average n2o emission in both years under nm was higher by 41 7 41 6 45 0 and 42 8 than pms pme pmt and pmw p 0 05 respectively meanwhile the highest nh3 emission occurred in the pms among different mulching durations in the elongation stage average nh3 emission in both years under pms was higher by 17 0 16 5 and 19 0 than pme pmt and pmw respectively but it still was 21 7 lower than that of nm the significant differences in n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching treatments were found in the tasseling and filling stages the highest n2o and nh3 emissions occurred in pms treatment under different mulching duration average n2o emission in both years under pms was higher by 19 8 48 3 and 57 3 than pme pmt and pmw p 0 05 respectively and was higher by 18 8 30 7 and 37 0 for nh3 emission however n2o and nh3 emissions under pms were 17 3 and 18 8 significantly lower than that of nm in the maturity stage n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching durations were no significant difference p 0 05 except for pmw 3 4 simulated no 3 n leaching nl under different mulching durations an opposite trend in simulated nl was found compared with observed n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching durations and the highest nl occurred in pmw treatment fig 7 however there was a significantly temporal difference in nl in 2019 and 2020 in 2019 the difference in nl under different mulching durations mainly occurred in the elongation and tasseling stages average nl under pmw was higher by 64 8 37 7 21 1 and 12 8 than nm pms pme and pmt in 2019 respectively however the highest difference in nl under different mulching treatments mainly occurred in the seedling and elongation stages in 2020 average nl under pmw was higher by 87 9 74 5 33 4 and 18 1 than nm pms pme and pmt in 2020 respectively in general the average cumulative no3 n leaching in both years under pmw was higher by 41 5 27 6 15 3 and 9 9 than nm pms pme and pmt respectively fig 7 3 5 comprehensive benefits analysis for different mulching durations the result of comprehensive benefits analysis showed that among economic indicators the entropy value ej of y was the highest 0 72 while ej of nue was the lowest 0 65 table 4 also ej of nl was higher than that of n2o and nh3 emissions in general ej of nl was the highest 0 75 among all evaluation indicators but its weight wj was only 0 15 the largest wj occurred in nue 0 20 indicating the importance of nue over other indicators additionally the individual evaluation score si of nue y roi observed n2o emission observed nh3 emission and simulated nl under different mulching durations were 8 9 11 1 943 0 1766 9 0 10 0 31 0 06 0 17 2 8 5 1 and 0 42 0 70 respectively the highest and lowest comprehensive evaluation score sc occurred under pme 1782 7 and nm 957 6 respectively overall these results suggest that pme was the optimal mulching treatment in this region 4 discussion 4 1 mulching duration affected the dynamics of soil water and nitrogen to evade stress from low snc and obtain a higher yield the strategy of removing pm at the specific corn growth stage was a widely adopted agricultural practice li et al 2004a hou et al 2010 zhang et al 2012 the mulching duration has emerged as a crucial factor li et al 2004b li et al 2008 usually the stresses of low swc and high snc occurred in a shorter mulching duration condition due to weak root nitrogen uptake ability in the intense soil evaporation condition wang et al 2009 kader et al 2019 however the stresses of high swc and low snc may occur in a longer mulching duration condition due to low soil evaporation stronger root nitrogen uptake and low nitrogen fertilizer application amount especially in the maturity stage wang et al 2009 chen et al 2020 the main reason was that the plastic film mulching cut off the water vapor transport between surface soil and the atmosphere which dramatically increased the surface swc but decreased surface snc in the tasseling filling and maturity stages in this study we obtained similar results snc under nm and pms was higher by 12 1 and 10 5 than pmw p 0 05 in 2020 meanwhile n2o emissions would be limited due to the denitrification of surface snc giles et al 2012 mathieu et al 2006 niu et al 2019 also the higher soil water potential and snc promoted nl under longer mulching durations compared to shorter mulching durations especially in the seedling and elongation stages chen et al 2020 for instance this study found that nl under pmw was higher by 20 6 than nm fig 7 additionally the difference in snc among different treatments in the surface soil layer was higher than that in the deep soil layer the phenomenon was also caused by limitation the water vapor in surface soil layer under pm surface snc was migrated into the deeper soil layer along with the downward movement of surface swc and resulted in the difference of snc among different treatments in 20 40 cm soil layer however in the deep soil layer 40 100 cm the snc difference among different treatments was negligible since swc was not obviously affected by pm in general snc dynamics in the deep soil layer was mainly controlled by irrigation and rainfall events rather than mulching eneji et al 2013 hurtado et al 2011 mastrocicco et al 2019 furthermore snc under the protracted duration of mulching treatment pmt and pmw was higher than under pme however the significant differences in n2o and nh3 emissions under different mulching treatments were found in the tasseling and filling stages since higher soil microbial and enzymatic activities promoted the soil nitrogen transformation in this stage chen et al 2021a 2021b in general a comparison of soil environment under different mulching treatments revealed that pme was the optimal mulching duration for corn pme could effectively increase corn nitrogen uptake by improving soil enzyme activity and root permeability jiang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 4 2 comprehensive benefits analysis the altered soil nitrogen dynamics under different mulching treatments affected the comprehensive benefits zhao et al 2012 in general only pme produced optimal snc for best root growth in corn under different mulching durations it not only provided the suitable snc for germ development in the seedling stage but also prevented the nitrogen stress in the tasseling and filling stages the cause of this phenomenon was that soil enzyme activity and root permeability were significantly improved under pme scenario which promoted the ability of corn roots to uptake nitrate jiang et al 2013 yin et al 2015 zhang et al 2019 moreover although the evaluation score of environmental benefits under pme was not the highest among different mulching treatments table 4 it offered specific advantages compared with nm and pmw for example n2o and nh3 emissions under pme were lower by 34 9 and 28 2 than nm respectively since plastic film limited the gas emission by cutting off the gas transport between soil body and atmosphere due to its low gas permeability ali et al 2021 berger et al 2013 however nl under pme was lower by 24 4 than pmw due to relatively short mulching duration the phenomenon could be attributed to a decrease in surface soil water potential after removing the plastic film which reduced the water potential gradient between the shallow and deep soil depths meanwhile nl also decreased in response to a decline in water potential gradient chen et al 2020 for example nl increased in response to a decrease of groundwater level in the same corn growth season however there was an apparent difference in the nl in 2019 and 2020 although groundwater level in 2019 was deeper than 2020 nl in 2019 was higher than that of 2020 the reason was mainly attributed to higher irrigation depth in 2019 compared to 2020 the water potential gradient difference between shallow soil layer and groundwater in 2019 was apparently higher than 2020 which promoted nl along with drainage increasing however corn yield and corresponding benefit were not much different between pmt and pmw due to significantly prolonged mulching in pmt this decreased the water vapor flux in the soil plant atmosphere continuum and decreased n2o and nh3 emissions in the filling and maturity stages on similar lines hou et al 2010 reported that the crop yield was the same if mulching was prolonged pme pmt pmf and pmw all produced similar crop yields in general the comprehensive evaluation score sc of pme was the highest therefore we suggested that pme was the optimal mulching treatment in this region 5 conclusion the impacts of soil nitrogen loss on crop yield and comprehensive benefits have not been revealed to save the above problem hydrus 2d 3d model was used to evaluate the differences of soil nitrogen dynamics under different mulching durations this study found that hydrus 2d 3d model could well capture soil nitrate dynamics under different mulching treatments in the validation period there were no apparent differences in soil nitrate concentration n2o emission nh3 emission and no3 n leaching under different mulching treatments in the seedling stage due to the similar root nitrogen uptake ability however the corresponding difference markedly increased with corn growth and development since the difference of root nitrogen uptake increased especially in 2019 nitrogen emission n2o and nh3 showed an increase trend with the shortening of mulching duration while an opposite trend was found for no3 n leaching the phenomenon was caused by limitation the gas transport in surface soil layer under plastic film mulching in general mulching for the elongation stage pme treatment was found to be the optimal mulching duration with the highest comprehensive evaluation score therefore in this region pme could be applied to promote the development of sustainable agriculture the findings of this study improved the understanding of the mechanisms of nitrogen use for the corn field under plastic film mulching future research might focus more closely on the complex interplay of soil nitrogen dynamics and soil carbon transports under different mulching durations declaration of competing interest the

8876,the vegsyst model initially developed for nitrogen n and irrigation recommendations for greenhouse grown vegetable crops in southeastern spain was calibrated and validated for greenhouse tomato cultivated in soil in uruguay south america for autumn and spring growing seasons additionally the performance of the recalibrated vegsyst model was compared to the calibration for tomato grown in almeria greenhouses of vegsyst model v3 five tomato crops three autumn and two spring crops grown in 2019 2020 and 2021 were used for model calibration spring 19 and autumn 20 and validation autumn 19 spring 21 and autumn 21 a major change to the existing vegsyst model v3 was the incorporation of the hargreaves samani equation adapted to plastic greenhouses to estimate eto the recalibrated vegsyst model accurately simulated dry matter production dmp etc and crop n and k uptake over time for autumn and spring growing seasons using the original vegsyst v3 calibration acceptable results were obtained for dmp and n uptake a new dilution curve for n content was included it was derived from pooled data and was described by the power equation n 3 4117 x dmp 0 153 r2 of 0 84 both this dilution curve and the critical n curve of vegsyst v3 provided accurate simulation of crop n uptake therefore both can be used in uruguayan conditions k uptake simulations were accurate according to the statistical indices used this was despite that the k dilution curve of k 4 359 x dmp 0 005 had a low r2 value moreover simulation with this k dilution curve provided better results than with the dilution curve of vegsyst v3 a decision support system based on the recalibrated vegsyst model will be developed to assist uruguayan farmers and advisers it will provide calculation of daily irrigation needs and nutrient concentration tailored to each crop and greenhouse keywords solanum lycopersicum nutrient uptake etc modeling fertigation abbreviations etc crop evapotranspiration data availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction greenhouse vegetable production has expanded in many parts of the world enoch and enoch 1999 in addition to the traditional mild winter coastal areas in the mediterranean basin briassoulis et al 1997 pardossi et al 2004 greenhouse production is expanding rapidly in south and central america vargas et al 2018 in these regions greenhouses are mostly low cost structures covered with plastic film without active climatic control systems vargas et al 2018 crops are grown soil with drip irrigation and fertigation berrueta et al 2019 the production system is similar to that in southeast se spain pérez parra et al 2004 the greenhouse area in uruguay increased 41 from 741 ha to 1043 ha between 2000 and 2011 and tomato solanum lycopersicum l is the most important crop diea digegra 2014 two cropping strategies are used to produce tomato throughout most of the year in the south of uruguay the first strategy which is more commonly used consists of two short cropping cycles in each year the first cycle is transplanted in august and finishes in january february spring crops the second cycle is transplanted in february and finishes in july august autumn crops the second strategy is to grow one longer crop per year which is generally transplanted in september and finishes in may june the two crop per year strategy is less affected by disease and nematodes and avoids reductions in fruit set and quality during the summer period of december to february rosa and suarez 1998 recent studies in greenhouse tomato farms in uruguay showed high variability in yield between crops berrueta et al 2020a these studies estimated an average yield gap to attainable yield of 34 and 28 in the southern and northern parts of the country respectively berrueta et al 2020a inetti 2018 the supply of both nitrogen n and potassium k and the hydric welfare index the ratio between actual crop evapotranspiration etc and estimated crop evapotranspiration for pristine conditions have been identified as major factors limiting greenhouse tomato yield in uruguay berrueta et al 2019 combined drip irrigation and fertigation systems advanced fertigation systems venturi or fertilizers tanks are used to provide frequent application of irrigation and nutrients berrueta et al 2020b these systems have the technical capacity to frequently apply irrigation and nutrients according to crop demand however the technical capacity of these drip irrigation fertigation systems for optimal irrigation and nutrient supply is not being effectively used in tomato farms in uruguay growers generally apply nutrients and irrigation based on local experience of what ensures high productions levels there is currently no use of scientific tools to match irrigation and nutrient application to crop requirements current management practices result in excessive or insufficient irrigation and nutrient application during crop growth affecting tomato yield fruit quality and can cause accumulation of available phosphorus p and exchangeable k and sodium na in soil berrueta et al 2019 reported that in relation to crop requirements most greenhouse tomato crops in uruguay receive insufficient n and k and excessive p calcium ca and magnesium mg in relation to water management berrueta et al 2019 reported that 66 of the tomato crops were irrigated below crop demand according to the hydric welfare index lower than 0 8 there is considerable potential to improve nutrient and water management not only to increase yield but also to reduce fertilizer costs water use inefficiencies and negative environmental impacts given that most growers in this system have the technical capacity for precise fertigation detailed knowledge of crop irrigation and nutrient requirements will enable application to match crop demand numerous authors have experimentally determined tomato nutrient uptake juárez et al 2017 voogt 1993 however it is very difficult to extrapolate nutrient uptake determined in a limited number of individual experimental crops to a specific commercial crop because of differences in cropping dates weather conditions greenhouse characteristics and crop management practices the most effective way to cope with the variability in nutrient uptake with time amongst commercial crops is the use of simulation models simulation models calculate daily uptake of nutrients considering the specific conditions of individual crops and anticipate the likely nutrient requirements the vegsyst simulation model gallardo et al 2011 2014 2016 giménez et al 2013 calculates daily dry matter production dmp crop n uptake and crop evapotranspiration of the main greenhouse crops grown in southeast se spain this model has been integrated into a decision support system dss the vegsyst dss that provide recommendations for daily irrigation rates daily n fertilizer rate and daily n concentration in the nutrient solution for seven vegetable species grown in greenhouses in almeria gallardo et al 2014 2017a a ms windows compatible version in english and spanish is available at https w3 ual es gruposinv nitrogeno vegsyst dss shtml the simulation of crop uptake of k p ca and mg in tomato was incorporated into vegsyst v3 gallardo et al 2021 in vegsyst v3 the critical n curve of padilla et al 2015 was used for estimation of n content and consequently for n uptake a revised version of the associated decision support system vegsyst dss v2 was recently developed by adding a component for recommendations of p k ca and mg gallardo et al 2021 2023 the previous version of vegsyst dss provided recommendations for irrigation and n gallardo et al 2014 2023 unlike for cereal crops e g epic williams et al 1984 stics brisson et al 1998 dssat jones et al 2003 there are only a small number of models and decision support systems that can simulate etc and crop n uptake of vegetable crops e g vegsyst gallardo et al 2014 eu rotate n rahn et al 2010 cropmanage cahn et al 2014 some of those are complex mechanistic models developed for or adapted to outdoor vegetable cropping such as eu rotate n rahn et al 2010 the vegsyst model has been developed to be incorporated into a dss which required that the number of inputs be minimized also having been specifically developed for greenhouse grown crops it considers the transmissivity of greenhouse cover has eto equations adapted to and validated for greenhouse conditions gallardo et al 2011 2016 2017b the cropping conditions for which vegsyst was developed soil grown crops in simple plastic greenhouses are similar to those of greenhouse vegetable production in uruguay additionally no other model simulates etc and crop n and k uptake of soil grown tomato in greenhouse production this combination is very useful for fertigated crops until now the vegsyst model has only been calibrated and validated for plastic greenhouses in se spain the performance of the model in very different conditions such as in the southern hemisphere in uruguay is unknown the primary objective of this study was to recalibrate and validate the vegsyst v3 model to simulate seasonal dynamics of dmp crop uptake of n and k and etc for beef tomato grown in soil in greenhouses in uruguay with autumn and spring growing seasons the secondary objective was to evaluate the performance of the vegsyst model to simulate dmp and n and k uptake in greenhouse tomato crops in uruguay using the original calibration developed for tomato in almeria in future work a decision support system dss based on the vegsyst dss will be developed to be used for practical fertigation management in greenhouses in uruguay 2 materials and methods 2 1 calibration and validation of the vegsyst model for uruguayan conditions the vegsyst v3 model gallardo et al 2016 2021 was calibrated and validated to simulate daily and seasonal dmp etc and n and k uptake of greenhouse soil grown beef tomato in uruguay both the calibration and validation were performed for autumn and spring tomato growing seasons which are the most common in southern uruguay berrueta et al 2020a 2 1 1 experimental and cropping details five tomato crops solanum lycopersicum l three autumn autumn 19 autumn 20 and autumn 21 and two spring spring 19 and spring 21 crops grown in seasons 2019 2020 and

1 meq 100 g 1 respectively crops were grown in a 870 m2 greenhouse 60 m long and 14 5 m wide with a single gable roof structure made from wood and covered with light diffusing plastic film heights at the ridge and gutter were 4 5 and 2 m respectively the greenhouse had a north south orientation it had passive lateral and ridge ventilation soil in crop rows was covered with white plastic mulch 1 4 width the crops were managed following local commercial cropping practices five week old seedlings were transplanted plants were topped after the development of the eighth cluster plant density was 2 66 plants m 2 1 88 m between rows 0 2 m between plants within rows tomato plants were physically supported using a system of vertical nylon cords and were periodically pruned the irrigation system consisted of drip tape on the soil surface arranged in paired lines associated with each line of plants there was a 0 3 m spacing between lines within each pair which were equidistant from the dripline 1 88 m spacing between the center of the lines of adjacent pairs and 0 2 m spacing between drip emitters within drip lines 5 3 emitters m2 1 l h 1 discharge rate there were two emitters on either 15 cm distance of each plant irrigation was scheduled to maintain the soil matric potential in the root zone at 20 cm depth within 10 to 20 kpa 12 tensiometers irrometer co riverside ca usa located in the middle of each plot were used to measure soil matric potential every day three treatments consisted of three different fertigation regimes were applied in each of the five tomato crops the treatment used for the study consisted of complete nutrient solution applied throughout the crop in all irrigation the macronutrient and micronutrient concentrations used ensured no limitations the others fertigation regimes were not reported here because they were not used for the study the composition of the nutrient solution was formulated considering expected yield nutrient concentration in irrigation water and soil characteristics it was also adjusted for phenological stage total n and k application for each crop throughout the entire growing period is presented in table 2 the differences in total amounts of applied nutrients between individual crops were due to i different yield expectations depending on crop growing season autumn or spring berrueta et al 2020a and ii variations in soil nutrient supply which was higher in the 2019 growing seasons because of higher soil fertility which decreased with succeeding crops petiole sap test were conducted every 14 days to ensure that n and k were not limiting crop growth using reference values from hochmuth et al 2015 randomized complete block designs with four replications were used for each trial replicate plots measured 14 m by 1 88 m each plot contained one row of tomato plants with 0 2 m between plants the greenhouse was divided longitudinally into northern and southern plots by a 2 m wide path along its east west axis with two plots of each treatment in each of the northern and southern sectors there were border areas along the edges of the greenhouse 2 1 2 measurements 2 1 2 1 climatic data temperature and relative humidity inside the greenhouses were measured and recorded every 30 min with a weather station model vantage pro2 davis instruments usa located at the center of the greenhouse positioned slightly above the height of the crop daily global radiation was measured with a pyranometer model cs320 campbell scientific logan ut usa located outside the greenhouse and daily radiation inside the greenhouse was calculated by multiplying outside solar radiation by greenhouse transmissivity greenhouse transmissivity for each crop was measured at the beginning and at the end of each growing period measurements were made with a ceptometer model lp 80 decagon devices inc pullman usa at 1 5 m above ground in 16 positions both inside and outside greenhouse at 9 00 12 00 and 16 00 on sunny days 2 1 2 2 fraction of radiation intercepted the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted by the crops was determined from measurements made with a linear quantum sensor model lp 80 decagon devices inc pullman usa every 20 days for all crops four measurements were conducted per replication plot in each crop two per each side of the row the probe was positioned at 45 angle across the rows at ground level and just above canopy probe position ensure covering half row and half path to consider row and path effect measurements were made at 12 30 on sunny days 2 1 2 3 dry matter accumulation nitrogen and potassium uptake measurements of above ground dry matter production dmp throughout each crop were made by harvesting one plant per replicated plot every 20 days at each biomass sampling the amounts of dry matter in leaves stems and fruits were determined dry matter determinations were made by weighing all fresh material of each component and oven drying at 65 c until constant weight the amounts of all pruned shoot material and fruit production were determined throughout each crop in 10 plants per replicate plot at each pruning and harvest the amount of dry matter removed was determined as described previously on average seven biomass sampling 14 prunings and nine harvests were conducted for each tomato crop for each biomass sampling total shoot dmp was determined from the sum of dry matter of leaves stems and immature fruits for that sampling date plus the combined dry matter of all pruned material and harvested fruit until that sampling date the n and k content in dry matter was determined in finely ground samples of i leaves stems and fruit from biomass samplings ii pruned material and iii fruit from harvests the n content was determined by the kjeldahl method and the k content by atomic absorption spectroscopy isaac and kerber 1971 above ground crop uptake of each analysed element was calculated for each biomass sampling in each crop as the sum of the uptake in leaves stems and immature fruit plus the uptake in pruned and harvested material since the previous biomass sampling for each nutrient on each date uptake was calculated as the sum of the products of dmp and element content for each component 2 1 2 4 crop evapotranspiration in each crop weekly etc was determined using a water balance approach as the difference between the weekly measured volumes of irrigation and drainage also considering the difference in soil moisture the volume of each irrigation was measured with volume meters table 2 drainage was collected from a free draining re packed lysimeters 2 m long 0 9 m wide 1 4 m deep three times per week table 2 the soil profile in the lysimeter reproduced that of the outside area to a depth of 1 4 m with a layer of gravel between geotextile meshes at the bottom of the lysimeter the volumetric soil moisture content for the water balance calculations was measured weekly using a neutron probe ict

of the adapted penman monteith equation in plastic greenhouses gallardo et al 2016 m d fernandez personal communication given the i uncertainty of the suitability of the penman monteith equation for plastic greenhouses and its requirement for more inputs and ii that the almeria radiation is an empirical model calibrated for se spain the hargreaves equation hargreaves and samani 1985 adapted by fernandez et al 2011 2010 to plastic greenhouses was used in the present work the kc values were simulated using the vegsyst kc function described for tomato by gallardo et al 2014 initial maximum and final kc values of the vegsyst model were obtained in this study for the autumn and spring crops by minimizing errors between measured and simulated etc values 2 3 statistical indices to evaluate model performance the performance of the simulation of dmp n and k uptake and etc using the recalibrated vegsyst model was validated for tomato with autumn and spring growing seasons in uruguay using the experimental data from autumn 19 autumn 21 and spring 21 the performance of dmp n and k uptake simulation using the original vegsyst v3 calibration was validated using the experimental data from all tomato crops to evaluate the agreement between simulated and measured values the following statistical indices were used the root mean square error rmse the relative error re stöckle et al 2004 the willmott index of agreement d willmott 1982 and linear regression analysis between simulated and measured values values of re 0 25 and d 0 75 were considered to indicate good model performance following yang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 climate data average values of air temperature relative humidity and the daily integral of solar radiation inside the greenhouse for each tomato crop are presented in table 3 the measured transmissivity values used to determine solar radiation inside the greenhouse were 64 for autumn 19 and spring 19 62 for autumn 20 and autumn 21 and 60 for spring 21

for a given growing season e g autumn and spring the different crops generally had a similar relationship between fi par and ctt fig 1 the exception was spring 21 where higher values of fi par occurred in the last two measurements fig 1b both the autumn and spring crops had higher maximum values of the fraction of intercepted par than was reported for tomato in almería table 4 the curve describing the relationship between fi par and ctt for tomato in almería was intermediate between the autumn and spring tomato crops in uruguay full interception in almería was reached at 798 ºd intermediate between autumn 956 ºd and spring 500 ºd crops in uruguay table 4 the derived calibration parameters for autumn and spring tomato crops grown in uruguay are presented in table 4 except for base temperature all parameters were obtained from experimental data of the autumn 20 and spring 19 crops calibration coefficients determined for tomato in se spain by gallardo et al 2021 2014 used vegsyst v3 are also presented in table 4 base temperature for tomato was considered to be 10 ºc marcelis et al 1998 the radiation use efficiency rue for both growing seasons in uruguay was lower than value for tomato of vegsyst in almeria table 4 this was particularly so for the spring growing season that had the lowest rue the relationships for both n and k content with dmp were determined using pooled data from the five tomato crops fig 2 the dilution curve for n content fitted to pooled data was described by the power equation n 3 4117 x dmp 0 153 table 4 fig 2 with a high r2 value of 0 84 the k dilution curve was described by the power equation k 4 359 x dmp 0 005 with a low r2 value of 0 02 fig 2 despite this low r2 value model simulations of k uptake showed good model performance according to statistical indices re 0 25 and the willmott index of agreement 0 95 table 5 moreover simulations with this equation showed better results compared to the original version of vegsyst v3 fig 7 the seasonal evolution of simulated and measured values of dmp n and k uptake for the calibration crops in autumn fig 3a c e and spring fig 3b d f are presented in fig 3 there was generally good agreement between simulated and measured values of dmp n and k uptake for calibration crops re 0 17 and willmott index of agreement d 0 99 table 5 except for the last sampling date of the autumn 20 crop when dmp and n uptake were overestimated by the model fig 3a c as well as k although autumn crops had higher rue values table 4 they received less par radiation than spring crops table 3 particularly after reaching maximum canopy development consequently the accumulation of dmp n and k uptake was lower for the autumn compared to the spring crop fig 3 at the end of the growing period accumulated measured dmp was 12 8 0 3 t ha 1 and 15 4 1 1 t ha 1 mean standard error for the autumn 20 and spring 19 respectively for the autumn 20 crop total n uptake was 289 9 kg ha 1 and total k uptake was 558 21 kg ha 1 for the spring 19 crop total n and k uptake were 346 33 kg ha 1 and 615 55 kg ha 1 respectively the ratio between k and n uptake was similar for both crops being 1 9 and 1 8

there was a good agreement between simulated and measured values during the growing period re was 0 10 or lower and willmott index of agreement equal to 1 table 5 appreciable differences were observed between growing seasons in accumulated etc for the autumn 20 crop the etc of 279 mm was 55 of the total etc of the spring 19 crop of 503 mm despite the longer duration of the autumn 20 crop the lower average daily radiation and temperature values table 3 resulted in lower total etc the kc values determined for the autumn calibration crop were 0 15 1 43 and 0 45 for initial maximum and final kc table 4 for the spring calibration crop the initial kc was the same as autumn the maximum kc was lower 1 2 and no final kc value was determined table 4 3 3 model validation 3 3 1 validation of the seasonal evolution of dmp and uptake of n and k simulated and measured values of seasonal evolution of dmp n and k uptake for one validation crop for each growing season autumn 21 and spring 21 are presented in fig 5 in both of these validation crops there was a good agreement between simulated and measured values throughout the growing season some discrepancies were observed in the last two measured value of dmp n uptake and k uptake for the autumn 21 validation crop which were overestimated by the model for the spring 21 validation crop the model underestimated n uptake in the two last measured values as with the calibration crops fig 3 the accumulation of dmp n and k uptake was lower for the autumn crop compared to the spring crop at the end of season accumulated measured values of dmp and total n uptake were very similar to calibration crops accumulated dmp measured was 12 7 0 5 t ha 1 and 14 3 1 1 t ha 1 mean standard error for autumn 21 and spring 21 respectively fig 5a and b total n uptake was 285 18 kg ha 1 and 362 7 kg ha 1 for autumn 21 and spring 21 respectively fig 5c and d total k uptake was 525 28 kg ha 1 for autumn 21 fig 5e similar to autumn 20 total k of spring

simulations of dmp and of n and k uptake table 5 re was below 0 25 and the willmott index of agreement d above 0 97 in all calibration and validation crops for dmp n and k uptake parameters these values are considered acceptable according to the criteria of yang et al 2014 according to the slope m and intercept c of the linear relationship between measured and estimated values the model underestimated the measured values in several parameters and crops e g autumn 19 spring 19 and spring 21 for dmp n and k uptake for autumn 21 dmp n and k uptake were overestimated by the model according to the slope and intercept of linear regression the disagreement occurring in the last part of growing period fig 5a c e no significant bias was observed for dmp and n uptake in autumn 20 slope was not significantly different from 1 and intercept from 0 3 3 2 validation of seasonal evolution of etc simulated etc throughout the crop growing seasons showed good agreement with measured

underestimated the measured etc in most crops e g spring 19 autumn 20 and spring 21 particularly in the last part of growing period fig 6b 3 3 3 comparison of the recalibrated and original vegsyst model simulated values of dmp n uptake and k uptake calculated with the recalibrated vegsyst and the original vegsyst v3 models gallardo et al 2021 2014 are plotted against measured values for pooled data from the five tomato crops in fig 7 the results obtained with the version of vegsyst recalibrated for uruguayan conditions were closer to measured data than those obtained with the vegsyst v3 recalibrated vegsyst showed good performance to predict dmp n and k uptake with slopes of regression curves between measured and simulated values being 0 95 0 94 and 0 95 respectively fig 7a c and e the r2 values were 0 97 0 96 and 0 97 for the dmp n and k uptake regression curves fig 7a c and e this agrees with statistical indices interpretation detailed in section 3 2 1 table 5 the results from the vegsyst v3 model had slopes of regression equations between simulated and measured values of 1 07 0 88 and 0 72 for dmp n and k uptake respectively fig 7b d and f these were further from one than was obtained with the recalibrated model this was confirmed with the statistical indices presented in table 7 the re values for simulations obtained with the recalibrated model were lower than those obtained with vegsyst v3 for dmp all crops n uptake autumn 19 autumn 20 and k uptake all crops vegsyst v3 showed poor performance re 0 25 0 9 m 1 1 for k uptake simulations in autumn 19 autumn 20 autumn 21 and spring 21 the slopes of regression curves between measured and simulated k uptake were lower than 0 76 indicating model underestimation nevertheless the calibration of vegsyst v3 showed acceptable performance for dmp except for spring 19 and autumn 21 and n uptake simulations re 0 25 d 0 95 despite that it was developed for different cropping conditions for crop n uptake vegsyst v3 simulations for autumn 21 and spring 21 presented lower re compared to the recalibrated model for spring 19 model performance was very good re 0 10 d 0 95 4 discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation the vegsyst model developed to assist with nutrient and irrigation management of greenhouse vegetable crops in se spain was calibrated and validated for tomato grown in plastic greenhouses in uruguay south america calibration was conducted for the two most common cropping cycles in the region being spring and autumn crops berrueta et al 2020a recalibrated vegsyst accurately simulated crop biomass production crop n and k uptake over time for both autumn and spring growing seasons the vegsyst model simulates dmp based on the fraction of intercepted par and rue the value obtained for the maximum fraction of intercepted par f f for the autumn growing season was higher than spring and also in that of the vegsyst v3 model 0 90 0 76 and 0 73 respectively the high values for this parameter in the autumn crop compared to spring could be explained by the seasonal pattern of light interception with on average a lower fraction of light intercepted during summer than during winter months the higher solar elevation in summer months results in an orientation of light rays more perpendicular to the plant canopy causing higher light penetration and lower interception sarlikioti et al 2011 lower maximum fraction of intercepted par for vegsyst v3 calibration can possibly be attributed to lower plant densities and higher leaf pruning intensities plant density used for calibration and validation crops was 2 66 plant m 2 whereas 2 plants m 2 was used in vegsyst v3 calibration gallardo et al 2014 only two leaf prunings were conducted in the uruguayan tomato crops only leaves below the second truss were removed when fruits of first truss began to ripen despite normalizing for thermal time a delay in the development of canopy cover in relation to ctt in autumn crops was observed compared with spring crops in uruguay according to gallardo et al 2017b this could be explained by the differences between crops in the relationship between ctt and cumulated solar radiation for a given ctt average solar radiation was much higher in spring than in the autumn table 3 the higher ctt for a given value of solar radiation could be explained by differences in greenhouse ventilation management between seasons with a higher rate of air exchange in spring than in autumn crops gallardo et al 2017b the difference in maximum par interception between the autumn and spring growing seasons could be explained by differences in transplanting dates and cultivars spring crops were transplanted in late winter august and autumn crops were transplanted in late summer february table 1 this being the south hemisphere lower radiation and temperature for spring crops until maximum canopy growth and plant topping could explained the lower values of maximum par interception compared to the autumn also the different cultivars used in autumn elpida and spring lapataia could have affected canopy development these are the cultivars most commonly used in commercial crops in these growing seasons rue was 2 5 and 3 4 g mj par 1 for spring and autumn crops respectively these values coincide with other authors who reported rue values of approximately 3 g mj par 1 for greenhouse tomato cockshull et al 1992 de 1993 and other greenhouse vegetable species baille 1999 gallardo et al 2016 after reaching maximum par interception november spring crops received high radiation with increased ratio of direct diffuse radiation high temperature low relative humidity and high vapor pressure deficit these conditions could explain the lower rue for spring crops baille 1999 heuvelink and dorais 2005 sinclair et al 1992 shade screens and whitening on the greenhouse cover to reduce transmissivity and therefore radiation were not used the rue value derived for the recalibrated model was lower than that of vegsyst v3 the limited climatic control in greenhouses such at used in the current study can result in temperature and relative humidity values outside of optimal ranges this may explain the lower rue values the different cultivars used in uruguay and spain may have resulted in differences in photosynthetic rates and in the light extinction coefficient higashide and heuvelink 2009 in the present work the n dilution curve obtained had a high r2 and the k dilution curve had a low r2 value however k uptake simulations showed accurate performance according to statistical indices moreover simulation with this k dilution curve provided better results than with vegsyst v3 therefore despite the low r2 the k dilution curve obtained here was used in the recalibrated model the contradiction between the k dilution curve having a low r2 value and providing accurate performance when used in simulations suggests that the derived k dilution curve was appropriate for these crops despite notable noise in the data the source of the noise in the data is difficult to identify for n uptake both simulations with the dilution curve obtained here and the critical n curve of padilla et al 2015 of vegsyst v3 showed acceptable performance and accurate prediction therefore both could be used in uruguayan conditions the n dilution curve obtained here showed lower n content for very low dmp values compared to the critical n curve of padilla et al 2015 for greenhouse tomato and tei et al 2002 for processing tomato average total n and k uptake per ton of fresh fruit yield for all crops evaluated were 1 9 kg n t 1 and 3 3 kg k t 1 these values are similar to those reported by ciampitti and garcía 2007 for tomato of 1 9 kg n t 1 and 3 1 kg k t 1 crop evapotranspiration was accurately simulated by the model when using the hargreaves samani equation adapted to plastic greenhouses fernández et al 2010 2011 to estimate eto this was an advantageous change to the existing vegsyst model v3 because it requires less data inputs and provides good results for etc estimation of crops in plastic greenhouses without whitening fernández et al 2011 2010 with calibration of kc values good performance of the model was obtained for simulation of seasonal etc for both growing seasons some slight discrepancies were observed in the last month of the validation crops where the simulation with recalibrated vegsyst model slightly overestimated and underestimated measured data for autumn 21 and spring 21 crops respectively the last month of autumn crops occurred in july mid winter and in spring crops during january mid summer contrasting climatic conditions with extreme temperature and humidity could explain the differences to measured data in the last month of these crops discrepancies between simulated and measured values are frequent in the latter part of the growing season due to a heightened incidence of pest and disease and leaf senescence gallardo m personal communication the maximum kc values were 1 43 for autumn and 1 2 for spring crops both values of maximum kc are consistent with reported values for vertically supported greenhouse crops fernández et al 2001 orgaz et al 2005 the suggested explanation for the relatively high maximum kc values of supported greenhouse vegetable crops compared to open field crops is more uniform light penetration within the canopies that enable higher et for given climatic conditions orgaz et al 2005 more uniform light penetration results from the taller and more open canopies supported and pruned higher leaf area indices lai and the higher proportion of diffuse radiation inside the greenhouse orgaz et al 2005 the maximum kc value was lower for spring than for autumn crops this could be explained by the lower fraction of intercepted par of the spring crops 16 lower than autumn crops which was presumably associated with the lower lai of the spring crops data not shown a decrease in kc during the last part of crop was used kc fin only for autumn crops in the autumn crops following the period of maximum kc kc values subsequently decreased slightly during the latter part of the autumn growing season in the autumn crops with longer growing periods older leaves clearly showed signs of senescence these were not observed in the spring crops orgaz et al 2005 suggested that the reduction in kc values during the latter part of growing period was due to senescence and or cold damage to leaves these difference between autumn and spring crops were not reflected in the fraction of intercepted par fig 1a because only very old leaves were removed during crop growth and many damaged leaves remain on the plant as is common in the region the vegsyst v3 model has previously demonstrated robust performance by adequately simulating accumulated dmp etc and crop nutrient uptake for a range of greenhouse grown vegetable crops under different conditions sites years varieties planting densities growing media seasonal cycles length of growing season gallardo et al 2021 2016 2011 giménez et al 2017 2013 the vegsyst model was adapted to outdoor vegetable crop with good results giménez et al 2019 the robustness of the vegsyst model was confirmed in the present work by the acceptable results for dmp and n uptake for greenhouse tomato in uruguay when using the calibration of vegsyst v3 the n uptake simulations using the critical n curve of padilla et al 2015 were as good as those obtained using the locally derived n dilution curve this indicated that either n curve could be used for uruguayan conditions however the recalibrated version for uruguayan conditions obtained more accurate simulations of dmp and k uptake potassium uptake using the k dilution curve of vegsyst v3 showed poor performance compared to the recalibrated version 4 2 on farm application of the vegsyst model to improve water and nutrient management the vegsyst model has been developed to assist with on farm decision making such as when and how much nutrient and irrigation to apply the calibration of vegsyst for tomato grown in plastic greenhouses in uruguay will assist local growers and farm advisers prepare fertigation plans that consider climatic conditions growing season and planting dates given the inter annual climate variability of uruguay tiscornia et al 2016 consideration of climate data of specific years is essential using the prescriptive corrective management approach granados et al 2013 incrocci et al 2017 thompson et al 2017 recommendations from model simulations can be used to assist with prescriptive management a decision support system dss vegsyst dss based on vegsyst model has been developed to provide daily recommendations of irrigation volume and nutrient concentration gallardo et al 2014 2016 nutrient recommendations are based on crop nutrient uptake simulated by the model and additionally consider nutrients supplied by soil and manure and nutrient use efficiency irrigation requirements are based on simulated etc and additionally consider irrigation application efficiency and salinity the main advantage of the vegsyst dss is that require very few inputs all of which are readily available to farmers and advisors for best on farm results the corrective management of the prescriptive corrective approach is also required this part involves crop and soil monitoring to make adjustments to ensure optimal crop nutrient and water status thompson et al 2017 theses monitoring techniques can integrate plant and root zone monitoring thompson et al 2017 peña fleitas et al 2015 some of them have been already adapted for uruguayan conditions berrueta et al 2021 2022 and are currently used by farm advisers 5 conclusions the vegsyst v3 model was calibrated and validated for tomato grown in plastic greenhouses in uruguay south america calibration was performed for spring and autumn crops the most common growing seasons in the region recalibrated vegsyst accurately simulated crop biomass production etc crop n and k uptake over time for both autumn and spring crops acceptable results were obtained using the original vegsyst v3 calibration for dmp and n uptake which confirmed the robustness of the calibration that was derived in almeria spain the exception was k where the original calibration consistently underestimated k uptake for simulating n uptake the n dilution curve obtained in the current work and the critical n curve of vegsyst v3 both provided accurate predictions therefore both could be used in uruguayan conditions a decision support system based on recalibrated vegsyst model will be developed to assist uruguayan farmers and advisers it will provide daily calculation of irrigation volumes and nutrient concentrations tailored to the specific characteristics of each crop and greenhouse doing so will enhance crop yield improve water and nutrient use efficiency and

8876,the vegsyst model initially developed for nitrogen n and irrigation recommendations for greenhouse grown vegetable crops in southeastern spain was calibrated and validated for greenhouse tomato cultivated in soil in uruguay south america for autumn and spring growing seasons additionally the performance of the recalibrated vegsyst model was compared to the calibration for tomato grown in almeria greenhouses of vegsyst model v3 five tomato crops three autumn and two spring crops grown in 2019 2020 and 2021 were used for model calibration spring 19 and autumn 20 and validation autumn 19 spring 21 and autumn 21 a major change to the existing vegsyst model v3 was the incorporation of the hargreaves samani equation adapted to plastic greenhouses to estimate eto the recalibrated vegsyst model accurately simulated dry matter production dmp etc and crop n and k uptake over time for autumn and spring growing seasons using the original vegsyst v3 calibration acceptable results were obtained for dmp and n uptake a new dilution curve for n content was included it was derived from pooled data and was described by the power equation n 3 4117 x dmp 0 153 r2 of 0 84 both this dilution curve and the critical n curve of vegsyst v3 provided accurate simulation of crop n uptake therefore both can be used in uruguayan conditions k uptake simulations were accurate according to the statistical indices used this was despite that the k dilution curve of k 4 359 x dmp 0 005 had a low r2 value moreover simulation with this k dilution curve provided better results than with the dilution curve of vegsyst v3 a decision support system based on the recalibrated vegsyst model will be developed to assist uruguayan farmers and advisers it will provide calculation of daily

availability the data that has been used is confidential 1 introduction greenhouse vegetable production has expanded in many parts of the world enoch and enoch 1999 in addition to the traditional mild winter coastal areas in the mediterranean basin briassoulis et al 1997 pardossi et al 2004 greenhouse production is expanding rapidly in south and central america vargas et al 2018 in these regions greenhouses are mostly low cost structures covered with plastic film without active climatic control systems vargas et al 2018 crops are grown soil with drip irrigation and fertigation berrueta et al 2019 the production system is similar to that in southeast se spain pérez parra et al 2004 the greenhouse area in uruguay increased 41 from 741 ha to 1043 ha between 2000 and 2011 and tomato solanum lycopersicum l is the most important crop diea digegra 2014 two cropping strategies are used to produce tomato throughout most of the year in the south of uruguay the first strategy which is more commonly used consists of two short cropping cycles in each year the first cycle is transplanted in august and finishes in january february spring crops the second cycle is transplanted in february and finishes in july august autumn crops the second strategy is to grow one longer crop per year which is generally transplanted in september and finishes in may june the two crop per year strategy is less affected by disease and nematodes and avoids reductions in fruit set and quality during the summer period of december to february rosa and suarez 1998 recent studies in greenhouse tomato farms in uruguay showed high variability in yield between crops berrueta et al 2020a these studies estimated an average yield gap to attainable yield of 34 and 28 in the southern and northern parts of the country respectively berrueta et al 2020a inetti 2018 the supply of both nitrogen n and potassium k and the hydric welfare index the ratio between actual crop evapotranspiration etc and estimated crop evapotranspiration for pristine conditions have been identified as major factors limiting greenhouse tomato yield in uruguay berrueta et al 2019 combined drip irrigation and fertigation systems advanced fertigation systems venturi or fertilizers tanks are used to provide frequent application of irrigation and nutrients berrueta et al 2020b these systems have the technical capacity to frequently apply irrigation and nutrients according to crop demand however the technical capacity of these drip irrigation fertigation systems for optimal irrigation and nutrient supply is not being effectively used in tomato farms in uruguay growers generally apply nutrients and irrigation based on local experience of what ensures high productions levels there is currently no use of scientific tools to match irrigation and nutrient application to crop requirements current management practices result in excessive or insufficient irrigation and nutrient application during crop growth affecting tomato yield fruit quality and can cause accumulation of available phosphorus p and exchangeable k and sodium na in soil berrueta et al 2019 reported that in relation to crop requirements most greenhouse tomato crops in uruguay receive insufficient n and k and excessive p calcium ca and magnesium mg in relation to water management berrueta et al 2019 reported that 66 of the tomato crops were irrigated below crop demand according to the hydric welfare index lower than 0 8 there is considerable potential to improve nutrient and water management not only to increase yield but also to reduce fertilizer costs water use inefficiencies and negative environmental impacts given that most growers in this system have the technical capacity for precise fertigation detailed knowledge of crop irrigation and nutrient requirements will enable application to match crop demand numerous authors have experimentally determined tomato nutrient uptake juárez et al 2017 voogt 1993 however it is very difficult to extrapolate nutrient uptake determined in a limited number of individual experimental crops to a specific commercial crop because of differences in cropping dates weather conditions greenhouse characteristics and crop management practices the most effective way to cope with the variability in nutrient uptake with time amongst commercial crops is the use of simulation models simulation models calculate daily uptake of nutrients considering the specific conditions of individual crops and anticipate the likely nutrient requirements the vegsyst simulation model gallardo et al 2011 2014 2016 giménez et al 2013 calculates daily dry matter production dmp crop n uptake and crop evapotranspiration of the main greenhouse crops grown in southeast se spain this model has been integrated into a decision support system dss the vegsyst dss that provide recommendations for daily irrigation rates daily n fertilizer rate and daily n concentration in the nutrient solution for

shtml the simulation of crop uptake of k p ca and mg in tomato was incorporated into vegsyst v3 gallardo et al 2021 in vegsyst v3 the critical n curve of padilla et al 2015 was used for estimation of n content and consequently for n uptake a revised version of the associated decision support system vegsyst dss v2 was recently developed by adding a component for recommendations of p k ca and mg

model has been developed to be incorporated into a dss which required that the number of inputs be minimized also having been specifically developed for greenhouse grown crops it considers the transmissivity of greenhouse cover has eto equations adapted to and validated for greenhouse conditions gallardo et al 2011 2016 2017b the cropping conditions for which vegsyst was developed soil grown crops in simple plastic greenhouses are similar to those of greenhouse vegetable production in uruguay additionally no other model simulates etc and crop n and k uptake of soil grown tomato in greenhouse production this combination is very useful for fertigated crops until now the vegsyst model has only been calibrated and validated for plastic greenhouses in se spain the performance of the model in very different conditions such as in the southern hemisphere in uruguay is unknown the primary objective of this study was to recalibrate and validate the vegsyst v3 model to simulate seasonal dynamics of dmp crop uptake of n and k and etc for beef tomato grown in soil in greenhouses in uruguay with autumn and spring growing seasons the secondary objective was to evaluate the performance of the vegsyst model to simulate dmp and n and k uptake in greenhouse tomato crops in uruguay using the original calibration developed for tomato in almeria in future work a decision support system dss based on the vegsyst dss will be developed to be used for practical fertigation management in greenhouses in uruguay 2 materials and methods 2 1 calibration and validation of the vegsyst model for uruguayan conditions the vegsyst v3 model gallardo et al 2016 2021 was calibrated and validated to simulate daily and seasonal dmp etc and n and k uptake of greenhouse soil grown

located in the middle of each plot were used to measure soil matric potential every day three treatments consisted of three different fertigation regimes were applied in each of the five tomato crops the treatment used for the study consisted of complete nutrient solution applied throughout the crop in all irrigation the macronutrient and micronutrient concentrations used ensured no limitations the others fertigation regimes were not reported here because they were not used for the study the composition of the nutrient solution was formulated considering expected yield nutrient concentration in irrigation water and soil characteristics it was also adjusted for phenological stage total n and k application for each crop throughout the entire growing period is presented in table 2 the differences in total amounts of applied nutrients between individual crops were due to i different yield expectations depending on crop growing season autumn or spring berrueta et al 2020a and ii variations in soil nutrient supply which was higher in the 2019 growing seasons because of higher soil fertility which decreased with succeeding crops petiole sap test were conducted every 14 days to ensure that n and k were not limiting crop growth using reference values from hochmuth et al 2015 randomized complete block designs with four replications were used for each trial replicate plots measured 14 m by 1 88 m each plot contained one row of tomato plants with 0 2 m between plants the greenhouse was divided longitudinally into northern and southern plots by a 2 m wide path along its east west axis with two plots of each treatment in each of the northern and southern sectors there were border areas along the edges of the greenhouse 2 1 2 measurements 2 1 2 1 climatic data temperature and relative humidity inside the greenhouses were measured and recorded every 30 min with a weather station model vantage pro2 davis instruments usa located at the center of the greenhouse positioned slightly above the height of the crop daily global radiation was measured with a pyranometer model cs320 campbell scientific logan ut usa located outside the greenhouse and daily radiation inside the greenhouse was calculated by multiplying outside solar radiation by greenhouse transmissivity greenhouse transmissivity for each crop was measured at the beginning and at the end of each growing period measurements were made with a ceptometer model lp 80 decagon devices inc pullman usa at 1 5 m above ground in 16 positions both inside and outside greenhouse at 9 00 12 00 and 16 00 on sunny days 2 1 2 2 fraction of radiation intercepted the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation par intercepted by the crops was determined from measurements made with a linear quantum sensor model lp 80 decagon devices inc pullman usa every 20 days for all crops four measurements were conducted per replication plot in each crop two per each side of the row the probe was positioned at 45 angle across the rows at ground level and just above canopy probe position ensure covering half row and half path to consider row and path effect measurements were made at 12 30 on sunny days 2 1 2 3 dry matter accumulation nitrogen and potassium uptake measurements of above ground dry matter production dmp throughout each crop were made by harvesting one plant per replicated plot every 20 days at each biomass sampling the amounts of dry matter in leaves stems and fruits were determined dry matter determinations were made by weighing all fresh material of each component and oven drying at 65 c until constant weight the amounts of all pruned shoot material and fruit production were determined throughout each crop in 10 plants per replicate plot at each pruning and harvest the amount of dry matter removed was determined as described previously on average seven biomass sampling 14 prunings and nine harvests were conducted for each tomato crop for each biomass sampling total shoot dmp was determined from the sum of dry matter of leaves stems and immature fruits for that sampling date plus the combined dry matter of all pruned material and harvested fruit until that sampling date the n and k content in dry matter was determined in finely ground samples of i leaves stems and fruit from biomass samplings ii pruned material and iii fruit from harvests the n content was determined by the kjeldahl method and the k content by atomic absorption spectroscopy isaac and kerber 1971 above ground crop uptake of each analysed element was calculated for each biomass sampling in each crop as the sum of the uptake in leaves stems and immature fruit plus the uptake in pruned and harvested material since the previous biomass sampling for each nutrient on each date uptake was calculated as the sum of the products of dmp and element content for each component 2 1 2 4 crop evapotranspiration in each crop weekly etc was determined using a water balance approach as the difference between the weekly measured volumes of irrigation and drainage also considering the difference in soil moisture the volume of each irrigation was measured with volume meters table 2 drainage was collected from a free draining re packed lysimeters 2 m long 0 9 m wide 1 4 m deep three times per week table 2 the soil profile in the lysimeter reproduced that of the outside area to a depth of 1 4 m with a layer of gravel between geotextile meshes at the bottom of the lysimeter the volumetric soil moisture content for the water balance calculations was measured weekly using a neutron probe ict

final kc values of the vegsyst model were obtained in this study for the autumn and spring crops by minimizing errors between measured and simulated etc values 2 3 statistical indices to evaluate model performance the performance of the simulation of dmp n and k uptake and etc using the recalibrated vegsyst model was validated for tomato with autumn and spring growing seasons in uruguay using the experimental data from autumn 19 autumn 21 and spring 21 the performance of dmp n and k uptake simulation using the original vegsyst v3 calibration was validated using the experimental data from all tomato crops to evaluate the agreement between simulated and measured values the following statistical indices were used the root mean square error rmse the relative error re stöckle et al 2004 the willmott index of agreement d willmott 1982 and linear regression analysis between simulated and measured values values of re 0 25 and d 0 75 were considered to indicate good model performance following yang et al 2014 3 results 3 1 climate data average values of air temperature relative humidity and the daily integral of solar radiation inside the greenhouse for each tomato crop are

thermal time at the end of canopy growth ctt f were also lower for spring crops fig 1 table 4 validation crops showed the same sigmoidal relationship for fi par and ctt observed for calibration crops for a given growing season e g autumn and spring the different crops generally had a similar relationship between fi par and ctt fig 1 the exception was spring 21 where higher values of fi par occurred in the last two measurements fig 1b both the autumn and spring crops had higher maximum values of the fraction of intercepted par than was reported for tomato in almería table 4 the curve describing the relationship between fi par and ctt for tomato in almería was intermediate between the autumn and spring tomato crops in uruguay full interception in almería was reached at 798 ºd intermediate between autumn 956 ºd and spring 500 ºd crops in uruguay table 4 the derived calibration parameters for autumn and spring tomato crops grown in uruguay are presented in table 4 except for base temperature all parameters were obtained from experimental data of the autumn 20 and spring 19 crops calibration coefficients determined for tomato in se spain by gallardo et al 2021 2014 used vegsyst v3 are also presented in table 4 base temperature for tomato was considered to be 10 ºc marcelis et al 1998 the radiation use efficiency rue for both growing seasons in uruguay was lower than value for tomato of vegsyst in almeria table 4 this was particularly so for the spring growing season that had the lowest rue the relationships for both n and k content with dmp were determined using pooled data from the five tomato crops fig 2 the dilution curve for n content fitted to pooled data was described by the power equation n 3 4117 x dmp 0 153 table 4 fig 2 with a high r2 value of 0 84 the k dilution curve was described by the power equation k 4 359 x dmp 0 005 with a low r2 value of 0 02 fig 2 despite this low r2 value model simulations of k uptake showed good model performance according to statistical indices re 0 25 and the willmott index of agreement 0 95 table 5 moreover simulations with this equation showed better results compared to the original version of vegsyst v3 fig 7 the seasonal evolution of simulated and measured values of dmp n and k uptake for the calibration crops in autumn fig 3a c e and spring fig 3b d f are presented in fig 3 there was generally good agreement between simulated and measured values of dmp n and k uptake for calibration crops re 0 17 and willmott index of agreement d 0 99 table 5 except for the last sampling date of the autumn 20 crop when dmp and n uptake were overestimated by the model fig 3a c as well as k although autumn crops had higher rue values table 4 they received less par radiation than spring crops table 3 particularly after reaching maximum canopy development consequently the accumulation of dmp n and k uptake was lower for the autumn compared to the spring crop fig 3 at the end of the growing period accumulated measured dmp was 12 8 0 3 t ha 1 and 15 4 1 1 t ha 1 mean standard error for the autumn 20 and spring 19 respectively for the autumn 20 crop total n uptake was 289 9 kg ha 1 and total k uptake was 558 21 kg ha 1 for the spring 19 crop total n and k uptake were 346 33 kg ha 1 and 615 55 kg ha 1 respectively the ratio between k and n uptake was similar for both crops being 1 9 and 1 8

average daily radiation and temperature values table 3 resulted in lower total etc the kc values determined for the autumn calibration crop were 0 15 1 43 and 0 45 for initial maximum and final kc

seasonal evolution of dmp and uptake of n and k simulated and measured values of seasonal evolution of dmp n and k uptake for one validation crop for each growing season autumn 21 and spring 21 are presented in fig 5 in both of these validation crops there was a good agreement between simulated and measured values throughout the growing season some discrepancies were observed in the last two

dmp and total n uptake were very similar to calibration crops accumulated dmp measured was 12 7 0 5 t ha 1 and 14 3 1 1 t ha 1 mean standard error for autumn 21 and spring 21 respectively fig 5a and b

simulations of dmp and of n and k uptake table 5 re was below 0 25 and the willmott index of agreement d above 0 97 in all calibration and validation crops for dmp n and k uptake parameters these values are considered acceptable according to the criteria of yang et al 2014 according to the slope m and intercept c of the linear relationship between measured and estimated values the model underestimated the measured values in several parameters and crops e g autumn 19 spring 19 and spring 21 for dmp n and k uptake for autumn 21 dmp n and k uptake were overestimated by the model according to the slope and intercept of linear regression the disagreement occurring in the last part of growing period fig 5a c e no significant bias was observed for dmp and n uptake in autumn 20 slope was not significantly different from 1 and intercept from 0 3 3 2 validation of seasonal evolution of etc simulated etc throughout the crop growing seasons showed good agreement with measured

evapotranspiration was accurately simulated by the recalibrated vegsyst model for the calibration and validation tomato crops according to statistical indices presented in table 6 for all crops the re

underestimated the measured etc in most crops e g spring 19 autumn 20 and spring 21 particularly in the last part of growing period fig 6b 3 3 3 comparison of the recalibrated and original vegsyst model simulated values of dmp n uptake and k uptake calculated with the recalibrated vegsyst and the original vegsyst v3 models gallardo et al 2021 2014 are plotted against measured values for pooled data from the five tomato crops in fig 7 the results obtained with the version of vegsyst recalibrated for uruguayan conditions were closer to measured data than those obtained with the vegsyst v3 recalibrated vegsyst showed good performance to predict dmp n and k uptake with slopes of regression curves between measured and simulated values being 0 95 0 94 and 0 95 respectively fig 7a c and e the r2 values were 0 97 0 96 and 0 97 for the dmp n and k uptake regression curves fig 7a c and e this agrees with statistical indices interpretation detailed in section 3 2 1 table 5 the results from the vegsyst v3 model had slopes of regression equations between simulated and measured values of 1 07 0 88 and 0 72 for dmp n and k uptake respectively fig 7b d and f these were further from one than was obtained with the recalibrated model this was confirmed with the statistical indices presented in table 7 the re values for simulations obtained with the recalibrated model were lower than those obtained with vegsyst v3 for dmp all crops n uptake autumn 19 autumn 20 and k uptake all crops vegsyst v3 showed poor performance re 0 25 0 9 m 1 1 for k uptake simulations in autumn 19 autumn 20 autumn 21 and spring 21 the slopes of regression curves between measured and simulated k uptake were lower than 0 76 indicating model underestimation nevertheless the calibration of vegsyst v3 showed acceptable performance for dmp except for spring 19 and autumn 21 and n uptake simulations re 0 25 d 0 95 despite that it was developed for different cropping conditions for crop n uptake vegsyst v3 simulations for autumn 21 and spring 21 presented lower re compared to the recalibrated model for spring 19 model performance was very good re 0 10 d 0 95 4 discussion 4 1 model calibration and validation the vegsyst model developed to assist with nutrient and irrigation management of greenhouse vegetable crops in se spain was calibrated and validated for tomato grown in plastic greenhouses in uruguay south america calibration was conducted for the two most common cropping cycles in the region being spring and autumn crops berrueta et al 2020a recalibrated vegsyst accurately simulated crop biomass production crop n and k uptake over time for both autumn and spring growing seasons the vegsyst model simulates dmp based on the fraction of intercepted par and rue the value obtained for the maximum fraction of intercepted par f f for the autumn growing season was higher than spring and also in that of the vegsyst v3 model 0 90 0 76 and 0 73 respectively the high values for this parameter in the autumn crop compared to spring could be explained by the seasonal pattern of light interception with on average a lower fraction of light intercepted during summer than during winter months the higher solar elevation in summer months results in an orientation of light rays more perpendicular to the plant canopy causing higher light penetration and lower interception sarlikioti et al 2011 lower maximum fraction of intercepted par for vegsyst v3 calibration can possibly be attributed to lower plant densities and higher leaf pruning intensities plant density used for calibration and validation crops was 2 66 plant m 2 whereas 2 plants m 2 was used in vegsyst v3 calibration gallardo et al 2014 only two leaf prunings were conducted in the uruguayan tomato crops only leaves below the second truss were removed when fruits of first truss began to ripen despite normalizing for thermal time a delay in the development of canopy cover in relation to ctt in autumn crops was observed compared with spring crops in uruguay according to gallardo et al 2017b this could be explained by the differences between crops in the relationship between ctt and cumulated solar radiation for a given ctt average solar radiation was much higher in spring than in the autumn table 3 the higher ctt for a given value of solar radiation could be explained by differences in greenhouse ventilation management between seasons with a higher rate of air exchange in spring than in autumn crops gallardo et al 2017b the difference in maximum par interception between the autumn and spring growing seasons could be explained by differences in transplanting dates and cultivars spring crops were transplanted in late winter august and autumn crops were transplanted in late summer february table 1 this being the south hemisphere lower radiation and temperature for spring crops until maximum canopy growth and plant topping could explained the lower values of maximum par interception compared to the autumn also the different cultivars used in autumn elpida and spring lapataia could have affected canopy development these are the cultivars most commonly used in commercial crops in these growing seasons rue was 2 5 and 3 4 g mj par 1 for spring and autumn crops respectively these values coincide with other authors who reported rue values of approximately 3 g mj par 1 for greenhouse tomato cockshull et al 1992 de 1993 and other greenhouse vegetable species baille 1999 gallardo et al 2016 after reaching maximum par interception november spring crops received high radiation with increased ratio of direct diffuse radiation high temperature low relative humidity and high vapor pressure deficit these conditions could explain the lower rue for spring crops baille 1999 heuvelink and dorais 2005 sinclair et al 1992 shade screens and whitening on the greenhouse cover to reduce transmissivity and therefore radiation were not used the rue value derived for the recalibrated model was lower than that of vegsyst v3 the limited climatic control in greenhouses such at used in the current study can result in temperature and relative humidity values outside of optimal ranges this may explain the lower rue values the different cultivars used in uruguay and spain may have resulted in differences in photosynthetic rates and in the light extinction coefficient higashide and heuvelink 2009 in the present work the n dilution curve obtained had a high r2 and the k dilution curve had a low r2 value however k uptake simulations showed accurate performance according to statistical indices moreover simulation with this k dilution curve provided better results than with vegsyst v3 therefore despite the low r2 the k dilution curve obtained here was used in the recalibrated model the contradiction between the k dilution curve having a low r2 value and providing accurate performance when used in simulations suggests that the derived k dilution curve was appropriate for these crops despite notable noise in the data the source of the noise in the data is difficult to identify for n uptake both simulations with the dilution curve obtained here and the critical n curve of padilla et al 2015 of vegsyst v3 showed acceptable performance and accurate prediction therefore both could be used in uruguayan conditions the n dilution curve obtained here showed lower n content for very low dmp values compared to the critical n curve of padilla et al 2015 for greenhouse tomato and tei et al 2002 for processing tomato average total n and k uptake per ton of fresh fruit yield for all crops evaluated were 1 9 kg n t 1 and 3 3 kg k t 1 these values are similar to those reported by ciampitti and garcía 2007 for tomato of 1 9 kg n t 1 and 3 1 kg k t 1 crop evapotranspiration was accurately simulated by the model when using the hargreaves samani equation adapted to plastic greenhouses fernández et al 2010 2011 to estimate eto this was an advantageous change to the existing vegsyst model v3 because it requires less data inputs and provides good results for etc estimation of crops in plastic greenhouses without whitening fernández et al 2011 2010 with calibration of kc values good performance of the model was obtained for simulation of seasonal etc for both growing seasons some slight discrepancies were observed in the last month of the validation crops where the simulation with recalibrated vegsyst model slightly overestimated and underestimated measured data for autumn 21 and spring 21 crops respectively the last month of autumn crops occurred in july mid winter and in spring crops during january mid summer contrasting climatic conditions with extreme temperature and humidity could explain the differences to measured data in the last month of these crops discrepancies between simulated and measured values are frequent in the latter part of the growing season due to a heightened incidence of pest and disease and leaf senescence gallardo m personal communication the maximum kc values were 1 43 for autumn and 1 2 for spring crops both values of maximum kc are consistent with reported values for vertically supported greenhouse crops fernández et al 2001 orgaz et al 2005 the suggested explanation for the relatively high maximum kc values of supported greenhouse vegetable crops compared to open field crops is more uniform light penetration within the canopies that enable higher et for given climatic conditions orgaz et al 2005 more uniform light penetration results from the taller and more open canopies supported and pruned higher leaf area indices lai and the higher proportion of diffuse radiation inside the greenhouse orgaz et al 2005 the maximum kc value was lower for spring than for autumn crops this could be explained by the lower fraction of intercepted par of the spring crops 16 lower than autumn crops which was presumably associated with the lower lai of the spring crops data not shown a decrease in kc during the last part of crop was used kc fin only for autumn crops in the autumn crops following the period of maximum kc kc values subsequently decreased slightly during the latter part of the autumn growing season in the autumn crops with longer growing periods older leaves clearly showed signs of senescence these were not observed in the spring crops orgaz et al 2005 suggested that the reduction in kc values during the latter part of growing period was due to senescence and or cold damage to leaves these difference between autumn and spring crops were not reflected in the fraction of intercepted par fig 1a because only very old leaves were removed during crop growth and many damaged leaves remain on the plant as is common in the region the vegsyst v3 model has previously demonstrated robust performance by adequately simulating accumulated dmp etc and crop nutrient uptake for a range of greenhouse grown vegetable crops under different conditions sites years varieties planting densities growing media seasonal cycles length of growing season gallardo et al 2021 2016 2011 giménez et al 2017 2013 the vegsyst model was adapted to outdoor vegetable crop with good results giménez et al 2019 the robustness of the vegsyst model was confirmed in the present work by the acceptable results for dmp and n uptake for greenhouse tomato in uruguay when using the calibration of vegsyst v3 the n uptake simulations using the critical n curve of padilla et al 2015 were as good as those obtained using the locally derived n dilution curve this indicated that either n curve could be used for uruguayan conditions however the recalibrated version for uruguayan conditions obtained more accurate simulations of dmp and k uptake potassium uptake using the k dilution curve of vegsyst v3 showed poor performance compared to the recalibrated version 4 2 on farm application of the vegsyst model to improve water and nutrient management the vegsyst model has been developed to assist with on farm decision making such as when and how much nutrient and irrigation to apply the calibration of vegsyst for tomato grown in plastic greenhouses in uruguay will assist local growers and farm advisers prepare fertigation plans that consider climatic conditions growing season and planting dates given the inter annual climate variability of uruguay tiscornia et al 2016 consideration of climate data of specific years is essential using the prescriptive corrective management approach granados et al 2013 incrocci et al 2017 thompson et al 2017 recommendations from model simulations can be used to assist with prescriptive management a decision support system dss vegsyst dss based on vegsyst model has been developed to provide daily recommendations of irrigation volume and nutrient concentration gallardo et al 2014 2016 nutrient recommendations are based on crop nutrient uptake simulated by the model and additionally consider nutrients supplied by soil and manure and nutrient use efficiency irrigation requirements are based on simulated etc and additionally consider irrigation application efficiency and salinity the main advantage of the vegsyst dss is that require very few inputs all of which are readily available to farmers and advisors for best on farm results the corrective management of the prescriptive corrective approach is also required this part involves crop and soil monitoring to make adjustments to ensure optimal crop nutrient and water status thompson et al 2017 theses monitoring techniques can integrate plant and root zone monitoring thompson et al 2017 peña fleitas et al 2015 some of them have been already adapted for uruguayan conditions berrueta et al 2021 2022 and are currently used by farm advisers 5 conclusions the vegsyst v3 model was calibrated and validated for tomato grown in plastic greenhouses in uruguay south america calibration was performed for spring and autumn crops the most common growing seasons in the region recalibrated vegsyst accurately simulated crop biomass production etc crop n and k uptake over time for both autumn and spring crops acceptable results were obtained using the original vegsyst v3 calibration for dmp and n uptake which confirmed the robustness of the calibration that was derived in almeria spain the exception was k where the original calibration consistently underestimated k uptake for simulating n uptake the n dilution curve obtained in the current work and the critical n curve of vegsyst v3 both provided accurate predictions therefore both could be used in uruguayan conditions a decision support system based on recalibrated vegsyst model will be developed to assist uruguayan farmers and advisers it will provide daily calculation of irrigation volumes and nutrient concentrations tailored to the specific characteristics of each crop and greenhouse doing so will enhance crop yield improve water and nutrient use efficiency and

8877,water is the main limiting factor for olive cultivation in rainfed conditions in irrigated orchards water availability is scarce mainly during drought periods thus increasing irrigation efficiency is a key issue to improve water management especially in semiarid conditions the objective of this study was to assess different irrigation strategies on tree growth and production components during three years in a young super high density olive orchard arbequina cv located in northeast spain four deficit irrigation strategies were compared to a control strategy based on replenishing crop evapotranspiration the four strategies were as follows continuous deficit irrigation cdi two regulated deficit irrigation strategies moderate mrdi and severe srdi and a precision irrigation strategy based on daily trunk growth precision in the precision strategy olive oil production increased by 7 and the vegetative variables did not show significant reductions resulting in an average yearly water savings of 31 compared to the control strategy the regulated deficit irrigation strategies also produced promising results based on the high average yearly water saving rates of 19 and 29 however the srdi strategy exhibited significant reductions in tree height lateral branches growth olive yield and oil yield compared to the control on the other hand the mrdi strategy did not differ significantly in oil yield tree height and lateral branches growth compared to the control or precision strategies similarly the cdi strategy resulted in significantly lower tree height lateral branches growth and production compared to the control although the observed reduced growth in both srdi and cdi strategies presents an interesting opportunity for managing excessive vigor in super high density olive orchards it is important to consider that this approach may compromise production in successive seasons graphical abstract ga1 keywords trunk diameter growth yield efficiency vegetative response water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction olive cultivation is generally concentrated in areas with a mediterranean climate which is characterized by mild rainy winters and warm dry summers spain leads olive production with an area of 2 77 million hectares of which 1 89 million are cultivated in rainfed orchards the rest were grown under irrigation conditions mapa 2021 in the rainfed conditions water is the main limiting factor of the crop along with increasing temperatures these factors make the rainfed low density orchards in dry regions more vulnerable to climate change mairech et al 2021 for this reason planting densities have been very low in traditional olive cultivation however in the last 20 years super high density orchards have been planted their density varies from 550 to 850 trees ha 1 in rainfed conditions and from 650 to 2000 plants ha 1 in irrigated orchards in these orchards trees were hedgerow trained to maximize production and reduce costs through mechanized harvesting connor et al 2014 rius and lacarte 2015 super high density orchard mechanical harvesting with straddle harvesters multiplies the effective field capacity by 2 7 compared to other harvesting systems castillo ruiz et al 2015 this effective field capacity was calculated and defined by asae 2005 due to higher crop evapotranspiration etc demands for the dense canopies and the low relative soil volume available for each tree more irrigation water ha 1 is necessary for super high density olive orchards the mediterranean olive growing area is characterized by water deficits during summer cabezas et al 2020 available water resources are often insufficient to satisfy olive irrigation demands thus it is necessary to reduce the amount of water applied two of the most widely assessed strategies to save water are continuous deficit irrigation cdi in which only a percentage of etc is applied during the all vegetative period martín vertedor et al 2011 patumi et al 1999 and regulated deficit irrigation rdi which consists of irrigating below etc only during plant water stress periods that can be tolerated gómez del campo 2013 other strategies can be found in steduto et al 2012 an adequate water deficit management can lead to increase irrigation water productivity arbizu milagro et al 2022 corell et al 2019 martínez gimeno et al 2022 moriana et al 2003 it is necessary to properly define periods of water stress which can be tolerated and the level of irrigation reduction because water scarcity at certain phenological growth stages can negatively affect vegetative development and yield for example in olives a moderate water deficit after pit hardening does not seem to affect fruit growth compared to trees without water deficit rosecrance et al 2015 however water stress in the final moments of olive growth can cause a reduction in fruit diameter and oil yield it seems that negative effects are minimized between pit hardening and the onset of fruit ripening alegre et al 2002 iniesta et al 2009 tognetti et al 2006 tovar et al 2002 on the contrary certain phenological growth stages are particularly sensitive to water stress conditions which are common in the mediterranean climate for example the stem elongation period is very sensitive to low soil moisture especially in dry warm weather leading to fruit drop fruit size reduction and alternate bearing girona et al 2004 rapoport et al 2012 the two irrigation strategies rdi 75 of etc without irrigation in summer and cdi 75 of etc along with the application of 100 etc control were compared and found to produce similar yields in both treatments moriana et al 2003 other experiments were carried out to study the cdi strategy patumi et al 1999 and rdi during the pit hardening phenological stage alegre et al 2002 goldhamer 1999 motilva et al 2000 tovar et al 2002 these studies found no differences in terms of olive production between the control and the two deficit irrigation strategies on the contrary more recent studies have indicated that the rdi strategy obtained greater water savings and greater water productivity compared to the cdi strategy siakou et al 2021 however trees under the cdi strategy had lower transpiration rates than fully irrigated trees lópez bernal et al 2018 moreover the irrigation strategy can influence the olive fruit composition and the corresponding oil quality some studies have concluded that early water stress produces an increase in the phenolic concentration of olive oil compared with full irrigation gucci et al 2019 similar results have been reported for rdi treatments during pit hardening garcía garví et al 2022 sánchez rodríguez et al 2020 however a late deficit during the oil synthesis period causes the opposite effect decreasing the phenol content as well as other qualitative components of the oil garcía et al 2020 the objective of this study was to assess the effects of distinct deficit irrigation strategies on growth and production components in young super high density olive groves the assessment will provide irrigation management strategies that could reduce water consumption without reducing production parameters while maintaining controlled vegetative development 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted during three consecutive growing seasons from april to december at a commercial orchard planted with cv arbequina i 18 olea europaea l located in the northeast of spain 42º 14 57 73 n 2º 2 58 45 w trees were 4 year old at the beginning of the experiment and were hedgerow trained with a 4 m x 1 5 m spacing so they could be harvested using a straddle canopy shaker the orchard harvest date was decided by the commercial plot technician to maximize oil yield on a dry basis and attend to the harvester s availability soil was relatively deep 1 5 m with a loam clay sandy texture alkaline ph low organic matter and high calcium carbonate content field capacity was 29 permanent wilting point was 9 bulk density varied from 1 44 to 1 52 t m 3 and hydraulic conductivity was 3 9 and 1 6 cm h 1 at 30 and 60 cm depths respectively apart from the high clay content and high bulk density the main limitation of the soil was salinity which could reach 1 6 ds m 1 in the soil and 1 1 ds m 1 in the irrigation water orchard management for all treatments was uniform except for irrigation the orchard was located in a continental mediterranean climate fig 1 therefore irrigation was advisable the commercial orchard irrigation system included an automatic irrigation controller and a general flowmeter the flowmeter controlled the irrigation flow in the area where the experimental plots were located drip irrigation was carried out during the irrigation season each year using one dripline per tree row with integrated drippers 0 6 m apart and 2 5 l h 1 per dripper each dripline was controlled by a manual valve which was partially closed to adjust the desired flow in each treatment the partial closure of the manual valves was adjusted every year before starting irrigation and each emitter flow was measured to adjust for each treatment thus the irrigation time was set and maintained the same for all treatments by the automatic irrigation controller dripline valves for the precision strategy were closed and opened manually according to dendrometer measurements during july and august meteorological data was obtained from an automatic weather station located in the orchard 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments the experimental design was a randomized complete block with 5 treatments of irrigation and 3 replications each 15 experimental plots each replication composed of 7 trees located in a single row with two adjacent buffer rows moreover all measurements were taken from the five central trees all irrigation strategies were designed based on the daily crop etc calculated using the penman monteith fao method allen et al 1998 using data from the automatic weather station eq 1 as we have a perennial leaf crop girona i gomis 1996 the constant crop coefficient of 0 7 kc was used for this high density crop in full production which was within the wide range 0 5 0 75 considered by other authors connor et al 2014 a tree ground cover coefficient of 0 75 kr fereres and castel 1981 canopy cover was measured in the first year of the tests sc 37 5 and the same value was applied for the three years of study because the trees were not pruned during this period and the main development was in height thus canopy cover hardly varied through the experimental period and kr was considered constant eq 2 1 etc et 0 kc kr 2 kr 2 sc 100 all irrigation strategies except continuous deficit irrigation cdi received full water needs from april to june constituting no differences with the fully irrigated control treatment the irrigation was carried out to obtain an adequate flowering set fruit setting and more shoots for the following year this water status was maintained until the pit hardening phenological stage which took place in early july from pit hardening to the beginning of fruit ripening early september sensitivity to water deficit was considered to be less important this effect is due to stomata closing caused by a high daily vapor pressure deficit vpd hence vegetative growth stopped during the summer and irrigations were limited to those that maintained the photosynthetic functions of the leaves from september to october the fruit ripening and oil accumulation period water stress sensitivity reached maximum again therefore all strategies except cdi received full water needs again until harvest which took place during november in the three tested years considering these premises irrigation strategies were defined as follows control 100 etc during the whole irrigation season moderate regulated deficit irrigation mrdi the same as the control except in july and august summer vegetative growth stop irrigation was 50 etc severe regulated deficit irrigation srdi the same as the control except in july and august summer vegetative growth stop irrigation was 25 etc continuous deficit irrigation cdi 50 etc the whole irrigation season from april to early november databased precision irrigation precision the same as the control except in july and august summer vegetative growth stop irrigation only took place after two consecutive days of decreased trunk diameter according to dendrometer data verdtech dendrometer verdesmart co s l spain water applied in each irrigation during this period was equivalent to the etc of the previous day the dendrometer was installed 15 cm above the ground on the main trunk of a representative tree for the precision strategy the dendrometer took and sent measurements every 15 min via radio to a data logger the daily trunk growth was calculated from the daily curves as the difference between two maximum trunk diameters of two consecutive days in the precision strategy dripline valves were manually opened when the dendrometer provided two consecutive days of trunk diameter decrease compared to the previous day 2 3 vegetative measurements in each replication tree height from the soil the length of two lateral bearing branches and trunk diameters were measured at 15 cm above the soil the measured branches were randomly selected each year at eye height and distributed around the canopy boundary a total of 15 trunk diameters tree heights and 30 lateral bearing branch lengths were measured measurements were taken at the 5 different phenological stages as follows 15 days after stem elongation i pre flowering ii 5 weeks after fruit setting iii beginning of fruit ripening iv and pre harvesting v table 1 the variations in annual growth were studied by comparing the calculated trunk cross sectional area tca in cm² at the end of the two consecutive irrigation seasons early november just before harvest and by obtaining the trunk cross sectional area increase tcai cm² year 1 eq 1 3 tcai cm 2 year 1 tca i tca i 1 1 year 2 4 production measurements during the month before harvest a random sample of 100 fruit from around the canopy boundary at eye height was taken from 5 trees per replication average fruit weight maturity index mi based on the assessment of skin and pulp color on a scale ranging from 0 100 deep green skin fruit hard to 7 100 purple flesh and black skin berenguer et al 2006 were measured throughout the month prior to harvest the maturity index mi is defined as follows 4 mi n 0 0 n 1 1 n 2 2 n 3 3 n 4 4 n 5 5 n 6 6 n 7 7 100 where n indicates the number of olives at each maturity stage n0 n7 berenguer et al 2006 fruit water content and fat content by the soxlhlet method were measured on the harvest date the three central trees of each replication were manually harvested to determine fruit yield calculated as average production per tree frías et al 1999 yield efficiency ye kg cm 2 was calculated as the production of a tree in relation to the trunk cross sectional area tca cm2 to consider the differences in the size of the tree and its growth at the time of harvest caruso et al 2013 the resource distribution kg cm 2 year 1 was also estimated as a ratio between the olive yield and the trunk cross sectional area increase tcai ebel et al 1995 martínez gimeno et al 2022 furthermore oil yield per tree was calculated after measuring the oil content extracted from a fruit sample using an abencor laboratory assembly frías et al 1999 oil yield efficiency oye was calculated as the oil production of a tree in relation to the tca caruso et al 2013 2 5 data analysis results were examined by applying an analysis of variance using the spss statistics 19 0 for windows ibm corporation armonk ny usa differences and confidence levels were determined by calculating the least significant difference lsd and significant differences were defined at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water saving meteorological data et0 and rainfall were measured showing typical mediterranean values most of the rain fell before the beginning of the irrigation season and during the first and third irrigation periods during the second irrigation period july and august rain was scarce fig 2 table 2 every year the amount of irrigation water applied varied but the differences between irrigation strategies were maintained relatively constant table 2 except for the cdi strategy all other strategies only restricted water applied during summer so the irrigation data are presented in three periods before the summer vegetative stop period i during the summer vegetative stop period ii and after the summer vegetative stop period iii during period ii july and august trunk diameter data were used to support irrigation decisions in the precision strategy reducing the number of irrigation events compared with the rest of the treatments in which the irrigation was carried out daily in this strategy the number of irrigations during the summer vegetative stop period ii was reduced to 12 for years 1 and 3 and to 16 in year 2 which was drier than the other years thus in the precision strategy the water applied in period ii was reduced to 83 77 and 84 of that applied in the control strategy for each year of the experiment respectively for each year of the experiment all irrigation strategies achieved significant water savings compared to the control strategy greater water savings were provided by the cdi strategy 50 followed by precision irrigation along with sdri 31 and 28 respectively and finally mrdi 19 3 2 vegetative response regardless of the irrigation strategy tree height increased rapidly during phenological stages i to iii between phases iii and iv pit hardening growth stopped and at the end of the summer there was a second vegetative growth increase the vegetative stop was affected by water management which provoked a lower level of growth in the cdi srdi and mrdi strategies supplementary material fig s 1 mrdi and srdi height decrease was due to apical buds withering because of the lack of water and soil conditions this fact resulted in a mean tree height reduction in this treatment table 3 once the full irrigation was recovered the highest shoot without apical damage resumed its growth and was taken as the final tree height tree height for the control strategy showed higher values than the other strategies especially since the second year of the study where the decrease in tree height during phases iii and iv did not recover in phase v of the same year for rdi and cdi strategies in the cdi strategy tree height was affected throughout the whole irrigation season so it increased slower from the beginning of the experiment and the effect during the pit hardening period was lighter than the rest of the irrigation strategies the precision strategy showed greater growth capacity after the vegetative stop period than the rest of the strategies it was similar to the control lateral bearing branch growth followed a similar pattern to tree height growth shown in supplementary material fig s 2 branches rapidly grew during phases i to iii and suffered a growth stop or even a length decrease due to apical buds withering in phases iii to iv when the pit hardening period ended and irrigation was reestablished most of the irrigation strategies recovered and achieved a similar growth rate as the control strategy excluding srdi and cdi the cdi strategy provided between 50 and 65 less absolute lateral branch growth than the control strategy table 3 despite differences in tree height and lateral branch growth rate trunk diameter increase throughout the irrigation period provided less evident differences between irrigation strategies trunk diameter growth stop from phase iii to iv was pronounced in cdi and rdi strategies and particularly in the srdi irrigation strategy for the three years shown in supplementary material fig s 3 after this period of deficit irrigation once irrigation was reestablished trees showed a high recovery capacity all strategies except for the cdi strategy achieved similar trunk diameter growth to the control in the cdi strategy the first season growth was less resulting in a smaller trunk diameter after three growing seasons of the experiment in general trunk cross sectional area increase tcai was affected by alternate bearing with greater growth observed in off years year 2 compared to on years years 1 and 3 these fluctuations of trunk growth according to production seemed to be greater when irrigation was closer to a fully irrigated treatment control rdi and precision strategies however this relationship was less evident for trees under continous water deficit cdi strategy despite this interaction between irrigation and production tcai barely showed significant differences between irrigation strategies table 4 trunk growth was much more independent from irrigation than the absolute lateral branch or tree height growth table 5 only the cdi strategy had significantly lower trunk growth than the rest of the treatments providing 56 less tcai than the control strategy after the three years of the experiment however srdi showed a growth similar to cdi in terms of tree height and lateral branches growth being significantly lower than the control only the mrdi and precision strategies did not significantly differ p 0 05 in any growth measurement from the control strategy table 5 3 3 production measurements irrigation strategies had a significant effect on the ripeness process during the month prior to harvesting fig 3 the maturity index mi evolved distinctly between the most stressful irrigation treatments and the control strategy the most severe deficit irrigation strategies cdi and srdi had a quick mi increase like mrdi while the control fruit ripened much slower finally the precision strategy gave intermediate mi values it was similar to the control strategy during the two first weeks and similar to other strategies in the last two weeks fig 3 at harvest all strategies showed a significantly higher mi than the control and the precision strategies except for the first year the fact that ripening was advanced in deficit strategies should be considered to determine the optimum harvest date considering that irrigation increased fruit water content while water stress increased fat content table 6 at harvest the lowest fruit water content was found in the most stressful strategies cdi and srdi even mrdi showed significant differences p 0 05 compared to the control and the precision strategy table 6 which produced similar values in the three years studied the harvest was carried out the first week of november olive yield was significantly p 0 05 higher in the less stressed strategies which were the control precision and mrdi strategies table 6 olive yield after three years was 30 and 28 less than the control in cdi and srdi strategies respectively and only 6 5 less in the mrdi strategy assessing olive yield components the number of fruit per tree did not show significant differences p 0 05 between strategies only in the third year the number of fruit in the cdi strategy was significantly lower p 0 05 compared to the other strategies however fresh fruit weight provided significantly lower values in the srdi and cdi strategies thus fresh fruit weight was the main yield component that explained olive yield differences finally oil yield followed a similar pattern to olive yield table 6 yield efficiency ye presented differences as the experiment advanced with significant differences p 0 05 only for the second and third years between srdi and the rest of the strategies table 7 in the second year which was an off year due to alternate bearing ye decreased for all strategies however only the srdi strategy showed significant differences p 0 05 oil yield efficiency oye showed similar behavior but it did not provide significant differences p 0 05 until the last year when the precision cdi and srdi strategies stood out with a higher oye than the other irrigation strategies furthermore resource distribution provided significant differences only during the second year which was an off year the cdi treatment reached the highest level which meant that trees prioritize fruit production over tree growth and this effect is more evident in on years 4 discussion tree growth was affected by water management strategy mainly seen in tree height and lateral branch growth tables 3 and 5 and supplementary material negative growths could be measured due to apical bud withering pests or diseases or due to mechanical damage during harvesting pérez ruiz et al 2018 if the irrigation strategy was adequate shoot growth could overcome these setbacks otherwise shoot growth could be negative even for several measurements however trunk diameter and tcai showed a slower response providing significant results p 0 05 in off years or at the end of the experiment in the cdi strategy table 4 the effect of the irrigation strategies on height and lateral branch growth during the pit hardening phase was greater in cdi and srdi treatments and lower in the precision and control strategies especially in the on years see supplementary material figs s 1 and s 2 furthermore the cdi strategy showed a significant decrease for height lateral branches growth and trunk diameter compared to control from the first year supplementary material and table 3 according to results reported by moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 iniesta et al 2009 and pierantozzi et al 2014 this seems to indicate that constant water deficit reduces growth which could be interesting to control vigor in super high density olive orchards martínez gimeno et al 2022 tognetti et al 2006 this objective should be achieved without compromising olive oil yield and economic profit this can be accomplished through a regulated deficit strategy that applies approximately 60 of the crop s water needs when water availability is limited as suggested by fernández et al 2020 these water saving measures align with the 31 reduction in water consumption observed in our study nevertheless oil quality is conditioned for both irrigation amount and fruit bruising during harvesting dag et al 2008 along with fruit location within the olive canopy castillo ruiz et al 2015 complementary measures to control olive vigor in super high density olive orchards could consist of the use of low vigor varieties camposeo et al 2021 or dwarfing rootstocks torres sánchez et al 2022 the srdi strategy also showed the lowest tree height growth since the second year and the lowest lateral branch growth in the third year table 3 these results are consistent with those reported by melgar et al 2008 the cdi irrigation strategy showed significantly lower tcai and trunk diameter regarding cumulative values tables 4 and 5 according to previous research which found that trunk growth was not affected by controlled deficit irrigation moriana et al 2003 because when irrigation was reestablished a high recovery capacity was recorded as described for vegetative and productive response in off years palese et al 2010 however the cdi strategy provided the lowest trunk diameter from the second year pit hardening phase onwards supplementary material fig s 3 olive yield was affected by the amount of irrigation water applied except for the precision strategy which produced the highest cumulative olive yield while achieving more than 30 of the yearly water savings compared to the control strategy the cumulative olive yield was significantly p 0 05 lower in the mrdi srdi and cdi strategies with respect to the control of 7 28 and 30 table 6 achieving water savings of 19 28 and 50 table 2 respectively similar results were obtained by ben gal et al 2021 these differences in olive yield were mainly due to fruit weight and greater water content martínez gimeno et al 2022 moriana et al 2003 while fat content lessened the differences as it was higher for less irrigated strategies than for the control mrdi and precision strategies table 6 however fat content could not compensate olive yield as a result oil yield values remained significantly higher p 0 05 for the precision and control strategies than for the srdi and cdi furthermore the distinct irrigation strategies affected oil yield less than olive yield oil yield cumulative values constituted 3 16 and 17 reductions for mrdi srdi and cdi respectively compared to the control strategy as described by martínez gimeno et al 2022 these results could be explained not only by the fact that a higher moisture content in the fruit negatively affected the industrial extractability berenguer et al 2006 but also because the oil content increased as the water stress rose especially in the treatments with greater water restrictions srdi and cdi the ye decreased from the second year onward with the applied water but only with significant differences p 0 05 for srdi table 7 so the srdi strategy gave ye values 32 and 21 lower than the control for the second and third years respectively which was similar to previous trials caruso et al 2013 martínez gimeno et al 2022 however ye did not decrease in the cdi and precision strategies as much as irrigation did showing a greater yield efficiency than srdi with significant differences in the third year regarding the oil yield efficiency oye all treatments showed behavior similar to the control during the first two years however oye was significantly higher p 0 05 for the cdi and precision strategies in the third year which is consistent with the results reported by caruso et al 2013 as mentioned above the application of deficit irrigation influenced both vegetative development and yield however it is possible to optimize oil production with considerable water savings while also regulating vegetative development martínez gimeno et al 2022 this can be particularly interesting in super high density crops where harvesting is performed using a straddle canopy shaker nevertheless deficit irrigation with high water saving rates did not show a clear reduction in ye or oye although it could delay the first full harvest as described by caruso et al 2013 finally the precision strategy which reduced irrigation only during period 2 the pit hardening phase as shown in tables 1 and 2 led to significant water savings of 31 without compromising the yields of olive and oil 5 conclusions five irrigation strategies were evaluated in terms of water saving vegetative growth and production this research demonstrated that olive tree irrigation can be optimized as it is possible to reduce irrigation by 31 while preserving vegetative development olive yield and oil yield similar to the control the precision strategy did not show significant differences in tree height lateral branches growth trunk diameter growth and olive and oil yields in all years except for year 2 where there was a significant difference in tree height compared to the control furthermore the precision strategy provided the highest olive and oil yields which were significantly greater than those obtained from srdi and cdi strategies however it is worth noting that the precision strategy exhibited lower maturity index values and higher fruit water content compared to the srdi and cdi strategies similarly the mrdi strategy could be of interest to achieve a 19 water savings compared to the control with slight decreases in vegetative parameters but without affecting olive weight at harvest or oil yield however the precision strategy provided a significantly higher oil yield than mrdi on the other hand the srdi and cdi treatments resulted in reduced vegetative development reflected in shorter tree height and decreased average lateral branch growth compared to control and lower olive and oil productions finally both yield efficiency and oil yield efficiency were significantly higher for the precision strategy in comparison with the control however the cdi strategy achieved the highest oye because it prioritized fruit production over vegetative development as indicated by the significantly greater resource distribution compared to any other strategy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

8877,water is the main limiting factor for olive cultivation in rainfed conditions in irrigated orchards water availability is scarce mainly during drought periods thus increasing irrigation efficiency is a key issue to improve water management especially in semiarid conditions the objective of this study was to assess different irrigation strategies on tree growth and production components during three years in a young super high density olive orchard arbequina cv located in northeast spain four deficit irrigation strategies were compared to a control strategy based on replenishing crop evapotranspiration the four strategies were as follows continuous deficit irrigation cdi two regulated deficit irrigation strategies moderate mrdi and severe srdi and a precision irrigation strategy based on daily trunk growth precision in the precision strategy olive oil production increased by 7 and the vegetative variables did not show significant reductions resulting in an average yearly water savings of 31 compared to the control strategy the regulated deficit irrigation strategies also produced promising results based on the high average yearly water saving rates of 19 and 29 however the srdi strategy exhibited significant reductions in tree height lateral branches growth olive yield and oil yield compared to the control on the other hand the mrdi strategy did not differ significantly in oil yield tree height and lateral branches growth compared to the control or precision strategies similarly the cdi strategy resulted in significantly lower tree height lateral branches growth and production compared to the control although the observed reduced growth in both srdi and cdi strategies presents an interesting opportunity for managing excessive vigor in super high density olive orchards it is important to consider that this approach may compromise production in successive seasons graphical abstract ga1 keywords trunk diameter growth yield efficiency vegetative response water management data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction olive cultivation is generally concentrated in areas with a mediterranean climate which is characterized by mild rainy winters and warm dry summers spain leads olive production with an area of 2 77 million hectares of which 1 89 million are cultivated in rainfed orchards the rest were grown under irrigation conditions mapa 2021 in the rainfed conditions water is the main limiting factor of the crop along with increasing temperatures these factors make the rainfed low density orchards in dry regions more vulnerable to climate change mairech et al 2021 for this reason planting densities have been very low in traditional olive cultivation however in the last 20 years super high density orchards have been planted their density varies from 550 to 850 trees ha 1 in rainfed conditions and from 650 to 2000 plants ha 1 in irrigated orchards in these orchards trees were hedgerow trained to maximize production and reduce costs through mechanized harvesting connor et al 2014 rius and lacarte 2015 super high density orchard mechanical harvesting with straddle harvesters multiplies the effective field capacity by 2 7 compared to other harvesting systems castillo ruiz et al 2015 this effective field capacity was calculated and defined by asae 2005 due to higher crop evapotranspiration etc demands for the dense canopies and the low relative soil volume available for each tree more irrigation water ha 1 is necessary for super high density olive orchards the mediterranean olive growing area is characterized by water deficits during summer cabezas et al 2020 available water resources are often insufficient to satisfy olive irrigation demands thus it is necessary to reduce the amount of water applied two of the most widely assessed strategies to save water are continuous deficit irrigation cdi in which only a percentage of etc is applied during the all vegetative period martín vertedor et al 2011 patumi et al 1999 and regulated deficit irrigation rdi which consists of irrigating below etc only during plant water stress periods that can be tolerated gómez del campo 2013 other strategies can be found in steduto et al 2012 an adequate water deficit management can lead to increase irrigation water productivity arbizu milagro et al 2022 corell et al 2019 martínez gimeno et al 2022 moriana et al 2003 it is necessary to properly define periods of water stress which can be tolerated and the level of irrigation reduction because water scarcity at certain phenological growth stages can negatively affect vegetative development and yield for example in olives a moderate water deficit after pit hardening does not seem to affect fruit growth compared to trees without water deficit rosecrance et al 2015 however water stress in the final moments of olive growth can cause a reduction in fruit diameter and oil yield it seems that negative effects are minimized between pit hardening and the onset of fruit ripening alegre et al 2002 iniesta et al 2009 tognetti et al 2006 tovar et al 2002 on the contrary certain phenological growth stages are particularly sensitive to water stress conditions which are common in the mediterranean climate for example the stem elongation period is very sensitive to low soil moisture especially in dry warm weather leading to fruit drop fruit size reduction and alternate bearing girona et al 2004 rapoport et al 2012 the two irrigation strategies rdi 75 of etc without irrigation in summer and cdi 75 of etc along with the application of 100 etc control were compared and found to produce similar yields in both treatments moriana et al 2003 other experiments were carried out to study the cdi strategy patumi et al 1999 and rdi during the pit hardening phenological stage alegre et al 2002 goldhamer 1999 motilva et al 2000 tovar et al 2002 these studies found no differences in terms of olive production between the control and the two deficit irrigation strategies on the contrary more recent studies have indicated that the rdi strategy obtained greater water savings and greater water productivity compared to the cdi strategy siakou et al 2021 however trees under the cdi strategy had lower transpiration rates than fully irrigated trees lópez bernal et al 2018 moreover the irrigation strategy can influence the olive fruit composition and the corresponding oil quality some studies have concluded that early water stress produces an increase in the phenolic concentration of olive oil compared with full irrigation gucci et al 2019 similar results have been reported for rdi treatments during pit hardening garcía garví et al 2022 sánchez rodríguez et al 2020 however a late deficit during the oil synthesis period causes the opposite effect decreasing the phenol content as well as other qualitative components of the oil garcía et al 2020 the objective of this study was to assess the effects of distinct deficit irrigation strategies on growth and production components in young super high density olive groves the assessment will provide irrigation management strategies that could reduce water consumption without reducing production parameters while maintaining controlled vegetative development 2 materials and methods 2 1 site description the experiment was conducted during three consecutive growing seasons from april to december at a commercial orchard planted with cv arbequina i 18 olea europaea l located in the northeast of spain 42º 14 57 73 n 2º 2 58 45 w trees were 4 year old at the beginning of the experiment and were hedgerow trained with a 4 m x 1 5 m spacing so they could be harvested using a straddle canopy shaker the orchard harvest date was decided by the commercial plot technician to maximize oil yield on a dry basis and attend to the harvester s availability soil was relatively deep 1 5 m with a loam clay sandy texture alkaline ph low organic matter and high calcium carbonate content field capacity was 29 permanent wilting point was 9 bulk density varied from 1 44 to 1 52 t m 3 and hydraulic conductivity was 3 9 and 1 6 cm h 1 at 30 and 60 cm depths respectively apart from the high clay content and high bulk density the main limitation of the soil was salinity which could reach 1 6 ds m 1 in the soil and 1 1 ds m 1 in the irrigation water orchard management for all treatments was uniform except for irrigation the orchard was located in a continental mediterranean climate fig 1 therefore irrigation was advisable the commercial orchard irrigation system included an automatic irrigation controller and a general flowmeter the flowmeter controlled the irrigation flow in the area where the experimental plots were located drip irrigation was carried out during the irrigation season each year using one dripline per tree row with integrated drippers 0 6 m apart and 2 5 l h 1 per dripper each dripline was controlled by a manual valve which was partially closed to adjust the desired flow in each treatment the partial closure of the manual valves was adjusted every year before starting irrigation and each emitter flow was measured to adjust for each treatment thus the irrigation time was set and maintained the same for all treatments by the automatic irrigation controller dripline valves for the precision strategy were closed and opened manually according to dendrometer measurements during july and august meteorological data was obtained from an automatic weather station located in the orchard 2 2 experimental design and irrigation treatments the experimental design was a randomized complete block with 5 treatments of irrigation and 3 replications each 15 experimental plots each replication composed of 7 trees located in a single row with two adjacent buffer rows moreover all measurements were taken from the five central trees all irrigation strategies were designed based on the daily crop etc calculated using the penman monteith fao method allen et al 1998 using data from the automatic weather station eq 1 as we have a perennial leaf crop girona i gomis 1996 the constant crop coefficient of 0 7 kc was used for this high density crop in full production which was within the wide range 0 5 0 75 considered by other authors connor et al 2014 a tree ground cover coefficient of 0 75 kr fereres and castel 1981 canopy cover was measured in the first year of the tests sc 37 5 and the same value was applied for the three years of study because the trees were not pruned during this period and the main development was in height thus canopy cover hardly varied through the experimental period and kr was considered constant eq 2 1 etc et 0 kc kr 2 kr 2 sc 100 all irrigation strategies except continuous deficit irrigation cdi received full water needs from april to june constituting no differences with the fully irrigated control treatment the irrigation was carried out to obtain an adequate flowering set fruit setting and more shoots for the following year this water status was maintained until the pit hardening phenological stage which took place in early july from pit hardening to the beginning of fruit ripening early september sensitivity to water deficit was considered to be less important this effect is due to stomata closing caused by a high daily vapor pressure deficit vpd hence vegetative growth stopped during the summer and irrigations were limited to those that maintained the photosynthetic functions of the leaves from september to october the fruit ripening and oil accumulation period water stress sensitivity reached maximum again therefore all strategies except cdi received full water needs again until harvest which took place during november in the three tested years considering these premises irrigation strategies were defined as follows control 100 etc during the whole irrigation season moderate regulated deficit irrigation mrdi the same as the control except in july and august summer vegetative growth stop irrigation was 50 etc severe regulated deficit irrigation srdi the same as the control except in july and august summer vegetative growth stop irrigation was 25 etc continuous deficit irrigation cdi 50 etc the whole irrigation season from april to early november databased precision irrigation precision the same as the control except in july and august summer vegetative growth stop irrigation only took place after two consecutive days of decreased trunk diameter according to dendrometer data verdtech dendrometer verdesmart co s l spain water applied in each irrigation during this period was equivalent to the etc of the previous day the dendrometer was installed 15 cm above the ground on the main trunk of a representative tree for the precision strategy the dendrometer took and sent measurements every 15 min via radio to a data logger the daily trunk growth was calculated from the daily curves as the difference between two maximum trunk diameters of two consecutive days in the precision strategy dripline valves were manually opened when the dendrometer provided two consecutive days of trunk diameter decrease compared to the previous day 2 3 vegetative measurements in each replication tree height from the soil the length of two lateral bearing branches and trunk diameters were measured at 15 cm above the soil the measured branches were randomly selected each year at eye height and distributed around the canopy boundary a total of 15 trunk diameters tree heights and 30 lateral bearing branch lengths were measured measurements were taken at the 5 different phenological stages as follows 15 days after stem elongation i pre flowering ii 5 weeks after fruit setting iii beginning of fruit ripening iv and pre harvesting v table 1 the variations in annual growth were studied by comparing the calculated trunk cross sectional area tca in cm² at the end of the two consecutive irrigation seasons early november just before harvest and by obtaining the trunk cross sectional area increase tcai cm² year 1 eq 1 3 tcai cm 2 year 1 tca i tca i 1 1 year 2 4 production measurements during the month before harvest a random sample of 100 fruit from around the canopy boundary at eye height was taken from 5 trees per replication average fruit weight maturity index mi based on the assessment of skin and pulp color on a scale ranging from 0 100 deep green skin fruit hard to 7 100 purple flesh and black skin berenguer et al 2006 were measured throughout the month prior to harvest the maturity index mi is defined as follows 4 mi n 0 0 n 1 1 n 2 2 n 3 3 n 4 4 n 5 5 n 6 6 n 7 7 100 where n indicates the number of olives at each maturity stage n0 n7 berenguer et al 2006 fruit water content and fat content by the soxlhlet method were measured on the harvest date the three central trees of each replication were manually harvested to determine fruit yield calculated as average production per tree frías et al 1999 yield efficiency ye kg cm 2 was calculated as the production of a tree in relation to the trunk cross sectional area tca cm2 to consider the differences in the size of the tree and its growth at the time of harvest caruso et al 2013 the resource distribution kg cm 2 year 1 was also estimated as a ratio between the olive yield and the trunk cross

laboratory assembly frías et al 1999 oil yield efficiency oye was calculated as the oil production of a tree in relation to the tca caruso et al 2013 2 5 data analysis results were examined by applying an analysis of variance using the spss statistics 19 0 for windows ibm corporation armonk ny usa differences and confidence levels were determined by calculating the least significant difference lsd and significant differences were defined at p 0 05 3 results 3 1 water saving meteorological data et0 and rainfall were measured showing typical mediterranean values most of the rain fell before the beginning of the irrigation season and during the first and third irrigation periods during the second irrigation period july and august rain was scarce fig 2 table 2 every year the amount of irrigation water applied varied but the differences between irrigation strategies were maintained relatively constant table 2 except for the cdi strategy all other strategies only restricted water applied during summer so the irrigation data are presented in three periods before the summer vegetative stop period i during the summer vegetative stop period ii and after the summer vegetative stop period iii during period ii july and august trunk diameter data were used to support irrigation decisions in the precision strategy reducing the number of irrigation events compared with the rest of the treatments in which the irrigation was carried out daily in this strategy the number of irrigations during the summer vegetative stop period ii was reduced to 12 for years 1 and 3 and to 16 in year 2 which was drier than the other years thus in the precision strategy the water applied in period ii was reduced to 83 77 and 84 of that applied in the control strategy for each year of the experiment respectively for each year of the experiment all irrigation strategies achieved significant water savings compared to the control strategy greater water savings were provided by the cdi strategy 50 followed by precision irrigation along with sdri 31 and 28 respectively and finally mrdi 19 3 2 vegetative response regardless of the irrigation strategy tree height increased rapidly during phenological stages i to iii between phases iii and iv pit hardening growth stopped and at the end of the summer there was a second vegetative growth increase the vegetative stop was affected by water management which provoked a lower level of growth in the cdi srdi and mrdi strategies supplementary material fig s 1 mrdi and srdi height decrease was due to apical buds withering because of the lack of water and soil conditions this fact resulted in a mean tree height reduction in this treatment table 3 once the full irrigation was recovered the highest shoot without apical damage resumed its growth and was taken as the final tree height tree height for the control strategy showed higher values than the other strategies especially since the second year of the study where the decrease in tree height during phases iii and iv did not recover in phase v of the same year for rdi and cdi strategies in the cdi strategy tree height was affected throughout the whole irrigation season so it increased slower from the beginning of the experiment and the effect during the pit hardening period was lighter than the rest of the irrigation strategies the precision strategy showed greater growth capacity after the vegetative stop period than the rest of the strategies it was similar to the control lateral bearing branch growth followed a similar pattern to tree height growth shown in supplementary material fig s 2 branches rapidly grew during phases i to iii and suffered a growth stop or even a length decrease due to apical buds withering in phases iii to iv when the pit hardening period ended and irrigation was reestablished most of the irrigation strategies recovered and achieved a similar growth rate as the control strategy excluding srdi and cdi the cdi strategy provided between 50 and 65 less absolute lateral branch growth than the control strategy table 3 despite differences in tree height and lateral branch growth rate trunk diameter increase throughout the irrigation period provided less evident differences between irrigation strategies trunk diameter growth stop from phase iii to iv was pronounced in cdi and rdi strategies and particularly in the srdi irrigation strategy for the three years shown in supplementary material fig s 3 after this period of deficit irrigation once irrigation was reestablished trees showed a high recovery capacity all strategies except for the cdi strategy achieved similar trunk diameter growth to the control in the cdi strategy the first season growth was less resulting in a smaller trunk diameter after three growing seasons of the experiment in general trunk cross sectional area increase tcai was affected by alternate bearing with greater growth observed in off years year 2 compared to on years years 1 and 3 these fluctuations of trunk growth according to production seemed to be greater when irrigation was closer to a fully irrigated treatment control rdi and precision strategies however this relationship was less evident for trees under continous water deficit cdi strategy despite this interaction between irrigation and production tcai barely showed significant differences between irrigation strategies table 4 trunk growth was much more independent from irrigation than the absolute lateral branch or tree height growth table 5 only the cdi strategy had significantly lower trunk growth than the rest of the treatments providing 56 less tcai than the control strategy after the three years of the experiment however srdi showed a growth similar to cdi in terms of tree height and lateral branches growth being significantly lower than the control only the mrdi and precision strategies did not significantly differ p 0 05 in any growth measurement from the control strategy table 5 3 3 production measurements irrigation strategies had a significant effect on the ripeness process during the month prior to harvesting fig 3 the maturity index mi evolved distinctly between the most stressful irrigation treatments and the control strategy the most severe deficit irrigation strategies cdi and srdi had a quick mi increase like mrdi while the control fruit ripened much slower finally the precision strategy gave intermediate mi values it was similar to the control strategy during the two first weeks and similar to other strategies in the last two weeks fig 3 at harvest all strategies showed a significantly higher mi than the control and the precision strategies except for the first year the fact that ripening was advanced in deficit strategies should be considered to determine the optimum harvest date considering that irrigation increased fruit water content while water stress increased fat content table 6 at harvest the lowest fruit water content was found in the most stressful strategies cdi and srdi even mrdi showed significant differences p 0 05 compared to the control and the precision strategy table 6 which produced similar values in the three years studied the harvest was carried out the first week of november olive yield was significantly p 0 05 higher in the less stressed strategies which were the control precision and mrdi strategies table 6 olive yield after three years was 30 and 28 less than the control in cdi and srdi strategies respectively and only 6 5 less in the mrdi strategy assessing olive yield components the number of fruit per tree did not show significant differences p 0 05 between strategies only in the third year the number of fruit in the cdi strategy was significantly lower p 0 05 compared to the other strategies however fresh fruit weight provided significantly lower values in the srdi and cdi strategies thus fresh fruit weight was the main yield component that explained olive yield differences finally oil yield followed a similar pattern to olive yield table 6 yield efficiency ye presented differences as the experiment advanced with significant differences p 0 05 only for the second and third years between srdi and the rest of the strategies table 7 in the second year which was an off year due to alternate bearing ye decreased for all strategies however only the srdi strategy showed significant differences p 0 05 oil yield efficiency oye showed similar behavior but it did not provide significant differences p 0 05 until the last year when the precision cdi and srdi strategies stood out with a higher oye than the other irrigation strategies furthermore resource distribution provided significant differences only during the second year which was an off year the cdi treatment reached the highest level which meant that trees prioritize fruit production over tree growth and this effect is more evident in on years 4 discussion tree growth was affected by water management strategy mainly seen in tree height and lateral branch growth tables 3 and 5 and supplementary material negative growths could be measured due to apical bud withering pests or diseases or due to mechanical damage during harvesting pérez ruiz et al 2018 if the irrigation strategy was adequate shoot growth could overcome these setbacks otherwise shoot growth could be negative even for several measurements however trunk diameter and tcai showed a slower response providing significant results p 0 05 in off years or at the end of the experiment in the cdi strategy table 4 the effect of the irrigation strategies on height and lateral branch growth during the pit hardening phase was greater in cdi and srdi treatments and lower in the precision and control strategies especially in the on years see supplementary material figs s 1 and s 2 furthermore the cdi strategy showed a significant decrease for height lateral branches growth and trunk diameter compared to control from the first year supplementary material and table 3 according to results reported by moriana et al 2003 grattan et al 2006 iniesta et al 2009 and pierantozzi et al 2014 this seems to indicate that constant water deficit reduces growth which could be interesting to control vigor in super high density olive orchards martínez gimeno et al 2022 tognetti et al 2006 this objective should be achieved without compromising olive oil yield and economic profit this can be accomplished through a regulated deficit strategy that applies approximately 60 of the crop s water needs when water availability is limited as suggested by fernández et al 2020 these water saving measures align with the 31 reduction in water consumption observed in our study nevertheless oil quality is conditioned for both irrigation amount and fruit bruising during harvesting dag et al 2008 along with fruit location within the olive canopy castillo ruiz et al 2015 complementary measures to control olive vigor in super high density olive orchards could consist of the use of low vigor varieties camposeo et al 2021 or dwarfing rootstocks torres sánchez et al 2022 the srdi strategy also showed the lowest tree height growth since the second year and the lowest lateral branch growth in the third year table 3 these results are consistent with those reported by melgar et al 2008 the cdi irrigation strategy showed significantly lower tcai and trunk diameter regarding cumulative values tables 4 and 5 according to previous research which found that trunk growth was not affected by controlled deficit irrigation moriana et al 2003 because when irrigation was reestablished a high recovery capacity was recorded as described for vegetative and productive response in off years palese et al 2010 however the cdi strategy provided the lowest trunk diameter from the second year pit hardening phase onwards supplementary material fig s 3 olive yield was affected by the amount of irrigation water applied except for the precision strategy which produced the highest cumulative olive yield while achieving more than 30 of the yearly water savings compared to the control strategy the cumulative olive yield was significantly p 0 05 lower in the mrdi srdi and cdi strategies with respect to the control of 7 28 and 30 table 6 achieving water savings of 19 28 and 50 table 2 respectively similar results were obtained by ben gal et al 2021 these differences in olive yield were mainly due to fruit weight and greater water content martínez gimeno et al 2022 moriana et al 2003 while fat content lessened the differences as it was higher for less irrigated strategies than for the control mrdi and precision strategies table 6 however fat content could not compensate olive yield as a result oil yield values remained significantly higher p 0 05 for the precision and control strategies than for the srdi and cdi furthermore the distinct irrigation strategies affected oil yield less than olive yield oil yield cumulative values constituted 3 16 and 17 reductions for mrdi srdi and cdi respectively compared to the control strategy as described by martínez gimeno et al 2022 these results could be explained not only by the fact that a higher moisture content in the fruit negatively affected the industrial extractability berenguer et al 2006 but also because the oil content increased as the water stress rose especially in the treatments with greater water restrictions srdi and cdi the ye decreased from the second year onward with the applied water but only with significant differences p 0 05 for srdi table 7 so the srdi strategy gave ye values 32 and 21 lower than the control for the second and third years respectively which was similar to previous trials caruso et al 2013 martínez gimeno et al 2022 however ye did not decrease in the cdi and precision strategies as much as irrigation did showing a greater yield efficiency than srdi with significant differences in the third year regarding the oil yield efficiency oye all treatments showed behavior similar to the control during the first two years however oye was significantly higher p 0 05 for the cdi and precision strategies in the third year which is consistent with the results reported by caruso et al 2013 as mentioned above the application of deficit irrigation influenced both vegetative development and yield however it is possible to optimize oil production with considerable water savings while also regulating vegetative development martínez gimeno et al 2022 this can be particularly interesting in super high density crops where harvesting is performed using a straddle canopy shaker nevertheless deficit irrigation with high water saving rates did not show a clear reduction in ye or oye although it could delay the first full harvest as described by caruso et al 2013 finally the precision strategy which reduced irrigation only during period 2 the pit hardening phase as shown in tables 1 and 2 led to significant water savings of 31 without compromising the yields of olive and oil 5 conclusions five irrigation strategies were evaluated in terms of water saving vegetative growth and production this research demonstrated that olive tree irrigation can be optimized as it is possible to reduce irrigation by 31 while preserving vegetative development olive yield and oil yield similar to the control the precision strategy did not show significant differences in tree height lateral branches growth trunk diameter growth and olive and oil yields in all years except for year 2 where there was a significant difference in tree height compared to the control furthermore the precision strategy provided the highest olive and oil yields which were significantly greater than those obtained from srdi and cdi strategies however it is worth noting that the precision strategy exhibited lower maturity index values and higher fruit water content compared to the srdi and cdi strategies similarly the mrdi strategy could be of interest to achieve a 19 water savings compared to the control with slight decreases in vegetative parameters but without affecting olive weight at harvest or oil yield however the precision strategy provided a significantly higher oil yield than mrdi on the other hand the srdi and cdi treatments resulted in reduced vegetative development reflected in shorter tree height and decreased average lateral branch growth compared to control and lower olive and oil productions finally both yield efficiency and oil yield efficiency were significantly higher for the precision strategy in comparison with the control however the cdi strategy achieved the highest oye because it prioritized fruit production over vegetative development as indicated by the significantly greater resource distribution compared to any other strategy declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal

8878,agricultural drought seriously threatens the food and ecological security of most of the world s developing countries data driven integrated agricultural drought index with remote sensing provides an effective tool to monitor evaluate and predict the agricultural drought however there is still a lack of comprehensive analytical work on taking the most effective machine learning ml and deep learning dl methods to construct such integrated drought index in other words it is still unclear whether the recent dl methods can improve integrated drought monitoring as compared with the currently widely used ml methods therefore we critically evaluated the performances of four representative dl methods represents the four currently popular dl network types i e entity embedding deep neural network eednn one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn gated recurrent unit gru and self attention mechanism sam and three widely used tree based ml methods i e cubist random forest rf and light gradient boosting machine lgbm through constructing a quickdri like integrated drought index abbreviated as quickdri china about 30 years of meteorological data 14 years of remote sensing data and various biophysical variables in china such as land use land cover available water capacity irrigated agriculture elevation and ecoregion were employed in this study results showed that the eednn performed best followed by the rf and lgbm and then the other methods including the currently wide used cubist according to the station accuracy evaluations spatial description evaluations and responses to specific drought event the tree based ml methods such as rf and lgbm are still competitive in constructing the integrated agricultural drought index at the current stage however the higher accuracy the smoother spatial description and the more responsive ability of the eednn demonstrate great potential of dl methods the future integrated agricultural drought monitoring with remote sensing should develop a specialized dl network for heterogeneous agricultural drought features keywords agricultural drought remote sensing data driven deep learning machine learning inductive bias data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is a recurring destructive and complex extreme climate event that occurs in most parts of the world asadi zarch et al 2015 dai 2011 vicente serrano et al 2020 it is generally classified into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic wilhite and glantz 1985 among them agricultural drought refers to the phenomenon of impaired plant function due to lack of soil moisture which can lead to reduced or total failure of crops and forages jiao et al 2019 agricultural drought seriously threatens the security of food and socio economics causing direct economic losses of billions of dollars every year and with global climate change this threat is still intensifying aghakouchak et al 2015 dai 2013 gao et al 2019 naumann et al 2021 therefore real time and accurate drought monitoring is particularly important which can provide decision makers with the necessary information to take appropriate response actions to reduce drought losses rhee and im 2017 the most effective and commonly used approach for agricultural drought monitoring is to construct suitable drought indices which can be defined as variables used to describe the physical characteristics of drought such as severity spatial extent and duration hao and singh 2015 historically the traditional drought indices were based on ground stations west et al 2019 the station based drought indices are mainly calculated from the measured values of precipitation temperature and soil moisture at ground stations among them palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 etc are widely used the advantages of station based drought indices are their reliability and long term observations asadi zarch et al 2015 however agricultural drought is a regional event and the stations are distributed unevenly and discontinuously in space it cannot well describe the detailed characteristics of the regional spatial distribution of drought beck et al 2017 hao et al 2015 with the advent and development of remote sensing technology benefiting from the large scale and time sensitive advantages of satellite observation a paradigm shift occurred in drought monitoring west et al 2019 the remote sensing based drought indices are mainly developed based on the land surface temperature rainfall soil moisture vegetation coverage and other information observed by satellites the commonly used remote sensing based drought indices include vegetation condition index vci felix n f n kogan 1995 felix n felixn kogan 1995 temperature condition index tci kogan 1995 enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 vegetation drought index vdi sun et al 2013 etc the advantages of remote sensing based drought indices are that they can carry out large scale continuous coverage of drought monitoring and can effectively describe the detailed spatial heterogeneity of drought sun et al 2017 zhang and jia 2013 however due to the influence of uncertain atmospheric conditions and retrieval model errors the accuracy of remote sensing based drought indices still has some problems feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 and a single drought index cannot fully describe the complex characteristics of agricultural drought jiao et al 2019 as more and more remotely sensed data became available integrated agricultural drought monitoring indices were developed integrated agricultural drought monitoring uses a variety of remote sensing ground station and geographic background data which can more comprehensively describe the characteristics of agricultural drought and improve the accuracy of drought monitoring hao and singh 2015 jiao et al 2021 among them the integrated drought monitoring based on data driven methods is one of the most important mainstreams jiao et al 2021 brown et al 2008 integrated station based drought indices spi psdi remote sensing vegetation drought indices and other biophysical information to construct the vegetation drought response index vegdri based on the cubist method the vegdri can produce a 1 km u s drought map in near real time tadesse et al 2017 used the same approach to generate the vegdri canada for agricultural drought monitoring subsequently earth resources observation and science eros center developed the quick drought response index quickdri based on a similar technical framework which can effectively reflect short term drought conditions and capture sudden drought events in addition park et al 2016 used tree based machine learning methods such as random forest rf boosted regression trees and cubist to fuse 16 remote sensing drought factors with station based spi and the generated integrated drought maps showed strong visual consistency with the u s drought monitor usdm maps based on spi and evi roodposhti et al 2017 used support vector machine svm to generate a drought sensitivity map under the consideration for geographic background data which can effectively reflect the drought sensitivity spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation coverage feng et al 2019 screened 30 remotely sensed drought factors from modis and trmm satellite sensors and used machine learning methods to perform a data driven fusion of remotely sensed drought factors and station based spei which successfully mapped the agricultural drought in southeastern australia and the map correlated well with crop yields data driven methods play an important role in integrated drought monitoring which directly affect the accuracy of drought monitoring in previous research data driven mostly used machine learning methods the most representative of which are tree based methods such as rf cubist feng et al 2019 park et al 2016 rhee and im 2017 in recent years deep learning has developed rapidly and been widely used in various fields lecun et al 2015 deep learning has good nonlinear fitting ability and high data driven upper limit which is very suitable for describing complex drought phenomena yuan et al 2020 some studies have begun to use deep supervised learning as the data driven method for integrated drought monitoring and most of the deep learning techniques used in these studies are deep neural network dnn also known as multi layer perceptron mlp alizadeh and nikoo 2018 feng et al 2019 liu et al 2020 prodhan et al 2021 shen et al 2019 but the results of some studies are inconsistent alizadeh and nikoo 2018 compared the performance of mlp and four machine learning methods including tree based method and found that mlp performed best the results reported by feng et al 2019 showed that the tree based machine learning method performed better than mlp whether deep learning can effectively improve integrated drought monitoring is still unclear in addition many popular deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network cnn alzubaidi et al 2021 recurrent neural network rnn and transformer based on attention mechanism am vaswani et al 2017 have not been fully explored for their ability to monitor drought there is still a lack of comprehensive analytical work on taking the most effective machine learning and deep learning methods to construct the integrated drought index in other words it is still unclear whether the deep learning methods can improve integrated drought monitoring as compared with the currently widely used machine learning methods therefore based on the quickdri framework this paper systematically compares the drought monitoring performance of four currently popular deep learning techniques and three tree based methods four deep learning techniques are dnn cnn rnn am and three tree based methods are cubist the original model in quickdri framework rf which performed well in previous integrated drought monitoring research light gradient boosting machine lgbm which is an advanced ensemble learning model the overarching objective of this paper is to comprehensively explore and analyze the data driven capabilities of deep learning for integrated drought monitoring and provide a reference for the selection of data driven methods the specific research objectives of this paper are 1 according to mainstream deep supervised learning technologies such as dnn cnn rnn and am the specific deep learning network architectures are used or designed respectively the integrated drought monitoring accuracy of different deep learning networks and tree based methods is evaluated based on ground stations 2 comparing the drought spatial distribution performance of different data driven methods 3 comparing the responses to typical drought events of different data driven methods 4 generating quickdri china based on the best data driven method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is china fig 1 latitude 4 n 53 30 n and longitude 73 40 e 135 05 e china s terrain is diverse including plains mountains hills plateaus and basins in terms of climate it can be divided into the eastern monsoon region the northwest arid and semi arid region and the qinghai tibet alpine region china s complex terrain and climatic conditions result in diverse drought situations providing an ideal opportunity to explore the integrated drought monitoring capabilities of different data driven methods 2 2 quickdri china and input data 2 2 1 the overall framework of quickdri china the quickdri is an integrated drought monitoring index that uses the data driven method to integrate data from multiple sources such as ground stations remote sensing satellites and biophysical information to detect short term changes and rapid intensification of drought conditions the overall flowchart of quickdri china is shown in fig 2 first the remote sensing and biophysical variable values at ground station locations were extracted together with the station based climate variables spi spei to generate the feature variables dataset the station based spei is the dependent variable and the remaining features are the independent variables details of feature variables are shown in table 1 then the feature variables dataset was trained by data driven method to develop the quickdri model dataset generation and model development were organized by month from january to december finally the independent variable raster data were input into the developed quickdri model to draw the quickdri map in this study the data driven step evaluated and compared the integrated drought monitoring performance of four deep learning techniques dnn cnn rnn am and three tree based methods cubist rf lgbm the best performing one was chosen as the data driven method for developing the quickdri china 2 2 2 climate variables the 1 month time scale spi and spei were calculated based on monthly cumulative precipitation and monthly mean temperature at ground stations over

center isric world soil information https data isric org this dataset has a spatial resolution of 250 m and contains the available soil water capacity until wilting point at 7 standard depths since the depth of vegetation roots is generally around 1 1 5 m the data at a depth of 200 cm was used in the study 2 2 4 3 irrigated agriculture irrag the irrag brown et al 2008 represents the proportion of irrigated farmland area to total farmland area in an administrative unit the irrag value is assigned to the pixels whose land cover is farmland in the administrative region and the non farmland area is set to a constant background value of 0 which means that there is no irrigation in the study chinese prefecture level cities were taken as administrative units the statistical data of farmland

with 500 m spatial resolution for each year from 2001 to 2014 were generated 2 2 4 4 elevation the elevation data comes from the srtm digital elevation data version 4 dataset reuter et al 2007 provided by consultative group for international agricultural research consortium for spatial information cgiar csi https srtm csi cgiar org this dataset provides global elevation information with a spatial resolution of 90 m 2 2 4 5 ecoregion the ecoregion data comes from the resolve ecoregions dataset dinerstein et al 2017 provided by resolve biodiversity and wildlife solutions https ecoregions appspot com this dataset includes descriptions of 846 terrestrial ecoregions around the world 2 3 training and evaluation of data driven step training and accuracy evaluation of the quickdri models based on different deep learning networks and tree based methods are shown in fig 3 this process was trained once every month based on the dataset of that month a total of 12 times from january to december the specific process is as follows 1 the data from 2001 to 2012 in dataset of a certain month was used as the training set and validation set for hyperparameter tuning 2 hyperparameter tuning for all data driven methods using 5 fold cross validation and bayesian optimization the optimal hyperparameters of different deep learning networks and tree based methods were obtained 3 the optimal hyperparameters were used to develop the quickdri models of different data driven methods 4 the data of 2013 and 2014 was used as the test set for unbiased estimation of quickdri models based on different data driven methods 2 3 1 deep learning network architectures the essence of data driven integrated drought monitoring is a supervised learning process dnn cnn rnn and am are currently the four most widely used deep supervised learning techniques in the study specific network architecture was used or designed respectively and all were implemented by pytorch https pytorch org 2 3 1 1 entity embedding deep neural network eednn in this study eednn guo and berkhahn 2016 is the specific architecture implementation of dnn as shown in fig 4 this network uses the classic two fully connected layer architecture of dnn which can effectively fit functions of any complexity in theory goodfellow et al 2016 and the embedding layer using in the network can effectively deal with the categorical variables lulc eco in this study 2 3 1 2 one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn the cnn was originally used to analyze two dimensional images 2d cnn krizhevsky et al 2012 and later developed architectures for analyzing time series 1d cnn and analyzing spatiotemporal information 3d cnn since the integrated drought monitoring variables used in the study do not have spatial structure in order to evaluate the ability of cnn the time series data was used for supervised learning in the study the independent variable time series with a 3 month scale current month and the previous two months was used as input to regression with the dependent variable of the current month the 1d cnn architecture shown in fig 5 was designed to analyze time series the most important of which is the size of the convolution kernel in order to take advantage of cnn s multi scale analysis referring to the textcnn architecture kim 2014 1d cnn uses convolution kernels of three sizes 1 month 2 month and 3 month to convolve the time series meanwhile considering that closer time nodes have a stronger impact on drought monitoring 1 month size only convolutes the last month of the time series 2 month convolutes the last two months and 3 month convolutes all three months 2 3 1 3 gated recurrent unit gru the rnn technology in this study refers to the generalized recurrent neural network common rnn architectures include elman rnn gru lstm long short term memory etc in this study gru cho et al 2014 was used as the specific network architecture of rnn as shown in fig 6 compared with elman rnn and lstm gru is an advanced network architecture which can take into account lower time cost and good operation effect chung et al 2014 because the input data of gru is generally sequence data the independent variable time series with a 3 month scale was used as input like 1d cnn 2 3 1 4 self attention mechanism sam the network using the attention mechanism niu et al 2021 is an emerging network type in recent years the most representative one is transformer based on self attention mechanism vaswani et al 2017 the self attention mechanism can obtain the correlation between variables thereby highlighting important variables the network architecture of sam in the study is shown in fig 7 in order to enable categorical variables to perform self attention analysis effectively the embedding technology is used for dense encoding the output dimension of encoding is 1 which is to prevent the multi dimensional output classification variables from causing ambiguity in the meaning of the correlation coefficient with other variables 2 3 2 tree based machine learning methods in the study three typical tree based methods were also used for integrated drought monitoring data driven cubist the original model in the quickdri framework rf which performed well in previous integrated drought monitoring research lgbm which is an advanced ensemble learning model the three tree based methods are representative cubist is a traditional decision tree model which represents a non ensemble learning method rf and lgbm represent the two mainstream ensemble learning methods bagging and boosting respectively 2 3 2 1 cubist cubist is a rule based decision tree model quinlan 1993 1992 it can build rule based linear models between multiple variables and target values and these linear models are included in the leaf nodes of the tree cubist has the advantage that the volume of the model is small with good accuracy and the rule based model is more interpretable in the study the cubist package of r https cran r project org web packages cubist developed by rulequest research https www rulequest com was used for implementation 2 3 2 2 random forest rf rf is an ensemble learning model that includes many decision trees breiman 2001 ho 1995 the ensemble learning strategy of the rf is bagging which trains the decision trees by randomly extracting training samples with retractions and randomly selecting feature subsets and then using the average value returned by many decision trees as the predicted value of the rf the introduction of two randomness makes the generalization ability of rf stronger and insensitive to missing values and outliers in the study the scikit learn package of python https scikit learn org pedregosa et al 2011 was used to implement the rf 2 3 2 3 light gradient boosting machine lgbm lgbm ke et al 2017 is an ensemble learning model based on boosting strategy lgbm is an efficient implementation of gradient boosting decision tree gbdt friedman 2001 it builds new decision trees multiple times to fit the residual of the existing decision tree so as to improve the prediction accuracy of the model and uses the negative gradient of the loss function of the existing decision tree as the residual approximation compared with the same type of xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 lgbm can achieve higher training efficiency and lower memory usage while maintaining high prediction accuracy and also supports direct input of categorical variables in the study the lightgbm package of python https lightgbm readthedocs io provided by microsoft was used for implementation 2 3 3 dataset generation 2 3 3 1 datasets of each month two types of datasets were established in the study tabular dataset and time series dataset the time series dataset was to meet the time series input requirements of 1d cnn and gru both types of datasets were divided by month each generating 12 month datasets and all generated datasets cover the time length from 2001 to 2014 finally 12 tabular datasets and 12 time series datasets were generated the specific steps to generate the datasets are as follows 1 generate the tabular datasets of each month every weather station is a sample extract the average values of the remote sensing and biophysical raster data within 5 km 5 km at the location of the weather station as the independent variable values of the station sample the station based spei is the dependent variable of the sample the reason for choosing a 5 km 5 km window is to compromise the spatial resolution of each independent variable raster 2 based on the tabular datasets generate the time series datasets of each month for a time series sample the tabular independent variables of the current month and the previous two months of a station were used to generate the 3 month scale time series independent variables and the spei of the current month of the station was used as the dependent variable 3 since the independent variable data at some stations may have invalid null values in some months it is necessary to remove the station samples with null values in the tabular datasets and time series datasets of each month after removing invalid samples in order to ensure the comparability of tabular datasets and time series datasets it is necessary to ensure that the tabular datasets and time series datasets of each month cover the same stations finally only samples of stations that are common to both were kept in the datasets 2 3 3 2 data normalization and categorical variable encoding in order to eliminate the influence of abnormal samples and speed up the convergence of deep learning networks it is necessary to normalize the continuous feature variables in the datasets commonly used normalization methods include z score normalization and min max normalization in the study spei spi svi esi and sma are z score normalized data so the remaining awc sosa ele and irrag need to be normalized because awc and sosa conform to the normal distribution z score was used for normalization ele and irrag do not conform to the normal distribution so the min max normalization was used at the same time most deep learning networks and tree based methods cannot directly deal with categorical variables one hot encoding qu et al 2019 was used for the two categorical variables of lulc and eco 2 3 4 hyperparameter tuning hyperparameters are an important factor affecting the performance of deep learning networks so scientific hyperparameter tuning is necessary in the study there are training hyperparameters and architectural hyperparameters the training hyperparameters mainly control the training process of the networks and the architecture hyperparameters are used to control the architectural details of the networks training hyperparameters include learning rate number of epochs regularization and batch size the learning rate and the number of epochs were dynamically determined by the learning rate scheduler and early stopping the learning rate scheduler will continuously reduce the learning rate according to the loss of the validation set during training so as to prevent the problem of non convergence caused by too large initial learning rate or slow convergence caused by too small initial learning rate the early stopping is to determine that the network has converged when the validation set loss does not decrease for n consecutive times n 150 in the study and to stop the training early to prevent the network from overfitting the l2 regularization was used and the batch size was set to 32 masters and luschi 2018 the architectural hyperparameters are different for each network and method detailed in table 2 in the study 5 fold cross validation and bayesian optimization bergstra et al 2011 were used for hyperparameter tuning data from 2001 to 2012 in the datasets of each month was used for the 5 fold cross validation in order to ensure the effectiveness of cross validation the data distribution of the validation set needs to be similar to that of the test set so the data of two adjacent years was used as the validation set in the 5 times of cross validation select 2007 2008 2008 2009 2009 2010 2010 2011 2011 2012 as the validation set in turn and the remaining years data was used as the training set in each time the results of cross validation were used for bayesian optimization and the best combination of hyperparameters was finally returned bayesian optimization is a hyperparameter tuning method based on prior which uses the performance of the hyperparameters that have been searched to infer the next hyperparameter tuning direction thereby reducing the search space and greatly improving the search efficiency in the study the hyperopt package of python http hyperopt github io hyperopt bergstra et al 2013 was used to implement bayesian optimization 2 3 5 evaluation method 2 3 5 1 accuracy evaluation in order to evaluate the integrated drought monitoring accuracy of different deep learning networks and tree based methods the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were used for quantitative evaluation the evaluation metrics are as follows 1 r 2 1 i s i q i 2 i s i s 2 2 rmse i 1 n s i q i 2 n in the formula n is the number of samples s i and q i are the real value of station based spei and the predicted value of quickdri of sample i respectively 2 3 5 2 spatial distribution evaluation in the study according to the accuracy evaluation results the data driven methods with better performance were selected for the spatial mapping of quickdri china this is to further evaluate the spatial distribution macroscale and microscale performance and drought response ability of the quickdri china generated by different data driven methods at the same time the 0 5 gridded 1 month scale spei of the global spei database https spei csic es beguería et al 2022 was used as the reference data of the spatial distribution 3 result 3 1 accuracy evaluation table 3 shows the r2 and rmse of the quick models january to december of different data driven methods and fig 8 shows the corresponding boxplots for each month the method with the best performance on the evaluation metrics and the methods within 0 005 of the best metrics were considered as the preferred methods for the month it can be seen from table 3 that 1 both eednn and rf are the preferred method in 8 months the eednn performed best in the 5 months of february march may august and november the rf performed best in the three months of june july and september lgbm 1d cnn and gru are the preferred method in 6 4 and 2 months respectively sam and cubist are the preferred method in only 1 month 2 the months where rf is the preferred method show a tendency for rf to perform better for those months where the average goodness of fit is higher june july and september with the best performance of the rf are also the three months with the highest average goodness of fit and the average r2 are all greater than 0 95 the eednn does not show such a tendency and performs well in months with high medium and low average goodness of fit it shows that eednn is more adaptable to different month conditions fig 8 shows the overall performance of the accuracy evaluation of the models of each month the eednn performs best on median outliers and volatility the lgbm has the next best median but the outliers performed poorly the median performance of rf is similar to that of 1d cnn and gru but the outliers of rf are better the medians of sam and cubist both perform poorly and cubist outliers also show poor performance based on the evaluation results of each month s quickdri model the performance of each data driven method is ranked as follows eednn rf lgbm 1d cnn gru sam cubist the eednn performed the best overall followed by the rf they were the preferred methods in most months and their boxplots performed well the lgbm was the preferred method in half of the months and the median performance was good but the performance in march was poor the performance of 1d cnn and gru was medium and 1d cnn was better than gru the sam and cubist performed poorly fig 9 is a scatterplot of the quickdri predicted values and the station based spei it contains the predictions of all month s quickdri models based on different data driven methods and the overall r2 and rmse are calculated the overall accuracy evaluation metrics r2 rmse from high to low is eednn 0 914 0 299 rf 0 912 0 302 lgbm 0 908 0 308 1d cnn 0 907 0 310 sam 0 905 0 313 gru 0 904 0 314 cubist 0 902 0 318 the eednn has the best performance followed by the rf they are in the tier 1 highest accuracy the lgbm and 1d cnn are in the tier 2 the gru and sam are in the tier 3 compared with other methods the cubist has more discrete outliers and relatively poor accuracy it is in the tier lowest finally considering the monthly and overall performance of each method the accuracy evaluation ranking from high to low is eednn rf lgbm 1d cnn sam gru cubist among them the eednn and rf show obvious advantages over other methods and they also represent deep learning method and tree based method respectively 3 2 spatial patterns of quickdri china according to the above accuracy evaluation the eednn and rf perform better representing the best method for deep learning and tree based method respectively in order to further compare the integrated drought monitoring capabilities of these two methods the spatial patterns of the quickdri china generated by eednn and rf were compared in the study as shown in figs 10 and 11 the quickdri china generated by eednn and rf are indistinguishable in macroscopic spatial pattern and they are all similar to the macroscopic spatial pattern of the 1 month scale spei of the global spei database this shows that the quickdri china generated by both can accurately characterize the macroscopic spatial pattern of drought fig 12 is a comparison of the micro scale spatial distribution of the quickdri china the location is around weishan lake the largest freshwater lake in northern china it can be found that the quickdri based on eednn have richer spatial details than that based on rf especially in october in addition the quickdri based on rf showed obvious boundary effect when describing regions with different drought degrees as shown in august and september the spatial distribution of the quickdri based on eednn is smoother and there is no obvious boundary between regions of different drought degrees 3 3 responses to typical drought events from early july to mid august 2013 a once in a century drought occurred in southern china involving 9 provinces and 2 provincial municipalities yuan et al 2016 during the same period floods occurred in parts of northwest china north china and northeast china a rare spatial pattern of drought in the south and flood in the north appeared in china fig 13 is the quickdri china in july 2013 developed by eednn and rf respectively it can be found that both of them have captured the severe drought in southern china well and the monitored drought range is consistent with the relevant historical data china meteorological administration 2015 they also show the characteristics of drought in the south and flood in the north in the spatial pattern the above shows that the quickdri china developed by eednn and rf can effectively respond to macroscopic and large scale drought events and can accurately characterize their spatial patterns in order to further compare the ability of the quickdri china generated by eednn and rf to capture drought events in local areas in the study the drought monitoring in hunan province was further analyzed as the most severe drought area hunan had the largest area of crop damage and crop failure as shown in fig 14 it can be found that compared with the quickdri developed by rf fig 14 b the quickdri based on eednn fig 14 a has detected more severe drought events in central hunan the region where these detected extreme drought events occurred coincided highly with the region where the 2013 grain yield reduction was most severe fig 14 c this shows that the quickdri based on eednn can more effectively capture extreme drought events at local scales 4 discussion 4 1 heterogeneous drought features and inductive biases of the data driven methods in the study according to the architectural characteristics of 1d cnn and gru the time series variables were used for training although the information was increased the accuracy was not as good as eednn when we analyze the reasons from the inductive biases of each method we can find that many cnn and rnn network architectures including 1d cnn and gru are designed for homogeneous data such as audio text and images from the beginning that is the nature of each feature input into the network is the same borisov et al 2022 katzir et al 2021 for example in text sequence data each sequence node is a word text and the coding features corresponding to each word text are homogeneous another example is image data when the pixels at adjacent spatial positions of the image are sent as features to the convolution kernel for calculation cnn convolution operation the fundamental nature of different pixel features is the same however for most of today s integrated drought indices including the quickdri the features often include a variety of numerical continuous or discrete variables and categorical variables with different nature which is a kind of heterogeneous tabular data when the data driven methods gru and 1d cnn with homogeneous inductive bias are used to train heterogeneous drought data there will inevitably be deviations from the expected results borisov et al 2022 the same is true for the sam the transformer based on the self attention mechanism is carefully designed to train sequence data when performing self attention analysis it is considered that there is homogeneity between different features when analyzing heterogeneous integrated drought features especially when the features contain categorical variables the effectiveness of the self attention mechanism will be greatly reduced for the dnn as a classic fully connected layer network it does not have such a strong homogeneous inductive bias like rnn and cnn at the beginning of its design and it is often used for nonlinear multiple regression of tabular data at the same time the eednn used in this paper itself improves the ability of the network to simultaneously process continuous and categorical variables on the basis of dnn guo and berkhahn 2016 the embedding technology used in eednn has been proven to effectively improve the ability of the network to process heterogeneous data cheng et al 2016 this shows that the inductive bias of eednn matches heterogeneous data and is more adaptable to heterogeneous features in integrated drought monitoring in addition studies have shown that proper regularization can make the multi layer perceptron also known as dnn more effective in dealing with heterogeneous tabular data kadra et al 2021 in this study the optimal l2 regularization was determined through the learning rate scheduler and early stopping which may further improve the ability of eednn to deal with heterogeneous data finally for the tree based ensemble learning methods such as rf and lgbm they are originally designed to solve tabular data and naturally have a good ability to deal with heterogeneous tabular data grinsztajn et al 2022 this is why the accuracy evaluation of rf and lgbm in this study is still excellent however tree based methods have limitations in the spatial description of drought which will be discussed in the next subsection 4 2 deep learning has unique advantages in describing the spatial distribution of drought from the results in section 3 2 we can see that the quickdri developed by rf shows obvious boundary effect in the detailed spatial description while the spatial description of the quickdri developed by eednn is relatively smooth drought is a continuous spatial event and spatial description must be considered in integrated drought monitoring many studies have shown that neural networks are biased towards low frequency smooth target functions while tree based methods which learn piece wise constant functions favor irregular non smooth patterns grinsztajn et al 2022 rahaman et al 2019 a simulation experiment was also carried out in the study to verify this conclusion four methods were selected including eednn and 1d cnn with the highest accuracy of deep learning and rf and lgbm with the highest accuracy of tree based method the two spatial continuous independent variables of esi and sma were simulated in the range of 2 5 2 5 according to the step size of 0 01 other continuous variables took the median classification variables took the mode and kept constant during the simulation the quickdri models of july with the highest average r2 and march with the lowest average r2 were used for the experiment the results of the simulation experiment are shown in fig 15 it can be found that the predicted values of quickdri based on the tree based methods show obvious boundaries and strips while the predicted values based on the deep learning methods are smooth without obvious boundaries the non smooth bias of the tree based method has little effect on general tabular data that does not have spatial properties and even shows advantages on some tabular data that obeys irregular patterns grinsztajn et al 2022 but this non smooth bias is fatal for tabular data that has spatial properties and requires continuous spatial distribution mapping according to the tobler s first law of geography for continuous spatial variables closer locations mean closer values tobler 1970 the smooth bias of the target function of deep learning makes the transition between the predicted values of the approximate independent variables smooth and thus smooth in space however the non smooth bias of the tree based method may lead to a clear boundary between the predicted values of the approximate independent variables which also leads to the boundary effect in the spatial description this boundary effect is obviously inconsistent with the spatial continuity characteristics of drought events while the smooth spatial description of deep learning is closer to the real situation therefore we believe that for the events with spatial continuity characteristics including drought the smooth inductive bias of deep learning has a natural advantage in spatial description 4 3 conception of specialized deep learning network for integrated drought monitoring deep learning has a unique advantage in spatial description of drought because of its smooth bias of target function at the same time in terms of accuracy evaluation eednn achieves higher accuracy results due to its weak homogeneous inductive bias combined with embedding coding technology and appropriate regularization however considering the elaborate and complex design of eednn and the high time cost of hyperparameter tuning it still does not show absolute advantages in accuracy evaluation compared with tree based ensemble methods due to its better adaptability to heterogeneous data and lower cost of hyperparameter tuning the tree based ensemble methods still show strong competitiveness without considering the spatial description of drought we believe that at the present stage deep learning has improved the ability of integrated drought monitoring which is more inclined to the unique advantages of deep learning in spatial description as well as its potential to achieve higher prediction accuracy than the traditional tree based ensemble methods through appropriate architecture design and hyperparameter tuning this potential of deep learning still has great room for improvement and there is still a lack of mature deep learning technology that specializes in processing heterogeneous tabular data in the future coupling the respective advantages of deep learning and tree based methods may become a feasible improvement method the tree based models are not differentiable and cannot be directly trained jointly with deep learning modules therefore this coupling is more inclined to combine the inductive bias of the tree based method that match heterogeneous data and develop a specialized deep learning network for heterogeneous tabular data the advantages of this specialized network are 1 it has a good ability to handle heterogeneous data 2 it maintains the advantages of deep learning in spatial description 3 it can be combined with other deep learning networks for joint training with the increase of drought related data acquisition means and the increase of data volume drought feature extraction only through expert knowledge will not be able to fully obtain all the drought information in large data volumes the deep learning technologies such as cnn and rnn with homogeneous inductive bias are suitable for extracting drought features from homogeneous data such as remote sensing images and meteorological time series the heterogeneous drought features extracted by deep learning and expert knowledge are fed into the specialized deep learning network for joint training this will further improve the accuracy spatial mapping and intelligence of integrated drought monitoring 5 conclusions in this study four representative deep learning methods i e eednn 1d cnn gru and sam and three widely used tree based machine learning methods i e cubist rf and lgbm were critically evaluated in constructing the integrated agricultural drought index quickdri china the main insights and conclusions of this paper are as follows 1 in terms of station accuracy evaluation not all deep learning methods presented better performances than the tree based machine learning methods their overall accuracy evaluation metrics r2 rmse from high to low are eednn 0 914 0 299 rf 0 912 0 302 lgbm 0 908 0 308 1d cnn 0 907 0 310 sam 0 905 0 313 gru 0 904 0 314 cubist 0 902 0 318 the reason may lie in the adaptability to heterogeneous input features since the features that employed in constructing the integrated agricultural drought index are heterogeneous the method who has the adaptability to heterogeneous features tend to perform better the eednn effectively deals with heterogeneous drought features thanks to the weak homogeneous inductive bias of dnn advanced embedding coding technology and appropriate regularization means the rf and lgbm have their natural advantage in dealing with heterogeneous data and the 1d cnn gru and sam have homogeneous inductive bias resultantly the eednn performed best followed by the rf and lgbm and then the other methods 2 in terms of spatial description evaluation both the eednn method representative of deep learning and the rf method representative of machine learning can accurately describe the macroscopic spatial pattern of drought however the eednn derived quickdri china has richer spatial details than the rf derived quickdri china at the micro scale moreover the former has a smoother spatial description than the latter which implies that the eednn derived result is more in line with the actual spatial continuity of agricultural drought while the rf derived result is prone to obvious boundaries in the spatial description this smoother spatial description benefits from the fact that neural networks are biased toward low frequency functions while tree based methods favor irregular non smooth patterns 3 in terms of responses to drought events both the eednn derived quickdri china and the rf derived quickdri china can effectively reflect the macroscopic and large scale drought events but the eednn performed better at local scale and it can capture some extreme drought events that the rf cannot detect to sum up the tree based ensemble machine learning methods such as rf and lgbm are still competitive in constructing the integrated drought index as compared with the deep learning methods at the current stage however the higher accuracy the smoother spatial description and the more responsive ability of the eednn demonstrate great potential of deep learning methods for integrated agricultural drought monitoring we believe that developing a specialized deep learning network for heterogeneous agricultural drought features can further improve the performances of integrated agricultural drought monitoring this should be one of the focuses in the next study of remote sensing of agricultural

8878,agricultural drought seriously threatens the food and ecological security of most of the world s developing countries data driven integrated agricultural drought index with remote sensing provides an effective tool to monitor evaluate and predict the agricultural drought however there is still a lack of comprehensive analytical work on taking the most effective machine learning ml and deep learning dl methods to construct such integrated drought index in other words it is still unclear whether the recent dl methods can improve integrated drought monitoring as compared with the currently widely used ml methods therefore we critically evaluated the performances of four representative dl methods represents the four currently popular dl network types i e entity embedding deep neural network eednn one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn gated recurrent unit gru and self attention mechanism sam and three widely used tree based ml methods i e cubist random forest rf and light gradient boosting machine lgbm through constructing a quickdri like integrated drought index abbreviated as quickdri china about 30 years of meteorological data 14 years of remote sensing data and various biophysical variables in china such as land use land cover available water capacity irrigated agriculture elevation and ecoregion were employed in this study results showed that the eednn performed best followed by the rf and lgbm and then the other methods including the currently wide used cubist according to the station accuracy evaluations spatial description evaluations and responses to specific drought event the tree based ml methods such as rf and lgbm are still competitive in constructing the integrated agricultural drought index at the current stage however the higher accuracy the smoother spatial description and the more responsive ability of the eednn demonstrate great potential of dl methods the future integrated agricultural drought monitoring with remote sensing should develop a specialized dl network for heterogeneous agricultural drought features keywords agricultural drought remote sensing data driven deep learning machine learning inductive bias data availability data will be made available on request 1 introduction drought is a recurring destructive and complex extreme climate event that occurs in most parts of the world asadi zarch et al 2015 dai 2011 vicente serrano et al 2020 it is generally classified into four types meteorological agricultural hydrological and socioeconomic wilhite and glantz 1985 among them agricultural drought refers to the phenomenon of impaired plant function due to lack of soil moisture which can lead to reduced or total failure of crops and forages jiao et al 2019 agricultural drought seriously threatens the security of food and socio economics causing direct economic losses of billions of dollars every year and with global climate change this threat is still intensifying aghakouchak et al 2015 dai 2013 gao et al 2019 naumann et al 2021 therefore real time and accurate drought monitoring is particularly important which can provide decision makers with the necessary information to take appropriate response actions to reduce drought losses rhee and im 2017 the most effective and commonly used approach for agricultural drought monitoring is to construct suitable drought indices which can be defined as variables used to describe the physical characteristics of drought such as severity spatial extent and duration hao and singh 2015 historically the traditional drought indices were based on ground stations west et al 2019 the station based drought indices are mainly calculated from the measured values of precipitation temperature and soil moisture at ground stations among them palmer drought severity index pdsi palmer 1965 standardized precipitation index spi mckee et al 1993 standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index spei vicente serrano et al 2010 etc are widely used the advantages of station based drought indices are their reliability and long term observations asadi zarch et al 2015 however agricultural drought is a regional event and the stations are distributed unevenly and discontinuously in space it cannot well describe the detailed characteristics of the regional spatial distribution of drought beck et al 2017 hao et al 2015 with the advent and development of remote sensing technology benefiting from the large scale and time sensitive advantages of satellite observation a paradigm shift occurred in drought monitoring west et al 2019 the remote sensing based drought indices are mainly developed based on the land surface temperature rainfall soil moisture vegetation coverage and other information observed by satellites the commonly used remote sensing based drought indices include vegetation condition index vci felix n f n kogan 1995 felix n felixn kogan 1995 temperature condition index tci kogan 1995 enhanced vegetation index evi huete et al 2002 vegetation drought index vdi sun et al 2013 etc the advantages of remote sensing based drought indices are that they can carry out large scale continuous coverage of drought monitoring and can effectively describe the detailed spatial heterogeneity of drought sun et al 2017 zhang and jia 2013 however due to the influence of uncertain atmospheric conditions and retrieval model errors the accuracy of remote sensing based drought indices still has some problems feng et al 2019 zhang et al 2019 and a single drought index cannot fully describe the complex characteristics of agricultural drought jiao et al 2019 as more and more remotely sensed data became available integrated agricultural drought monitoring indices were developed integrated agricultural drought monitoring uses a variety of remote sensing ground station and geographic background data which can more comprehensively describe the characteristics of agricultural drought and improve the accuracy of drought monitoring hao and singh 2015 jiao et al 2021 among them the integrated drought monitoring based on data driven methods is one of the most important mainstreams jiao et al 2021 brown et al 2008 integrated station based drought indices spi psdi remote sensing vegetation drought indices and other biophysical information to construct the vegetation drought response index vegdri based on the cubist method the vegdri can produce a 1 km u s drought map in near real time tadesse et al 2017 used the same approach to generate the vegdri canada for agricultural drought monitoring subsequently earth resources observation and science eros center developed the quick drought response index quickdri based on a similar technical framework which can effectively reflect short term drought conditions and capture sudden drought events in addition park et al 2016 used tree based machine learning methods such as random forest rf boosted regression trees and cubist to fuse 16 remote sensing drought factors with station based spi and the generated integrated drought maps showed strong visual consistency with the u s drought monitor usdm maps based on spi and evi roodposhti et al 2017 used support vector machine svm to generate a drought sensitivity map under the consideration for geographic background data which can effectively reflect the drought sensitivity spatiotemporal pattern of vegetation coverage feng et al 2019 screened 30 remotely sensed drought factors from modis and trmm satellite sensors and used machine learning methods to perform a data driven fusion of remotely sensed drought factors and station based spei which successfully mapped the agricultural drought in southeastern australia and the map correlated well with crop yields data driven methods play an important role in integrated drought monitoring which directly affect the accuracy of drought monitoring in previous research data driven mostly used machine learning methods the most representative of which are tree based methods such as rf cubist feng et al 2019 park et al 2016 rhee and im 2017 in recent years deep learning has developed rapidly and been widely used in various fields lecun et al 2015 deep learning has good nonlinear fitting ability and high data driven upper limit which is very suitable for describing complex drought phenomena yuan et al 2020 some studies have begun to use deep supervised learning as the data driven method for integrated drought monitoring and most of the deep learning techniques used in these studies are deep neural network dnn also known as multi layer perceptron mlp alizadeh and nikoo 2018 feng et al 2019 liu et al 2020 prodhan et al 2021 shen et al 2019 but the results of some studies are inconsistent alizadeh and nikoo 2018 compared the performance of mlp and four machine learning methods including tree based method and found that mlp performed best the results reported by feng et al 2019 showed that the tree based machine learning method performed better than mlp whether deep learning can effectively improve integrated drought monitoring is still unclear in addition many popular deep learning techniques such as convolutional neural network cnn alzubaidi et al 2021 recurrent neural network rnn and transformer based on attention mechanism am vaswani et al 2017 have not been fully explored for their ability to monitor drought there is still a lack of comprehensive analytical work on taking the most effective machine learning and deep learning methods to construct the integrated drought index in other words it is still unclear whether the deep learning methods can improve integrated drought monitoring as compared with the currently widely used machine learning methods therefore based on the quickdri framework this paper systematically compares the drought monitoring performance of four currently popular deep learning techniques and three tree based methods four deep learning techniques are dnn cnn rnn am and three tree based methods are cubist the original model in quickdri framework rf which performed well in previous integrated drought monitoring research light gradient boosting machine lgbm which is an advanced ensemble learning model the overarching objective of this paper is to comprehensively explore and analyze the data driven capabilities of deep learning for integrated drought monitoring and provide a reference for the selection of data driven methods the specific research objectives of this paper are 1 according to mainstream deep supervised learning technologies such as dnn cnn rnn and am the specific deep learning network architectures are used or designed respectively the integrated drought monitoring accuracy of different deep learning networks and tree based methods is evaluated based on ground stations 2 comparing the drought spatial distribution performance of different data driven methods 3 comparing the responses to typical drought events of different data driven methods 4 generating quickdri china based on the best data driven method 2 materials and methods 2 1 study area the study area is china fig 1 latitude 4 n 53 30 n and longitude 73 40 e 135 05 e china s terrain is diverse including plains mountains hills plateaus and basins in terms of climate it can be divided into the eastern monsoon region the northwest arid and semi arid region and the qinghai tibet alpine region china s complex terrain and climatic conditions result in diverse drought situations providing an ideal opportunity to explore the integrated drought monitoring capabilities of different data driven methods 2 2 quickdri china and input data 2 2 1 the overall framework of quickdri china the quickdri is an integrated drought monitoring index that uses the data driven method to integrate data from multiple sources such as ground stations remote sensing satellites and biophysical information to detect short term changes and rapid intensification of drought conditions the overall flowchart of quickdri china is shown in fig 2 first the remote sensing and biophysical variable values at ground station locations were extracted together with the station based climate variables spi spei to generate the feature variables dataset the station based spei is the dependent variable and the remaining features are the independent variables details of feature variables are shown in table 1 then the feature variables dataset was trained by data driven method to develop the quickdri model dataset generation and model development were organized by month from january to december finally the independent variable raster data were input into the developed quickdri model to draw the quickdri map in this study the data driven step evaluated and compared the integrated drought monitoring performance of four deep learning techniques dnn cnn rnn am and three tree based methods cubist rf lgbm the best performing one was chosen as the data driven method for developing the quickdri china 2 2 2 climate variables the 1 month time scale spi and spei were calculated based on monthly cumulative precipitation and monthly mean temperature at ground stations over a 30 year period from 1985 to 2014 the weather station dataset daily meteorological dataset of basic meteorological elements of china national surface weather station used in the study comes from the china meteorological data service center cmdc https data cma cn and the national tibetan plateau data center tpdc http data tpdc ac cn this dataset contains daily measurements of basic meteorological elements at 2474 stations in china from 1951 to 2014 first the monthly average temperature and monthly cumulative precipitation of each month from 1985 to 2014 were calculated months with valid temperature measurements greater than 20 days in a single month and without any missing day of precipitation in a single month were considered valid months and all stations with invalid months were removed then the spi and spei were calculated using the r package spei https spei csic es developed by santiago beguería and sergio m vicente serrano finally 1 month spi and spei of 1724 stations from 1985 to 2014 were obtained and the location distribution is shown in fig 1 2 2 3 remote sensing variables 2 2 3 1 standardized vegetation index svi the svi peters et al 2002 is a standardization of ndvi deviations from a historical normal which can effectively reflect the vegetation status in areas with varying drought conditions the formula for calculating svi is svi v v μ v σ in the formula v is the ndvi value of a certain time period in a year v μ and v σ respectively represent the mean and standard deviation of v in the benchmark long term historical year in the study the 1 month svi

appspot com this dataset includes descriptions of 846 terrestrial ecoregions around the world 2 3 training and evaluation of data driven step training and accuracy evaluation of the quickdri models based on different deep learning networks and tree based methods are shown in fig 3 this process was trained once every month based on the dataset of that month a total of 12 times from january to december the specific process is as follows 1 the data from 2001 to 2012 in dataset of a certain month was used as the training set and validation set for hyperparameter tuning 2 hyperparameter tuning for all data driven methods using 5 fold cross validation and bayesian optimization the optimal hyperparameters of different deep learning networks and tree based methods were obtained 3 the optimal hyperparameters were used to develop the quickdri models of different data driven methods 4 the data of 2013 and 2014 was used as the test set for unbiased estimation of quickdri models based on different data driven methods 2 3 1 deep learning network architectures the essence of data driven integrated drought monitoring is a supervised learning process dnn cnn rnn and am are currently the four most widely used deep supervised learning techniques in the study specific network architecture was used or designed respectively and all were implemented by pytorch https pytorch org 2 3 1 1 entity embedding deep neural network eednn in this study eednn guo and berkhahn 2016 is the specific architecture implementation of dnn as shown in fig 4 this network uses the classic two fully connected layer architecture of dnn which can effectively fit functions of any complexity in theory goodfellow et al 2016 and the embedding layer using in the network can effectively deal with the categorical variables lulc eco in this study 2 3 1 2 one dimensional convolutional neural network 1d cnn the cnn was originally used to analyze two dimensional images 2d cnn krizhevsky et al 2012 and later developed architectures for analyzing time series 1d cnn and analyzing spatiotemporal information 3d cnn since the integrated drought monitoring variables used in the study do not have spatial structure in order to evaluate the ability of cnn the time series data was used for supervised learning in the study the independent variable time series with a 3 month scale current month and the previous two months was used as input to regression with the dependent variable of the current month the 1d cnn architecture shown in fig 5 was designed to analyze time series the most important of which is the size of the convolution kernel in order to take advantage of cnn s multi scale analysis referring to the textcnn architecture kim 2014 1d cnn uses convolution kernels of three sizes 1 month 2 month and 3 month to convolve the time series meanwhile considering that closer time nodes have a stronger impact on drought monitoring 1 month size only convolutes the last month of the time series 2 month convolutes the last two months and 3 month convolutes all three months 2 3 1 3 gated recurrent unit gru the rnn technology in this study refers to the generalized recurrent neural network common rnn architectures include elman rnn gru lstm long short term memory etc in this study gru cho et al 2014 was used as the specific network architecture of rnn as shown in fig 6 compared with elman rnn and lstm gru is an advanced network architecture which can take into account lower time cost and good operation effect chung et al 2014 because the input data of gru is generally sequence data the independent variable time series with a 3 month scale was used as input like 1d cnn 2 3 1 4 self attention mechanism sam the network using the attention mechanism niu et al 2021 is an emerging network type in recent years the most representative one is transformer based on self attention mechanism vaswani et al 2017 the self attention mechanism can obtain the correlation between variables thereby highlighting important variables the network architecture of sam in the study is shown in fig 7 in order to enable categorical variables to perform self attention analysis effectively the embedding technology is used for dense encoding the output dimension of encoding is 1 which is to prevent the multi dimensional output classification variables from causing ambiguity in the meaning of the correlation coefficient with other variables 2 3 2 tree based machine learning methods in the study three typical tree based methods were also used for integrated drought monitoring data driven cubist the original model in the quickdri framework rf which performed well in previous integrated drought monitoring research lgbm which is an advanced ensemble learning model the three tree based methods are representative cubist is a traditional decision tree model which represents a non ensemble learning method rf and lgbm represent the two mainstream ensemble learning methods bagging and boosting respectively 2 3 2 1 cubist cubist is a rule based decision tree model quinlan 1993 1992 it can build rule based linear models between multiple variables and target values and these linear models are included in the leaf nodes of the tree cubist has the advantage that the volume of the model is small with good accuracy and the rule based model is more interpretable in the study the cubist package of r https cran r project org web packages cubist developed by rulequest research https www rulequest com was used for implementation 2 3 2 2 random forest rf rf is an ensemble learning model that includes many decision trees breiman 2001 ho 1995 the ensemble learning strategy of the rf is bagging which trains the decision trees by randomly extracting training samples with retractions and randomly selecting feature subsets and then using the average value returned by many decision trees as the predicted value of the rf the introduction of two randomness makes the generalization ability of rf stronger and insensitive to missing values and outliers in the study the scikit learn package of python https scikit learn org pedregosa et al 2011 was used to implement the rf 2 3 2 3 light gradient boosting machine lgbm lgbm ke et al 2017 is an ensemble learning model based on boosting strategy lgbm is an efficient implementation of gradient boosting decision tree gbdt friedman 2001 it builds new decision trees multiple times to fit the residual of the existing decision tree so as to improve the prediction accuracy of the model and uses the negative gradient of the loss function of the existing decision tree as the residual approximation compared with the same type of xgboost chen and guestrin 2016 lgbm can achieve higher training efficiency and lower memory usage while maintaining high prediction accuracy and also supports direct input of categorical variables in the study the lightgbm package of python https lightgbm readthedocs io provided by microsoft was used for implementation 2 3 3 dataset generation 2 3 3 1 datasets of each month two types of datasets were established in the study tabular dataset and time series dataset the time series dataset was to meet the time series input requirements of 1d cnn and gru both types of datasets were divided by month each generating 12 month datasets and all generated datasets cover the time length from 2001 to 2014 finally 12 tabular datasets and 12 time series datasets were generated the specific steps to generate the datasets are as follows 1 generate the tabular datasets of each month every weather station is a sample extract the average values of the remote sensing and biophysical raster data within 5 km 5 km at the location of the weather station as the independent variable values of the station sample the station based spei is the dependent variable of the sample the reason for choosing a 5 km 5 km window is to compromise the spatial resolution of each independent variable raster 2 based on the tabular datasets generate the time series datasets of each month for a time series sample the tabular independent variables of the current month and the previous two months of a station were used to generate the 3 month scale time series independent variables and the spei of the current month of the station was used as the dependent variable 3 since the independent variable data at some stations may have invalid null values in some months it is necessary to remove the station samples with null values in the tabular datasets and time series datasets of each month after removing invalid samples in order to ensure the comparability of tabular datasets and time series datasets it is necessary to ensure that the tabular datasets and time series datasets of each month cover the same stations finally only samples of stations that are common to both were kept in the datasets 2 3 3 2 data normalization and categorical variable encoding in order to eliminate the influence of abnormal samples and speed up the convergence of deep learning networks it is necessary to normalize the continuous feature variables in the datasets commonly used normalization methods include z score normalization and min max normalization in the study spei spi svi esi and sma are z score normalized data so the remaining awc sosa ele and irrag need to be normalized because awc and sosa conform to the normal distribution z score was used for normalization ele and irrag do not conform to the normal distribution so the min max normalization was used at the same time most deep learning networks and tree based methods cannot directly deal with categorical variables one hot encoding qu et al 2019 was used for the two categorical variables of lulc and eco 2 3 4 hyperparameter tuning hyperparameters are an important factor affecting the performance of deep learning networks so scientific hyperparameter tuning is necessary in the study there are training hyperparameters and architectural hyperparameters the training hyperparameters mainly control the training process of the networks and the architecture hyperparameters are used to control the architectural details of the networks training hyperparameters include learning rate number of epochs regularization and batch size the learning rate and the number of epochs were dynamically determined by the learning rate scheduler and early stopping the learning rate scheduler will continuously reduce the learning rate according to the loss of the validation set during training so as to prevent the problem of non convergence caused by too large initial learning rate or slow convergence caused by too small initial learning rate the early stopping is to determine that the network has converged when the validation set loss does not decrease for n consecutive times n 150 in the study and to stop the training early to prevent the network from overfitting the l2 regularization was used and the batch size was set to 32 masters and luschi 2018 the architectural hyperparameters are different for each network and method detailed in table 2 in the study 5 fold cross validation and bayesian optimization bergstra et al 2011 were used for hyperparameter tuning data from 2001 to 2012 in the datasets of each month was used for the 5 fold cross validation in order to ensure the effectiveness of cross validation the data distribution of the validation set needs to be similar to that of the test set so the data of two adjacent years was used as the validation set in the 5 times of cross validation select 2007 2008 2008 2009 2009 2010 2010 2011 2011 2012 as the validation set in turn and the remaining years data was used as the training set in each time the results of cross validation were used for bayesian optimization and the best combination of hyperparameters was finally returned bayesian optimization is a hyperparameter tuning method based on prior which uses the performance of the hyperparameters that have been searched to infer the next hyperparameter tuning direction thereby reducing the search space and greatly improving the search efficiency in the study the hyperopt package of python http hyperopt github io hyperopt bergstra et al 2013 was used to implement bayesian optimization 2 3 5 evaluation method 2 3 5 1 accuracy evaluation in order to evaluate the integrated drought monitoring accuracy of different deep learning networks and tree based methods the coefficient of determination r2 and root mean square error rmse were used for quantitative evaluation the evaluation metrics are as follows 1 r 2 1 i s i q i 2 i s i s 2 2 rmse i 1 n s i q i 2 n in the formula n is the number of samples s i and q i are the real value of station based spei and the predicted value of quickdri of sample i respectively 2 3 5 2 spatial distribution evaluation in the study according to the accuracy evaluation results the data driven methods with better performance were selected for the spatial mapping of quickdri china this is to further evaluate the spatial distribution macroscale and microscale performance and drought response ability of the quickdri china generated by different data driven methods at the same time the 0 5 gridded 1 month scale spei of the global spei database https spei csic es beguería et al 2022 was used as the reference data of the spatial distribution 3 result 3 1 accuracy evaluation table 3 shows the r2 and rmse of the quick models january to december of different data driven methods and fig 8 shows the corresponding boxplots for each month the method with the best performance on the evaluation metrics and the methods within 0 005 of the best metrics were considered as the preferred methods for the month it can be seen from table 3 that 1 both eednn and rf are the preferred method in 8 months the eednn performed best in the 5 months of february march may august and november the rf performed best in the three months of june july and september lgbm 1d cnn and gru are the preferred method in 6 4 and 2 months respectively sam and cubist are the preferred method in only 1 month 2 the months where rf is the preferred method show a tendency for rf to perform better for those months where the average goodness of fit is higher june july and september with the best performance of the rf are also the three months with the highest average goodness of fit and the average r2 are all greater than 0 95 the eednn does not show such a tendency and performs well in months with high medium and low average goodness of fit it shows that eednn is more adaptable to different month conditions fig 8 shows the overall performance of the accuracy evaluation of the models of each month the eednn performs best on median outliers and volatility the lgbm has the next best median but the outliers performed poorly the median performance of rf is similar to that of 1d cnn and gru but the outliers of rf are better the medians of sam and cubist both perform poorly and cubist outliers also show poor performance based on the evaluation results of each month s quickdri model the performance of each data driven method is ranked as follows eednn rf lgbm 1d cnn gru sam cubist the eednn performed the best overall followed by the rf they were the preferred methods in most months and their boxplots performed well the lgbm was the preferred method in half of the months and the median performance was good but the performance in march was poor the performance of 1d cnn and gru was medium and 1d cnn was better than gru the sam and cubist performed poorly fig 9 is a scatterplot of the quickdri predicted values and the station based spei it contains the predictions of all month s quickdri models based on different data driven methods and the overall r2 and rmse are calculated the overall accuracy evaluation metrics r2 rmse from high to low is eednn 0 914 0 299 rf 0 912 0 302 lgbm 0 908 0 308 1d cnn 0 907 0 310 sam 0 905 0 313 gru 0 904 0 314 cubist 0 902 0 318 the eednn has the best performance followed by the rf they are in the tier 1 highest accuracy the lgbm and 1d cnn are in the tier 2 the gru and sam are in the tier 3 compared with other methods the cubist has more discrete outliers and relatively poor accuracy it is in the tier lowest finally considering the monthly and overall performance of each method the accuracy evaluation ranking from high to low is eednn rf lgbm 1d cnn sam gru cubist among them the eednn and rf show obvious advantages over other methods and they also represent deep learning method and tree based method respectively 3 2 spatial patterns of quickdri china according to the above accuracy evaluation the eednn and rf perform better representing the best method for deep learning and tree based method respectively in order to further compare the integrated drought monitoring capabilities of these two methods the spatial patterns of the quickdri china generated by eednn and rf were compared in the study as shown in figs 10 and 11 the quickdri china generated by eednn and rf are indistinguishable in macroscopic spatial pattern and they are all similar to the macroscopic spatial pattern of the 1 month scale spei of the global spei database this shows that the quickdri china generated by both can accurately characterize the macroscopic spatial pattern of drought fig 12 is a comparison of the micro scale spatial distribution of the quickdri china the location is around weishan lake the largest freshwater lake in northern china it can be found that the quickdri based on eednn have richer spatial details than that based on rf especially in october in addition the quickdri based on rf showed obvious boundary effect when describing regions with different drought degrees as shown in august and september the spatial distribution of the quickdri based on eednn is smoother and there is no obvious boundary between regions of different drought degrees 3 3 responses to typical drought events from early july to mid august 2013 a once in a century drought occurred in southern china involving 9 provinces and 2 provincial municipalities yuan et al 2016 during the same period floods occurred in parts of northwest china north china and northeast china a rare spatial pattern of drought in the south and flood in the north appeared in china fig 13 is the quickdri china in july 2013 developed by eednn and rf respectively it can be found that both of them have captured the severe drought in southern china well and the monitored drought range is consistent with the relevant historical data china meteorological administration 2015 they also show the characteristics of drought in the south and flood in the north in the spatial pattern the above shows that the quickdri china developed by eednn and rf can effectively respond to macroscopic and large scale drought events and can accurately characterize their spatial patterns in order to further compare the ability of the quickdri china generated by eednn and rf to capture drought events in local areas in the study the drought monitoring in hunan province was further analyzed as the most severe drought area hunan had the largest area of crop damage and crop failure as shown in fig 14 it can be found that compared with the quickdri developed by rf fig 14 b the quickdri based on eednn fig 14 a has detected more severe drought events in central hunan the region where these detected extreme drought events occurred coincided highly with the region where the 2013 grain yield reduction was most severe fig 14 c this shows that the quickdri based on eednn can more effectively capture extreme drought events at local scales 4 discussion 4 1 heterogeneous drought features and inductive biases of the data driven methods in the study according to the architectural characteristics of 1d cnn and gru the time series variables were used for training although the information was increased the accuracy was not as good as eednn when we analyze the reasons from the inductive biases of each method we can find that many cnn and rnn network architectures including 1d cnn and gru are designed for homogeneous data such as audio text and images from the beginning that is the nature of each feature input into the network is the same borisov et al 2022 katzir et al 2021 for example in text sequence data each sequence node is a word text and the coding features corresponding to each word text are homogeneous another example is image data when the pixels at adjacent spatial positions of the image are sent as features to the convolution kernel for calculation cnn convolution operation the fundamental nature of different pixel features is the same however for most of today s integrated drought indices including the quickdri the features often include a variety of numerical continuous or discrete variables and categorical variables with different nature which is a kind of heterogeneous tabular data when the data driven methods gru and 1d cnn with homogeneous inductive bias are used to train heterogeneous drought data there will inevitably be deviations from the expected results borisov et al 2022 the same is true for the sam the transformer based on the self attention mechanism is carefully designed to train sequence data when performing self attention analysis it is considered that there is homogeneity between different features when analyzing heterogeneous integrated drought features especially when the features contain categorical variables the effectiveness of the self attention mechanism will be greatly reduced for the dnn as a classic fully connected layer network it does not have such a strong homogeneous inductive bias like rnn and cnn at the beginning of its design and it is often used for nonlinear multiple regression of tabular data at the same time the eednn used in this paper itself improves the ability of the network to simultaneously process continuous and categorical variables on the basis of dnn guo and berkhahn 2016 the embedding technology used in eednn has been proven to effectively improve the ability of the network to process heterogeneous data cheng et al 2016 this shows that the inductive bias of eednn matches heterogeneous data and is more adaptable to heterogeneous features in integrated drought monitoring in addition studies have shown that proper regularization can make the multi layer perceptron also known as dnn more effective in dealing with heterogeneous tabular data kadra et al 2021 in this study the optimal l2 regularization was determined through the learning rate scheduler and early stopping which may further improve the ability of eednn to deal with heterogeneous data finally for the tree based ensemble learning methods such as rf and lgbm they are originally designed to solve tabular data and naturally have a good ability to deal with heterogeneous tabular data grinsztajn et al 2022 this is why the accuracy evaluation of rf and lgbm in this study is still excellent however tree based methods have limitations in the spatial description of drought which will be discussed in the next subsection 4 2 deep learning has unique advantages in describing the spatial distribution of drought from the results in section 3 2 we can see that the quickdri developed by rf shows obvious boundary effect in the detailed spatial description while the spatial description of the quickdri developed by eednn is relatively smooth drought is a continuous spatial event and spatial description must be considered in integrated drought monitoring many studies have shown that neural networks are biased towards low frequency smooth target functions while tree based methods which learn piece wise constant functions favor irregular non smooth patterns grinsztajn et al 2022 rahaman et al 2019 a simulation experiment was also carried out in the study to verify this conclusion four methods were selected including eednn and 1d cnn with the highest accuracy of deep learning and rf and lgbm with the highest accuracy of tree based method the two spatial continuous independent variables of esi and sma were simulated in the range of 2 5 2 5 according to the step size of 0 01 other continuous variables took the median classification variables took the mode and kept constant during the simulation the quickdri models of july with the highest average r2 and march with the lowest average r2 were used for the experiment the results of the simulation experiment are shown in fig 15 it can be found that the predicted values of quickdri based on the tree based methods show obvious boundaries and strips while the predicted values based on the deep learning methods are smooth without obvious boundaries the non smooth bias of the tree based method has little effect on general tabular data that does not have spatial properties and even shows advantages on some tabular data that obeys irregular patterns grinsztajn et al 2022 but this non smooth bias is fatal for tabular data that has spatial properties and requires continuous spatial distribution mapping according to the tobler s first law of geography for continuous spatial variables closer locations mean closer values tobler 1970 the smooth bias of the target function of deep learning makes the transition between the predicted values of the approximate independent variables smooth and thus smooth in space however the non smooth bias of the tree based method may lead to a clear boundary between the predicted values of the approximate independent variables which also leads to the boundary effect in the spatial description this boundary effect is obviously inconsistent with the spatial continuity characteristics of drought events while the smooth spatial description of deep learning is closer to the real situation therefore we believe that for the events with spatial continuity characteristics including drought the smooth inductive bias of deep learning has a natural advantage in spatial description 4 3 conception of specialized deep learning network for integrated drought monitoring deep learning has a unique advantage in spatial description of drought because of its smooth bias of target function at the same time in terms of accuracy evaluation eednn achieves higher accuracy results due to its weak homogeneous inductive bias combined with embedding coding technology and appropriate regularization however considering the elaborate and complex design of eednn and the high time cost of hyperparameter tuning it still does not show absolute advantages in accuracy evaluation compared with tree based ensemble methods due to its better adaptability to heterogeneous data and lower cost of hyperparameter tuning the tree based ensemble methods still show strong competitiveness without considering the spatial description of drought we believe that at the present stage deep learning has improved the ability of integrated drought monitoring which is more inclined to the unique advantages of deep learning in spatial description as well as its potential to achieve higher prediction accuracy than the traditional tree based ensemble methods through appropriate architecture design and hyperparameter tuning this potential of deep learning still has great room for improvement and there is still a lack of mature deep learning technology that specializes in processing heterogeneous tabular data in the future coupling the respective advantages of deep learning and tree based methods may become a feasible improvement method the tree based models are not differentiable and cannot be directly trained jointly with deep learning modules therefore this coupling is more inclined to combine the inductive bias of the tree based method that match heterogeneous data and develop a specialized deep learning network for heterogeneous tabular data the advantages of this specialized network are 1 it has a good ability to handle heterogeneous data 2 it maintains the advantages of deep learning in spatial description 3 it can be combined with other deep learning networks for joint training with the increase of drought related data acquisition means and the increase of data volume drought feature extraction only through expert knowledge will not be able to fully obtain all the drought information in large data volumes the deep learning technologies such as cnn and rnn with homogeneous inductive bias are suitable for extracting drought features from homogeneous data such as remote sensing images and meteorological time series the heterogeneous drought features extracted by deep learning and expert knowledge are fed into the specialized deep learning network for joint training this will further improve the accuracy spatial mapping and intelligence of integrated drought monitoring 5 conclusions in this study four representative deep learning methods i e eednn 1d cnn gru and sam and three widely used tree based machine learning methods i e cubist rf and lgbm were critically evaluated in constructing the integrated agricultural drought index quickdri china the main insights and conclusions of this paper are as follows 1 in terms of station accuracy evaluation not all deep learning methods presented better performances than the tree based machine learning methods their overall accuracy evaluation metrics r2 rmse from high to low are eednn 0 914 0 299 rf 0 912 0 302 lgbm 0 908 0 308 1d cnn 0 907 0 310 sam 0 905 0 313 gru 0 904 0 314 cubist 0 902 0 318 the reason may lie in the adaptability to heterogeneous input features since the features that employed in constructing the integrated agricultural drought index are heterogeneous the method who has the adaptability to heterogeneous features tend to perform better the eednn effectively deals with heterogeneous drought features thanks to the weak homogeneous inductive bias of dnn advanced embedding coding technology and appropriate regularization means the rf and lgbm have their natural advantage in dealing with heterogeneous data and the 1d cnn gru and sam have homogeneous inductive bias resultantly the eednn performed best followed by the rf and lgbm and then the other methods 2 in terms of spatial description evaluation both the eednn method representative of deep learning and the rf method representative of machine learning can accurately describe the macroscopic spatial pattern of drought however the eednn derived quickdri china has richer spatial details than the rf derived quickdri china at the micro scale moreover the former has a smoother spatial description than the latter which implies that the eednn derived result is more in line with the actual spatial continuity of agricultural drought while the rf derived result is prone to obvious boundaries in the spatial description this smoother spatial description benefits from the fact that neural networks are biased toward low frequency functions while tree based methods favor irregular non smooth patterns 3 in terms of responses to drought events both the eednn derived quickdri china and the rf derived quickdri china can effectively reflect the macroscopic and large scale drought events but the eednn performed better at local scale and it can capture some extreme drought events that the rf cannot detect to sum up the tree based ensemble machine learning methods such as rf and lgbm are still competitive in constructing the integrated drought index as compared with the deep learning methods at the current stage however the higher accuracy the smoother spatial description and the more responsive ability of the eednn demonstrate great potential of deep learning methods for integrated agricultural drought monitoring we believe that developing a specialized deep learning network for heterogeneous agricultural drought features can further improve the performances of integrated agricultural drought monitoring this should be one of the focuses in the next study of remote sensing of agricultural

8879,over the years desalination has become integral to water resources management primarily in coastal semi arid to arid regions while desalinated seawater has mainly been supplied to municipal and high revenue industries the agriculture sector faces increasing irrigation demands making it a potential user this review assesses the sustainability of using desalinated seawater for irrigation shedding light on its limitations and potential using desalinated water for irrigation presents challenges including its high energy consumption potential contribution to climate change and agronomy related concerns however evidence suggests that these challenges can be addressed effectively through tailor fitted strategies that said conventional binary decision making paradigms that label practices as good or bad and focus on a singular isolated aspect are insufficient for evaluating the sustainability of desalination due to the complex and interconnected nature of the issues involved to overcome this the climate water energy food cwef nexus concept is proposed as a comprehensive framework for sustainability assessment adopting the cwef nexus approach allows for a better understanding of the potential challenges associated with using desalinated water for irrigation encompassing social economic and environmental concerns to ensure effective management of these challenges it is crucial to tailor desalination projects to specific regional conditions and employ either prophylactic or corrective strategies by embracing the cwef nexus approach informed decisions can be made regarding the future utilization of desalinated water for irrigation contributing to broader sustainability goals keywords desalination irrigation water resources management water crisis climate water energy food nexus data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction while recently gathered data suggest a notable decline in worldwide fossil fuel production these resources most notably oil and coal are still dominating the energy market by a considerable margin it is estimated that fossil fuels accounted for more than 81 of world energy production in 2019 similar to the value reported in 2018 iea 2021 in addition to the adverse environmental impacts of resorting to these resources due to greenhouse gas ghg emissions the alarming dependency on fossil fuels signals a developing energy crisis as these resources are by nature non renewable all in all continuing this trajectory would create devastating future socio economic and environmental problems on the other hand global hunger levels remain alarmingly high and the world continues to struggle with an ongoing food crisis it is estimated that in 2021 nearly 193 million individuals faced the challenges of acute food insecurities and required immediate assistance across 53 countries territories a tragic all time high record that captures the sheer magnitude of the impending food crisis fsin 2022 given the stresses on the global food system the frequency and severity of the said crisis are expected to rise in the upcoming years puma et al 2018 lastly an ongoing water crisis has been looming over the world for quite some time now one of the most notable roots of this problem is that the global water demand has been steadily increasing over the years and is expected to continue the said trajectory ritchie and roser 2017 of course one should consider that water is not distributed evenly throughout the globe leaving some regions with less accessibility to readily available water resources as a result regions such as the middle east have been struggling with an ongoing water crisis which is expected to be exacerbated by the adverse impacts of climate change bozorg haddad et al 2020 the looming crises raise challenges for the agriculture industry as stated the challenge of reliable food production most notably in semi arid and arid regions coupled with the ever increasing demand for new food products drives the industry to expand its operations including extended use of water for irrigation valipour and singh 2016 doing so would pressure the already vulnerable water sector furthermore accessing new water resources can be an energy demanding procedure that may induce further stress on the energy sector kenway et al 2011 climate change is projected to complicate the situation even further as not only does it directly impact the agriculture sector but it can also affect and be affected by solutions to the water and energy crises zolghadr asli et al 2019 this situation is direr in semi arid to arid regions where lack of water has already taken its toll on the water food and energy sectors in light of all these crises over the years desalination has emerged as a reasonable practice to secure water resources most notably in semi arid and arid regions by convention desalination is defined as the process of removing dissolved solids such as salts and minerals from water kucera 2019 in addition to its prominent role in augmenting water resources what distinguishes desalinated water from other conventional alternatives is that it can buffer natural hydro climatic volatility making water resources management relatively independent from the hydrological cycle as such desalination has been playing a vital role in the current landscape of water planning and management including and perhaps most notably meeting municipal water demands since the 1960s angelakis et al 2021 for the most part on a global scale use of desalinated water in the agriculture industry has been limited as such while a good deal of experience and knowledge has been accumulated collectively about applying desalination to meet municipal demands the same cannot be said about application to the agriculture sector in fact at the moment based on currently available data the only countries committed to this practice under a nationwide and publicly supported program at a notable scale are spain and israel martin gorriz et al 2021 the application of desalinated water in the spanish agriculture sector dates to 1995 when a private desalination plant was installed to guarantee the irrigation requirements of the mazarrón irrigation district martínez alvarez et al 2018 in 2004 however the spanish government committed to a long term plan to invest in desalinated water for the agriculture industry martínez alvarez et al 2018 navarro 2018 as for israel while the country had been contemplating using desalinated water for irrigation since the mid 1960s 2006 marks the milestone in which the nation committed to a long term plan to support this practice lahav and birnhack 2007 that said it should be noted that given current circumstances and projected challenges in the water and food industry other regions including australia chile china egypt saudi arabia and the united states are entertaining the idea of implementing desalination for the agriculture industry lattemann et al 2010 martínez alvarez et al 2018 in light of the impending crises stated earlier it is critical to understand the potential role of desalination in the agriculture industry in particular for irrigation purposes significant relevant research has been undertaken in the last decade or so to shed light on this subject e g burn et al 2015 martínez alvarez et al 2016 kumar et al 2018 notwithstanding the necessity and value of such research what is lacking in such analyses is the acknowledgement and in turn exploration of the multifaceted nature of the problem furthermore any attempt to investigate this topic without exploring the impacts of climate change is arguably moot with this in mind through the concept of the climate water energy food cwef nexus the current review aims to provide a fresh and more holistic approach to interpreting the role of desalination within the context of the agriculture industry similar to the well established water energy food wef nexus the underlying concept of the cwef nexus is to emphasize the interconnectedness of water energy food and in this case climate security this paradigm of thinking has played a vital role in contemporary sustainable water planning and management e g duan et al 2019 qin et al 2022 cwef based frameworks have been used to evaluate the merits and drawbacks of water management techniques e g sun et al 2020 ren et al 2022 this can ultimately help decision makers and engineers better understand the nexus and what the future may hold should large elements of the agriculture industry resort to desalination as a new water resource ultimately this review aims to explore how sustainable desalinated water can be within the context of the agriculture industry which from this point onward exclusively refers to the irrigation practices that rely on desalinated water unless explicitly stated otherwise 2 role of desalination from the water resources angle in order to evaluate the potential future role of desalination in the agriculture industry it is crucial to understand its current role in water resources management generally speaking the practice of desalination has been expanding steadily on a global scale as can be seen in fig 1 the industry is showing a steady growth both in terms of installed desalination plants and overall capacity that said because water resources and socio economic conditions vary from region to region so has the development of desalination projects as can be seen in fig 2 the middle east region 47 5 alone accounts for the majority of available global capacity for desalination with north america 14 9 and southern and western europe 10 0 being the next biggest investors as well as varying between regions the reliance on desalination varies drastically from one sector to another based on kucera 2019 fig 3 depicts each sector s relative share of desalinated water globally in 2015 the municipal 60 and industry 28 sectors are by a considerable margin the most notable users these uses dwarf irrigation related water demands which account only for 2 of desalinated water globally given the ever increasing water demands of the agriculture sector and the ongoing water crisis one can surmise that these numbers are going to change as such it would not be unexpected to see more countries incorporate desalinated water in their agricultural systems similar to previous developments in spain and israel however as we will explore in the upcoming sections some pressing matters most notably environmental and economic concerns could potentially delay or halt such long term commitments 3 a closer look at desalination from the energy sector perspective the water and energy sectors are interconnected on various levels to the point that addressing the issues of one sector without at least considering the other sector is impossible zolghadr asli et al 2019 while water is actively contributing to the energy sector for example through fuel extraction and processing operations thermoelectric cooling and hydropower generation the energy sector is providing power to run the water sector extraction distribution conveyance and wastewater collection and treatment are merely examples of how the water sector relies heavily on the energy sector saleh et al 2019 the reliance of water supply on energy supply is particularly pronounced in the desalination industry the energy demands of desalinated water relate to how and where it is used with additional pre and post treatment processes generally required to ensure water quality standards can be met and in some cases pumping of the product over considerable distances and elevation gains is also required studies suggest that on average desalination requires four times as much energy as water produced in water reuse plants ten times as much energy as a traditional treatment for surface water and nearly twenty times more energy than pumping groundwater mcevoy and wilder 2012 as a result reliance on desalination exposes water sellers and buyers to the energy market s notorious volatilities hussey and pittock 2012 tubi and williams 2021 furthermore the energy consumption of desalinated water supply could in turn be ultimately reflected in ghg emissions in response to the economic and environmental disadvantages of desalinated water supply there has been a gradual decline in the power consumption of desalination units over the years fig 4 for instance depicts how the power consumption of seawater reverse osmosis ro desalination units currently the most relevant and efficient technology available in the market has improved over time the power demand for such units ranged from 10 to 16 kwh m3 to today s state of the art ro units that require approximately 3 5 kwh m3 baten and stummeyer 2013 palmer 2015 kim et al 2019 ideally the ultimate goal would be to cut down the energy consumption of the desalination units as much as possible it should be noted however that there is a minimum theoretical limit as desalination is fundamentally energy demanding based on thermodynamic principles for instance the theoretical energy requirement for an ro unit that desalinates seawater with total dissolved solids of 35 000 ppm and with temperature 25 c assuming 50 energy recovery is approximately 1 06 kwh m3 baten and stummeyer 2013 palmer 2015 the stated value is of course based on pure theoretical conditions and in practice often we cannot achieve this level of efficiency furthermore incorporating pre and post treatment measures to enhance water quality for a specific sector would increase this power consumption in the agriculture sector this may include reducing the concentration of phytotoxic elements such as boron and chloride or reintroducing nutrition elements back to the water based on data gathered in spain and israel such additional power consumptions are estimated to range between 0 50 and 0 77 kwh m3 which brings the total energy consumption of state of the art large seawater desalination units that supply the agriculture sector to somewhere between 2 9 and 4 3 kwh m3 martínez alvarez et al 2018 from a planning and management perspective a practical approach to reducing energy consumption of the desalination process is to optimize its planning design layout and operation for instance knowing that larger desalination units can be more energy efficient martínez alvarez et al 2019 having a clear long term plan about water requirements including possible expansion to include the demands of different parties and perhaps even different sectors while planning and designing these systems can help increase their overall energy efficiency it should also be noted that a significant amount of energy infrastructure and water supply infrastructure is required to power desalination and transport water in and out of the desalination units denicola et al 2015 as such optimally locating the units with respect to the water source and the end user can significantly reduce both capital cost and energy requirements maintenance of the system is another way to uphold energy performance of these units over their operation horizon lapuente 2012 cornejo et al 2014 leon et al 2021 nevertheless the most notable principal factor determining a desalination unit s energy consumption is the core technology used for the desalination process since thermal process based technologies such as multi effect desalination med and multistage flash msf fundamentally require large amounts of thermal energy ro is often cited as the most energy efficient technology leon et al 2021 incorporating energy recovery devices e g isobaric chambers and positive displacement pumps in general is another alternative that can ultimately help offset the overall energy consumption of desalination units lapuente 2012 cornejo et al 2014 leon et al 2021 recent advancements in the desalination industry may also open the door to a whole new approach for energy conservative desalination though still in the testing phase state of the art technologies such as nanomembranes or batch desalination may be the key to a more efficient process palmer 2015 a complementary way to address the challenges associated with the energy consumption of the desalination industry is to take a critical look at the energy supply that is employing a more environmentally friendly and possibly cheaper energy resource reportedly global use of renewable energy has experienced a 3 increase in 2020 while demand for all other fuels has declined iea 2021 it was estimated that the share of renewable energy resources in global electricity generation in 2020 was around 29 iea 2021 while renewable energy resources are markedly perceived as more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels as they have less ghg emissions they are considered to be expensive for large scale industrial applications this notion has been challenged recently pistocchi et al 2020 studies show for instance that commercial implementation of renewable energy to run large scale desalination units could be considered economically feasible should fossil fuel subsidies be removed from the equation baten and stummeyer 2013 currently the most notable practical attempts to address this issue take advantage of a hybrid format where both fossil fuels and renewable energy alternatives are simultaneously used to power a desalination unit tubi and williams 2021 many options are available for linking renewable energy sources and desalination technology scalability costs suitability to specific climatic and environmental conditions and feedwater quality are the main factors that help decide the most fitting option the most common renewable and carbon dioxide free energy resources implemented in the desalination industry are geothermal nuclear solar wave and wind kucera 2019 among these options currently solar based desalination is the most prevalent the relative predictability of sunshine makes this option easier to plan and manage than alternatives like wave or wind power leon et al 2021 furthermore it is becoming progressively more affordable to implement at larger scales pistocchi et al 2020 though it has been under development since 1982 wind energy is mainly used to power relatively small scale ro units kucera 2019 similarly wave energy is usually paired up with small scale ro desalination units palmer 2015 naturally the latter approach is deemed more suitable for near coastline cities for example it has been employed in perth australia palmer 2015 nuclear energy can also be used as a carbon dioxide free energy source belessiotis et al 2010 often this is paired with thermal desalination technology and it is estimated that by doing so one can reduce the ghg of the desalination process by up to 90 kucera 2019 geothermal energy is another renewable energy source that can directly power a thermal desalination unit or indirectly provide the electricity needed for ro units kucera 2019 similarly solar power can be coupled with thermal desalination units using solar stills solar multi effect humidification meh or concentrating solar plant multi effect distillation csp med the other option is to convert solar radiation into electric energy using semiconducting materials in the form of photovoltaic pv panels rothwarf and böer 1975 with photovoltaic reverse osmosis pv ro and photovoltaic electrodialysis pv ed being the two main approaches while these are considered to be promising technologies one of the known drawbacks of pv based desalination is the high cost of pv cells and batteries for electricity storage kucera 2019 all in all replacing conventional resources with desalinated water in the agriculture sector solely from the energy side of things may impose additional challenges including economic and environmental concerns that said there seem to be some strategies that can mitigate or perhaps resolve these issues altogether substituting fossil energies with renewable and carbon dioxide free energy resources for instance can be a game changer for the sustainability of irrigating with desalinated water with these in mind it is time to evaluate the practice of desalination within the context of the food and agronomic sector it should be noted that the scope of this review was limited to the application of desalinated water for agronomic purposes and more specifically the irrigation of crops due to its immense role as one of the primary food supplies around the world as such from this point onward the terms agriculture and agronomy solely refer to crop farming and the practice of irrigation unless explicitly stated otherwise 4 a closer look at desalination from the food and agronomy sector when it comes to implementing desalination technology to meet agricultural water demand the most significant incentive is the opportunity it provides to expand agronomical activities and in turn increase food production in light of the ongoing food production deficiency markedly in semi arid and arid regions this in and of itself could be a compelling enough argument to at least entertain this idea despite this relying on desalinated water for irrigation purposes is a more limited practice but has been attracting more attention in the last two decades as a result some of the mid to long term impacts of this practice are still unclear that said reportedly this practice could cause some concerns and has done so in some cases broadly speaking the potential agronomic concerns are lack of essential nutrients phytotoxicity of chemical components such as boron b chloride cl and sodium na risk of soil sodicity and low alkalinity and buffering capacity of the said water martínez alvarez et al 2016 these potential issues could be in turn reflected in the crop quality crop yield and plants disease resistance however the potential for such impacts depends on multiple factors and ultimately needs to be determined on a case by case basis before diving into the agronomic concerns about irrigating with desalinated water it is essential to appreciate why such concerns could arise in the first place often the desalinated water from ro units is associated with a total dissolved solids concentration tds below 250 mg l very low hardness and buffering capacity and an acidic ph martínez alvarez et al 2016 these conditions are not quite suitable for most agricultural related applications and can even be aggressive towards the materials used in the distribution and conveyance systems martínez alvarez et al 2018 the general quality of the feedwater and desalination technology dictates the chemical composition of the desalinated water that said predominate minerals in desalinated water are na and cl ions with a very low concentration of other elements such as calcium ca magnesium mg sulfate so4 as well as high concentration of boron b martínez alvarez et al 2016 while some of these elements can potentially cause phytotoxicity at high concentrations the concentrations in water treated by ro tend to be so low that it lacks the nutrition components necessary for the plant growth and productivity what is also crucial to note here is that desalination not only removes the undesirable minerals from the feedwater but also somewhat separates most minerals with an ionic charge some of which have nutritional value for the plants furthermore elements with no ionic charge such as b found with high concentrations in seawater would easily pass the membrane with little to no filtration therefore determining the agronomic impacts depends on the quality of the desalinated water relative to alternative sources for instance studies revealed that using desalination could be agronomically beneficial in a region in israel where generally the quality of water that was replaced with desalinated water was relatively poor martínez alvarez et al 2016 other studies arrived at the opposite conclusion for a region in southeast spain where the conventional resources used prior to desalinated water were of high quality martínez alvarez et al 2018 the relation of crop growth to quality of the source water also depends on type of irrigation practice local climate soil condition and crop type crop type is a crucial factor that determines how a given plant would react to desalinated water fig 5 for instance shows how different plants would generally react to b and salinity soil type is another key factor for instance soils with high clay content are more prone to sodicity hazards martínez alvarez et al 2018 the irrigation practice is another element that needs to be taken into consideration cl and na for instance can cause a more pronounced problem should one use sprinkler irrigation as these elements can be absorbed directly through the leaves markedly during periods of high temperatures and low humidity bernstein 1975 hydro climatic conditions of a region can also be a decisive factor for instance higher feedwater temperature would result in a higher b passage rate martínez alvarez et al 2016 higher precipitation rates as another example can enhance the tolerance for salinity in the irrigation water as the soil in such regions is exposed to a natural leaching process martínez alvarez et al 2018 all in all desalinated water solely from the agronomic side of things appears to be a suitable choice to meet the ever increasing water demands of the agriculture sector that said resorting to desalinated water for irrigation could have adverse agronomic side effects varying from one case to another this sheds light on the importance of regional and even local studies on the agronomical impacts of desalination however it is essential to note that observing the full effect of such practice on crop quality and yield may take a while as was demonstrated by silber et al 2015 however before reaching the overall verdict with regard to the permissibility of desalination in the context of the agriculture industry it is crucial to look at the last piece of the puzzle which is how this practice would influence and be influenced by climate change 5 climate change and desalination there is staggering scientific evidence to prove that human activities have altered global climate over the years most notably a steady upward trend in the global average temperature with a rate unprecedented in the last two millennia ipcc 2021 in fact thanks to the recent advancements in paleoclimate data assimilation new studies were able to demonstrate that indeed one of the primary drivers of the global temperature variability within the last 24 millennia was ghg emissions osman et al 2021 through tampering with the hydrologic cycle climate change is altering the status quo of water resources worldwide that said how these alterations are manifested varies from region to region zolghadr asli 2017 with that in mind the general perception about the advent of these new hydro climatic patterns is that these changes may exacerbate the situation of water resources in semi arid and arid regions including the middle east which needless to say are already experiencing mild to severe water stress bozorg haddad et al 2020 forming a sustaining adaptation strategy has become one of the last lines of defense to ultimately secure the integrity of water resources enayati et al 2021 zolghadr asli et al 2021 in current context this introduces the question can desalination be genuinely seen as an adaptive strategy against the impacts of climate change addressing this question requires us to capture the dynamic and intricate relationship between desalination and climate change as stated desalination is in essence an intensive energy driven technology to augment conventional water resources heihsel et al 2019 notwithstanding the positive contribution of this practice to remedy the water and food crisis the fact that it is energy intensive implies that it can exacerbate global climate change a common approach to understanding how desalination or any human activity can contribute to climate change is to measure its cumulative ghg emission to that end scholars employ a metric called carbon footprint equivalent the carbon footprint equivalent of an activity often denoted by co2 eq is defined as the global warming effects of all the ghg emissions of that activity cornejo et al 2014 saleh et al 2019 note that the co2eq metric reflects both direct emissions say on site sources and indirect ghg contributions associated with the activity such as off site energy production production of raw materials and chemical components and fuels for a more detailed review of this subject interested readers are referred to cornejo et al 2014 in the context of climate change using the concept above each practice can be labeled as either a source or sink of ghg emission where the former contributes to amplifying climate change effects while the latter subtracts or mitigates such impacts the mainstream perception concerning the overall contribution of crop farming is that it can be seen as a sink of ghg emissions martin gorriz et al 2021 the implication is that this industry is in and of itself an adaptive way to alleviate the impacts of climate change that said introducing desalinated water for irrigation purposes could drastically change the narrative as the practice of desalination is generally a source of ghg emissions and as such can counterbalance the positive contribution of the agriculture industry the impact of desalination on the agriculture industry s ghg emission seems to vary from one case to another e g martin gorriz et al 2021 recent studies however suggest that generally most plant based agricultural practices can still be regarded as a sink for ghg emissions despite the negative impacts of desalination that said theoretically this practice can also present some potential nuances as desalination creates an augmented and reliable water source with often acceptable quality that can be used to expand the farmed areas or initiate new irrigation projects with more environmentally suitable and economically profitable crops theoretically speaking how and to what extent desalination can influence climate change is rooted in a series of factors including but not limited to desalination plant type pre and post treatment process irrigation practice system efficiency in terms of distribution and conveyance desalination plant size construction maintenance and operation of the system source and demanded water quality and hydro geographic conditions lyons et al 2009 fine and hadas 2012 cornejo et al 2014 saleh et al 2019 crop type is another decisive factor martin gorriz et al 2021 recent studies have illustrated how the type of crop can switch the irrigation from a sink to a source for ghg emission martin gorriz et al 2021 perhaps the most notable contributing factor is the energy source that fuels the entire process baten and stummeyer 2013 as explored earlier the transition into renewable energy based desalination plants could substantially reduce the carbon footprint of this practice making it practically a zero carbon footprint source for water resources pistocchi et al 2020 while the above narrative shows how desalination can influence climate change there is another side to this as climate change can also alter how desalination is perceived and practiced worldwide the most obvious and arguably predominant demonstration of this is rooted in how climate change alters the hydro climatic status quo the common perception is that climate change is exacerbating the water crisis in semi arid to arid regions e g bozorg haddad et al 2020 mubeen et al 2022 as the demand for a new reliable and sustainable source of water increases impacted societies would be more receptive toward the idea of desalination this has previously been observed to varying extends in australia israel spain and the united states feitelson and rosenthal 2012 williams 2018 tubi and williams 2021 some authors have even gone as far as saying that such shifts may have substantial geopolitical implications in the future creating a new socio political establishment that leans more heavily on coastal areas wolf 2009 on the other side of the spectrum of climate change impacts is flooding which is projected to become a more frequent and intense phenomenon this would in turn be induced as an additional source of risk to desalination infrastructure that needs to be accounted for often located near the shorelines desalination networks could also be exposed to additional risks as climate change projections signal a significant rise in sea levels denicola et al 2015 tubi and williams 2021 furthermore recent studies illustrated that the impacts of tsunamis are expected to be more devastating due to such projections for sea level rises sepúlveda et al 2021 another risk that could jeopardize the safety of coastal desalination infrastructure last but not least it is also crucial to note how the latest projections for climate change indicate that this phenomenon is adversely affecting marine life making this ecosystem more fragile than ever poloczanska et al 2013 this becomes exceptionally important within desalination practice as improper brine and sludge disposal could further amplify these vulnerabilities the outlook for the dynamic relationship between desalination and climate change is depicted in fig 6 all in all this section goes to show that climate is another potential factor that can influence and be influenced by the practice of desalination however the precise nature of this interaction is determined by various factors and as such requires to be studied on a case by case base 6 desalination sustainability reinterpretation within the context of climate water energy food nexus while previous sections demonstrated the potential for the application of desalinated water to irrigation they also shed light on some of the drawbacks of this practice thus far gathered experience shows that while any of the issues stated earlier can cause significant problems if not addressed correctly and in a timely fashion they are still for the most part manageable that is to say they are practical strategies available that can mitigate or even wholly address these negative impacts naturally the applicability of these strategies would need to be determined on a case by case basis however evaluating the effectiveness and suitability of these strategies would require a more comprehensive perspective that looks beyond conventional thinking exploring this topic and in turn evaluating these strategies can be done under the umbrella term of the climate water energy food cwef security nexus simply put the core idea here is that there is a complex interdependency and intertwined network between the water energy food and climate to the point that securing one would not be practical without addressing or considering other components zhang et al 2018 as a result a robust and sustainable planning and management paradigm often hinges on the cwef security nexus e g rasul and sharma 2016 enayati et al 2021 zolghadr asli et al 2021 similarly achieving sustainability within the context of incorporating desalinated water for irrigation purposes would require a decision making paradigm that accounts for the cwef security nexus the decision to evaluate the practice of using desalinated water for irrigation under a cwef nexus based decision making paradigm stems from the inherent complexity and interconnectedness of its components serrano tovar et al 2019 by introducing desalinated water for irrigation water deficits can be alleviated facilitating agricultural growth and increased food production however this comes with the trade off of heightened energy demand leading to higher operational costs and potential exacerbation of climate change through greenhouse gas emissions as discussed earlier utilizing desalinated water for irrigation purposes can help mitigate these adverse effects through selection of the right crop or opting for renewable energy resources martin gorriz et al 2014 caldera and breyer 2019 conversely climate change itself can impact water availability and agricultural productivity due to its influence on the hydro climatic cycle this abstract example highlights the necessity of comprehensively understanding and evaluating these intricate interactions to make sustainable decisions with long term effects generally speaking we have categorized strategies towards sustainable use of desalination for agriculture into two main classes namely prophylactic and corrective strategies strategies in the former category tend to prevent the problem before any meaningful impact appears these strategies are based on carefully tailored planning and management decisions that help optimize the system for specific conditions based on regional factors the idea is that the design layout and operation of desalination units and the desalination project in general could be customized to take advantage of unique environmental and local factors opting for a suitable desalination technology project site incorporating a cost effective energy source operating the system on the most suitable time slots to reduce the pressure on power grids or selecting the best environmentally friendly way to intake and discharge water are a few examples of passive strategies creating a monitoring and regular maintenance plan is another prophylactic approach to getting the best performance out of desalination units socio economic oriented strategies can also be seen as a prophylactic approach to addressing inherent problems of using desalination for irrigation purposes as stated for instance one of the most pressing issues when it comes to desalination in general is that it is often considered a much pricier alternative markedly in less developed regions than most conventional water resources lattemann et al 2010 pistocchi et al 2020 as such expanding the application of desalinated water to agriculture may not be attractive because there is less immediate urgency than for municipal supplies and the profit margins are far less lucrative than some industrial applications however revisiting the issue from a cwef security nexus angle would bring a whole new dimension to the urgency of this situation while it is true that the profitability of this practice at least on a local scale may not be able to compete with conventional resources it is also crucial to factor in the agriculture industry s role in the context of impending water and food crises the idea is that maintaining a consistent source of food production in the agriculture industry is becoming more difficult as time goes by establishing a subsidy mechanism would help desalination for the agriculture sector become more luring as an economically formidable option pistocchi et al 2020 it is also important to note that solely from a socio economic standpoint incorporating desalinated water for irrigation could be lucrative as it can bring a new source of revenue to the community by creating new job opportunities or increasing the income of previously established ones with that in mind based on a trickle down economy school of thought a public funded tariff on desalinated water could balance things toward making this technology enticing enough for the agriculture industry similar to the situation in saudi arabia for urban use denicola et al 2015 or spain at a limited scale for irrigation purposes lapuente 2012 monterrey viña et al 2020 ricart et al 2020 nevertheless in light of the cwef security nexus establishing an effective subsidy requires careful planning that also accounts for the environmental impacts of the energy sector the point is that conventional energy sources can be a significant source of ghg emissions not to mention that the volatility of the energy market could cause even further complications investing in renewable energy as an alternative to power desalination units entirely or in a hybrid form could be a practical approach to mitigate the environmental impacts of desalination an outside the box alternative socio economic strategy would be to bring forth the concept of water markets the core principle here would be to look at water or energy for that matter as tradable economic entities as a way to offset both economic and or environmental costs that are generally associated with the practice of desalination as such each stakeholder in this case irrigators would be entitled to a certain amount of desalinated water these rights could then be traded among the stakeholders or sold to interested parties from other sectors these trades would be a mechanism for the irrigators to concentrate production in the most profitable locations and crops and reduce the environmental impacts by focusing the transfer of desalinated water to fewer sites trading the right to desalinated water such as the practice that has been executed in southeast spain on a very limited scale martínez alvarez et al 2016 aznar sánchez et al 2017 could be a creative way to mitigate the problems of desalination in the context of the agriculture industry resource recovery also referred to as seawater mining is the process of extracting valuable minerals from the seawater some scholars are of the opinion that resource recovery has the potential to offset the economic cost of desalination by introducing a new source of revenue that can be gained from selling these minerals diallo et al 2015 quist jensen et al 2016 loganathan et al 2017 as a result resource recovery can be technically seen as a passive socio economic strategy to accommodate the high cost of desalination the problem from a practical standpoint is that the available options for extraction are either monetarily high value yet with very low concentration e g au ag high concentration yet low financial value e g sea salt or low concentration with intermediate value e g cu li pistocchi et al 2020 perhaps some potentially viable candidates from an economic standpoint would be mg k and b which often have relatively high monetarily value and concentration though even mining these elements at least with current technology would not be economically justifiable for all cases pistocchi et al 2020 all in all it is often hard to generalize this strategy s economic value as it requires evaluation on a case by case basis logistic matters local markets and the intake seawater quality are among the many factors that dictate the financial appeal of this strategy in addition to the prophylactic strategies one could opt for a more hands on approach to tackle these problems the general theme in corrective strategies is to devise a tailored procedure to tackle a specifically targeted problem corrective strategies can be classified into two major classes namely on site and off site strategies there are three main categories when it comes to on site oriented strategies which are pre treatment in unit and post treatment plans the purpose of pre treatment regimens is often to enhance the intake water quality to a minimum pre required condition which is necessary to uphold the overall performance of the desalination unit removing solids from intake water is the most common pre treatment regimen in unit strategies basic idea is to enhance the performance or efficiency of the desalination unit often in terms of energy consumption or improving the desalinated water quality incorporating energy recovery e g isobaric chambers and positive displacement pumps is an effective active strategy to offset the overall energy consumption of desalination lapuente 2012 cornejo et al 2014 leon et al 2021 in some cases the chemical composition of the intake water contains a higher concentration of components that could be harmful to specific sectors for instance a common issue with utilizing seawater desalination for irrigation is the high concentration of phytotoxicity elements such as b cl and na martínez alvarez et al 2018 using multi pass ro is often a practical yet energy taxing way that has proven to help reduce the concentration of these elements to acceptable and harmless levels martínez alvarez et al 2016 2018 finally if need be the post treatment regimens are there to either minimize the adverse environmental impacts of desalination or enhance the quality of the desalinated water cost effectively in the former case a standard course of action is imposing more rigorous physical or chemical restrictions say using multi pass ro to enhance the quality of brine discharge which could mitigate the known negative impacts of desalting units on ecosystems and marine life another post treatment regimen for incorporating desalinated water for irrigation is reintroducing nutrients that are often lacking in desalinated water as a post treatment process these minerals most notably mg ca and so4 could be reintroduced to the desalinated water which can reinvigorate the said resource for agricultural purposes ben gal et al 2009 in contrast to on site treatment regimens where a corrective course of action would be selected at the desalination management level in off site strategies the consumers whether individually or perhaps collectively proactively attempt to make the desalinated water more suitable to their specific requirements within the realm of the agriculture sector the two known examples of these strategies are mixing different water resources to create a more suitable batch on site and adding fertilizers to account for lacking nutritional elements in desalinated water considering the often high cost of desalination in addition to improving the water quality for irrigation purposes the former strategy could also help reduce the overall cost of irrigation with desalinated water this however requires an on site monitoring system that tracks the chemical composition of desalinated water and an additional facility to mix the said water with the right proportion as was shown here evaluating the pressing issues of desalination individually would not be sufficient and may be an ineffective approach to resolving or mitigating the disadvantages of desalination reinterpreting these problems within the context of the cwef security nexus can however help justify the implication of desalination for agricultural purposes by shedding light on some hidden yet crucial angles of the problem all in all experiences in the past suggest that most if not all these problems are for the most part manageable if addressed in a proper and timely manner this means that if the right course of action is selected for a specific problem it is possible to maintain these adverse impacts to an acceptable level however the crucial thing to note here is that multiple factors often come into play making it rather impossible to render a solution acceptable for all cases and situations in other words like most water management problems a universally optimum solution may not exist and the best strategy must be determined on a case by case basis 7 concluding remark with the looming threats of water and food crises it is crucial to rethink how water resources management needs to adapt to emerging challenges desalination is an established way of alleviating the challenges of increasing water demand in the municipal sector primarily in semi arid to arid regions where water availability is a pressing problem gradually other sectors have started to adopt desalination as technological advances have made it more cost effective while the associated environmental issues have become better understood and better managed the agriculture sector has tentatively started to use desalinated water for irrigation purposes following the footsteps of israel and spain incorporating desalinated water for irrigation could become an enticing idea in the future as more regions started to entertain the idea of utilizing this resource in the agriculture industry while the outlook of this strategy in general seems to be positive for the most part there are some pressing issues when it comes to utilizing desalinated water for irrigation purposes for one this technology is by nature energy intensive which in turn makes this not quite enticing from an economic standpoint compared to conventional sources of water the other problem here is the ghg emissions associated with the energy consumption of this technology in addition to endangering the marine ecosystem and possibly spoiling the structure of the irrigated soil perhaps the most pressing environmental issue behind expanded use of desalination for irrigation is its potential role in exacerbating climate change all in all understanding how sustainable desalination can be in the context of the agriculture industry requires investigating and in turn mitigating these adverse impacts doing so however would not be possible through conventional assessment frameworks as this is by nature a multi faceted problem as it would effectively influence society in various ways this more than anything goes to show that when it comes to desalination it might be time to abandon and move on from this outdated and arguably misleading binary perception about this practice rather the concept is multi dimensional intricate and intertwined with so many aspects of our modern day life as such it might be borderline impossible to summarize or limit the impact of such practices by simple labels of being good or bad as was demonstrated here reinterpreting this matter under the umbrella of the cwef security nexus would perhaps provide a more realistic and applicable idea about the merits and drawbacks of this technology within the context of the agriculture industry reevaluating the performance of desalinated water for irrigation purposes using the cwef security nexus would unveil that while there are indeed issues in this practice that require to be addressed promptly and adequately the potential contribution of this technology lies in the bigger picture of its contribution to the food water and climate change crises one should note that over the years different mitigation strategies have been proposed to mitigate the adverse impacts of desalination these are either prophylactic in nature or tend to have a more corrective approach in light of the cwef security nexus selecting the right combination of these strategies can be a practical way to mitigate these problems on a case by case basis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper 
8879,over the years desalination has become integral to water resources management primarily in coastal semi arid to arid regions while desalinated seawater has mainly been supplied to municipal and high revenue industries the agriculture sector faces increasing irrigation demands making it a potential user this review assesses the sustainability of using desalinated seawater for irrigation shedding light on its limitations and potential using desalinated water for irrigation presents challenges including its high energy consumption potential contribution to climate change and agronomy related concerns however evidence suggests that these challenges can be addressed effectively through tailor fitted strategies that said conventional binary decision making paradigms that label practices as good or bad and focus on a singular isolated aspect are insufficient for evaluating the sustainability of desalination due to the complex and interconnected nature of the issues involved to overcome this the climate water energy food cwef nexus concept is proposed as a comprehensive framework for sustainability assessment adopting the cwef nexus approach allows for a better understanding of the potential challenges associated with using desalinated water for irrigation encompassing social economic and environmental concerns to ensure effective management of these challenges it is crucial to tailor desalination projects to specific regional conditions and employ either prophylactic or corrective strategies by embracing the cwef nexus approach informed decisions can be made regarding the future utilization of desalinated water for irrigation contributing to broader sustainability goals keywords desalination irrigation water resources management water crisis climate water energy food nexus data availability no data was used for the research described in the article 1 introduction while recently gathered data suggest a notable decline in worldwide fossil fuel production these resources most notably oil and coal are still dominating the energy market by a considerable margin it is estimated that fossil fuels accounted for more than 81 of world energy production in 2019 similar to the value reported in 2018 iea 2021 in addition to the adverse environmental impacts of resorting to these resources due to greenhouse gas ghg emissions the alarming dependency on fossil fuels signals a developing energy crisis as these resources are by nature non renewable all in all continuing this trajectory would create devastating future socio economic and environmental problems on the other hand global hunger levels remain alarmingly high and the world continues to struggle with an ongoing food crisis it is estimated that in 2021 nearly 193 million individuals faced the challenges of acute food insecurities and required immediate assistance across 53 countries territories a tragic all time high record that captures the sheer magnitude of the impending food crisis fsin 2022 given the stresses on the global food system the frequency and severity of the said crisis are expected to rise in the upcoming years puma et al 2018 lastly an ongoing water crisis has been looming over the world for quite some time now one of the most notable roots of this problem is that the global water demand has been steadily increasing over the years and is expected to continue the said trajectory ritchie and roser 2017 of course one should consider that water is not distributed evenly throughout the globe leaving some regions with less accessibility to readily available water resources as a result regions such as the middle east have been struggling with an ongoing water crisis which is expected to be exacerbated by the adverse impacts of climate change bozorg haddad et al 2020 the looming crises raise challenges for the agriculture industry as stated the challenge of reliable food production most notably in semi arid and arid regions coupled with the ever increasing demand for new food products drives the industry to expand its operations including extended use of water for irrigation valipour and singh 2016 doing so would pressure the already vulnerable water sector furthermore accessing new water resources can be an energy demanding procedure that may induce further stress on the energy sector kenway et al 2011 climate change is projected to complicate the situation even further as not only does it directly impact the agriculture sector but it can also affect and be affected by solutions to the water and energy crises zolghadr asli et al 2019 this situation is direr in semi arid to arid regions where lack of water has already taken its toll on the water food and energy sectors in light of all these crises over the years desalination has emerged as a reasonable practice to secure water resources most notably in semi arid and arid regions by convention desalination is defined as the process of removing dissolved solids such as salts and minerals from water kucera 2019 in addition to its prominent role in augmenting water resources what distinguishes desalinated water from other conventional alternatives is that it can buffer natural hydro climatic volatility making water resources management relatively independent from the hydrological cycle as such desalination has been playing a vital role in the current landscape of water planning and management including and perhaps most notably meeting municipal water demands since the 1960s angelakis et al 2021 for the most part on a global scale use of desalinated water in the agriculture industry has been limited as such while a good deal of experience and knowledge has been accumulated collectively about applying desalination to meet municipal demands the same cannot be said about application to the agriculture sector in fact at the moment based on currently available data the only countries committed to this practice under a nationwide and publicly supported program at a notable scale are spain and israel martin gorriz et al 2021 the application of desalinated water in the spanish agriculture sector dates to 1995 when a private desalination plant was installed to guarantee the irrigation requirements of the mazarrón irrigation district martínez alvarez et al 2018 in 2004 however the spanish government committed to a long term plan to invest in desalinated water for the agriculture industry martínez alvarez et al 2018 navarro 2018 as for israel while the country had been contemplating using desalinated water for irrigation since the mid 1960s 2006 marks the milestone in which the nation committed to a long term plan to support this practice lahav and birnhack 2007 that said it should be noted that given current circumstances and projected challenges in the water and food industry other regions including australia chile china egypt saudi arabia and the united states are entertaining the idea of implementing desalination for the agriculture industry lattemann et al 2010 martínez alvarez et al 2018 in light of the impending crises stated earlier it is critical to understand the potential role of desalination in the agriculture industry in particular for irrigation purposes significant relevant research has been undertaken in the last decade or so to shed light on this subject e g burn et al 2015 martínez alvarez et al 2016 kumar et al 2018 notwithstanding the necessity and value of such research what is lacking in such analyses is the acknowledgement and in turn exploration of the multifaceted nature of the problem furthermore any attempt to investigate this topic without exploring the impacts of climate change is arguably moot with this in mind through the concept of the climate water energy food cwef nexus the current review aims to provide a fresh and more holistic approach to interpreting the role of desalination within the context of the agriculture industry similar to the well established water energy food wef nexus the underlying concept of the cwef nexus is to emphasize the interconnectedness of water energy food and in this case climate security this paradigm of thinking has played a vital role in contemporary sustainable water planning and management e g duan et al 2019 qin et al 2022 cwef based frameworks have been used to evaluate the merits and drawbacks of water management techniques e g sun et al 2020 ren et al 2022 this can ultimately help decision makers and engineers better understand the nexus and what the future may hold should large elements of the agriculture industry resort to desalination as a new water resource ultimately this review aims to explore how sustainable desalinated water can be within the context of the agriculture industry which from this point onward exclusively refers to the irrigation practices that rely on desalinated water unless explicitly stated otherwise 2 role of desalination from the water resources angle in order to evaluate the potential future role of desalination in the agriculture industry it is crucial to understand its current role in water resources management generally speaking the practice of desalination has been expanding steadily on a global scale as can be seen in fig 1 the industry is showing a steady growth both in terms of installed desalination plants and overall capacity that said because water resources and socio economic conditions vary from region to region so has the development of desalination projects as can be seen in fig 2 the middle east region 47 5 alone accounts for the majority of available global capacity for desalination with north america 14 9 and southern and western europe 10 0 being the next biggest investors as well as varying between regions the reliance on desalination varies drastically from one sector to another based on kucera 2019 fig 3 depicts each sector s relative share of desalinated water globally in 2015 the municipal 60 and industry 28 sectors are by a considerable margin the most notable users these uses dwarf irrigation related water demands which account only for 2 of desalinated water globally given the ever increasing water demands of the agriculture sector and the ongoing water crisis one can surmise that these numbers are going to change as such it would not be unexpected to see more countries incorporate desalinated water in their agricultural systems similar to previous developments in spain and israel however as we will explore in the upcoming sections some pressing matters most notably environmental and economic concerns could potentially delay or halt such long term commitments 3 a closer look at desalination from the energy sector perspective the water and energy sectors are interconnected on various levels to the point that addressing the issues of one sector without at least considering the other sector is impossible zolghadr asli et al 2019 while water is actively contributing to the energy sector for example through fuel extraction and processing operations thermoelectric cooling and hydropower generation the energy sector is providing power to run the water sector extraction distribution conveyance and wastewater collection and treatment are merely examples of how the water sector relies heavily on the energy sector saleh et al 2019 the reliance of water supply on energy supply is particularly pronounced in the desalination industry the energy demands of desalinated water relate to how and where it is used with additional pre and post treatment processes generally required to ensure water quality standards can be met and in some cases pumping of the product over considerable distances and elevation gains is also required studies suggest that on average desalination requires four times as much energy as water produced in water reuse plants ten times as much energy as a traditional treatment for surface water and nearly twenty times more energy than pumping groundwater mcevoy and wilder 2012 as a result reliance on desalination exposes water sellers and buyers to the energy market s notorious volatilities hussey and pittock 2012 tubi and williams 2021 furthermore the energy consumption of desalinated water supply could in turn be ultimately reflected in ghg emissions in response to the economic and environmental disadvantages of desalinated water supply there has been a gradual decline in the power consumption of desalination units over the years fig 4 for instance depicts how the power consumption of seawater reverse osmosis ro desalination units currently the most relevant and efficient technology available in the market has improved over time the power demand for such units ranged from 10 to 16 kwh m3 to today s state of the art ro units that require approximately 3 5 kwh m3 baten and stummeyer 2013 palmer 2015 kim et al 2019 ideally the ultimate goal would be to cut down the energy consumption of the desalination units as much as possible it should be noted however that there is a minimum theoretical limit as desalination is fundamentally energy demanding based on thermodynamic principles for instance the theoretical energy requirement for an ro unit that desalinates seawater with total dissolved solids of 35 000 ppm and with temperature 25 c assuming 50 energy recovery is approximately 1 06 kwh m3 baten and stummeyer 2013 palmer 2015 the stated value is of course based on pure theoretical conditions and in practice often we cannot achieve this level of efficiency furthermore incorporating pre and post treatment measures to enhance water quality for a specific sector would increase this power consumption in the agriculture sector this may include reducing the concentration of phytotoxic elements such as boron and chloride or reintroducing nutrition elements back to the water based on data gathered in spain and israel such additional power consumptions are estimated to range between 0 50 and 0 77 kwh m3 which brings the total energy consumption of state of the art large seawater desalination units that supply the agriculture sector to somewhere between 2 9 and 4 3 kwh m3 martínez alvarez et al 2018 from a planning and management perspective a practical approach to reducing energy consumption of the desalination process is to optimize its planning design layout and operation for instance knowing that larger desalination units can be more energy efficient martínez alvarez et al 2019 having a clear long term plan about water requirements including possible expansion to include the demands of different parties and perhaps even different sectors while planning and designing these systems can help increase their overall energy efficiency it should also be noted that a significant amount of energy infrastructure and water supply infrastructure is required to power desalination and transport water in and out of the desalination units denicola et al 2015 as such optimally locating the units with respect to the water source and the end user can significantly reduce both capital cost and energy requirements maintenance of the system is another way to uphold energy performance of these units over their operation horizon lapuente 2012 cornejo et al 2014 leon et al 2021 nevertheless the most notable principal factor determining a desalination unit s energy consumption is the core technology used for the desalination process since thermal process based technologies such as multi effect desalination med and multistage flash msf fundamentally require large amounts of thermal energy ro is often cited as the most energy efficient technology leon et al 2021 incorporating energy recovery devices e g isobaric chambers and positive displacement pumps in general is another alternative that can ultimately help offset the overall energy consumption of desalination units lapuente 2012 cornejo et al 2014 leon et al 2021 recent advancements in the desalination industry may also open the door to a whole new approach for energy conservative desalination though still in the testing phase state of the art technologies such as nanomembranes or batch desalination may be the key to a more efficient process palmer 2015 a complementary way to address the challenges associated with the energy consumption of the desalination industry is to take a critical look at the energy supply that is employing a more environmentally friendly and possibly cheaper energy resource reportedly global use of renewable energy has experienced a 3 increase in 2020 while demand for all other fuels has declined iea 2021 it was estimated that the share of renewable energy resources in global electricity generation in 2020 was around 29 iea 2021 while renewable energy resources are markedly perceived as more environmentally friendly than fossil fuels as they have less ghg emissions they are considered to be expensive for large scale industrial applications this notion has been challenged recently pistocchi et al 2020 studies show for instance that commercial implementation of renewable energy to run large scale desalination units could be considered economically feasible should fossil fuel subsidies be removed from the equation baten and stummeyer 2013 currently the most notable practical attempts to address this issue take advantage of a hybrid format where both fossil fuels and renewable energy alternatives are simultaneously used to power a desalination unit tubi and williams 2021 many options are available for linking renewable energy sources and desalination technology scalability costs suitability to specific climatic and environmental conditions and feedwater quality are the main factors that help decide the most fitting option the most common renewable and carbon dioxide free energy resources implemented in the desalination industry are geothermal nuclear solar wave and wind kucera 2019 among these options currently solar based desalination is the most prevalent the relative predictability of sunshine makes this option easier to plan and manage than alternatives like wave or wind power leon et al 2021 furthermore it is becoming progressively more affordable to implement at larger scales pistocchi et al 2020 though it has been under development since 1982 wind energy is mainly used to power relatively small scale ro units kucera 2019 similarly wave energy is usually paired up with small scale ro desalination units palmer 2015 naturally the latter approach is deemed more suitable for near coastline cities for example it has been employed in perth australia palmer 2015 nuclear energy can also be used as a carbon dioxide free energy source belessiotis et al 2010 often this is paired with thermal desalination technology and it is estimated that by doing so one can reduce the ghg of the desalination process by up to 90 kucera 2019 geothermal energy is another renewable energy source that can directly power a thermal desalination unit or indirectly provide the electricity needed for ro units kucera 2019 similarly solar power can be coupled with thermal desalination units using solar stills solar multi effect humidification meh or concentrating solar plant multi effect distillation csp med the other option is to convert solar radiation into electric energy using semiconducting materials in the form of photovoltaic pv panels rothwarf and böer 1975 with photovoltaic reverse osmosis pv ro and photovoltaic electrodialysis pv ed being the two main approaches while these are considered to be promising technologies one of the known drawbacks of pv based desalination is the high cost of pv cells and batteries for electricity storage kucera 2019 all in all replacing conventional resources with desalinated water in the agriculture sector solely from the energy side of things may impose additional challenges including economic and environmental concerns that said there seem to be some strategies that can mitigate or perhaps resolve these issues altogether substituting fossil energies with renewable and carbon dioxide free energy resources for instance can be a game changer for the sustainability of irrigating with desalinated water with these in mind it is time to evaluate the practice of desalination within the context of the food and agronomic sector it should be noted that the scope of this review was limited to the application of desalinated water for agronomic purposes and more specifically the irrigation of crops due to its immense role as one of the primary food supplies around the world as such from this point onward the terms agriculture and agronomy solely refer to crop farming and the practice of irrigation unless explicitly stated otherwise 4 a closer look at desalination from the food and agronomy sector when it comes to implementing desalination technology to meet agricultural water demand the most significant incentive is the opportunity it provides to expand agronomical activities and in turn increase food production in light of the ongoing food production deficiency markedly in semi arid and arid regions this in and of itself could be a compelling enough argument to at least entertain this idea despite this relying on desalinated water for irrigation purposes is a more limited practice but has been attracting more attention in the last two decades as a result some of the mid to long term impacts of this practice are still unclear that said reportedly this practice could cause some concerns and has done so in some cases broadly speaking the potential agronomic concerns are lack of essential nutrients phytotoxicity of chemical components such as boron b chloride cl and sodium na risk of soil sodicity and low alkalinity and buffering capacity of the said water martínez alvarez et al 2016 these potential issues could be in turn reflected in the crop quality crop yield and plants disease resistance however the potential for such impacts depends on multiple factors and ultimately needs to be determined on a case by case basis before diving into the agronomic concerns about irrigating with desalinated water it is essential to appreciate why such concerns could arise in the first place often the desalinated water from ro units is associated with a total dissolved solids concentration tds below 250 mg l very low hardness and buffering capacity and an acidic ph martínez alvarez et al 2016 these conditions are not quite suitable for most agricultural related applications and can even be aggressive towards the materials used in the distribution and conveyance systems martínez alvarez et al 2018 the general quality of the feedwater and desalination technology dictates the chemical composition of the desalinated water that said predominate minerals in desalinated water are na and cl ions with a very low concentration of other elements such as calcium ca magnesium mg sulfate so4 as well as high concentration of boron b martínez alvarez et al 2016 while some of these elements can potentially cause phytotoxicity at high concentrations the concentrations in water treated by ro tend to be so low that it lacks the nutrition components necessary for the plant growth and productivity what is also crucial to note here is that desalination not only removes the undesirable minerals from the feedwater but also somewhat separates most minerals with an ionic charge some of which have nutritional value for the plants furthermore elements with no ionic charge such as b found with high concentrations in seawater would easily pass the membrane with little to no filtration therefore determining the agronomic impacts depends on the quality of the desalinated water relative to alternative sources for instance studies revealed that using desalination could be agronomically beneficial in a region in israel where generally the quality of water that was replaced with desalinated water was relatively poor martínez alvarez et al 2016 other studies arrived at the opposite conclusion for a region in southeast spain where the conventional resources used prior to desalinated water were of high quality martínez alvarez et al 2018 the relation of crop growth to quality of the source water also depends on type of irrigation practice local climate soil condition and crop type crop type is a crucial factor that determines how a given plant would react to desalinated water fig 5 for instance shows how different plants would generally react to b and salinity soil type is another key factor for instance soils with high clay content are more prone to sodicity hazards martínez alvarez et al 2018 the irrigation practice is another element that needs to be taken into consideration cl and na for instance can cause a more pronounced problem should one use sprinkler irrigation as these elements can be absorbed directly through the leaves markedly during periods of high temperatures and low humidity bernstein 1975 hydro climatic conditions of a region can also be a decisive factor for instance higher feedwater temperature would result in a higher b passage rate martínez alvarez et al 2016 higher precipitation rates as another example can enhance the tolerance for salinity in the irrigation water as the soil in such regions is exposed to a natural leaching process martínez alvarez et al 2018 all in all desalinated water solely from the agronomic side of things appears to be a suitable choice to meet the ever increasing water demands of the agriculture sector that said resorting to desalinated water for irrigation could have adverse agronomic side effects varying from one case to another this sheds light on the importance of regional and even local studies on the agronomical impacts of desalination however it is essential to note that observing the full effect of such practice on crop quality and yield may take a while as was demonstrated by silber et al 2015 however before reaching the overall verdict with regard to the permissibility of desalination in the context of the agriculture industry it is crucial to look at the last piece of the puzzle which is how this practice would influence and be influenced by climate change 5 climate change and desalination there is staggering scientific evidence to prove that human activities have altered global climate over the years most notably a steady upward trend in the global average temperature with a rate unprecedented in the last two millennia ipcc 2021 in fact thanks to the recent advancements in paleoclimate data assimilation new studies were able to demonstrate that indeed one of the primary drivers of the global temperature variability within the last 24 millennia was ghg emissions osman et al 2021 through tampering with the hydrologic cycle climate change is altering the status quo of water resources worldwide that said how these alterations are manifested varies from region to region zolghadr asli 2017 with that in mind the general perception about the advent of these new hydro climatic patterns is that these changes may exacerbate the situation of water resources in semi arid and arid regions including the middle east which needless to say are already experiencing mild to severe water stress bozorg haddad et al 2020 forming a sustaining adaptation strategy has become one of the last lines of defense to ultimately secure the integrity of water resources enayati et al 2021 zolghadr asli et al 2021 in current context this introduces the question can desalination be genuinely seen as an adaptive strategy against the impacts of climate change addressing this question requires us to capture the dynamic and intricate relationship between desalination and climate change as stated desalination is in essence an intensive energy driven technology to augment conventional water resources heihsel et al 2019 notwithstanding the positive contribution of this practice to remedy the water and food crisis the fact that it is energy intensive implies that it can exacerbate global climate change a common approach to understanding how desalination or any human activity can contribute to climate change is to measure its cumulative ghg emission to that end scholars employ a metric called carbon footprint equivalent the carbon footprint equivalent of an activity often denoted by co2 eq is defined as the global warming effects of all the ghg emissions of that activity cornejo et al 2014 saleh et al 2019 note that the co2eq metric reflects both direct emissions say on site sources and indirect ghg contributions associated with the activity such as off site energy production production of raw materials and chemical components and fuels for a more detailed review of this subject interested readers are referred to cornejo et al 2014 in the context of climate change using the concept above each practice can be labeled as either a source or sink of ghg emission where the former contributes to amplifying climate change effects while the latter subtracts or mitigates such impacts the mainstream perception concerning the overall contribution of crop farming is that it can be seen as a sink of ghg emissions martin gorriz et al 2021 the implication is that this industry is in and of itself an adaptive way to alleviate the impacts of climate change that said introducing desalinated water for irrigation purposes could drastically change the narrative as the practice of desalination is generally a source of ghg emissions and as such can counterbalance the positive contribution of the agriculture industry the impact of desalination on the agriculture industry s ghg emission seems to vary from one case to another e g martin gorriz et al 2021 recent studies however suggest that generally most plant based agricultural practices can still be regarded as a sink for ghg emissions despite the negative impacts of desalination that said theoretically this practice can also present some potential nuances as desalination creates an augmented and reliable water source with often acceptable quality that can be used to expand the farmed areas or initiate new irrigation projects with more environmentally suitable and economically profitable crops theoretically speaking how and to what extent desalination can influence climate change is rooted in a series of factors including but not limited to desalination plant type pre and post treatment process irrigation practice system efficiency in terms of distribution and conveyance desalination plant size construction maintenance and operation of the system source and demanded water quality and hydro geographic conditions lyons et al 2009 fine and hadas 2012 cornejo et al 2014 saleh et al 2019 crop type is another decisive factor martin gorriz et al 2021 recent studies have illustrated how the type of crop can switch the irrigation from a sink to a source for ghg emission martin gorriz et al 2021 perhaps the most notable contributing factor is the energy source that fuels the entire process baten and stummeyer 2013 as explored earlier the transition into renewable energy based desalination plants could substantially reduce the carbon footprint of this practice making it practically a zero carbon footprint source for water resources pistocchi et al 2020 while the above narrative shows how desalination can influence climate change there is another side to this as climate change can also alter how desalination is perceived and practiced worldwide the most obvious and arguably predominant demonstration of this is rooted in how climate change alters the hydro climatic status quo the common perception is that climate change is exacerbating the water crisis in semi arid to arid regions e g bozorg haddad et al 2020 mubeen et al 2022 as the demand for a new reliable and sustainable source of water increases impacted societies would be more receptive toward the idea of desalination this has previously been observed to varying extends in australia israel spain and the united states feitelson and rosenthal 2012 williams 2018 tubi and williams 2021 some authors have even gone as far as saying that such shifts may have substantial geopolitical implications in the future creating a new socio political establishment that leans more heavily on coastal areas wolf 2009 on the other side of the spectrum of climate change impacts is flooding which is projected to become a more frequent and intense phenomenon this would in turn be induced as an additional source of risk to desalination infrastructure that needs to be accounted for often located near the shorelines desalination networks could also be exposed to additional risks as climate change projections signal a significant rise in sea levels denicola et al 2015 tubi and williams 2021 furthermore recent studies illustrated that the impacts of tsunamis are expected to be more devastating due to such projections for sea level rises sepúlveda et al 2021 another risk that could jeopardize the safety of coastal desalination infrastructure last but not least it is also crucial to note how the latest projections for climate change indicate that this phenomenon is adversely affecting marine life making this ecosystem more fragile than ever poloczanska et al 2013 this becomes exceptionally important within desalination practice as improper brine and sludge disposal could further amplify these vulnerabilities the outlook for the dynamic relationship between desalination and climate change is depicted in fig 6 all in all this section goes to show that climate is another potential factor that can influence and be influenced by the practice of desalination however the precise nature of this interaction is determined by various factors and as such requires to be studied on a case by case base 6 desalination sustainability reinterpretation within the context of climate water energy food nexus while previous sections demonstrated the potential for the application of desalinated water to irrigation they also shed light on some of the drawbacks of this practice thus far gathered experience shows that while any of the issues stated earlier can cause significant problems if not addressed correctly and in a timely fashion they are still for the most part manageable that is to say they are practical strategies available that can mitigate or even wholly address these negative impacts naturally the applicability of these strategies would need to be determined on a case by case basis however evaluating the effectiveness and suitability of these strategies would require a more comprehensive perspective that looks beyond conventional thinking exploring this topic and in turn evaluating these strategies can be done under the umbrella term of the climate water energy food cwef security nexus simply put the core idea here is that there is a complex interdependency and intertwined network between the water energy food and climate to the point that securing one would not be practical without addressing or considering other components zhang et al 2018 as a result a robust and sustainable planning and management paradigm often hinges on the cwef security nexus e g rasul and sharma 2016 enayati et al 2021 zolghadr asli et al 2021 similarly achieving sustainability within the context of incorporating desalinated water for irrigation purposes would require a decision making paradigm that accounts for the cwef security nexus the decision to evaluate the practice of using desalinated water for irrigation under a cwef nexus based decision making paradigm stems from the inherent complexity and interconnectedness of its components serrano tovar et al 2019 by introducing desalinated water for irrigation water deficits can be alleviated facilitating agricultural growth and increased food production however this comes with the trade off of heightened energy demand leading to higher operational costs and potential exacerbation of climate change through greenhouse gas emissions as discussed earlier utilizing desalinated water for irrigation purposes can help mitigate these adverse effects through selection of the right crop or opting for renewable energy resources martin gorriz et al 2014 caldera and breyer 2019 conversely climate change itself can impact water availability and agricultural productivity due to its influence on the hydro climatic cycle this abstract example highlights the necessity of comprehensively understanding and evaluating these intricate interactions to make sustainable decisions with long term effects generally speaking we have categorized strategies towards sustainable use of desalination for agriculture into two main classes namely prophylactic and corrective strategies strategies in the former category tend to prevent the problem before any meaningful impact appears these strategies are based on carefully tailored planning and management decisions that help optimize the system for specific conditions based on regional factors the idea is that the design layout and operation of desalination units and the desalination project in general could be customized to take advantage of unique environmental and local factors opting for a suitable desalination technology project site incorporating a cost effective energy source operating the system on the most suitable time slots to reduce the pressure on power grids or selecting the best environmentally friendly way to intake and discharge water are a few examples of passive strategies creating a monitoring and regular maintenance plan is another prophylactic approach to getting the best performance out of desalination units socio economic oriented strategies can also be seen as a prophylactic approach to addressing inherent problems of using desalination for irrigation purposes as stated for instance one of the most pressing issues when it comes to desalination in general is that it is often considered a much pricier alternative markedly in less developed regions than most conventional water resources lattemann et al 2010 pistocchi et al 2020 as such expanding the application of desalinated water to agriculture may not be attractive because there is less immediate urgency than for municipal supplies and the profit margins are far less lucrative than some industrial applications however revisiting the issue from a cwef security nexus angle would bring a whole new dimension to the urgency of this situation while it is true that the profitability of this practice at least on a local scale may not be able to compete with conventional resources it is also crucial to factor in the agriculture industry s role in the context of impending water and food crises the idea is that maintaining a consistent source of food production in the agriculture industry is becoming more difficult as time goes by establishing a subsidy mechanism would help desalination for the agriculture sector become more luring as an economically formidable option pistocchi et al 2020 it is also important to note that solely from a socio economic standpoint incorporating desalinated water for irrigation could be lucrative as it can bring a new source of revenue to the community by creating new job opportunities or increasing the income of previously established ones with that in mind based on a trickle down economy school of thought a public funded tariff on desalinated water could balance things toward making this technology enticing enough for the agriculture industry similar to the situation in saudi arabia for urban use denicola et al 2015 or spain at a limited scale for irrigation purposes lapuente 2012 monterrey viña et al 2020 ricart et al 2020 nevertheless in light of the cwef security nexus establishing an effective subsidy requires careful planning that also accounts for the environmental impacts of the energy sector the point is that conventional energy sources can be a significant source of ghg emissions not to mention that the volatility of the energy market could cause even further complications investing in renewable energy as an alternative to power desalination units entirely or in a hybrid form could be a practical approach to mitigate the environmental impacts of desalination an outside the box alternative socio economic strategy would be to bring forth the concept of water markets the core principle here would be to look at water or energy for that matter as tradable economic entities as a way to offset both economic and or environmental costs that are generally associated with the practice of desalination as such each stakeholder in this case irrigators would be entitled to a certain amount of desalinated water these rights could then be traded among the stakeholders or sold to interested parties from other sectors these trades would be a mechanism for the irrigators to concentrate production in the most profitable locations and crops and reduce the environmental impacts by focusing the transfer of desalinated water to fewer sites trading the right to desalinated water such as the practice that has been executed in southeast spain on a very limited scale martínez alvarez et al 2016 aznar sánchez et al 2017 could be a creative way to mitigate the problems of desalination in the context of the agriculture industry resource recovery also referred to as seawater mining is the process of extracting valuable minerals from the seawater some scholars are of the opinion that resource recovery has the potential to offset the economic cost of desalination by introducing a new source of revenue that can be gained from selling these minerals diallo et al 2015 quist jensen et al 2016 loganathan et al 2017 as a result resource recovery can be technically seen as a passive socio economic strategy to accommodate the high cost of desalination the problem from a practical standpoint is that the available options for extraction are either monetarily high value yet with very low concentration e g au ag high concentration yet low financial value e g sea salt or low concentration with intermediate value e g cu li pistocchi et al 2020 perhaps some potentially viable candidates from an economic standpoint would be mg k and b which often have relatively high monetarily value and concentration though even mining these elements at least with current technology would not be economically justifiable for all cases pistocchi et al 2020 all in all it is often hard to generalize this strategy s economic value as it requires evaluation on a case by case basis logistic matters local markets and the intake seawater quality are among the many factors that dictate the financial appeal of this strategy in addition to the prophylactic strategies one could opt for a more hands on approach to tackle these problems the general theme in corrective strategies is to devise a tailored procedure to tackle a specifically targeted problem corrective strategies can be classified into two major classes namely on site and off site strategies there are three main categories when it comes to on site oriented strategies which are pre treatment in unit and post treatment plans the purpose of pre treatment regimens is often to enhance the intake water quality to a minimum pre required condition which is necessary to uphold the overall performance of the desalination unit removing solids from intake water is the most common pre treatment regimen in unit strategies basic idea is to enhance the performance or efficiency of the desalination unit often in terms of energy consumption or improving the desalinated water quality incorporating energy recovery e g isobaric chambers and positive displacement pumps is an effective active strategy to offset the overall energy consumption of desalination lapuente 2012 cornejo et al 2014 leon et al 2021 in some cases the chemical composition of the intake water contains a higher concentration of components that could be harmful to specific sectors for instance a common issue with utilizing seawater desalination for irrigation is the high concentration of phytotoxicity elements such as b cl and na martínez alvarez et al 2018 using multi pass ro is often a practical yet energy taxing way that has proven to help reduce the concentration of these elements to acceptable and harmless levels martínez alvarez et al 2016 2018 finally if need be the post treatment regimens are there to either minimize the adverse environmental impacts of desalination or enhance the quality of the desalinated water cost effectively in the former case a standard course of action is imposing more rigorous physical or chemical restrictions say using multi pass ro to enhance the quality of brine discharge which could mitigate the known negative impacts of desalting units on ecosystems and marine life another post treatment regimen for incorporating desalinated water for irrigation is reintroducing nutrients that are often lacking in desalinated water as a post treatment process these minerals most notably mg ca and so4 could be reintroduced to the desalinated water which can reinvigorate the said resource for agricultural purposes ben gal et al 2009 in contrast to on site treatment regimens where a corrective course of action would be selected at the desalination management level in off site strategies the consumers whether individually or perhaps collectively proactively attempt to make the desalinated water more suitable to their specific requirements within the realm of the agriculture sector the two known examples of these strategies are mixing different water resources to create a more suitable batch on site and adding fertilizers to account for lacking nutritional elements in desalinated water considering the often high cost of desalination in addition to improving the water quality for irrigation purposes the former strategy could also help reduce the overall cost of irrigation with desalinated water this however requires an on site monitoring system that tracks the chemical composition of desalinated water and an additional facility to mix the said water with the right proportion as was shown here evaluating the pressing issues of desalination individually would not be sufficient and may be an ineffective approach to resolving or mitigating the disadvantages of desalination reinterpreting these problems within the context of the cwef security nexus can however help justify the implication of desalination for agricultural purposes by shedding light on some hidden yet crucial angles of the problem all in all experiences in the past suggest that most if not all these problems are for the most part manageable if addressed in a proper and timely manner this means that if the right course of action is selected for a specific problem it is possible to maintain these adverse impacts to an acceptable level however the crucial thing to note here is that multiple factors often come into play making it rather impossible to render a solution acceptable for all cases and situations in other words like most water management problems a universally optimum solution may not exist and the best strategy must be determined on a case by case basis 7 concluding remark with the looming threats of water and food crises it is crucial to rethink how water resources management needs to adapt to emerging challenges desalination is an established way of alleviating the challenges of increasing water demand in the municipal sector primarily in semi arid to arid regions where water availability is a pressing problem gradually other sectors have started to adopt desalination as technological advances have made it more cost effective while the associated environmental issues have become better understood and better managed the agriculture sector has tentatively started to use desalinated water for irrigation purposes following the footsteps of israel and spain incorporating desalinated water for irrigation could become an enticing idea in the future as more regions started to entertain the idea of utilizing this resource in the agriculture industry while the outlook of this strategy in general seems to be positive for the most part there are some pressing issues when it comes to utilizing desalinated water for irrigation purposes for one this technology is by nature energy intensive which in turn makes this not quite enticing from an economic standpoint compared to conventional sources of water the other problem here is the ghg emissions associated with the energy consumption of this technology in addition to endangering the marine ecosystem and possibly spoiling the structure of the irrigated soil perhaps the most pressing environmental issue behind expanded use of desalination for irrigation is its potential role in exacerbating climate change all in all understanding how sustainable desalination can be in the context of the agriculture industry requires investigating and in turn mitigating these adverse impacts doing so however would not be possible through conventional assessment frameworks as this is by nature a multi faceted problem as it would effectively influence society in various ways this more than anything goes to show that when it comes to desalination it might be time to abandon and move on from this outdated and arguably misleading binary perception about this practice rather the concept is multi dimensional intricate and intertwined with so many aspects of our modern day life as such it might be borderline impossible to summarize or limit the impact of such practices by simple labels of being good or bad as was demonstrated here reinterpreting this matter under the umbrella of the cwef security nexus would perhaps provide a more realistic and applicable idea about the merits and drawbacks of this technology within the context of the agriculture industry reevaluating the performance of desalinated water for irrigation purposes using the cwef security nexus would unveil that while there are indeed issues in this practice that require to be addressed promptly and adequately the potential contribution of this technology lies in the bigger picture of its contribution to the food water and climate change crises one should note that over the years different mitigation strategies have been proposed to mitigate the adverse impacts of desalination these are either prophylactic in nature or tend to have a more corrective approach in light of the cwef security nexus selecting the right combination of these strategies can be a practical way to mitigate these problems on a case by case basis declaration of competing interest the authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper
