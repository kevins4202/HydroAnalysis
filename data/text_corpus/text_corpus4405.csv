ships mass have become increasingly interesting for the commercial maritime sector as an alternative to conventional ships compared with conventional ships or fully manned ships mass show diverse advantages ramos et al 2019b for instance the cost weight and space can be saved due to the removing of the accommodation and deckhouse which in turn improves the capability of mass to carry more cargo moreover the number of piracy incidents can be reduced because the crew cannot be used as ransom leverage besides mass have great impact on the greener shipping reducing energy consumption or even operating on battery or fuel cells in 2015 lloyd s register qinetiq and southampton university published the report entitled global marine technology trends 2030 gmtt2030 lloyd s 2015 the report presents the results of a set of foresights into global marine technology trends and their implications for the marine world in the year 2030 among which smart ships are widely debated as the shipping industry s next technological revolution international maritime organization imo has promulgated regulations pertaining to mass and plans to complete the regulatory scoping exercise by 2020 zhu et al 2019b in case of mass the autonomy is specified into four levels which are l1 ship with automated processes and decision support l2 remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board l3 remotely controller ship without seafarers on board and l4 fully autonomous ship imo hahn et al as seen the role of human operator is expected to be reduced obviously throughout the development of mass but it is realistic to assume that mass will require operators working in a shore control center scc ramos et al 2019b up to date many technical aspects relating to the development of mass operations such as risk modeling thieme et al 2018 risk assessment ramos et al 2019a collision avoidance ramos et al 2019b motion control e g control system configuration zubowicz et al 2019 trajectory tracking esfahani et al 2019 have attracted emphasizes from scientists for the purpose of simulation tests of mass operation techniques such as trajectory tracking and collision avoidance it is critical and essential to adopt a suitable ship dynamic model with efficient trade off between the accuracy and the complexity perez 2006 in fact the dynamic model used for conventional ships can also be applicable to mass due to the mechanism employed to analyze the dynamics is the newton s second laws of motion in case of conventional ships the models can be classified into four categories i e the abkowitz model the mathematical modeling group mmg model the vectorial representation model and the response model fossen 2011 for different regulations of motion control the selection of a preferable dynamic model is varying flexibly for example two nonlinear autopilot controllers designed based on a response model for mass were studied and compared in sharma et al 2014 in order to obtain a robust controller for course keeping luo and cong 2016 proposed a cascaded system by combining the dynamics of the rudder actuator with the dynamics of ship motion which was described by using a response model xu and guedes soares 2016 chosen a 2 dof sway yaw linear maneuvering model in the form of vectorial representation as control model for the path following controller design esfahani et al 2019 applied a 3 degree of freedom dof mathematical model to capture the nonlinear dynamics regarding surge sway and yaw motions of mass while investigating trajectory tracking issue apart from the task regarding the determination of the model structure parameters estimation involved in the structure is also of critical interest parameters estimation of ship dynamic models have been investigated in numerous studies in literature chen et al 2019 xu and guedes soares 2016 zhu et al 2019b in general four research directions of estimation methods are addressed in literature i e captive model test with planar motion mechanism rhee et al 2000 estimation with empirical formulas kawahara et al 2012 numerical calculation based on computational fluid dynamics cfd gokce and kinaci 2018 bonci et al 2015 and system identification in combination of full scale trails or free running model tests sajedi and bozorg 2019 chen et al 2019 comparatively system identification in combination with a free running model test or full scale trial is the most common and highest cost effective solution on parameters estimation of mass dynamic model various methods have been applied for parameter estimation or model identification of ships least square method ls is one of the most common approaches used to estimate parameters before intelligent algorithms appeared zhu et al 2017 however the drawbacks such as sensitivity to outliers overfitting and non consistent estimations are the barriers for the application of ls golub and reinsch 1971 in order to have a robust estimation some modified versions such as nonlinear ls nls fitting ls fls partial ls pls transformed multi innovation ls tmils and recursive ls rls have been developed to tackle the ill conditioned problem of ls for parameter estimation in marine domain in chen et al 2019 nls and fls were selected to identify the ship roll response model in shallow water for comparing and analyzing to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed identification method sun and sun 2013 proposed pls to process the estimation of nonlinear roll damping coefficients in case of tmils zhang et al 2015 applied it with the coefficient of correlation for the identification of a 4 dof ship maneuvering model with the full scale trail data extracted from vessel yukun in mu et al 2018 the rls was successfully adopted to identify the 3 dof dynamic model and the response model of a lanxin usv by using the data stemmed from a series of zigzag maneuvers in recent years the majority of efforts are committed to developing advanced system identification techniques to develop a highly effective parameter estimation method to deal with identification of the 4 dof surge sway yaw roll mmg model araki et al 2012 combined the extended kalman filtering and constrained ls using generalized reduced gradient algorithm together to be the system identification technique several experimental fluid dynamic efd ship maneuvers in calm water system based and cfd free running trials were adopted to verify and validate the identification performance of the proposed technique results shown the parameters estimated by the constrained ls using combined cfd free running trial data has the most generalized outcomes covering a wide range of maneuvers wang et al 2015 proposed the generalized ellipsoidal function based fuzzy neural network gebf fnn to model the dynamics in 3 dof for a large tanker esso osaka 190000 dwt tanker the effectiveness and superiority of gebf fnn was demonstrated through simulation studies on typical benchmark scenarios i e zigzag maneuvers with moderate and extreme steering a genetic algorithm ga based identification method in combination with ranse computation was investigated by bonci et al 2015 to estimate parameters of practical ship maneuvering models through the test case of a rather slender twin screw and two rudders ship chen et al 2018 improved the maximum likelihood method by introducing a new likelihood probability formula to realize the parameter estimation of a 3 dof nonlinear dynamic model for the underwater unmanned aerial even the ship in hou et al 2018 a nonparametric identification method developed by combining random decrement technique rdt and support vector regression svr was used to identify the roll motion mathematical model with the use of random rolling responses of the ship in irregular waves as can been seen the parameters of the dynamic models are assumed to be fixed without any perturbations perera et al 2015 considered the unstructured uncertainties associated with the modified steering model while applying extended kalman filter ekf to execute the model identification the measurement noises are assumed to be white noises sutulo and guedes soares 2014 developed an identification method based on the classic ga and five different metrics including the hausdorff metric for distance measure where the white noise of various levels were considered in the process of evaluation of the proposed identification method and the results demonstrated the best performance of hausdorff metric associated with ga furthermore sutulo and guedes soares 2019 applied ga and artificial bee colony algorithms for the internal global optimization of the previously proven identification method with the use of hausdorff metric as previous studies the white noises are also taken into consideration for the verification and validation of the improved identification methods it can be found that these works only accounted the white noises to test the robustness of the proposed identification method but in reality there are existing parameter value differences between the actual and the nominal values of parameters for a ship which is caused by the unmodeled dynamic different operation conditions and environmental conditions sajedi and bozorg 2019 these parameter differences to some degree are also regarded as parameter uncertainties most of previous works on parameter estimation of ships rarely take the effects of parameter uncertainties into consideration sajedi and bozorg 2019 implemented the robust extended kalman filter rekf and the extended h infinity filter to estimate the nominal hydrodynamic coefficients of the diving model involving parameter uncertainties for the autonomous underwater vehicle auv the desirable performance of these filters were well demonstrated through both simulation study by using a model of a sample auv and experimental test of a real auv but either the rekf algorithm or the extended h infinity filter requires adequate definition of some parameters to formulate the uncertainties of the estimated parameters the identification of hydrodynamic coefficients of a typhoon class auv developed by the department of industrial engineering of the university of florence in italy was investigated using simulation tools and the experimental data coming from campaigns at sea by allotta et al 2018 and pugi et al 2018 these works on identification of dynamic models for the auv are also applicable to surface vehicles such as the mass we concerned in recent literature support vector machine svm based identification method and similar modified estimators like least squares svm ls svm xu and guedes soares 2016 moreno salinas et al 2013 nonlinear ls svm nls svm chen et al 2019 optimal truncated ls svm xu and guedes soares 2019 reference model svm rm svm mei et al 2019 ν svm wang et al 2019 and the references therein can be found xu and guedes soares 2016 estimated the nomoto time and gain constants with high accuracy by using ls svm integrating with linear kernel function where the regularization parameter was determined referring to the study luo et al 2016 by employing particle swarm optimization algorithm in chen et al 2019 a nls svm parametric identification approach for estimating unknown damping coefficients in shallow water is investigated and compared with nls and pls results shown the outperformance of the proposed method but the issue concerning the optimization of penalty factors and kernel factors of the nls svm model was left as future work xu and guedes soares 2019 proposed an optimal truncated ls svm to estimate the nondimensionalized coefficients of the 3 dof surge sway and yaw nonlinear maneuvering model compared with the ls svm the optimal truncated ls svm method reduces the dimensionality of the kernel matrix and avoids the costly matrix inversion operation by using the singular values decomposition the parameter uncertainty was addressed by the authors who also presented estimated parameters with a small uncertainty but successful reproduction of the pmm test extracted from the eu project shopera papanikolaou et al 2016 mei et al 2019 achieved the identification of 3 dof dynamic model for ships by employing the rm and similarity rule firstly to analyze and determine the nonlinear characteristics of the target ship and then using the linear svm adaptively to fit the error between acceleration variables of rm and the target ship the rm svm also regarded as a gray box framework identifying ship dynamic model was validated by the use of data from a benchmark ship so called kvlcc2 to alleviate the impact of noises induced problems such as parameter drift or overfitting on the model reliability wang et al 2019 presented the ν svm identification method which was further validated by simulated data polluted in three different levels to identify a 3 dof dynamic model the regularization parameter c of the developed method was set by adopting the method of grid search and cross validation and the hyper parameter ν was determined manually considering the computing efficient and sample data structure it can be found that the svm based identification methods present good performance on parameters estimation of ship dynamic models which to a high degree takes advantage of the irreplaceable characteristic aspects of svm zhu et al 2019a one aspect is that svm can work with a finite set of samples in addition its optimization problem is a convex problem generally solved by using the quadratic program qp through which the global and unique optimal solution can be guaranteed the third aspect of svm can be defined that the minimization of the structural risk promotes its generalization capability in the present study a robust identification method has been developed and tested strongly on both experimental measurements and artificial data including ones with uncertainties that are generated by using a response model with predefined parameter values in combination with monte carlo simulations the ship is considered as a plant with uncertain parameters the identification method is designed based on ls svr adaptive weight method aw artificial bee colony algorithm abc and the robust 3 α principle among which abc is served as the structural parameters optimizer for ls svr to improve its performance the present implementation is made for the response model as which is the most important actuation system under course keeping and course changing maneuvers perera et al 2015 in simulation tests the samples stemmed from maneuvers activated by means of step inputs are used for verification and validation of the proposed method in identifying the response model besides the simulation tests the experimental zigzag maneuvers of a real usv are applied for the identification purpose and demonstration of the consistency of the method in summary the main contribution of this study is the development of an effective solution based on ls svr to tackle a critical identification issue about how to provide relatively accurate results of the identification of mass dynamic model under consideration of the parameter uncertainties induced by several realistic aspects e g unmodeled dynamics different operation conditions environmental conditions and measurement noises the parameter uncertainties are widely existing in realistic situations but this identification problem was rarely investigated in identifying the dynamic models of surface vehicles except for the studies on auv in literature from the knowledge of authors on this important identification issue the proposed solution is the first effort to investigate the issue the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a mathematical presentation of the response model for mass and the ls svr regarded as the basis for the identification method development are introduced in the preliminary section 2 the development of the proposed parameter estimation approach in detail including the sample processing as well as the robust weighted ls svr is presented in section 3 in order to evaluate the proposed identification method section 4 conducts two kinds of case studies i e model identification of a sample ship in combination with monte carlo simulations and model identification of a real usv using experimental measurements finally concluding remarks are addressed in section 5 2 preliminary 2 1 ship response model the response model was proposed to analyze ship yaw motions by investigating the heading response of the ship with respect to the commanded rudder order which up to date mainly contains four versions involving the first and second order linear and nonlinear nomoto model fossen 2011 the first and second order linear model was firstly derived from a linear steering dynamic model describing interactions between sway and yaw motions by nomoto et al 1957 due to the nonlinearity of ship dynamics in the operation of a large rudder angle norrbin 1963 adjusted the model form by adding a nonlinear component analogously nomoto s second order model was also modified by adding a nonlinear term by bech and smitt 1969 these four kinds of nomoto models are still recognizable and widely used for guidance and control design due to its simple and effective structure and easy understanding sharma et al 2014 luo and cong 2016 considering the first order linear nomoto model is the most straightforward set we start introducing it to derive its nonlinear form the time domain function of the first order linear nomoto model is illustrated as 1 t r r k δ of which the transfer function can also be obtained to explain the relationship between the heading angle and the rudder angle due to r s s ψ s based on the first order nomoto model norrbin 1963 proposed the nonlinear version shown as eq 2 to make it applicable for the cases of big rudder defections 2 t r h n r k δ h n r n 3 r 3 n 2 r 2 n 1 r n 0 which results in a common expression of the first order nonlinear nomoto model as 3 t r n 3 r 3 n 1 r k δ where t is the steering time constant k is the rudder gain n 3 is the coefficient of the nonlinear item n 1 is a coefficient determined according to ship s stability of course i e n 1 1 for a course stable ship and n 1 1 for a course unstable ship what is more the nomoto maneuvering indices t k n 3 of this model are assumed to be uncertain 2 2 least square support vector regression algorithm least square support vector regression algorithm ls svr is proposed by suykens and vandewalle 1999 via modifying svm to work with equality constraints instead of inequality constraints and the quadratic deviation suppose the training dataset are given as t x 1 y 1 x l y l χ y l in which x i χ r d i 1 l are patterns and each pattern is a d dimensional real vector and y i i 1 l are outputs the regression problem is to find a hyperplane expresses by a function f x fitting all patterns with adequate margins the expression of the decision function f x is described as 4 f x w φ x i b w i t h w χ b r where w is the weight vector normal to the hyperplane b is the intercept φ is a nonlinear function used to map the patterns to a high dimensional feature space according to the principle of structural risk minimization the risk bound is minimized through the following optimization programming 5 min 1 2 w 2 c 2 i 1 l e i 2 s t y i w φ x i b e i where e i i 1 l are regression errors c is the regularization parameter controlling the trade off between the achievement of a low error on the training data and the minimization of the norm of the weights the lagrange formulation of the optimization problem is given as 6 l w b α e 1 2 w 2 c 2 i 1 l e i 2 i 1 l α i w φ x i b e i y i now the derivatives with respect to w b e i and α i are computed and set to be zero respectively 7 l w b α e w 0 w i 1 l α i φ x i l w b α e b 0 i 1 l α i 0 l w b α e e i 0 α i c e i l w b α e α i 0 w φ x i b e i y i 0 after straightforward computations to eliminate variables w and e i from eq 7 one obtains the solution 8 b α 0 1 l 1 t 1 l 1 ω c 1 0 y where α α 1 α l t 1 l 1 is the l 1 unit vector ω is the l l hessian vector of which the expression introducing kernel functions is ω i j φ x i t φ x j k x i x j y y 1 y l t the diagonal matrix c is presented as c d i a g 1 c 1 1 c l in application of the trick kernel the decision function yields 9 f x i 1 l α i k x i x b considering the response model is linear with respect to the parameters required to be estimated this study uses the linear kernel function given as 10 k x i x j φ x i t φ x j i j 1 l 3 parameter estimation method to identify the response model taking effects caused by parameter uncertainties into account an adaptive identification method with low sensitivity to the outliers is developed based on ls svr called dw lssvr for which d means outlier detection and w donates adaptive weight to defend the influences induced by the noises contaminated in samples especially the training data the robust α principle is introduced to detect and filter the outliers furthermore ls svr is combined with adaptive weight mechanism to mitigate its sensitivity to negative effects of outliers for identification of the response model samples extracted from ship maneuvers are preprocessing including samples construction and outliers detection 3 1 sample processing 3 1 1 construction of samples for identification to be convenient for computer simulation the response equation is discretized by applying the euler s stepping method and the nonlinear response model is converted into a linear regression model which is written in the form of a matrix 11 δ r k 1 θ z k where the left hand side terms of eq 11 is the variation of r at k 1 compared to the last time k θ represents the unknown parameter vector required to be identified according to the original equation of the response model k 1 and k are two coterminous moments the deviation of which donates the sampling interval represented by the variable δ t it can be observed that the unknown parameter vector θ is determined by the nomoto maneuvering indices therefore for the identification using ls svr based estimator the input and parameter vectors can be given as input vector θ δ t n 3 t t δ t t δ t n 1 k t parameter vector z k δ r k 3 δ r k δ δ k t after preparing the suitable construction of the samples the robust ls svr method can be used to estimate the unknown parameters of the response model the parameter n 1 can be determined in advance as section 2 1 addressed so the response model for specific ships can be obtained straightforwardly once the yaw rate and the actual rudder angle are available 3 1 2 detection of outliers given a dataset x k k 1 2 n calculating the mean of the variable x and the standard deviation s yields 12 x 1 n k 1 n x k s 2 1 n 1 k 1 n x k x 2 generally if the dataset does not contain any outliers the mean and variance of the sample would present a good estimation for data location and scatter however the sample mean and variance would drift seriously when the dataset was contaminated with outliers even a single out of scale measurement cui and yan 2009 to diminish the impacts of outliers on the dataset mean and standard deviation the robust estimation method is employed which is extremely effective in practice pearson 2002 in this method the median and the median absolute deviation instead of the mean and standard deviation are respectively calculated as follows 13 x m e d m e d i a n x 1 x 2 x n x n 1 2 n x n 2 1 n 2 s m a d 1 4826 m e d i a n x 1 x m e d x n x m e d where x m e d is the median of the dataset s m a d is the median absolute deviation of the dataset is the function of round down the 1 4826 is a constant set to ensure s m a d an unbiased calculation of the standard deviation for gaussian data additionally to propose the outlier detection algorithm the absolute error e a b s k of the k th variable x k is given as follows 14 e a b s k x k x m e d k 1 2 n consequently the procedure of the robust 3 σ principle based on the robust estimation method for outliers detection can be described in detail as follows 1 use eq 13 to calculate the median absolute deviation s m a d of the dataset 2 calculate the absolute error e a b s k for each variable via eq 14 3 compare e a b s k with 3 s m a d if e a b s k 3 s m a d then the variable x k is defined as the outlier and removed from the dataset otherwise step to k k 1 to do the previous comparison until k n 3 2 adaptive weighted least square support vector regression algorithm after processing the outliers detection it is assumed that the remaining dataset is l n e w calculated by removing the detected outliers n o l from the original dataset l in order to improve the performance of the lssvr based model parameter estimation the error variables e i i 1 l n e w of the previous ls svr can be weighted with weighting factors υ i i 1 l n e w which leads to the following optimization problem suykens et al 2002 15 min 1 2 w 2 c 2 i 1 l υ i e i 2 s t y i w φ x i b e i then the lagrangian becomes 16 l w b α e 1 2 w 2 c 2 i 1 l υ i e i 2 i 1 l α i w φ x i b e i y i by optimizing eq 16 and eliminating w e one acquires the karush khun tucker kkt system 17 b α 0 1 l 1 t 1 l 1 ω v c 1 0 y where α α 1 α l n e w t the diagonal matrix v c is presented as v c d i a g 1 c υ 1 1 c υ l n e w υ υ 1 υ l n e w t the outliers contaminated in the dataset can be detected through the robust 3 σ principle which can effectively decrease the computation but there are still some potential outliers unmarked existing in the dataset besides the performance of the above introduced weighted ls svr highly depends on the distribution of data noises comprehensively considering the adaptive weight method is proposed to dynamically adjust the weight of each error variable the concrete adaptive weight process is defined as follows 18 υ i 2 1 e e i t i 1 l n e w with 19 t m e a n t 1 t 2 t 1 m e d i a n e 1 4 l n e w 1 e 1 4 l n e w 2 e 1 2 l n e w t 2 m e d i a n e 1 2 l n e w 1 e 1 2 l n e w 2 e 3 4 l n e w e i s o r t e i i 1 2 l n e w in which e i is the i th sample error e i is the error sorted according to the ascending order of the sample error series t 1 t 2 are the partial robust estimation and t is the pseudo median of the sample errors one can see that the bigger the error of the sample datum is the smaller the weight is consequently the decision function for the system is 20 f x i 1 l n e w α i k x i x b as the linear kernel function was used in this work the estimations for the parameter vector θ can be obtained as 21 θ i 1 l n e w α i x i as mentioned above every x i is a d dimensional real vector herein d 3 according to the number of parameter vector θ in the end the unknown nomoto maneuvering indices of the response model can be calculated as 22 t δ t 1 i 1 l n e w α i x 2 i n 3 i 1 l n e w α i x 1 i i 1 l n e w α i x 2 i 1 n 1 1 o r 1 k i 1 l n e w α i x 1 i i 1 l n e w α i x 3 i δ t n 1 i 1 l n e w α i x 2 i 1 3 3 estimation procedure in identifying the response model for ships using the dw lssvr method the implementation is following the system identification procedure which majorly consists of four key components i e data collection model determination identification method and model validation ljung 2001 fig 1 presents the procedure of applying the optimal dw lssvr method to identify the response model more details of which are described as follows 1 data collection the data are collected from the optimal experiment which is designed sometimes based on the prior knowledge so that the recorded data are maximally informative as suggested by ljung 2001 the input used to generate training maneuvers to supply sufficiently informative data for identification should satisfy the persistence of excitation conditions for guaranteeing convergence and ensuring robustness properties of the identification method ideally the phase trajectories resulting from such maneuvers are ought to fill some sufficiently large domain in the state space for instance the pseudo random binary sequences prbs are rich enough and desirable choice to guarantee reliable estimation of all parameters involved in the model sutulo and guedes soares 2014 but prbs requires very long tests to achieve good loop filling what is more the desirable maneuvers are in fact not possible to be achieved and not simple to be executed with the standard means of control from the studies many researchers have done on the identification of ship mathematical models the standard zigzag maneuvers can be alternatives sutulo and guedes soares 2014 wang et al 2019 araki et al 2012 therefore in the simulation study the step input deriving data are used in a realistic situation referring to the field experiments the data acquired from a series of standard zigzag maneuvers are prepared according to the derived regression model eq 11 the data for each time step containing heading angle actual rudder angle and yaw rate are extracted from ship maneuvers and divided into two groups including training dataset for verifying identification idea and validation dataset for validating the generalization performance of the modeling method 2 model determination this step is usually the most challenging part of the identification procedure the best suitable model needs to be selected from a set of models or model structures by specifying within these models models are generally categorized into black box models and gray box models in the maritime domain such model sets for describing ship dynamics can be built based on the above introduced kinds of ship dynamic models in other words the models can also be called gray box models in the present study the model is referring to the response model 3 identification method the identification method is responsible for searching for and determining the best model the quality of the model is decided by assessing the performance of the model on reproducing the measured data the determination of the identification method is dependent on the model structure used for a model structure sometimes not only one method is useful this study proposes a robust identification method i e dw lssvr to work for identification optimization the collected data are filtered firstly via the outliers detection component as mentioned in literature about the application of svm based method for identification it is paramount to particularly set the value for the structural parameters such as the regularization parameter in ls svr due to the demonstration of the superior performance of artificial bee colony algorithm abc on solving global optimization problems over continuous space karaboga and akay 2009 banharnsakun et al 2011 it is used in this work on tuning structural parameters for the proposed identification method afterwards the corresponding input output pairs in eq 11 are brought into the optimization problem eq 16 in combination with abc to obtain the optimal solution after the optimal solution is acquired the identified model is derived from eq 22 4 model validation after the previous three steps the best model with a particular structure can be obtained but not determined yet because it remains to be tested whether it is good enough for the intended purpose i e model validation the validation of the modeling approach with a focus on the generalization performance can be executed by analyzing and comparing the predictions of the identified model and validation data that have not been used for identification 4 evaluation to prove the suitability of the response model identified using our proposed optimal dw lssvr identification method two case studies including a numerical simulation study on a sample rov zeefakkel ship unar and murray smith 1999 and a experimental study on a real usv are conducted fig 2 shows the holistic evaluation diagram which can be depicted concretely as follows firstly the first order nonlinear nomoto with known parameter values of the rov zeefakkel ship is used to simulate a series of zigzag maneuvers for which measurement noises and parameter varying perturbations are accounted after the identification procedure is finished 100 times random cycle of it in monte carlo simulation are executed to provide satisfactory identified response model for the sample ship following the simulation study several groups of experimental maneuvers of the usv generated in a ocean field are adopted in powerfully demonstrating the response dynamics modeling approach 4 1 simulation study on a ship in this subsection the feasibility of the proposed optimal dw lssvr method in identifying the response model is demonstrated by employing the model of the rov zeefakkel ship unar and murray smith 1999 whereby the particulars are set as follows length l 45 m nomoto maneuvering indices at a forward speed of 5 m s t 31 s k 0 5 s 1 n 1 1 n 3 0 4 rad 2 s 2 rudder deflection limitation δ 35 35 rudder rate limitation δ 7 simulation studies are presented in two phases i e model identification for the small ship using the proposed optimal dw lssvr approach and 100 times of monte carlo simulations of the above phase comparisons are made with the original simulated maneuvers and the optimal ls svr optimal d lssvr optimal w lssvr methods all simulation studies are carried out in an unified environment running matlab r2018b version with an intel r core tm i7 8565u 4 0 ghz cpu the time interval is chosen as δ t 0 5 s in this simulation study the initialization of abc is set to be same for cases as follows the bee size for employed bees is 30 so the onlooker bee is the number of sources is 30 l i m i t 35 which means the food source will be initialed when it does not update until l i m i t the maximum number of iteration is 30 the number of parameter needed to be optimized is 1 the search rang is in 1 0 2 1 0 10 4 1 1 model identification for a sample ship according to eq 3 the model input and output of the simulation are rudder angle δ and yaw rate r respectively considering the parameter uncertainties it is assumed that the nominal values of the nomoto maneuvering indices are assigned with 10 perturbation of the nominal values respectively measurement noises are imitated in the process of white noise with zero mean and covariance of 10 6 for the yaw rate and covariance of 10 4 for the actual rudder angle training data and validation data including a time series of input δ and output r for identification generated by activating the rov zeefakkel model using step inputs are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively following the previously introduced identification procedure the parameters of the response model are estimated which are listed in table 1 it reveals that the estimation error of parameter t from the optimal dw lssvr method is slightly bigger than the smallest one obtained from the optimal ls svr method but the others from the optimal dw lssvr method are smallest table 2 illustrates the computational costs of these four different optimal identification methods from which we can find that the cost of the optimal dw lssvr is slightly bigger with respect to the others e g the difference compared to the smallest one is only 0 0023 s it should be considered the additional cost of simultaneous execution of outliers detection and adaptive weighting in the optimal dw lssvr therefore it can be still concluded that the optimal dw lssvr provides more accurate estimation results in the identification of the response model for the ship with a relatively very similar and low computational cost in order to validate the generalization and prediction capabilities of the proposed identification method prediction results using models identified by these four optimal methods are shown in fig 4 from which it can be found that the response model identified by the proposed optimal dw lssvr method approximates well the validation maneuver with relatively high accuracy besides these four identification methods identify the response model well with training data but the optimal dw lssvr method outperforms over the other three methods since the prediction error index namely mse mean square error of actual errors between the predictions of the identified model and the validation data presented in table 3 is smallest 4 1 2 monte carlo simulation in order to well verify the effectiveness of the proposed identification method this work plans to run 100 times of the above subsection identification simulation by introducing the monte carlo simulation in each run a set of nomoto maneuvering indices is selected randomly within the 10 10 perturbation around the nominal parameter values meanwhile the measurement noises with different random values are also imitated and added to the simulated actual rudder angle and yaw rate after 100 times processing of identification a set of estimated nomoto maneuvering indices are obtained with the use of four different identification methods for which the mean and the standard deviation of estimation errors are listed in tables 4 5 where the nominal values and the mean estimated values of parameters are also presented by applying the mean estimated parameter values the predictions of the response model are visualized in fig 5 and compared with the validation data also used in the above subsection the mse is adopted to analyze the identification performance of these four identification methods which is 0 0807 2 s 2 for the optimal ls svr 0 1705 2 s 2 for the optimal d lssvr 0 0850 2 s 2 for the optimal w lssvr and 0 0547 2 s 2 for the optimal dw lssvr it can be seen from the identification results that all the four identification methods can provide satisfactory results due to the predictions are all in well agreement with the validation data but comparatively the optimal dw lssvr shows superior performance over the other three methods in terms of the estimated parameter values and mse it is noticeable that the estimated parameter k is much more precise than the other two estimated parameters but the estimated n 3 is less accurate when comparing the mean error comprehensively speaking the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed optimal dw lssvr method in the estimation of nominal parameter values from the uncertain model contaminated by measurement noises with high precision has been demonstrated from the simulation study results 4 2 experimental study on a usv experimental studies are also carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimal dw lssvr method in identifying the response model for a real usv fig 6 depicted the usv whose specifications are presented in table 6 it has one podded propeller driven by servo motor with which one can control its surge speed and heading the maximum rudder deflection is 3 5 the usv is equipped with sensors including a gps an imu a compass and a rudder indicator the imu and rudder indicators are used to respectively measure its yaw rate and actual rudder angle which are required to be extracted for the identification of the response model for the usv the experiments are conducted in the weihai of china under less than level 3 sea conditions a set of data including actual rudder angle and yaw rate are finally stemmed from several time series maneuvers carried out at a steady forward speed varying slightly around 2 5 m s for which the sampling time is 0 2 s samples obtained from 2 0 2 0 zigzag maneuver are classified as training data for identification methods training to achieve parameter estimates which are presented in fig 7 the rest 1 0 1 0 and 1 5 1 5 zigzag maneuvers provide data for identification validation all properties of the abc used as ls svr s structural parameters optimizer are set as same as the ones applied in previous simulation studies after applying the four optimal identification methods to estimate parameters of the response model for the usv the identification results including the parameter values computational costs of identification methods and validation errors are obtained which are recorded in table 7 the computational costs of these four identification methods are very close the biggest cost is 0 0345 s from the optimal dw lssvr method which has an acceptable fulfillment for the requirement of computational cost in engineering applications it is noticeable that the computational costs herein are lower than those in the above simulation study due to fewer samples the number of support vectors from samples in ls svr based identification methods is the main factor determining their computational complexity in addition it can be seen from table 7 that the predictions of these four identified models are very similar and correspondingly the mses are very small and close to each other additionally the trends of these predictions are close to the measurements even though the obvious fluctuations induced by the environmental disturbances and measurement noises of the measurements can be observed which implies the satisfactory performance of these four optimal identification methods on the other hand it indicates the importance of taking into account the uncertainties covering the parameter uncertainty and measurement noise of the nomoto maneuvering indices when undertaking model identification comparatively the proposed optimal dw lssvr method in identifying the response model for the usv ensures the most accurate estimates in terms of mse after obtaining the estimates of the response model for the usv it is of significant importance to validate the generalization ability of the identified model which can be investigated by analyzing the accuracy of the predictions of the identified model compared with the validation data with use of the samples which have not adopted in previous identification procedure fig 8 shows the predictions of yaw rate by transforming the actual rudder angle extracted from 1 0 1 0 and 1 5 1 5 zigzag maneuvers to these four response models identified by four different identification methods respectively comparing these four groups of predictions with the validation yaw rate it is straightforward to calculate the mses as listed in table 7 from the validation results it can be concluded that the trends of predictions are in acceptable agreement with the validation samples slight discrepancies between predictions and validation data can be observed but they are varying within the tolerable range which still demonstrates the effectiveness of the optimal identification approach in estimating parameters of the response model for the usv with consideration of parameter uncertainties and measurements noises it is deserved to be highlighted that values of n 3 estimated by these four identification methods have obvious differences but the predictions from these methods show an ignorable discrepancy which to some degree reveals that this parameter has a negligible impact on the identification and the predictions of motions of the usv 5 conclusions for preparing and testing a robust identification approach in identifying ship dynamic models for the development of mass a novel hybrid intelligent identification method is proposed based on ls svr abc adaptive weight trick and outlier detection technique which is further investigated in deeply through simulation study on a sample ship with known response model and experimental study executed using a real usv in weihai china in these studies being made more realistic measurement noises and parameter uncertainties caused by unmodeled hydrodynamic effects varying loading conditions and environmental disturbances such as wave currents wind are all taken into account to test the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimal dw lssvr method identification results demonstrate that the proposed optimal identification method can estimate the nomote maneuvering indices correctly more precisely the optimal dw lssvr shows superior estimation performance over the other three optimal methods including the optimal ls lsvr the optimal d lssvr the optimal w lssvr it also can be concluded that the application of the optimal dw lssvr in identifying ship dynamic model with parameter uncertainties and measurement noises is suggested to improve the estimation accuracy in fact the measurement noises derived from sensors and parameter uncertainties cannot be completely eliminated the forthcoming research point will be on remedying effects induced by these uncertainties for instance by introducing robust filters to power the capability of our current proposed optimal identification method and

ships mass have become increasingly interesting for the commercial maritime sector as an alternative to conventional ships compared with conventional ships or fully manned ships mass show diverse advantages ramos et al 2019b for instance the cost weight and space can be saved due to the removing of the accommodation and deckhouse which in turn improves the capability of mass to carry more cargo moreover the number of piracy incidents can be reduced because the crew cannot be used as ransom leverage besides mass have great impact on the greener shipping reducing energy consumption or even operating on battery or fuel cells in 2015 lloyd s register qinetiq and southampton university published the report entitled global marine technology trends 2030 gmtt2030 lloyd s 2015 the report presents the results of a set of foresights into global marine technology trends and their implications for the marine world in the year 2030 among which smart ships are widely debated as the shipping industry s next technological revolution international maritime organization imo has promulgated regulations pertaining to mass and plans to complete the regulatory scoping exercise by 2020 zhu et al 2019b in case of mass the autonomy is specified into four levels which are l1 ship with automated processes and decision support l2 remotely controlled ship with seafarers on board l3 remotely controller ship without seafarers on board and l4 fully autonomous ship imo hahn et al as seen the role of human operator is expected to be reduced obviously throughout the development of mass but it is realistic to assume that mass will require operators working in a shore control center scc ramos et al 2019b up to date many technical aspects relating to the development of mass operations such as risk modeling thieme et al 2018 risk assessment ramos et al 2019a collision avoidance ramos et al 2019b motion control e g control system configuration zubowicz et al 2019 trajectory tracking esfahani et al 2019 have attracted emphasizes from scientists for the purpose of simulation tests of mass operation techniques such as trajectory tracking and collision avoidance it is critical and essential to adopt a suitable ship dynamic model with efficient trade off between the accuracy and the complexity perez 2006 in fact the dynamic model used for conventional ships can also be applicable to mass due to the mechanism employed to analyze the dynamics is the newton s second laws of motion in case of conventional ships the models can be classified into four categories i e the abkowitz model the mathematical modeling group mmg model the vectorial representation model and the response model fossen 2011 for different regulations of motion control the selection of a preferable dynamic model is varying flexibly for example two nonlinear autopilot controllers designed based on a response model for mass were studied and compared in sharma et al 2014 in order to obtain a robust controller for course keeping luo and cong 2016 proposed a cascaded system by combining the dynamics of the rudder actuator with the dynamics of ship motion which was described by using a response model xu and guedes soares 2016 chosen a 2 dof sway yaw linear maneuvering model in the form of vectorial representation as control model for the path following controller design esfahani et al 2019 applied a 3 degree of freedom dof mathematical model to capture the nonlinear dynamics regarding surge sway and yaw motions of mass while investigating trajectory tracking issue apart from the task regarding the determination of the model structure parameters estimation involved in the structure is also of critical interest parameters estimation of ship dynamic models have been investigated in numerous studies in literature chen et al 2019 xu and guedes soares 2016 zhu et al 2019b in general four research directions of estimation methods are addressed in literature i e captive model test with planar motion mechanism rhee et al 2000 estimation with empirical formulas kawahara et al 2012 numerical calculation based on computational fluid dynamics cfd gokce and kinaci 2018 bonci et al 2015 and system identification in combination of full scale trails or free running model tests sajedi and bozorg 2019 chen et al 2019 comparatively system identification in combination with a free running model test or full scale trial is the most common and highest cost effective solution on parameters estimation of mass dynamic model various methods have been applied for parameter estimation or model identification of ships least square method ls is one of the most common approaches used to estimate parameters before intelligent algorithms appeared zhu et al 2017 however the drawbacks such as sensitivity to outliers overfitting and non consistent estimations are the barriers for the application of ls golub and reinsch 1971 in order to have a robust estimation some modified versions such as nonlinear ls nls fitting ls fls partial ls pls transformed multi innovation ls tmils and recursive ls rls have been developed to tackle the ill conditioned problem of ls for parameter estimation in marine domain in chen et al 2019 nls and fls were selected to identify the ship roll response model in shallow water for comparing and analyzing to illustrate the characteristics of the proposed identification method sun and sun 2013 proposed pls to process the estimation of nonlinear roll damping coefficients in case of tmils zhang et al 2015 applied it with the coefficient of correlation for the identification of a 4 dof ship maneuvering model with the full scale trail data extracted from vessel yukun in mu et al 2018 the rls was successfully adopted to identify the 3 dof dynamic model and the response model of a lanxin usv by using the data stemmed from a series of zigzag maneuvers in recent years the majority of efforts are committed to developing advanced system identification techniques to develop a highly effective parameter estimation method to deal with identification of the 4 dof surge sway yaw roll mmg model araki et al 2012 combined the extended kalman filtering and constrained ls using generalized reduced gradient algorithm together to be the system identification technique several experimental fluid dynamic efd ship maneuvers in calm water system based and cfd free running trials were adopted to verify and validate the identification performance of the proposed technique results shown the parameters estimated by the constrained ls using combined cfd free running trial data has the most generalized outcomes covering a wide range of maneuvers wang et al 2015 proposed the generalized ellipsoidal function based fuzzy neural network gebf fnn to model the dynamics in 3 dof for a large tanker esso osaka 190000 dwt tanker the effectiveness and superiority of gebf fnn was demonstrated through simulation studies on typical benchmark scenarios i e zigzag maneuvers with moderate and extreme steering a genetic algorithm ga based identification method in combination with ranse computation was investigated by bonci et al 2015 to estimate parameters of practical ship maneuvering models through the test case of a rather slender twin screw and two rudders ship chen et al 2018 improved the maximum likelihood method by introducing a new likelihood probability formula to realize the parameter estimation of a 3 dof nonlinear dynamic model for the underwater unmanned aerial even the ship in hou et al 2018 a nonparametric identification method developed by combining random decrement technique rdt and support vector regression svr was used to identify the roll motion mathematical model with the use of random rolling responses of the ship in irregular waves as can been seen the parameters of the dynamic models are assumed to be fixed without any perturbations perera et al 2015 considered the unstructured uncertainties associated with the modified steering model while applying extended kalman filter ekf to execute the model identification the measurement noises are assumed to be white noises sutulo and guedes soares 2014 developed an identification method based on the classic ga and five different metrics including the hausdorff metric for distance measure where the white noise of various levels were considered in the process of evaluation of the proposed identification method and the results demonstrated the best performance of hausdorff metric associated with ga furthermore sutulo and guedes soares 2019 applied ga and artificial bee colony algorithms for the internal global optimization of the previously proven identification method with the use of hausdorff metric as previous studies the white noises are also taken into consideration for the verification and validation of the improved identification methods it can be found that these works only accounted the white noises to test the robustness of the proposed identification method but in reality there are existing parameter value differences between the actual and the nominal values of parameters for a ship which is caused by the unmodeled dynamic different operation conditions and environmental conditions sajedi and bozorg 2019 these parameter differences to some degree are also regarded as parameter uncertainties most of previous works on parameter estimation of ships rarely take the effects of parameter uncertainties into consideration sajedi and bozorg 2019 implemented the robust extended kalman filter rekf and the extended h infinity filter to estimate the nominal hydrodynamic coefficients of the diving model involving parameter uncertainties for the autonomous underwater vehicle auv the desirable performance of these filters were well demonstrated through both simulation study by using a model of a sample auv and experimental test of a real auv but either the rekf algorithm or the extended h infinity filter requires adequate definition of some parameters to formulate the uncertainties of the estimated parameters the identification of hydrodynamic coefficients of a typhoon class auv developed by the department of industrial engineering of the university of florence in italy was investigated using simulation tools and the experimental data coming from campaigns at sea by allotta et al 2018 and pugi et al 2018 these works on identification of dynamic models for the auv are also applicable to surface vehicles such as the mass we concerned in recent literature support vector machine svm based identification method and similar modified estimators like least squares svm ls svm xu and guedes soares 2016 moreno salinas et al 2013 nonlinear ls svm nls svm chen et al 2019 optimal truncated ls svm xu and guedes soares 2019 reference model svm rm svm mei et al 2019 ν svm wang et al 2019 and the references therein can be found xu and guedes soares 2016 estimated the nomoto time and gain constants with high accuracy by using ls svm integrating with linear kernel function where the regularization parameter was determined referring to the study luo et al 2016 by employing particle swarm optimization algorithm in chen et al 2019 a nls svm parametric identification approach for estimating unknown damping coefficients in shallow water is investigated and compared with nls and pls results shown the outperformance of the proposed method but the issue concerning the optimization of penalty factors and kernel factors of the nls svm model was left as future work xu and guedes soares 2019 proposed an optimal truncated ls svm to estimate the nondimensionalized coefficients of the 3 dof surge sway and yaw nonlinear maneuvering model compared with the ls svm the optimal truncated ls svm method reduces the dimensionality of the kernel matrix and avoids the costly matrix inversion operation by using the singular values decomposition the parameter uncertainty was addressed by the authors who also presented estimated parameters with a small uncertainty but successful reproduction of the pmm test extracted from the eu project shopera papanikolaou et al 2016 mei et al 2019 achieved the identification of 3 dof dynamic model for ships by employing the rm and similarity rule firstly to analyze and determine the nonlinear characteristics of the target ship and then using the linear svm adaptively to fit the error between acceleration variables of rm and the target ship the rm svm also regarded as a gray box framework identifying ship dynamic model was validated by the use of data from a benchmark ship so called kvlcc2 to alleviate the impact of noises induced problems such as parameter drift or overfitting on the model reliability wang et al 2019 presented the ν svm identification method which was further validated by simulated data polluted in three different levels to identify a 3 dof dynamic model the regularization parameter c of the developed method was set by adopting the method of grid search and cross validation and the hyper parameter ν was determined manually considering the computing efficient and sample data structure it can be found that the svm based identification methods present good performance on parameters estimation of ship dynamic models which to a high degree takes advantage of the irreplaceable characteristic aspects of svm zhu et al 2019a one aspect is that svm can work with a finite set of samples in addition its optimization problem is a convex problem generally solved by using the quadratic program qp through which the global and unique optimal solution can be guaranteed the third aspect of svm can be defined that the minimization of the structural risk promotes its generalization capability in the present study a robust identification method has been developed and tested strongly on both experimental measurements and artificial data including ones with uncertainties that are generated by using a response model with predefined parameter values in combination with monte carlo simulations the ship is considered as a plant with uncertain parameters the identification method is designed based on ls svr adaptive weight method aw artificial bee colony algorithm abc and the robust 3 α principle among which abc is served as the structural parameters optimizer for ls svr to improve its performance the present implementation is made for the response model as which is the most important actuation system under course keeping and course changing maneuvers perera et al 2015 in simulation tests the samples stemmed from maneuvers activated by means of step inputs are used for verification and validation of the proposed method in identifying the response model besides the simulation tests the experimental zigzag maneuvers of a real usv are applied for the identification purpose and demonstration of the consistency of the method in summary the main contribution of this study is the development of an effective solution based on ls svr to tackle a critical identification issue about how to provide relatively accurate results of the identification of mass dynamic model under consideration of the parameter uncertainties induced by several realistic aspects e g unmodeled dynamics different operation conditions environmental conditions and measurement noises the parameter uncertainties are widely existing in realistic situations but this identification problem was rarely investigated in identifying the dynamic models of surface vehicles except for the studies on auv in literature from the knowledge of authors on this important identification issue the proposed solution is the first effort to investigate the issue the remainder of this paper is organized as follows a mathematical presentation of the response model for mass and the ls svr regarded as the basis for the identification method development are introduced in the preliminary section 2 the development of the proposed parameter estimation approach in detail including the sample processing as well as the robust weighted ls svr is presented in section 3 in order to evaluate the proposed identification method section 4 conducts two kinds of case studies i e model identification of a sample ship in combination with monte carlo simulations and model identification of a real usv using experimental measurements finally concluding remarks are addressed in section 5 2 preliminary 2 1 ship response model the response model was proposed to analyze ship yaw motions by investigating the heading response of the ship with respect to the commanded rudder order which up to date mainly contains four versions involving the first and second order linear and nonlinear nomoto model fossen 2011 the first and second order linear model was firstly derived from a linear steering dynamic model describing interactions between sway and yaw motions by nomoto et al 1957 due to the nonlinearity of ship dynamics in the operation of a large rudder angle norrbin 1963 adjusted the model form by adding a nonlinear component analogously nomoto s second order model was also modified by adding a nonlinear term by bech and smitt 1969 these four kinds of nomoto models are still recognizable and widely used for guidance and control design due to its simple and effective structure and easy understanding sharma et al 2014 luo and cong 2016 considering the first order linear nomoto model is the most straightforward set we start introducing it to derive its nonlinear form the time domain function of the first order linear nomoto model is illustrated as 1 t r r k δ of which the transfer function can also be obtained to explain the relationship between the heading angle and the rudder angle due to r s s ψ s based on the first order nomoto model norrbin 1963 proposed the nonlinear version shown as eq 2 to make it applicable for the cases of big rudder defections 2 t r h n r k δ h n r n 3 r 3 n 2 r 2 n 1 r n 0 which results in a common expression of the first order nonlinear nomoto model as 3 t r n 3 r 3 n 1 r k δ where t is the steering time constant k is the rudder gain n 3 is the coefficient of the nonlinear item n 1 is a coefficient determined according to ship s stability of course i e n 1 1 for a course stable ship and n 1 1 for a course unstable ship what is more the nomoto maneuvering indices t k n 3 of this model are assumed to be uncertain 2 2 least square support vector regression algorithm least square support vector regression algorithm ls svr is proposed by suykens and vandewalle 1999 via modifying svm to work with equality constraints instead of inequality constraints and the quadratic deviation suppose the training dataset are given as t x 1 y 1 x l y l χ y l in which x i χ r d i 1 l are patterns and each pattern is a d dimensional real vector and y i i 1 l are outputs the regression problem is to find a hyperplane expresses by a function f x fitting all patterns with adequate margins the expression of the decision function f x is described as 4 f x w φ x i b w i t h w χ b r where w is the weight vector normal to the hyperplane b is the intercept φ is a nonlinear function used to map the patterns to a high dimensional feature space according to the principle of structural risk minimization the risk bound is minimized through the following optimization programming 5 min 1 2 w 2 c 2 i 1 l e i 2 s t y i w φ x i b e i where e i i 1 l are regression errors c is the regularization parameter controlling the trade off between the achievement of a low error on the training data and the minimization of the norm of the weights the lagrange formulation of the optimization problem is given as 6 l w b α e 1 2 w 2 c 2 i 1 l e i 2 i 1 l α i w φ x i b e i y i now the derivatives with respect to w b e i and α i are computed and set to be zero respectively 7 l w b α e w 0 w i 1 l α i φ x i l w b α e b 0 i 1 l α i 0 l w b α e e i 0 α i c e i l w b α e α i 0 w φ x i b e i y i 0 after straightforward computations to eliminate variables w and e i from eq 7 one obtains the solution 8 b α 0 1 l 1 t 1 l 1 ω c 1 0 y where α α 1 α l t 1 l 1 is the l 1 unit vector ω is the l l hessian vector of which the expression introducing kernel functions is ω i j φ x i t φ x j k x i x j y y 1 y l t the diagonal matrix c is presented as c d i a g 1 c 1 1 c l in application of the trick kernel the decision function yields 9 f x i 1 l α i k x i x b considering the response model is linear with respect to the parameters required to be estimated this study uses the linear kernel function given as 10 k x i x j φ x i t φ x j i j 1 l 3 parameter estimation method to identify the response model taking effects caused by parameter uncertainties into account an adaptive identification method with low sensitivity to the outliers is developed based on ls svr called dw lssvr for which d means outlier detection and w donates adaptive weight to defend the influences induced by the noises contaminated in samples especially the training data the robust α principle is introduced to detect and filter the outliers furthermore ls svr is combined with adaptive weight mechanism to mitigate its sensitivity to negative effects of outliers for identification of the response model samples extracted from ship maneuvers are preprocessing including samples construction and outliers detection 3 1 sample processing 3 1 1 construction of samples for identification to be convenient for computer simulation the response equation is discretized by applying the euler s stepping method and the nonlinear response model is converted into a linear regression model which is written in the form of a matrix 11 δ r k 1 θ z k where the left hand side terms of eq 11 is the variation of r at k 1 compared to the last time k θ represents the unknown parameter vector required to be identified according to the original equation of the response model k 1 and k are two coterminous moments the deviation of which donates the sampling interval represented by the variable δ t it can be observed that the unknown parameter vector θ is determined by the nomoto maneuvering indices therefore for the identification using ls svr based estimator the input and parameter vectors can be given as input vector θ δ t n 3 t t δ t t δ t n 1 k t parameter vector z k δ r k 3 δ r k δ δ k t after preparing the suitable construction of the samples the robust ls svr method can be used to estimate the unknown parameters of the response model the parameter n 1 can be determined in advance as section 2 1 addressed so the response model for specific ships can be obtained straightforwardly once the yaw rate and the actual rudder angle are available 3 1 2 detection of outliers given a dataset x k k 1 2 n calculating the mean of the variable x and the standard deviation s yields 12 x 1 n k 1 n x k s 2 1 n 1 k 1 n x k x 2 generally if the dataset does not contain any outliers the mean and variance of the sample would present a good estimation for data location and scatter however the sample mean and variance would drift seriously when the dataset was contaminated with outliers even a single out of scale measurement cui and yan 2009 to diminish the impacts of outliers on the dataset mean and standard deviation the robust estimation method is employed which is extremely effective in practice pearson 2002 in this method the median and the median absolute deviation instead of the mean and standard deviation are respectively calculated as follows 13 x m e d m e d i a n x 1 x 2 x n x n 1 2 n x n 2 1 n 2 s m a d 1 4826 m e d i a n x 1 x m e d x n x m e d where x m e d is the median of the dataset s m a d is the median absolute deviation of the dataset is the function of round down the 1 4826 is a constant set to ensure s m a d an unbiased calculation of the standard deviation for gaussian data additionally to propose the outlier detection algorithm the absolute error e a b s k of the k th variable x k is given as follows 14 e a b s k x k x m e d k 1 2 n consequently the procedure of the robust 3 σ principle based on the robust estimation method for outliers detection can be described in detail as follows 1 use eq 13 to calculate the median absolute deviation s m a d of the dataset 2 calculate the absolute error e a b s k for each variable via eq 14 3 compare e a b s k with 3 s m a d if e a b s k 3 s m a d then the variable x k is defined as the outlier and removed from the dataset otherwise step to k k 1 to do the previous comparison until k n 3 2 adaptive weighted least square support vector regression algorithm after processing the outliers detection it is assumed that the remaining dataset is l n e w calculated by removing the detected outliers n o l from the original dataset l in order to improve the performance of the lssvr based model parameter estimation the error variables e i i 1 l n e w of the previous ls svr can be weighted with weighting factors υ i i 1 l n e w which leads to the following optimization problem suykens et al 2002 15 min 1 2 w 2 c 2 i 1 l υ

tucker kkt system 17 b α 0 1 l 1 t 1 l 1 ω v c 1 0 y where α α 1 α l n e w t the diagonal matrix v c is presented as v c d i a g 1 c υ 1 1 c υ l n e w υ υ 1 υ l n e w t the outliers contaminated in the dataset can be detected through the robust 3 σ principle which can effectively decrease the computation but there are still some potential outliers unmarked existing in the dataset besides the performance of the above introduced weighted ls svr highly depends on the distribution of data noises comprehensively considering the adaptive weight method is proposed to dynamically adjust the weight of each error variable the concrete adaptive weight process is defined as follows 18 υ i 2 1 e e i t i 1 l n e w with 19 t m e a n t 1 t 2 t 1 m e d i a n e 1 4 l n e w 1 e 1 4 l n e w 2 e 1 2 l n e w t 2 m e d i a n e 1 2 l n e w 1 e 1 2 l n e w 2 e 3 4 l n e w e i s o r t e i i 1 2 l n e w in which e i is the i th sample error e i is the error sorted according to the ascending order of the sample error series t 1 t 2 are the partial robust estimation and t is the pseudo median of the sample errors one can see that the bigger the error of the sample datum is the smaller the weight is consequently the decision function for the system is 20 f x i 1 l n e w α i k x i x b as the linear kernel function was used in this work the estimations for the parameter vector θ can be obtained as

four key components i e data collection model determination identification method and model validation ljung 2001 fig 1 presents the procedure of applying the optimal dw lssvr method to identify the response model more details of which are described as follows 1 data collection the data are collected from the optimal experiment which is designed sometimes based on the prior knowledge so that the recorded data are maximally informative as suggested by ljung 2001 the input used to generate training maneuvers to supply sufficiently informative data for identification should satisfy the persistence of excitation conditions for guaranteeing convergence and ensuring robustness properties of the identification method ideally the phase trajectories resulting from such maneuvers are ought to fill some sufficiently large domain in the state space for instance the pseudo random binary sequences prbs are rich enough and desirable choice to guarantee reliable estimation of all parameters involved in the model sutulo and guedes soares 2014 but prbs requires very long tests to achieve good loop filling what is more the desirable maneuvers are in fact not possible to be achieved and not simple to be executed with the standard means of control from the studies many researchers have done on the identification of ship mathematical models the standard zigzag maneuvers can be alternatives sutulo and guedes soares 2014 wang et al 2019 araki et al 2012 therefore in the simulation study the step input deriving data are used in a realistic situation referring to the field experiments the data acquired from a series of standard zigzag maneuvers are prepared according to the derived regression model eq 11 the data for each time step containing heading angle actual rudder angle and yaw rate are extracted from ship maneuvers and divided into two groups including training dataset for verifying identification idea and validation dataset for validating the generalization performance of the modeling method 2 model determination this step is usually the most challenging part of the identification procedure the best suitable model needs to be selected from a set of models or model structures by specifying within these models models are generally categorized into black box models and gray box models in the maritime domain such model sets for describing ship dynamics can be built based on the above introduced kinds of ship dynamic models in other words the models can also be called gray box models in the present study the model is referring to the response model 3 identification method the identification method is responsible for searching for and determining the best model the quality of the model is decided by assessing the performance of the model on reproducing the measured data the determination of the identification method is dependent on the model structure used for a model structure sometimes not only one method is useful this study proposes a robust identification method i e dw lssvr to work for identification optimization the collected data are filtered firstly via the outliers detection component as mentioned in literature about the application of svm based method for identification it is paramount to particularly set the value for the structural parameters such as the regularization parameter in ls svr due to the demonstration of the superior performance of artificial bee colony algorithm abc on solving global optimization problems over continuous space karaboga and akay 2009 banharnsakun et al 2011 it is used in this work on tuning structural parameters for the proposed identification method afterwards the corresponding input output pairs in eq 11 are brought into the optimization problem eq 16 in combination with abc to obtain the optimal solution after the optimal solution is acquired the identified model is derived from eq 22 4 model validation after the previous three steps the best model with a particular structure can be obtained but not determined yet because it remains to be tested whether it is good enough for the intended purpose i e model validation the validation of the modeling approach with a focus on the generalization performance can be executed by analyzing and comparing the predictions of the identified model and validation data that have not been used for identification 4 evaluation to prove the suitability of the response model identified using our proposed optimal dw lssvr identification method two case studies including a numerical simulation study on a sample rov zeefakkel ship unar and murray smith 1999 and a experimental study on a real usv are conducted fig 2 shows the holistic evaluation diagram which can be depicted concretely as follows firstly the first order nonlinear nomoto with known parameter values of the rov zeefakkel ship is used to simulate a series of zigzag maneuvers for which measurement noises and parameter varying perturbations are accounted after the identification procedure is finished 100 times random cycle of it in monte carlo simulation are executed to provide satisfactory identified response model for the sample ship following the simulation study several groups of experimental maneuvers of the usv generated in a ocean field are adopted in powerfully demonstrating the response dynamics modeling approach 4 1 simulation study on a ship in this subsection the feasibility of the proposed optimal dw lssvr method in identifying the response model is demonstrated by employing the model of the rov zeefakkel ship unar and murray smith 1999 whereby the particulars are set as follows length l 45 m nomoto maneuvering indices at a forward speed of 5 m s t 31 s k 0 5 s 1 n 1 1 n 3 0 4 rad 2 s 2 rudder deflection limitation δ 35 35 rudder rate limitation δ 7 simulation studies are presented in two phases i e model identification for the small ship using the proposed optimal dw lssvr approach and 100 times of monte carlo simulations of the above phase comparisons are made with the original simulated maneuvers and the optimal ls svr optimal d lssvr optimal w lssvr methods all simulation studies are carried out in an unified environment running matlab r2018b version with an intel r core tm i7 8565u 4 0 ghz cpu the time interval is chosen as δ t 0 5 s in this simulation study the initialization of abc is set to be same for cases as follows the bee size for employed bees is 30 so the onlooker bee is the number of sources is 30 l i m i t 35 which means the food source will be initialed when it does not update until l i m i t the maximum number of iteration is 30 the number of parameter needed to be optimized is 1 the search rang is in 1 0 2 1 0 10 4 1 1 model identification for a sample ship according to eq 3 the model input and output of the simulation are rudder angle δ and yaw rate r respectively considering the parameter uncertainties it is assumed that the nominal values of the nomoto maneuvering indices are assigned with 10 perturbation of the nominal values respectively measurement noises are imitated in the process of white noise with zero mean and covariance of 10 6 for the yaw rate and covariance of 10 4 for the actual rudder angle training data and validation data including a time series of input δ and output r for identification generated by activating the rov zeefakkel model using step inputs are shown in fig 3 and fig 4 respectively following the previously introduced identification procedure the parameters of the response model are estimated which are listed in table 1 it reveals that the estimation error of parameter t from the optimal dw lssvr method is slightly bigger than the smallest one obtained from the optimal ls svr method but the others from the optimal dw lssvr method are smallest table 2 illustrates the computational costs of these four different optimal identification methods from which we can find that the cost of the optimal dw lssvr is slightly bigger with respect to the others e g the difference compared to the smallest one is only 0 0023 s it should be considered the additional cost of simultaneous execution of outliers detection and adaptive weighting in the optimal dw lssvr therefore it can be still concluded that the optimal dw lssvr provides more accurate estimation results in the identification of the response model for the ship with a relatively very similar and low computational cost in order to validate the generalization and prediction capabilities of the proposed identification method prediction results using models identified by these four optimal methods are shown in fig 4 from which it can be found that the response model identified by the proposed optimal dw lssvr method approximates well the validation maneuver with relatively high accuracy besides these four identification methods identify the response model well with training data but the optimal dw lssvr method outperforms over the other three methods since the prediction error index namely mse mean square error of actual errors between the predictions of the identified model and the validation data presented in table 3 is smallest 4 1 2 monte carlo simulation in order to well verify the effectiveness of the proposed identification method this work plans to run 100 times of the above subsection identification simulation by introducing the monte carlo simulation in each run a set of nomoto maneuvering indices is selected randomly within the 10 10 perturbation around the nominal parameter values meanwhile the measurement noises with different random values are also imitated and added to the simulated actual rudder angle and yaw rate after 100 times processing of identification a set of estimated nomoto maneuvering indices are obtained with the use of four different identification methods for which the mean and the standard deviation of estimation errors are listed in tables 4 5 where the nominal values and the mean estimated values of parameters are also presented by applying the mean estimated parameter values the predictions of the response model are visualized in fig 5 and compared with the validation data also used in the above subsection the mse is adopted to analyze the identification performance of these four identification methods which is 0 0807 2 s 2 for the optimal ls svr 0 1705 2 s 2 for the optimal d lssvr 0 0850 2 s 2 for the optimal w lssvr and 0 0547 2 s 2 for the optimal dw lssvr it can be seen from the identification results that all the four identification methods can provide satisfactory results due to the predictions are all in well agreement with the validation data but comparatively the optimal dw lssvr shows superior performance over the other three methods in terms of the estimated parameter values and mse it is noticeable that the estimated parameter k is much more precise than the other two estimated parameters but the estimated n 3 is less accurate when comparing the mean error comprehensively speaking the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed optimal dw lssvr method in the estimation of nominal parameter values from the uncertain model contaminated by measurement noises with high precision has been demonstrated from the simulation study results 4 2 experimental study on a usv experimental studies are also carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimal dw lssvr method in identifying the response model for a real usv fig 6 depicted the usv whose specifications are presented in table 6 it has one podded propeller driven by servo motor with which one can control its surge speed and heading the maximum rudder deflection is 3 5 the usv is equipped with sensors including a gps an imu a compass and a rudder indicator the imu and rudder indicators are used to respectively measure its yaw rate and actual rudder angle which are required to be extracted for the identification of the response model for the usv the experiments are conducted in the weihai of china under less than level 3 sea conditions a set of data including actual rudder angle and yaw rate are finally stemmed from several time series maneuvers carried out at a steady forward speed varying slightly around 2 5 m s for which the sampling time is 0 2 s samples obtained from 2 0 2 0 zigzag maneuver are classified as training data for identification methods training to achieve parameter estimates which are presented in fig 7 the rest 1 0 1 0 and 1 5 1 5 zigzag maneuvers provide data for identification validation all properties of the abc used as ls svr s structural parameters optimizer are set as same as the ones applied in previous simulation studies after applying the four optimal identification methods to estimate parameters of the response model for the usv the identification results including the parameter values computational costs of identification methods and validation errors are obtained which are recorded in table 7 the computational costs of these four identification methods are very close the biggest cost is 0 0345 s from the optimal dw lssvr method which has an acceptable fulfillment for the requirement of computational cost in engineering applications it is noticeable that the computational costs herein are lower than those in the above simulation study due to fewer samples the number of support vectors from samples in ls svr based identification methods is the main factor determining their computational complexity in addition it can be seen from table 7 that the predictions of these four identified models are very similar and correspondingly the mses are very small and close to each other additionally the trends of these predictions are close to the measurements even though the obvious fluctuations induced by the environmental disturbances and measurement noises of the measurements can be observed which implies the satisfactory performance of these four optimal identification methods on the other hand it indicates the importance of taking into account the uncertainties covering the parameter uncertainty and measurement noise of the nomoto maneuvering indices when undertaking model identification comparatively the proposed optimal dw lssvr method in identifying the response model for the usv ensures the most accurate estimates in terms of mse after obtaining the estimates of the response model for the usv it is of significant importance to validate the generalization ability of the identified model which can be investigated by analyzing the accuracy of the predictions of the identified model compared with the validation data with use of the samples which have not adopted in previous identification procedure fig 8 shows the predictions of yaw rate by transforming the actual rudder angle extracted from 1 0 1 0 and 1 5 1 5 zigzag maneuvers to these four response models identified by four different identification methods respectively comparing these four groups of predictions with the validation yaw rate it is straightforward to calculate the mses as listed in table 7 from the validation results it can be concluded that the trends of predictions are in acceptable agreement with the validation samples slight discrepancies between predictions and validation data can be observed but they are varying within the tolerable range which still demonstrates the effectiveness of the optimal identification approach in estimating parameters of the response model for the usv with consideration of parameter uncertainties and measurements noises it is deserved to be highlighted that values of n 3 estimated by these four identification methods have obvious differences but the predictions from these methods show an ignorable discrepancy which to some degree reveals that this parameter has a negligible impact on the identification and the predictions of motions of the usv 5 conclusions for preparing and testing a robust identification approach in identifying ship dynamic models for the development of mass a novel hybrid intelligent identification method is proposed based on ls svr abc adaptive weight trick and outlier detection technique which is further investigated in deeply through simulation study on a sample ship with known response model and experimental study executed using a real usv in weihai china in these studies being made more realistic measurement noises and parameter uncertainties caused by unmodeled hydrodynamic effects varying loading conditions and environmental disturbances such as wave currents wind are all taken into account to test the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed optimal dw lssvr method identification results demonstrate that the proposed optimal identification method can estimate the nomote maneuvering indices correctly more precisely the optimal dw lssvr shows superior estimation performance over the other three optimal methods including the optimal ls lsvr the optimal d lssvr the optimal w lssvr it also can be concluded that the application of the optimal dw lssvr in identifying ship dynamic model with parameter uncertainties and measurement noises is suggested to improve the estimation accuracy in fact the measurement noises derived from sensors and parameter uncertainties cannot be completely eliminated the forthcoming research point will be on remedying effects induced by these uncertainties for instance by introducing robust filters to power the capability of our current proposed optimal identification method and by modifying the structure of the dynamic model credit authorship contribution statement man zhu conceptualization methodology software writing original draft wuqiang sun data curation formal analysis

experimental results of flow around cylinders can be found from the open literature however to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of an exact answer about which turbulence model is more suitable for the accurate or the reliable results respect to the experimental data on flow around the bluff bodies in the previous studies involving the assessment of the turbulence models there are several geometrical shapes for the basic models such as cylinders with different cross sections for instance circular cylinders used in the numerical studies with different rans turbulence models by

some specific cases as square block and the surface mounted cube have also been studied by rans rusdin 2017 and les models lim et al 2009 in terms of performance examination of the turbulence models the studies are generally focused on the investigation of the turbulence models related with flow over these types of geometries especially for the bluff bodies there are available empirical and numerical results such as drag coefficients in the literature for the validation when the previous works in the literature are extensively viewed there are restricted studies involving the assessment of the turbulence models in case of flow past the semi circular cylinder scc relevant studies on circular cylinder cc are already available the flow structure over the scc has some application areas as side mirror of the vehicles skyscraper structures abutments vortex generator on vortex flowmeters devices such as heat exchangers with different designs thermal process in food industry fibrous processing paper industry underwater vessels having flat base etc barigou et al 1998 bhinder et al 2012 for instance a side mirror of a vehicle can be considered as scc model owing to its position on the vehicle it has a wake region and it produces drag and noise approximately 10 of the total drag acting on the vehicle is due to the side mirrors having 0 5 of the total projection surface area mimeau et al 2014 in another study weaver and veljkovic 2005 have used an open scc and a parabolic cylinder in a wind tunnel they have given the results of force coefficients as a function of incident angle for the flow characteristics strouhal number and amplitude response nada et al 2007 have studied flow characteristics over a scc with various orientation angles experimentally and numerically a wind tunnel was used in the experiments while the standard k ε turbulence model has been employed for the 2 d numerical analyses based on the experimental and numerical results the relative differences between these results have been found in the range of 20 farhadi et al 2010 numerically investigated the laminar flow past a 2 d scc under influence of a splitter plate placed in the wake

scc placed inside a horizontal channel at 1 re 40 for different blockage ratios the size of recirculation zone for the scc was found to be increased with the reynolds number for the same blockage ratio parthasarathy et al 2017 prepared a study about flow and heat transfer characteristics of a row of scc for various gap ratios at re 100 small increments for the values of average drag coefficient strouhal number and mean nusselt number have been observed in terms of the gap ratio from 10 to 4 sisodia et al 2017 numerically examined the flow over an angled scc with the downstream square cylinder at 10 re 45 the time averaged c d value was found minimum at 90 although there are some studies on the flow characteristics of the scc in the literature comparison of different models and their validation with the experimental data with respect to the flow structure drag and pressure coefficient values have not been encountered scc has not been commonly considered comparing to circular cylinder hamed et al 2017 in the present paper the main aim is to investigate the flow characteristics over the scc by different turbulence models in addition the numerical results have been compared to that of the experimental data however blunt trailing edge on flow characteristics are more transparently observed by considering the scc in terms of unsteady flow structure than that of cc especially for turbulence modeling where capturing the unsteady flow structure is a challenging issue according to this issue comparison of different turbulence models over the present problem in broad perspective seems to be of great interest for cfd analyses 2 methodology 2 1 turbulence model turbulent flows are under the influence of fluctuating and irregular velocity fields these fluctuations mix transported quantities such as momentum and energy fluctuations can be in different scales and frequencies considering the computer capacity and solution time turbulent flows are harder to simulate directly in the practical engineering applications instead of solving these types of fluid problems directly the modified equations can be solved by adapting them to the problems but in the modified equations including additional variables it is required to define these variables in terms of known quantities the flow is described by the conservation laws for continuity and momentum navier stokes equations as follows 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j ρ x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ ij u l x l x j ρ x i x j this solution method provides available solution for the mean flow variables and evidently decreases the computational effort for instance the governing equations do not require time derivatives and the result is obtained in less solution time and economically for the steady state flow condition therefore the reynolds averaged approach is mostly usable for practical engineering applications and the eddy viscosity turbulence models such as k ε and k ω and their derivatives are based on rans the other alternative approach for the transform navier stokes equations is the filtering it is basically a manipulation of the exact navier stokes equations to extract only the eddies that are smaller than the filter size which is usually taken as the grid size the filtering approximation also generates extra unknown terms which should be modeled smagorinsky 1963 lilly 1966 the mean flow characteristics are collected during the time dependent analyses in this case les provides an alternative approach in which the large eddies are calculated in a time dependent analysis 2 1 1 the standard rng and realizable k ε models three derivatives of k ε which are commonly used in the literature and in the practical engineering applications have similar forms with transport equations for k and ε the standard k ε model is a semi empirical form of transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate ε standard k ε model has some disadvantages on the cases including shear flow the estimation of the size of the recirculation region in the downstream or flow separation point in the calculation the flow is accepted as fully turbulent and the effects of molecular viscosity are negligible launder and spalding 1983 the turbulence kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate of ε are calculated from the following transport equations 3 t ρ k x i ρ ku i x i μ k x j g k ρε s k 4 t ρε x i ρ ε u i x i μ ε x j c 1 ε g k ε k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k s ε where the term of the g k is the turbulence kinetic energy generation owing to the mean velocity gradients and determined as 5 g k ρ u i u j u j x i the values of constant terms are c 1ε 1 44 and c 2ε 1 92 due to the lots of experiments for main turbulent shear flows including homogeneous shear flows and disrupting isotropic grid turbulence s k and s ε are user defined source terms the re normalization group rng k ε model is determined from the instantaneous navier stokes equations the feature that distinguishes rng k ε model from standard k ε model is the analytical derivation results in a model with constants different additional terms and functions in the transport equations yakhot et al 1992 6 t ρ k x i ρ ku i x i μ eff α k k x j g k ρ ε s k 7 t ρε x i ρε u i x i μ eff α k ε x j c 1 ε g k ε k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k r ε s ε the basic difference between the rng and standard k ε models is due to the additional term in the ε equation given as 8 r ε c μ ρη 3 1 η η 0 1 βη 3 ε 2 k in this term the constant c μ 0 0845 η s k ε η 0 4 38 β 0 012 because of that the rng is a refinement of the standard k ε model which is more sensitive to the prediction of the effects of rapid strain and streamlines curvature compared to standard k ε model the values of constants terms are also different from the standard k ε model and these are c 1ε 1 44 and c 2ε 1 92 in addition to the standard and rng derivatives of k ε model ansys fluent ensures the realizable module as having the modifications of the other derivatives of k ε model it is used for the problems with rotating shear flows boundary free shear flows such as mixing layers planar and round jets channel flows flat plate boundary layers with and without a pressure gradient and separated flows within the framework of turbulent flow physics the realizable module includes specific mathematical limitation on the normal stresses shih et al 1995 the turbulent kinetic energy k is similar to standard and rng k ε models however the equation of the dissipation rate ε is fairly different from them as follows 9 t ρ k x i ρ ku i x i μ k x j g k ρε s k 10 t ρε x i ρεu i x i μ k x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k v ε s ε 11 c 1 max 0 43 η η 5 the default values of constant terms are nearly similar to that of the rng k ε model and these are c 1 1 44 and c 2 1 9 for realizable k ε model 2 1 2 shear stress transport sst k ω in this turbulence model the turbulent viscosity is replaced to explain the transport of the main turbulent shear stress the sst k ω model pieces together the virtues of the k ε and k ω models in terms of aerodynamic flows especially for boundary layers affected by reverse pressure gradients the validation of this model has been encountered for fluid structure interaction problems free shear layers zero or reverse pressure gradients in the boundary layers argyropoulos and markatos 2015 other modifications are to add a cross diffusion term in the ω equation and mixing function to provide that the model behaves more favorably in both near wall and far field regions menter 1994 the transport equations for the sst k ω are given as follows 12 t ρ k x i ρ ku i x i γ k k x j g k y k s k 13 t ρ ω x i ρω u i x i γ ω ω x j g ω d ω y ω s ω the terms of turbulence kinetic energy generation g k is calculated as in k ε turbulence model g ω is the generation of ω the terms of γ k and γ ω are the main difference of the k ω turbulence model from the k ε turbulence model which are indicated as the effective diffusity of k and ω y k and y ω describe the dissipation of k and ω respectively derivation of s terms is also described as the user defined source terms 2 1 3 large eddy simulation les the large eddy simulation is the turbulence model between the direct numerical simulation dns and rans which calculates large eddies directly on the other hand les models small eddies just like all turbulence models mesh independence study is required for all cfd analyses furthermore les requires substantially finer meshes than those used for rans nicolás pérez et al 2017 due to the fact that finer meshes are required for appropriate resolution of wall layers and estimation of transition to turbulence in the boundary layers celik 2003 therefore in this study mesh independence study was performed with respect to the les model in addition the analysis needs to be transient with acceptable time steps because the temporary resolution requirements are obtained by the dissipating scales rather than the time averaged flow or the energy containing eddies moreover the governing equations utilized for les are provided by filtering the time dependent navier stokes equations rodi 1997 li et al 2018 the incompressible navier stokes equations are filtered as follows 14 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 15 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j x j μ u i x j p x i τ ij x j where τ ij represents the subgrid scale stress and it is described as 16 τ ij ρ u i u j ρ u i u j the navier stokes equation form for les eqs 14 and 15 demonstrates similarity to the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation eqs 1 and 2 the time dependent variables reveal the significant difference because these are filtered quantities in les equations which are mean quantities in rans equations due to the filtering the subgrid scale stresses are unknown and modeled as 17 τ ij 1 3 τ kk δ ij 2 μ t s ij this is the eddy viscosity model which is mostly used as subgrid scale model in this equation μ t is the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity and s ij is the rate of strain tensor and determined as follows 18 s ij 1 3 u i x j u j x i the eddy viscosity μ t is modeled in accordance with the smagorinsky lilly model 19 μ t ρ l s 2 s and smagorinsky constant 20 s 2 s ij s ij the c s was taken as 0 1 from homogeneous isotropic turbulence in the inertial sub range the mixing length l s for subgrid scale is computed 21 l s min κ d c s v 1 3 where the von karman constant is described as κ d is the distance to the closest wall and v is the volume of the computational cell 2 1 4 detached eddy simulation des des approach also known as the hybrid les rans was first proposed by spalart 1997 des turbulence model uses both the rans models near the wall and les model in the wake region of flow where unsteady and chaotic structure of flow occurred spalart 2000 in des models rans equations are used for the outside of the wake region of the flow to reduce the calculation time compared to the use of les in the whole flow volume for instance it includes rans simulation in the boundary layers and les run in the unsteady separated regions zhang et al 2019 there are three options of subgrid turbulence modeling for des turbulence model as spalart allmaras realizable k ε and sst k ω for the simulations carried out in this work sst k ω based des models were employed actually in the analyses des performs depending on a turbulent length scale l t to decide which approach is used during the simulation at the inlet boundary conditions des starts the computation with the sst model the formulation is the same as that of standard sst model except the length scale used in the calculation of the dissipation rate this is modified by local grid spacing δ if the turbulent length scale is greater than the grid spacing which is common in the regions with large eddies and chaotic flow nature les is activated in the des formulation the activation of les or the switching to sst model in des is controlled by a blending factor f menter and kuntz 2003 generally this factor takes the form as 22 f l t c des δ where c des is a constant 2 2 computational domain and boundary conditions in the present study the computational 3 d flow domain was created by taking into account of the experimental study of hamed et al 2017 a smooth scc having d c 50 mm diameter is placed vertically in the air flow domain within the dimensions 6 0d c x 20 0d c in the streamwise direction 6 0d c y 6 0d c in the vertical direction and 5 0d c z 5 0d c in the transverse direction as shown in fig 1 no slip boundary conditions are described on the physical surfaces of the scc model at the inlet boundary condition of the flow domain the uniform velocity inlet is defined as u 9 5 m s to obtain a reynolds number of re u d c υ 3 2 104 where υ is the kinematic viscosity of the air which is υ 1 46x10 5 m2 s is defined with the zero pressure gradient at the outlet boundary condition pressure outlet value is specified as zero pressure outlet boundary condition has been defined as a static gauge pressure at the outlet condition the boundary is open to the atmosphere which means the gauge pressure is to be set zero dogrul et al 2016 the free slip condition is applied at the top bottom and side walls of the flow domain the finite volume method is integrated to solve the transient and incompressible navier stokes equations with the pressure and velocity coupling with the splitting of the coupled type algorithm the second order implicit scheme was used for the pressure and the momentum spatial discretizations with green gauss solver to take the physical diffusion into account it is significantly influenced by numerical diffusion as a result of the central differencing schemes it should be appropriate approximation to conduct the spatial discretization the second order implicit scheme is also used for time integration 2 3 grid and time independence studies numerical results show that the unsteady prediction results are more accurate than those of the steady results due to the three dimensional unsteady turbulent flow regime in the downstream of the scc therefore the transient analyses were performed with different time step size to obtain the time independent results according to the grid structure iii shown in fig 3 in ittc standard for periodic phenomenon like vortex shedding applications it is advised to use at least 100 time steps per period anonymous 2011 in this study vortex shedding frequency was calculated and its value was 3 03 hz at reynolds number of 3 2 104 the period of the vortex shedding has been found as 0 33 s according to ittc the time step size is recommended to be around 0 0033 s therefore in this study the time step size has been defined between 0 0001 s and 0 05 s based on this result the dimensionless time step sizes are set to δt 1 0 95d c u δt 2 0 095d c u δt 3 0 0095d c u and δt 4 0 0019d c u 4 0x102 4 0x103 4 0x104 and 2 0x105 number of time steps respectively whose multiplications are equal to totally 20 s in actual time for all cases each time step consists of 20 iterations furthermore the convergence criteria of the numerical 3 d velocity components are detected at each time step by controlling the residuals of the all equations which are fixed to be solved by setting their variations less than 10 7 during the analyses the mean streamwise velocity is controlled for the study of time step independence as can be seen in fig 2 the analysis has been performed by using the les turbulence model and it showed that the differences between the results of the time step δt 3 and δt 4 are negligible for instance the saddle point in the downstream of the scc is nearly occurred at x d c 1 52 for δt 3 and δt 4 it is occurred at x d c 8 for δt 2 and not observed within the flow domain limits for δt 1 therefore the analysis has been continued by using the time step size δt 3 considering the total solution time cost and ittc standard another important factor that influences the solution time and accuracy of the results is the grid size to obtain a good performance from the cfd analyses enough element size is needed to solve the chaotic flow structure in the past of the bluff body in cfd studies the refinement factor represents the ratio of two grid sets which is advised to be greater than 1 3 celik et al 2008 tezdogan et al 2015 sezen et al 2018 dogrul 2019 for a better prediction the grid density should be increased in the near of the high gradient velocity distribution regions and grid structures with fine quality which should be built close to the fluid solid interaction regions in this study the computational domain was divided into seven sub domains for each grid arrangement as given in table 1 structured grids with quadrilateral elements were used in all the sub domains as can be seen in fig 3 in this figure the grid structure was compressed toward the rigid wall and four sets of grid arrangements were built for the grid independence study to ensure that the results are convincing in this study the refinement factor is between 1 68 and 2 28 therefore the results of the grid independence study in terms of the mean drag coefficient and the normalized mean streamwise velocity along the x axis and y axis have been presented in table 1 and fig 4 respectively the drag coefficient is the dimensionless form of the drag force which is acting on the surfaces of the bluff body in the streamwise direction given as follows 23 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a where f d is the drag force in the streamwise direction ρ is the fluid density and a is the projection area of the front view the variations of mean c d distribution with different grid sizes are presented in table 1 as seen there is a quite change of c d among grid structures i ii iii but no significant difference between grid structures iii and iv which was under 1 in addition to the mean value of c d the variations of the normalized time averaged streamwise velocity components along the x axis and y axis at the downstream of the bluff body were examined as shown in fig 4a the saddle point is occurred approximately at x d c 1 52 for grid structures iii and iv while it is observed nearly at x d c 1 4 and x d c 1 28 for grid structures i and ii respectively apparently along the y axis in fig 4b the mean streamwise velocity distributions of grid structures i and ii are different from grid structures iii and iv at the location of the saddle point at x d c 1 52 the saddle point was also determined nearly at x d c 1 6 in the experimental study hamed et al 2017 in addition according to the solution time per time step a comparison between the grid structures was conducted the results revealed that the grid structure iii was more consistent than the grid structure iv and the difference between their results was about 40 according to the results given in table 1 and fig 4 due to the fact that the computer capacity and solution time cost are of great importance in cfd analyses further analyses were performed with the grid structure iii all numerical computations were performed on the dell workstation with 64 gb ram intel xeon cpu e5 2630 2 6 ghz 3 results and discussion in this study a numerical investigation of a flow around the scc was considered by using different turbulence models to do so les des sst k ω and realizable rng standard k ε turbulence models at re 3 2 104 were used for simulations and the obtained results were reported in figs 5 11 the dimensions of all images were normalized with the diameter as characteristic length of the scc as x d c and y d c the distributions of the values were given in the legend bar for the flow patterns the maximum layers of the flow patterns are displayed as a red background color while the minimum layers are indicated with a blue one 3 1 instantaneous and time averaged flow patterns the distribution of non dimensional time averaged streamwise u u u and cross stream v u u velocity components have been given in fig 5 the time averaged streamwise and cross stream velocities were normalized with the free stream velocity u as emphasized in the left column of fig 5 the flow structures in the wake region are almost equally symmetrical with respect to the centerline of the body the flow accelerates after passing the top and bottom corners of the scc and reaches its maximum value near that region the location of the saddle point in the experimental study hamed et al 2017 was approximately determined at x d c 1 6 referring to the streamline topology the nearest result to the experimental study was found to be x d c 1 52 by les turbulence model with 5 of relative error for the rest of turbulence models in the present study the saddle point was nearly obtained at x d c 1 17 for des and realizable k ε turbulence models and for standard k ε model and sst k ω model it was found at x d c 1 04 and x d c 0 92 respectively in addition the error magnitude values were found as 23 8 39 48 25 0 and 32 5 for of des sst k ω realizable k ε and standard k ε models respectively for rng module of k ε turbulence model the flow structure in the downstream of the scc was significantly different compared to those of the rest of applied cfd models in this study as well as to the experimental one in the downstream of the scc two symmetrical foci points with similar sizes were observed these foci cycling towards the opposite directions are consisted in the experimental and numerical results except for rng k ε model however in this model two symmetrical large scale foci points are observed after the first saddle point needless to say that the reverse flows have continued to extend beyond x d c 5 in the field of view additionally the saddle point could also provide some information on the other flow patterns one of them is the time averaged cross stream velocity contours that are presented in the right column of fig 5 due to the blockage effect the cross stream velocity is induced in the negative and positive directions then after the flow passing the scc two different symmetrical pairs of clusters were formed in the downstream the cluster regions with comparatively smaller size were centered at nearly x d c 0 6 in the experimental result hamed et al 2017 in cfd results the centers of small clusters are found at x d c 0 52 and x d c 0 31 by les and des turbulence models respectively however for sst k ω realizable and standard k ε models the small clusters are occurred approximately near the surface of the scc besides two small clusters are also obtained by rng k ε model however compared to the experimental results these clusters did not physically occur furthermore considerable time averaged cross stream velocity contours large size clusters occur between x d c 1 0 and x d c 3 0 in the experimental and les results where the centers of these clusters are aligned with the saddle points however for the rest of the turbulence models the effect of large size clusters is observed nearly up to 2 0d c and also the centers of these clusters related with the saddle points generally except for rng k ε model the effect of the time averaged cross stream velocity is diminished beyond x d c 3 5 and can be neglected for this reason in rng k ε model due to the formation of the second reverse flow the influence of cross stream velocity continues to the further another flow characteristic is the instantaneous and the time averaged vorticities that were normalized with d c u and given in fig 6 the instantaneous vorticity ω ω d c u results clarify the von karman vortex street owing to the vortex shedding on the experimental and numerical studies as in the experimental study hamed et al 2017 the flow separation occurs from the top and the bottom corners of the scc at all cfd results the vortex shedding in the downstream of the scc coming from the top side rotates in the clockwise direction while the one from bottom side turns in the counter clockwise direction and this situation creates the shear layer between the upcoming flow and the vortex shedding when the flow separates from the body surface small scale eddies roll up along the downstream these small eddies appear more prominently in the les and the des turbulence models results which are similar to the experimental study whereas it is not captured by the rest of the turbulence models similarly the instantaneous vorticity structures of the experimental les and des results the time averaged vorticity patterns ω ω d c u as shown in the right column of fig 6 are also in good agreement the small scale vorticity suppresses each other and is not visible in the time averaged vorticity patterns while the large scale symmetrical positive and negative vorticity patterns are occurred in the wake region of the scc as in the experimental results the time averaged vorticity patterns in the region beyond the saddle point lose their effect for all cfd results the closest results to the experimental base study hamed et al 2017 were obtained by les turbulence model between the values ω 5 x 10 3 while des model is somewhat structurally similar to these results it is worth mentioning that near the back side of the scc since the direction of the vortex shedding changes continuously the time averaged vorticity patterns are nearly equal to zero for the les and des results which are in good agreement with the experimental results however in the sst k ω turbulence model the clusters of negative and positive vorticity patterns approach to the back surface of the scc for the derivatives of k ε turbulence model with the realizable and standard modules the results are approximately the same but in the rng module a different vorticity structure is formed as in the velocity contours in fluid dynamics turbulence kinetic energy tke is the averaged kinetic energy per unit mass associated with eddies in turbulent flow emphasized in the normalized form as follows tke u 2 v 2 u 2 where u is the velocity fluctuations and defined as u u u u is the instantaneous velocity and u is the local mean velocity in the fig 7a the base study hamed et al 2017 showed a single peak of the tke observed in the wake region of the body around x d c 1 8 at the symmetry axis similar to the experimental results the effects of the velocity fluctuations begin within the first diameter downstream of the scc in the les turbulence model the maximum value of the normalized tke 0 0133 is determined around x d c 1 76 by the les turbulence model for the rest of the turbulence models the position and the strength of the tke changed according to the levels of the velocity fluctuations and the vortex shedding frequency of the flow in the des and sst k ω turbulence models the maximum value is nearly the same with that of the les while it is located around x d c 1 2 and x d c 1 0 respectively for the realizable and standard k ε models the maximum normalized tke values were found as tke 0 008 and tke 0 01 respectively however the rng module showed different structure due to the observed vortex shedding structure the reynolds stress correlations u v u 2 in fig 8 are decided on the momentum transfer in the downstream of the scc due to the time dependent behavior of the vortex shedding and the flow entrainment into the wake region of the scc the momentum transfer occurred as pointed out in the experimental study of hamed et al 2017 the small and large scales of asymmetric clusters have occurred with respect to the symmetry axis in the results of les and des appropriate with the lateral mean shear as in the normalized tke the center of maximum reynolds stress correlations u v u 2 0 1 was also nearly found at x d c 1 76 and x d c 1 2 by les and des turbulence models respectively the reynolds stresses are approximated by an eddy viscosity times the mean rate of strain tensor the strain rate tensor is obtained by the boussinesq approximation for the k ω and k ε turbulence models schmitt 2007 therefore all the components of the reynolds stresses are not available in the k ω and k ε turbulence models and their derivatives since these turbulence models are two equations based models hence the flow characteristics of reynolds stress results are only given by les and des turbulence models 3 2 one dimensional profiles of flow characteristics additional insights over the effect of the scc on its wake region have been presented by one dimensional flow profiles of u u u tke and u v u 2 along the x axis of symmetry plane of the scc i e y d c 0 and at x d c 1 2 locations in the range of y d c 1 35 which were selected for comparison purpose since these locations have also been used in the experimental study of hamed et al 2017 in fig 9 the superposition of the results of all turbulence models and the experimental base study for the comparison was shown the u u profiles along the axis of symmetry fig 9a indicate that velocity recovery was rapid as can also be seen in fig 5 recirculation bubbles with different dimensions have been observed for each case as it was pointed out above the saddle point of experimental study of hamed et al 2017 occurred at x d c 1 6 in the present study and the closest result is obtained by les model at x d c 1 52 needless to say that x d c 5 0 is not enough for the full recovery for all of the treated cases however the recovery rate is getting slower after the point of approximately x d c 1 75 for the models of des sst k ω realizable and standard k ε the recovery rate for decreasing trend is observed after nearly x d c 2 35 for both les result and experimental result of hamed et al 2017 these profiles also show the location where the velocity has the global minimum the global minimum was found at x d c 0 25 for rng k ε x d c 0 35 for sst k ω x d c 0 50 for standard k ε x d c 0 60 for des x d c 0 70 for realizable k ε x d c 0 92 for les and x d c 1 00 for experimental study of hamed et al 2017 in fig 9b indicates that along the x axis of symmetry the turbulent kinetic energy had the same decreasing trend after nearly x d c 3 00 for all the cases the global maximum was observed at x d c 0 65 for rng k ε x d c 0 80 for sst k ω x d c 1 30 for standard k ε x d c 1 1 for des x d c 1 35 for realizable k ε x d c 1 60 for les while the global maximum for the experimental study of hamed et al 2017 was reported to be at x d c 1 75 the symmetrical flow patterns are reported in fig 9 c d and e where the normalized streamwise velocity components tke values and reynolds stress correlations were given for x d c 1 2 as demonstrated in fig 9c the normalized streamwise velocity components reach the uniform value approximately at y d c 0 95 for rng k ε y d c 0 83 for sst k ω y d c 0 70 for standard k ε y d c 0 63 for des y d c 0 64 for realizable k ε y d c 0 55 for les and y d c 0 62 for experimental study of hamed et al 2017 after the point of approximately y d c 0 75 except the rng k ε model the tke values are getting closer to zero as can be seen in fig 9d this situation is clearly supported by the reynolds stress correlations of fig 9e due to the effect of fluctuations on both tke values and reynolds stress correlations the results of les and des turbulence models demonstrated a tendency similar to those of the experimental data of the base study 3 3 pressure and drag coefficients the pressure coefficient is a dimensionless number which describes the relative pressure values around a body in a flow field as defined in eq 24 24 c p p p 1 2 ρ u 2 where p is the local static pressure p is the static pressure in the free stream in fig 10 stagnation point where the pressure coefficient distribution reaches its maximum value of c p 1 0 at the first contact point of flow to the scc that is at this point the flow stagnates and the total pressure is equal to the static pressure with the flow acceleration a negative pressure zone is formed in the vicinity of the top and bottom corners of scc and continues at the downstream of the scc the negative pressure coefficient structure was found to be symmetric at the top and bottom sides of the scc and its minimum value was c p 1 36 generally the negative pressure region disappeared beyond the saddle point in the wake region of the bluff body considering the similarity of the experimental and les results in terms of instantaneous and time averaged flow patterns in figs 5 to 9 the pressure coefficient obtained by the les turbulence model can be regarded as real like condition as mentioned in the grid independence study the mean c d history is another important issue on flow over bluff bodies the drag force is composed of the pressure force acting on bluff body and the friction force from its surface the friction force is affected by the fluid because of the shear stress patterns and therefore the friction force is significantly important in terms of laminar flow conversely the pressure force is important for turbulent flow because it depends on the pressure difference between the upstream and the downstream of the bluff body the time dependent c d behavior obtained by les turbulence model is given in fig 11 as seen in the time dependent history of c d the fluctuations are occurred owing to the vortex shedding in the shear layer in addition the time averaged mean c d was found to be 1 107 with the les turbulence model for the rest of the turbulence models the mean values of c d were calculated and compared with the experimental results of hamed et al 2017 then reported in table 2 in this table δc d represents the difference between c d in the experiments and cfd it worth mentioning that in the experimental study the momentum method approximation was used by hamed et al 2017 to determine the mean c d in all turbulence models except the rng k ε and sst k ω the maximum difference value between the experimental and cfd results is found to be below 7 4 conclusions the flow characteristics over the scc at re 3 2 104 have been obtained numerically by six different turbulence models which are the most commonly used in the literature and engineering applications namely les des sst k ω and derivatives of k ε the cfd results were compared with those of the experimental study found in the literature the present paper has supported quantitative results about the turbulence model at the upstream and downstream of the scc at the beginning of numerical analyses the grid and time independence studies were done by les turbulence model as a result of these studies the non dimensional time step was found to be δt 0 0095d c u and the flow volume was created with about four million grid size the preferred lower time step and higher grid size increase the total solution time and it requires a powerful computing capacity taken together when the experimental and cfd results are compared except the rng k ε model flow characteristics practically looked similar to one another in this context some important flow characteristics such as streamline topology superimposed streamwise and cross stream velocity contours instantaneous and time averaged vorticity patterns tke reynolds stress correlations and pressure and drag coefficients were compared in detail when all the time averaged flow patterns are examined it is determined that the closest result to the experimental result is obtained by the les turbulence model the des turbulence model follows the les turbulence model in terms of flow structure similarity especially in the instantaneous vorticity results findings revealed that the les and des turbulence models have been very successful in capturing small scale vorticity components and the results were in good agreement with the experimental study however the outcomes demonstrated that sst k ω realizable and standard derivatives of k ε turbulence models showed relatively similar results in terms of flow characteristics when compared to one another the evidence from this study suggests for this type of flow problem the flow around the bluff body the les turbulence model leads to the closest result to the real like conditions however this turbulence model is only used for 3 d flow analysis this is a disadvantage for practical engineering applications because it increases the number of the grid and total solution time and requires high computer capacity according to the outcomes of this study if a 2 d analysis is required needless to say the des turbulence model may be recommended over other applied turbulence models author contribution statement sercan yagmur conceptualization methodology software validation investigation

22026,this paper presents the flow field around a semi circular cylinder scc a basic geometry for fluid mechanics obtained numerically by computational fluid dynamics cfd at reynolds number of 3 2 104 time averaged flow characteristics such as vorticity velocity fields with streamline patterns reynolds stress correlations turbulence kinetic energy tke pressure and drag coefficients have been examined by using reynolds averaged navier stokes rans detached eddy simulation des and large eddy simulations les turbulence models several rans approaches with turbulence modeling including sst k ω k ε and their derivatives were used while in the les simulations the dynamic smagorinsky subgrid scale model was employed the obtained results of the present study have been compared with an experimental study from the open literature the results of the investigation showed that when numerical findings are compared to experimental ones the results of les and des turbulence models were found to be more consistent than those obtained by using k ε and sst k ω models time averaged flow patterns have been found to be considerably symmetric with respect to the axis passing through the end of the curved surface of the scc the deviation of les and des results and experimental results was less than 7 in terms of the drag coefficient graphical abstract image 1 keywords bluff body cfd fluid structure interaction les rans semi circular cylinder 1 introduction flow over a bluff body is an important issue in a wide variety of engineering and industrial applications in recent years designs in many engineering applications have been done by computational fluid dynamics cfd cfd is a method with high flexibility accuracy and wide breadth of applications in addition it is possible to determine the flow structures with different turbulence models in a cost effective and quick way kocaaslan et al 2016 babayigit et al 2017 however the imbroglio in cfd is when it comes to choose the appropriate turbulence model to determine physically occurred complicated flow structures with laminar separations turbulence transition regions saddle points as well as the entropy movements around a bluff body some bluff bodies with complex geometric shapes have been considered in the studies concerning with the selection of the appropriate turbulence models in the literature there are

model cheng et al 2019 have been taken into account for the evaluation of the performance of different turbulence models a number of studies using different turbulence models validated by the experimental results of flow around cylinders can be found from the open literature however to the best of our knowledge there is a lack of an exact answer about which turbulence model is more suitable for the accurate or the reliable results respect to the experimental data on flow around the bluff bodies in the previous studies involving the assessment of the turbulence models there are several geometrical shapes for the basic models such as cylinders with different cross sections for instance circular cylinders used in the numerical studies with different rans turbulence models by unal et al 2010 sst sas and sst urans methods by liu et al 2017 rans and sgs based turbulence models by zhang 2017 a finite volume of pressure based method using simple algorithm by chehreh and javadi 2018 square cylinders considered by les and rans models by rodi 1997 k ε turbulence models with les method by bosch and rodi 1998 les and urans models by younis and abrishamchi 2014 one eq sas and the sst sas k ω models by elkhoury 2016 and triangular cylinders analyzed via les turbulence model yagmur et al 2015 2017 are some popular geometrical structures encountered in the literature furthermore some specific cases as square block and the surface mounted cube have also been studied by rans rusdin 2017 and les models lim et al 2009 in terms of performance examination of the turbulence models the studies are generally focused on the investigation of the turbulence models related with flow over these types of geometries especially for the bluff bodies there are available empirical and numerical results such as drag coefficients in the literature for the validation when the previous works in the literature are extensively viewed there are restricted studies involving the assessment of the turbulence models in case of flow past the semi circular cylinder scc relevant studies on circular cylinder cc are already available the flow structure over the scc has some application areas as side mirror of the vehicles skyscraper structures abutments vortex generator on vortex flowmeters devices such as heat exchangers with different designs thermal process in food industry fibrous processing paper industry underwater vessels having flat base etc barigou et al 1998 bhinder et al 2012 for instance a side mirror of a vehicle can be considered as scc model owing to its position on the vehicle it has a wake region and it produces drag and noise approximately 10 of the total drag acting on the vehicle is due to the side mirrors having 0 5 of the total projection surface area mimeau et al 2014 in another study weaver and veljkovic 2005 have used an open scc and a parabolic cylinder in a wind tunnel they have given the results of force coefficients as a function of incident angle for the flow characteristics strouhal number and amplitude response nada et al 2007 have studied flow characteristics over a scc with various orientation angles experimentally and numerically a wind tunnel was used in the experiments while the standard k ε turbulence model has been employed for the 2 d numerical analyses based on the experimental and numerical results the relative differences between these results have been found in the range of 20 farhadi et al 2010 numerically investigated the laminar flow past a 2 d scc under influence of a splitter plate placed in the wake region at different reynolds numbers ranging from 100 to 500 for three different gaps g 0 0d to 4 5d and two different splitter lengths numerical study has been performed by finite volume discretization technique of quadratic upstream interpolation for convective kinematics quick scheme with semi implicit method for pressure linked equations consistent simplec method they reported that the drag coefficients were reduced by 6 7 at 0 g d 3 for 100 re 500 by mounting the same splitter plate at the downstream of the model gode et al 2011 numerically studied on flow past the scc placed as parallel with respect to the ongoing flow in the case of re 120 findings of their research revealed that nusselt numbers were influenced by both reynolds and prandtl numbers according to their correlation han and krajnovic 2013 validated a new method which is very large eddy simulation vles with the experimental results at re 3 6 104 for the application of passive flow control on a d shaped cylinder they obtained well predicted results as the drag reduction of 18 via cfd results while it was 17 5 on the experimental study kumar and dhiman 2015 considered the flow characteristics of the scc placed inside a horizontal channel at 1 re 40 for different blockage ratios the size of recirculation zone for the scc was found to be increased with the reynolds number for the same blockage ratio parthasarathy et al 2017 prepared a study about flow and heat transfer characteristics of a row of scc for various gap ratios at re 100 small increments for the values of average drag coefficient strouhal number and mean nusselt number have been observed in terms of the gap ratio from 10 to 4 sisodia et al 2017 numerically examined the flow over an angled scc with the downstream square cylinder at 10 re 45 the time averaged c d value was found minimum at 90 although there are some studies on the flow characteristics of the scc in the literature comparison of different models and their validation with the experimental data with respect to the flow structure drag and pressure coefficient values have not been encountered scc has not been commonly considered comparing to circular cylinder hamed et al 2017 in the present paper the main aim is to investigate the flow characteristics over the scc by different turbulence models in addition the numerical results have been compared to that of the experimental data however blunt trailing edge on flow characteristics are more transparently observed by considering the scc in terms of unsteady flow structure than that of cc especially for turbulence modeling where capturing the unsteady flow structure is a challenging issue according to this issue comparison of different turbulence models over the present problem in broad perspective seems to be of great interest for cfd analyses 2 methodology 2 1 turbulence model turbulent flows are under the influence of fluctuating and irregular velocity fields these fluctuations mix transported quantities such as momentum and energy fluctuations can be in different scales and frequencies considering the computer capacity and solution time turbulent flows are harder to simulate directly in the practical engineering applications instead of solving these types of fluid problems directly the modified equations can be solved by adapting them to the problems but in the modified equations including additional variables it is required to define these variables in terms of known quantities the flow is described by the conservation laws for continuity and momentum navier stokes equations as follows 1 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 2 t ρ u i x i ρ u i u j ρ x i x j μ u i x j u j x i 2 3 δ ij u l x l x j ρ x i x j this solution method provides available solution for the mean flow variables and evidently decreases the computational effort for instance the governing equations do not require time derivatives and the result is obtained in less solution time and economically for the steady state flow condition therefore the reynolds averaged approach is mostly usable for practical engineering applications and the eddy viscosity turbulence models such as k ε and k ω and their derivatives are based on rans the other alternative approach for the transform navier stokes equations is the filtering it is basically a manipulation of the exact navier stokes equations to extract only the eddies that are smaller than the filter size which is usually taken as the grid size the filtering approximation also generates extra unknown terms which should be modeled smagorinsky 1963 lilly 1966 the mean flow characteristics are collected during the time dependent analyses in this case les provides an alternative approach in which the large eddies are calculated in a time dependent analysis 2 1 1 the standard rng and realizable k ε models three derivatives of k ε which are commonly used in the literature and in the practical engineering applications have similar forms with transport equations for k and ε the standard k ε model is a semi empirical form of transport equations for the turbulence kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate ε standard k ε model has some disadvantages on the cases including shear flow the estimation of the size of the recirculation region in the downstream or flow separation point in the calculation the flow is accepted as fully turbulent and the effects of molecular viscosity are negligible launder and spalding 1983 the turbulence kinetic energy k and its dissipation rate of ε are calculated from the following transport equations 3 t ρ k x i ρ ku i x i μ k x j g k ρε s k 4 t ρε x i ρ ε u i x i μ ε x j c 1 ε g k ε k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k s ε where the term of the g k is the turbulence kinetic energy generation owing to the mean velocity gradients and determined as 5 g k ρ u i u j u j x i the values of constant terms are c 1ε 1 44 and c 2ε 1 92 due to the lots of experiments for main turbulent shear flows including homogeneous shear flows and disrupting isotropic grid turbulence s k and s ε are user defined source terms the re normalization group rng k ε model is determined from the instantaneous navier stokes equations the feature that distinguishes rng k ε model from standard k ε model is the analytical derivation results in a model with constants different additional terms and functions in the transport equations yakhot et al 1992 6 t ρ k x i ρ ku i x i μ eff α k k x j g k ρ ε s k 7 t ρε x i ρε u i x i μ eff α k ε x j c 1 ε g k ε k c 2 ε ρ ε 2 k r ε s ε the basic difference between the rng and standard k ε models is due to the additional term in the ε equation given as 8 r ε c μ ρη 3 1 η η 0 1 βη 3 ε 2 k in this term the constant c μ 0 0845 η s k ε η 0 4 38 β 0 012 because of that the rng is a refinement of the standard k ε model which is more sensitive to the prediction of the effects of rapid strain and streamlines curvature compared to standard k ε model the values of constants terms are also different from the standard k ε model and these are c 1ε 1 44 and c 2ε 1 92 in addition to the standard and rng derivatives of k ε model ansys fluent ensures the realizable module as having the modifications of the other derivatives of k ε model it is used for the problems with rotating shear flows boundary free shear flows such as mixing layers planar and round jets channel flows flat plate boundary layers with and without a pressure gradient and separated flows within the framework of turbulent flow physics the realizable module includes specific mathematical limitation on the normal stresses shih et al 1995 the turbulent kinetic energy k is similar to standard and rng k ε models however the equation of the dissipation rate ε is fairly different from them as follows 9 t ρ k x i ρ ku i x i μ k x j g k ρε s k 10 t ρε x i ρεu i x i μ k x j ρ c 1 s ε ρ c 2 ε 2 k v ε s ε 11 c 1 max 0 43 η η 5 the default values of constant terms are nearly similar to that of the rng k ε model and these are c 1 1 44 and c 2 1 9 for realizable k ε model 2 1 2 shear stress transport sst k ω in this turbulence model the turbulent viscosity is replaced to explain the transport of the main turbulent shear stress the sst k ω model pieces together the virtues of the k ε and k ω models in terms of aerodynamic flows especially for boundary layers affected by reverse pressure gradients the validation of this model has been encountered for fluid structure interaction problems free shear layers zero or reverse pressure gradients in the boundary layers argyropoulos and markatos 2015 other modifications are to add a cross diffusion term in the ω equation and mixing function to provide that the model behaves more favorably in both near wall and far field regions menter 1994 the transport equations for the sst k ω are given as follows 12 t ρ k x i ρ ku i x i γ k k x j g k y k s k 13 t ρ ω x i ρω u i x i γ ω ω x j g ω d ω y ω s ω the terms of turbulence kinetic energy generation g k is calculated as in k ε turbulence model g ω is the generation of ω the terms of γ k and γ ω are the main difference of the k ω turbulence model from the k ε turbulence model which are indicated as the effective diffusity of k and ω y k and y ω describe the dissipation of k and ω respectively derivation of s terms is also described as the user defined source terms 2 1 3 large eddy simulation les the large eddy simulation is the turbulence model between the direct numerical simulation dns and rans which calculates large eddies directly on the other hand les models small eddies just like all turbulence models mesh independence study is required for all cfd analyses furthermore les requires substantially finer meshes than those used for rans nicolás pérez et al 2017 due to the fact that finer meshes are required for appropriate resolution of wall layers and estimation of transition to turbulence in the boundary layers celik 2003 therefore in this study mesh independence study was performed with respect to the les model in addition the analysis needs to be transient with acceptable time steps because the temporary resolution requirements are obtained by the dissipating scales rather than the time averaged flow or the energy containing eddies moreover the governing equations utilized for les are provided by filtering the time dependent navier stokes equations rodi 1997 li et al 2018 the incompressible navier stokes equations are filtered as follows 14 ρ t x i ρ u i 0 15 t ρ u i x j ρ u i u j x j μ u i x j p x i τ ij x j where τ ij represents the subgrid scale stress and it is described as 16 τ ij ρ u i u j ρ u i u j the navier stokes equation form for les eqs 14 and 15 demonstrates similarity to the reynolds averaged navier stokes equation eqs 1 and 2 the time dependent variables reveal the significant difference because these are filtered quantities in les equations which are mean quantities in rans equations due to the filtering the subgrid scale stresses are unknown and modeled as 17 τ ij 1 3 τ kk δ ij 2 μ t s ij this is the eddy viscosity model which is mostly used as subgrid scale model in this equation μ t is the subgrid scale turbulent viscosity and s ij is the rate of strain tensor and determined as follows 18 s ij 1 3 u i x j u j x i the eddy viscosity μ t is modeled in accordance with the smagorinsky lilly model 19 μ t ρ l s 2 s and smagorinsky constant 20 s 2 s ij s ij the c s was taken as 0 1 from homogeneous isotropic turbulence in the inertial sub range the mixing length l s for subgrid scale is computed 21 l s min κ d c s v 1 3 where the von karman constant is described as κ d is the distance to the closest wall and v is the volume of the computational cell 2 1 4 detached eddy simulation des des approach also known as the hybrid les rans was first proposed by spalart 1997 des turbulence model uses both the rans models near the wall and les model in the wake region of flow where unsteady and chaotic structure of flow occurred spalart 2000 in des models rans equations are used for the outside of the wake region of the flow to reduce the calculation time compared to the use of les in the whole flow volume for instance it includes rans simulation in the boundary layers and les run in the unsteady separated regions zhang et al 2019 there are three options of subgrid turbulence modeling for des turbulence model as spalart allmaras realizable k ε and sst k ω for the simulations carried out in this work sst k ω based des models were employed actually in the analyses des performs depending on a turbulent length scale l t to decide which approach is used during the simulation at the inlet boundary conditions des starts the computation with the sst model the formulation is the same as that of standard sst model except the length scale used in the calculation of the dissipation rate this is modified by local grid spacing δ if the turbulent length scale is greater than the grid spacing which is common in the regions with large eddies and chaotic flow nature les is activated in the des formulation the activation of les or the switching to sst model in des is controlled by a blending factor f menter and kuntz 2003 generally this factor takes the form as 22 f l t c des δ where c des is a constant 2 2 computational domain and boundary conditions in the present study the computational 3 d flow domain was created by taking into account of the experimental study of hamed et al 2017 a smooth scc having d c 50 mm diameter is placed vertically in the air flow domain within the dimensions 6 0d c x 20 0d c in the streamwise direction 6 0d c y 6 0d c in the vertical direction and 5 0d c z 5 0d c in the transverse direction as shown in fig 1 no slip boundary conditions are described on the physical surfaces of the scc model at the inlet boundary condition of the flow domain the uniform velocity inlet is defined as u 9 5 m s to obtain a reynolds number of re u d c υ 3 2 104 where υ is the kinematic viscosity of the air which is υ 1 46x10 5 m2 s is defined with the zero pressure gradient at the outlet boundary condition pressure outlet value is specified as zero pressure outlet boundary condition has been defined as a static gauge pressure at the outlet condition the boundary is open to the atmosphere which means the gauge pressure is to be set zero dogrul et al 2016 the free slip condition is applied at the top bottom and side walls of the flow domain the finite volume method is integrated to solve the transient and incompressible navier stokes equations with the pressure and velocity coupling with the splitting of the coupled type algorithm the second order implicit scheme was used for the pressure and the momentum spatial discretizations with green gauss solver to take the physical diffusion into account it is significantly influenced by numerical diffusion as a result of the central differencing schemes it should be appropriate approximation to conduct the spatial discretization the second order implicit scheme is also used for time integration 2 3 grid and time independence studies numerical results show that the unsteady prediction results are more accurate than those of the steady results due to the three dimensional unsteady turbulent flow regime in the downstream of the scc therefore the transient analyses were performed with different time step size to obtain the time independent results according to the grid structure iii shown in fig 3 in ittc standard for periodic phenomenon like vortex shedding applications it is advised to use at least 100 time steps per period anonymous 2011 in this study vortex shedding frequency was calculated and its value was 3 03 hz at reynolds number of 3 2 104 the period of the vortex shedding has been found as 0 33 s according to ittc the time step size is recommended to be around 0 0033 s therefore in this study the time step size has been defined between 0 0001 s and 0 05 s based on this result the dimensionless time step sizes are set to δt 1 0 95d c u δt 2 0 095d c u δt 3 0 0095d c u and δt 4 0 0019d c u 4 0x102 4 0x103 4 0x104 and 2 0x105 number of time steps respectively whose multiplications are equal to totally 20 s in actual time for all cases each time step consists of 20 iterations furthermore the convergence criteria of the numerical 3 d velocity components are detected at each time step by controlling the residuals of the all equations which are fixed to be solved by setting their variations less than 10 7 during the analyses the mean streamwise velocity is controlled for the study of time step independence as can be seen in fig 2 the analysis has been performed by using the les turbulence model and it showed that the differences between the results of the time step δt 3 and δt 4 are negligible for instance the saddle point in the downstream of the scc is nearly occurred at x d c 1 52 for δt 3 and δt 4 it is occurred at x d c 8 for δt 2 and not observed within the flow domain limits for δt 1 therefore the analysis has been continued by using the time step size δt 3 considering the total solution time cost and ittc standard another important factor that influences the solution time and accuracy of the results is the grid size to obtain a good performance from the cfd analyses enough element size is needed to solve the chaotic flow structure in the past of the bluff body in cfd studies the refinement factor represents the ratio of two grid sets which is advised to be greater than 1 3 celik et al 2008 tezdogan et al 2015 sezen et al 2018 dogrul 2019 for a better prediction the grid density should be increased in the near of the high gradient velocity distribution regions and grid structures with fine quality which should be built close to the fluid solid interaction regions in this study the computational domain was divided into seven sub domains for each grid arrangement as given in table 1 structured grids with quadrilateral elements were used in all the sub domains as can be seen in fig 3 in this figure the grid structure was compressed toward the rigid wall and four sets of grid arrangements were built for the grid independence study to ensure that the results are convincing in this study the refinement factor is between 1 68 and 2 28 therefore the results of the grid independence study in terms of the mean drag coefficient and the normalized mean streamwise velocity along the x axis and y axis have been presented in table 1 and fig 4 respectively the drag coefficient is the dimensionless form of the drag force which is acting on the surfaces of the bluff body in the streamwise direction given as follows 23 c d 2 f d ρ u 2 a where f d is the drag force in the streamwise direction ρ is the fluid density and a is the projection area of the front view the variations of mean c d distribution with different grid sizes are presented in table 1 as seen there is a quite change of c d among grid structures i ii iii but no significant difference between grid structures iii and iv which was under 1 in addition to the mean value of c d the variations of the normalized time averaged streamwise velocity components along the x axis and y axis at the downstream of the bluff body were examined as shown in fig 4a the saddle point is occurred approximately at x d c 1 52 for grid structures iii and iv while it is observed nearly at x d c 1 4 and x d c 1 28 for grid structures i and ii respectively apparently along the y axis in fig 4b the mean streamwise velocity distributions of grid structures i and ii are different from grid structures iii and iv at the location of the saddle point at x d c 1 52 the saddle point was also determined nearly at x d c 1 6 in the experimental study hamed et al 2017 in addition according to the solution time per time step a comparison between the grid structures was conducted the results revealed that the grid structure iii was more consistent than the grid structure iv and the difference between their results was about 40 according to the results given in table 1 and fig 4 due to the fact that the computer capacity and solution time cost are of great importance in cfd analyses further analyses were performed with the grid structure iii all numerical computations were performed on the dell workstation with 64 gb ram intel xeon cpu e5 2630 2 6 ghz 3 results and discussion in this study a numerical investigation of a flow around the scc was considered by using different turbulence models to do so les des sst k ω and realizable rng standard k ε turbulence models at re 3 2 104 were used for simulations and the obtained results were reported in figs 5 11 the dimensions of all images were normalized with the diameter as characteristic length of the scc as x d c and y d c the distributions of the values were given in the legend bar for the flow patterns the maximum layers of the flow patterns are displayed as a red background color while the minimum layers are indicated with a blue one 3 1 instantaneous and time averaged flow patterns the distribution of non dimensional time averaged streamwise u u u and cross stream v u u velocity components have been given in fig 5 the time averaged streamwise and cross stream velocities were normalized with the free stream velocity u as emphasized in the left column of fig 5 the flow structures in the wake region are almost equally symmetrical with respect to the centerline of the body the flow accelerates after passing the top and bottom corners of the scc and reaches its maximum value near that region the location of the saddle point in the experimental study hamed et al 2017 was approximately determined at x d c 1 6 referring to the streamline topology the nearest result to the experimental study was found to be x d c 1 52 by les turbulence model with 5 of relative error for the rest of turbulence models in the present study the saddle point was nearly obtained at x d c 1 17 for des and realizable k ε turbulence models and for standard k ε model and sst k ω model it was found at x d c 1 04 and x d c 0 92 respectively in addition the error magnitude values were found as 23 8 39 48 25 0 and 32 5 for of des sst k ω realizable k ε and standard k ε models respectively for rng module of k ε turbulence model the flow structure in the downstream of the scc was significantly different compared to those of the rest of applied cfd models in this study as well as to the experimental one in the downstream of the scc two symmetrical foci points with similar sizes were observed these foci cycling towards the opposite directions are consisted in the experimental and numerical results except for rng k ε model however in this model two symmetrical large scale foci points are observed after the first saddle point needless to say that the reverse flows have continued to extend beyond x d c 5 in the field of view additionally the saddle point could also provide some information on the other flow patterns one of them is the time averaged cross stream velocity contours that are presented in the right column of fig 5 due to the blockage effect the cross stream velocity is induced in the negative and positive directions then after the flow passing the scc two different symmetrical pairs of clusters were formed in the downstream the cluster regions with comparatively smaller size were centered at nearly x d c 0 6 in the experimental result hamed et al 2017 in cfd results the centers of small clusters are found at x d c 0 52 and x d c 0 31 by les and des turbulence models respectively however for sst k ω realizable and standard k ε models the small clusters are occurred approximately near the surface of the scc besides two small clusters are also obtained by rng k ε model however compared to the experimental results these clusters did not physically occur furthermore considerable time averaged cross stream velocity contours large size clusters occur between x d c 1 0 and x d c 3 0 in the experimental and les results where the centers of these clusters are aligned with the saddle points however for the rest of the turbulence models the effect of large size clusters is observed nearly up to 2 0d c and also the centers of these clusters related with the saddle points generally except for rng k ε model the effect of the time averaged cross stream velocity is diminished beyond x d c 3 5 and can be neglected for this reason in rng k ε model due to the formation of the second reverse flow the influence of cross stream velocity continues to the further another flow characteristic is the instantaneous and the time averaged vorticities that were normalized with d c u and given in fig 6 the instantaneous vorticity ω ω d c u results clarify the von karman vortex street owing to the vortex shedding on the experimental and numerical studies as in the experimental study hamed et al 2017 the flow separation occurs from the top and the bottom corners of the scc at all cfd results the vortex shedding in the downstream of the scc coming from the top side rotates in the clockwise direction while the one from bottom side turns in the counter clockwise direction and this situation creates the shear layer between the upcoming flow and the vortex shedding when the flow separates from the body surface small scale eddies roll up along the downstream these small eddies appear more prominently in the les and the des turbulence models results which are similar to the experimental study whereas it is not captured by the rest of the turbulence models similarly the instantaneous vorticity structures of the experimental les and des results the time averaged vorticity patterns ω ω d c u as shown in the right column of fig 6 are also in good agreement the small scale vorticity suppresses each other and is not visible in the time averaged vorticity patterns while the large scale symmetrical positive and negative vorticity patterns are occurred in the wake region of the scc as in the experimental results the time averaged vorticity patterns in the region beyond the saddle point lose their effect for all cfd results the closest results to the experimental base study hamed et al 2017 were obtained by les turbulence model between the values ω 5 x 10 3 while des model is somewhat structurally similar to these results it is worth mentioning that near the back side of the scc since the direction of the vortex shedding changes continuously the time averaged vorticity patterns are nearly equal to zero for the les and des results which are in good agreement with the experimental results however in the sst k ω turbulence model the clusters of negative and positive vorticity patterns approach to the back surface of the scc for the derivatives of k ε turbulence model with the realizable and standard modules the results are approximately the same but in the rng module a different vorticity structure is formed as in the velocity contours in fluid dynamics turbulence kinetic energy tke is the averaged kinetic energy per unit mass associated with eddies in turbulent flow emphasized in the normalized form as follows tke u 2 v 2 u 2 where u is the velocity fluctuations and defined as u u u u is the instantaneous velocity and u is the local mean velocity in the fig 7a the base study hamed et al 2017 showed a single peak of the tke observed in the wake region of the body around x d c 1 8 at the symmetry axis similar to the experimental results the effects of the velocity fluctuations begin within the first diameter downstream of the scc in the les turbulence model the maximum value of the normalized tke 0 0133 is determined around x d c 1 76 by the les turbulence model for the rest of the turbulence models the position and the strength of the tke changed according to the levels of the velocity fluctuations and the vortex shedding frequency of the flow in the des and sst k ω turbulence models the maximum value is nearly the same with that of the les while it is located around x d c 1 2 and x d c 1 0 respectively for the realizable and standard k ε models the maximum normalized tke values were found as tke 0 008 and tke 0 01 respectively however the rng module showed different structure due to the observed vortex shedding structure the reynolds stress correlations u v u 2 in fig 8 are decided on the momentum transfer in the downstream of the scc due to the time dependent behavior of the vortex shedding and the flow entrainment into the wake region of the scc the momentum transfer occurred as pointed out in the experimental study of hamed et al 2017 the small and large scales of asymmetric clusters have occurred with respect to the symmetry axis in the results of les and des appropriate with the lateral mean shear as in the normalized tke the center of maximum reynolds stress correlations u v u 2 0 1 was also nearly found at x d c 1 76 and x d c 1 2 by les and des turbulence models respectively the reynolds stresses are approximated by an eddy viscosity times the mean rate of strain tensor the strain rate tensor is obtained by the boussinesq approximation for the k ω and k ε turbulence models schmitt 2007 therefore all the components of the reynolds stresses are not available in the k ω and k ε turbulence models and their derivatives since these turbulence models are two equations based models hence the flow characteristics of reynolds stress results are only given by les and des turbulence models 3 2 one dimensional profiles of flow characteristics additional insights over the effect of the scc on its wake region have been presented by one dimensional flow profiles of u u u tke and u v u 2 along the x axis of symmetry plane of the scc i e y d c 0 and at x d c 1 2 locations in the range of y d c 1 35 which were selected for comparison purpose since these locations have also been used in the experimental study of hamed et al 2017 in fig 9 the superposition of the results of all turbulence models and the experimental base study for the comparison was shown the u u profiles along the axis of symmetry fig 9a indicate that velocity recovery was rapid as can also be seen in fig 5 recirculation bubbles with different dimensions have been observed for each case as it was pointed out above the saddle point of experimental study of hamed et al 2017 occurred at x d c 1 6 in the present study and the closest result is obtained by les model at x d c 1 52 needless to say that x d c 5 0 is not enough for the full recovery for all of the treated cases however the recovery rate is getting slower after the point of approximately x d c 1 75 for the models of des sst k ω realizable and standard k ε the recovery rate for decreasing trend is observed after nearly x d c 2 35 for both les result and experimental result of hamed et al 2017 these profiles also show the location where the velocity has the global minimum the global minimum was found at x d c 0 25 for rng k ε x d c 0 35 for sst k ω x d c 0 50 for standard k ε x d c 0 60 for des x d c 0 70 for realizable k ε x d c 0 92 for les and x d c 1 00 for experimental study of hamed et al 2017 in fig 9b indicates that along the x axis of symmetry the turbulent kinetic energy had the same decreasing trend after nearly x d c 3 00 for all the cases the global maximum was observed at x d c 0 65 for rng k ε x d c 0 80 for sst k ω x d c 1 30 for standard k ε x d c 1 1 for des x d c 1 35 for realizable k ε x d c 1 60 for les while the global maximum for the experimental study of hamed et al 2017 was reported to be at x d c 1 75 the symmetrical flow patterns are reported in fig 9 c d and e where the normalized streamwise velocity components tke values and reynolds stress correlations were given for x d c 1 2 as demonstrated in fig 9c the normalized streamwise velocity components reach the uniform value approximately at y d c 0 95 for rng k ε y d c 0 83 for sst k ω y d c 0 70 for standard k ε y d c 0 63 for des y d c 0 64 for realizable k ε y d c 0 55 for les and y d c 0 62 for experimental study of hamed et al 2017 after the point of approximately y d c 0 75 except the rng k ε model the tke values are getting closer to zero as can be seen in fig 9d this situation is clearly supported by the reynolds stress correlations of fig 9e due to the effect of fluctuations on both tke values and reynolds stress correlations the results of les and des turbulence models demonstrated a tendency similar to those of the experimental data of the base study 3 3 pressure and drag coefficients the pressure coefficient is a dimensionless number which describes the relative pressure values around a body in a flow field as defined in eq 24 24 c p p p 1 2 ρ u 2 where p is the local static pressure p is the static pressure in the free stream in fig 10 stagnation point where the pressure coefficient distribution reaches its maximum value of c p 1 0 at the first contact point of flow to the scc that is at this point the flow stagnates and the total pressure is equal to the static pressure with the flow acceleration a negative pressure zone is formed in the vicinity of the top and bottom corners of scc and continues at the downstream of the scc the negative pressure coefficient structure was found to be symmetric at the top and bottom sides of the scc and its minimum value was c p 1 36 generally the negative pressure region disappeared beyond the saddle point in the wake region of the bluff body considering the similarity of the experimental and les results in terms of instantaneous and time averaged flow patterns in figs 5 to 9 the pressure coefficient obtained by the les turbulence model can be regarded as real like condition as mentioned in the grid independence study the mean c d history is another important issue on flow over bluff bodies the drag force is composed of the pressure force acting on bluff body and the friction force from its surface the friction force is affected by the fluid because of the shear stress patterns and therefore the friction force is significantly important in terms of laminar flow conversely the pressure force is important for turbulent flow because it depends on the pressure difference between the upstream and the downstream of the bluff body the time dependent c d behavior obtained by les turbulence model is given in fig 11 as seen in the time dependent history of c d the fluctuations are occurred owing to the vortex shedding in the shear layer in addition the time averaged mean c d was found to be 1 107 with the les turbulence model for the rest of the turbulence models the mean values of c d were calculated and compared with the experimental results of hamed et al 2017 then reported in table 2 in this table δc d represents the difference between c d in the experiments and cfd it worth mentioning that in the experimental study the momentum method approximation was used by hamed et al 2017 to determine the mean c d in all turbulence models except the rng k ε and sst k ω the maximum difference value between the experimental and cfd results is found to be below 7 4 conclusions the flow characteristics over the scc at re 3 2 104 have been obtained numerically by six different turbulence models which are the most commonly used in the literature and engineering applications namely les des sst k ω and derivatives of k ε the cfd results were compared with those of the experimental study found in the literature the present paper has supported quantitative results about the turbulence model at the upstream and downstream of the scc at the beginning of numerical analyses the grid and time independence studies were done by les turbulence model as a result of these studies the non dimensional time step was found to be δt 0 0095d c u and the flow volume was created with about four million grid size the preferred lower time step and higher grid size increase the total solution time and it requires a powerful computing capacity taken together when the experimental and cfd results are compared except the rng k ε model flow characteristics practically looked similar to one another in this context some important flow characteristics such as streamline topology superimposed streamwise and cross stream velocity contours instantaneous and time averaged vorticity patterns tke reynolds stress correlations and pressure and drag coefficients were compared in detail when all the time averaged flow patterns are examined it is determined that the closest result to the experimental result is obtained by the les turbulence model the des turbulence model follows the les turbulence model in terms of flow structure similarity especially in the instantaneous vorticity results findings revealed that the les and des turbulence models have been very successful in capturing small scale vorticity components and the results were in good agreement with the experimental study however the outcomes demonstrated that sst k ω realizable and standard derivatives of k ε turbulence models showed relatively similar results in terms of flow characteristics when compared to one another the evidence from this study suggests for this type of flow problem the flow around the bluff body the les turbulence model leads to the closest result to the real like conditions however this turbulence model is only used for 3 d flow analysis this is a disadvantage for practical engineering applications because it increases the number of the grid and total solution time and requires high computer capacity according to the outcomes of this study if a 2 d analysis is required needless to say the des turbulence model may be recommended over other applied turbulence models author contribution statement sercan yagmur conceptualization methodology software validation investigation

studied by incorporating this proposed algorithm for a ship s slow steaming strategies keywords voyage optimization voluntary speed reduction fuel consumption metocean forecast uncertainties great circle routes 1 introduction in today s shipping industry the increasing regulatory requirements and intense competition caused by the market overcapacity have attracted great attention to developing energy efficiency measures which can help to gain more economic benefits and reduce air emissions from shipping among all the well known measures the so called weather routing system is regarded as one of the most promising approaches tillig et al 2018 according to the extensive market survey conducted by dnv gl 2015 weather routing systems have been implemented by 68 of shipping companies and 20 planned to be implemented to save fuel a weather routing system is used to propose courses schedules to help ships sailing to their destinations with certain pre defined objectives e g the expected time of arrival with minimum fuel consumption and air emissions etc bowditch 2002 james 1957 the core element of such a weather routing system is a proper voyage optimization algorithm which generates optimal ship routing based on the metocean meteorological and oceanographic conditions surrounding the ship s sailing area the ship s characteristics and operational capabilities as well as some constraints of a specific voyage simonsen et al 2015 wang et al 2019 normally the final outcome of a voyage optimization system is to optimize a ship s sailing waypoints and or speeds ship engine rpm and shaft power etc along the voyage conventional voyage planning methods often employ two dimensional optimization algorithms to search for the optimum trajectory waypoints composed of longitudes and latitudes of a given voyage dijkstra 1959 calvert 1990 larsson et al 2015 two dimensional voyage optimization algorithms can be generally divided into static grid based methods and dynamic grid based methods wang et al 2017 static grid based methods search for optimum waypoints in the pre defined grid waypoints systems various methods have been developed in the maritime community such as the dynamic programming method bellman 1952 dijkstra s algorithm dijkstra 1959 a algorithm hart et al 1968 etc from implementation perspectives chen 1978 calvert 1990 and de wit 1990 employed a search method for voyage progress as the stage variable and used a backward algorithm implemented with dynamic programming padhy et al 2008 proposed to utilize dijkstra s algorithm to solve the voyage optimization problem the optimal routes generated by the above static grid based methods should be theoretically identical when those methods are implemented in the same grid system with the same input variables dijkstra s algorithm employs a priority queue but dynamic programming is not able to accomplish in the same setting in voyage optimization problems one can implement dijkstra s algorithm as a dynamic programming algorithm where the same optimal results can be obtained however dijkstra s algorithm can be derived in many different ways for both single objective and multi objective voyage optimization problems and it is more efficient and better structured while the difference between the a algorithm and dijkstra s algorithm is that the a algorithm contains a heuristic function the function helps the algorithm to find the optimal solutions faster than dijkstra s algorithm but both algorithms should give identical results if only the sailing trajectory is of interest for the voyage optimization dynamic grid based methods define a voyage into several time stages at each stage the algorithms proceed with the voyage optimization and generate the local grid waypoint system simultaneously the most representative method is the isochrone method it was first introduced by james 1957 and modified by hagiwara 1989 to be more suitable for the computerization of ship voyage optimization the method can optimize a ship s voyage with minimum sailing time it can also be used to obtain a ship s optimal route with a minimum fuel cost by recursively adjusting propeller revolutions or engine power for a minimum time of arrival furthermore more complex voyage optimization algorithms have been developed in recent years such as 3d dynamic programming method by shao and zhou 2012 zaccone et al 2018 montewka et al 2019 3d isochrone method by lin et al 2013 lin 2018 improved isochrone method by roh 2013 evolutionary algorithms as well as multi objective approaches for voyage optimization problems by hinnenthal 2008 marie and courteille 2009 szłapczynska and smierzchalski 2009 maki et al 2011 vettor and guedes soares 2016 kim and kim 2017 veneti et al 2017 these algorithms can optimize both sailing trajectories and speeds at each waypoint but the computation efforts are also dramatically increased however the special settings in those 3d voyage optimization methods may only provide locally optimal voyage planning results furthermore due to the limited accepted waiting time from shipping end users to perform a voyage optimization larsson and simonsen 2014 the weather routing markets are mainly implementing two dimensional optimization algorithms for a ship s voyage planning moreover because of large uncertainties in a ship s voyage optimization process such as ship performance models metocean forecasts navigation methods etc more complex optimization algorithms may result in more uncertain voyage planning results for example a simple two dimensional voyage optimization method may generate an optimum route with its course significantly deviated from the shortest route great circle in order to avoid harsh metocean conditions due to large uncertainties associated with metocean forecast and ship speed power models as inputs in the voyage optimization algorithms a ship s actual fuel consumption along the generated optimum route with long sailing distance may be much higher than that sailing in the great circle route for example according to the post voyage analysis of a handy size container ship s winter navigation in 2008 the ship was recommended to sail toward significant south of the great circle to avoid harsh sea storms based on the uncertain metocean forecasts mao et al 2012 2016 but after the ship completed the voyage it is found that she encountered three storms in the optimum route as in fig 1 actually if the ship was sailing along the traditional great circle route the ship could easily avoid the three storms in the end it leads to a 100 increase of sailing time much higher fuel consumption and risks associated with 3 big storms encountered because the optimal route diverges far away from the great circle route considering various uncertain information inputted in complex voyage optimization algorithms manipulating a ship s trajectories course speed power rpm it can be more secure and efficient to optimize a ship s speeds along the great circle routes to avoid encountering big storms then the ship can slow down to let storms pass and speed up to catch the expected time of arrival along the shortest route chen 2013 while conventional ships are still sailing along the shortest great circle routes ballou et al 2008 therefore in this study we first propose a fixed course speed optimization method that can help to adjust a ship s speed along e g the great circle routes for minimum fuel voyage optimization secondly the potentials of the proposed optimization method for fuel saving are investigated by comparing with two dimensional voyage optimization methods that optimize a ship s sailing trajectories in particular due to large uncertain inputs in those voyage optimization methods the risk of even higher fuel costs when sailing along the generated optimum routes is also investigated finally the slow steaming strategy is widely used in today s shipping market to reduce fuel consumption the longer sailing time associated with even larger forecast uncertainties of metocean conditions and large reserved engine power will have a direct impact on a ship s voyage planning this study will investigate the capability of the proposed speed optimization algorithm which can be combined with the slow steaming to further reduce the fuel consumptions and air emissions for the completeness of the paper the following section 2 presents an overview of the voyage optimization algorithm in particular the proposed 2d fixed course speed optimization algorithm is present as well as the conventional fixed speed course optimization methods section 3 presents some uncertain inputs and their impacts on voyage optimization of a case study containership with full scale measurements when sailing in the north atlantic section 4 and 5 present results and discussion in detail regarding how uncertain metocean forecast and slow steaming operations can affect the ship s voyage optimization conclusion and references are given in the end 2 concept of voyage optimization in weather routing systems before the departure of an ocean crossing voyage captains should first make a preliminary voyage planning of a ship s sailing course and speed arrival times at various waypoints along the course according to some transport requirements for modern ship navigation a weather routing service is often engaged in the voyage planning process it helps a ship to find the best route based on metocean forecasts ship performance characteristics and special voyage requirements such as maximum allowed motions expected time of arrival eta etc the optimization is often involved in the voyage planning process therefore the planning purpose is not to completely avoid all harsh storm conditions but rather to seek the best balance to minimize the ship s operational cost and meanwhile satisfying other requirements such as ensure eta and ship safety in this study a ship s operational cost is limited to the ship s fuel consumption when sailing at sea 2 1 mathematical description of a voyage optimization problem since a ship can sail in any locations waypoints in the open sea between departure and destination ports the first step in a voyage optimization process is to discretize the ship s potential sailing area into a waypoint grid system two types of grid systems are used in today s weather routing market namely the dynamic and static grid systems as in fig 2 in both grid systems a ship s voyage is discretized into various sailing stages the dynamic grid system progressively discretizes a ship s sailing area i e it only discretizes the searching space from waypoints of the current stage until the next stage as in fig 2 a this grid system is often used in the so called isochrone or isopone methods which are more specialized in ensuring a ship s expected fastest time of arrival wang et al 2017 the static grid system discretizes the entire sailing area at the beginning of voyage planning the resolution of the grid should be predefined and cannot be adjusted in the middle of the searching optimization process as in fig 2 b because of its efficiency in computation most of today s ship voyage optimization algorithms are based on the static grid system it is also more capable to be implemented for voyage optimization with objectives of minimum fuel consumption therefore the voyage optimization algorithms used in this study are also based on the static grid system for the static waypoint grid graph system let a ship s voyage be discretized into n time stages 1 g p 0 t 0 g 1 g 2 g i g n 1 p n t n where p 0 and p n represent the departure and destination locations while t 0 and t n represent the departure and arrival times of the voyage then the departure and destination waypoints include both geographical and temporal information are denoted as 2 p 0 t 0 x 0 y 0 t 0 p n t n x n y n t n where x and y denote the longitudes and latitudes of the waypoints for the i th stage there are j i locations nodes in the grid graph system then the geographical locations of all waypoints in the i th stage are denoted by 3 g i p i 1 p i 2 p i j p i ji where p i j x i j y i j the spatial resolution δx x i j x i 1 j δy y i j y i 1 j is often defined based on the temporal resolution of metocean forecast data in the grid system waypoints between two adjacent stages can form various sub routes as the ship voyage advances i e the time stage increases as shown in fig 2 b possible candidate sub routes will increase exponentially furthermore each geographic location is also associated with different passing times which make the number of potential sub routes increase dramatically for example if a three dimensional optimization algorithm is used i e the sailing speed or engine power is set to vary at each location the number of potential sub routes in the i th sailing stage is proportional to the number of locations in each time stage multiplied by the pre defined sailing speeds at each location to the power i according to wang et al 2019 most of today s 3 dimensional optimization algorithms will generate locally optimum solutions this study will mainly investigate the efficiency of 2 dimensional voyage algorithms i e either to fix ship speed or engine power but allow sailing courses to vary or to fix ship course but allow speed to vary the grid systems of these two optimization methods are shortly presented as follows 2 1 1 grid graph system in great circle speed optimization gc speed optimization even in today s shipping market a large number of ships especially bulk carriers are still operated following the shortest distance routes i e the great circle routes for such a voyage planning fixed ship speed is roughly calculated by captains according to the expected time of arrival based on the metocean forecast and corresponding ship weather impact however with the computer aided voyage optimization the sailing speeds at each time stage along the voyage could be optimized to allow minimum fuel consumption and ensure eta in the gc speed optimization method the ship course is fixed to the great circle route and the discretized waypoints in the grid graph system are presented in fig 3 a in the grid graph system a time set time dimension is added to the discretized waypoints as nodes vertices a time set is an array denoted by t i which contains a series of feasible arrival times for each waypoint then the grid system can be written as 4 g p 0 t 0 p 1 t 1 p 2 t 2 p i t i p n 1 t n 1 p n t n where p i x i y i the time set t i associated with each location p i also represents various sailing speeds at p i first let discretize the time set with a given resolution δt and assign the same time set to all the waypoints p i viz 5 t i t 0 t 0 δ t t 0 2 δ t 2 t n t 0 where i 1 2 n 1 by considering a ship s engine capability and weather impact in waves let assume a ship s sailing speed can vary between 0 2v and 1 2v where v is the ship s service speed under this practical assumption some unrealistic passing times for certain waypoints will be automatically deleted by the method for example in fig 3 b the crosses represent unrealistic passing times because of either too fast low speeds required while the dots represent the possible passing times for the predefined ship speeds even though a ship s sailing course is set to be fixed in the gc speed optimization method a large number of potential ship routes needed to be calculated in the voyage planning in order to find the best optimum ship route normally some voyage optimization algorithms are needed to increase the searching efficiency with respect to certain sailing objectives such as specific eta minimum fuel and ensured safety etc in this paper the introduced grid system in fig 3 integrated with the dijkstra s optimization algorithm is proposed for the gc speed optimization method the details of the proposed optimization implementation will be further presented in section 2 3 2 1 2 grid graph system in constant speed course optimization cs course optimization alternatively another 2 dimensional voyage planning method is used to allow the ship sailing course trajectory to vary but with fixed speed power as inputs for the voyage optimization it is named as cs course optimization the waypoints in the grid graph system within this method are discretized around a reference ship course route most often the great circle is used as the reference route which covers the accessible sailing area of the voyage during the process of generating the graph constraints such as land crossing constraint maximum course change constraint are also included to eliminate the infeasible sub paths edges and improve the efficiency of any chosen optimization algorithm an example of the grid graph system in the cs course optimization method is shown in fig 4 similar to the grid system denoted by eq 3 the geographic locations of waypoints in the i th stage of the cs course optimization method can be written as 6 g i p i 1 t i 1 p i 2 t i 2 p i j t i j p i j i t i j i where p i j x i j y i j represents the geographic locations of the waypoints the passing time set t i j differs for waypoints from various stages and it also varies for waypoints at the same discretized sailing stages 7 t i j t i 1 1 δ p i j p i 1 1 v 0 t i 1 2 δ p i j p i 1 2 v 0 t i 1 j i 1 δ p i j p i 1 j i 1 v 0 where t i 1 j j 1 2 j i 1 represent the passing time set associated with the location p i 1 j δ p i j p i 1 j represents the distance between the two locations p i j and p i 1 j and v 0 denotes the pre defined input speed for voyage optimization it should be noted that if a ship encounters harsh metocean environments at sea the speed v 0 may be reduced involuntarily due to engine capabilities therefore the time set t i 1 j is not a pre defined variable but calculated during the optimization iteration process finally it should be noted that the number of potential waypoints i e passing times associated with one location increases exponentially as the voyage advances as 8 t i j n 1 i 1 j n for j 1 2 j i where t i j represents the number of passing times t i j and j n represents the number of discretized locations at the n th sailing stage by connecting all waypoints composed of both locations and all passing times at adjacent stages makes the potential sub routes increase exponentially as the increase of ship sailing stages the computation effort for finding optimum ship routes can easily exceed current computation capability therefore optimization algorithms should be employed to eliminate some badly performed sub routes based on the given predefined optimization objectives in the following the voyage planning objectives are defined as minimum fuel consumption and meanwhile keeping the expected time of arrival eta for a given voyage 2 2 implementation of optimization algorithms for voyage planning in the above grid graph system another important component is the sailing sub paths edges that connect two waypoints at adjacent stages the sub paths edges associated with the waypoints p i j are denoted by 9 a i j p i 1 1 t i 1 p i j p i 1 2 t i j p i j p i 1 j i 1 t i 1 j i 1 p i j where means that two waypoints are connected in both space and time for the voyage optimization every sailing sub path edge is assigned with sailing distance encountered metocean conditions w containing wind wave current data etc operational conditions u and ship sailing constraints viz 10 w a i j k h s t z s ω h s t z c u c v v w u v w v t 11 u a i j k v θ t where k represents the number of each sub path edge associated with the waypoint p i j for such a sub path edge the corresponding wave conditions are denoted by the significant wave height h s mean wave period t z and wave spectrum s ω h s t z the ocean current velocity is denoted by c u c v the wind velocity is denoted by v w u v w v etc the subscript u v of current and wind represent the velocity components of the horizontal current wind towards east and north respectively in eq 11 v and θ denote the ship s sailing speed and heading angle relative to waves respectively the ship sailing constraints includes land crossing constraints marine engine power constraints and safety constraints etc here safety constraints are treated as the severest metocean conditions a ship allowed to be encountered the variables within eqs 10 11 for all waypoints and sub paths edges should be extracted stage by stage since the passing time t i j of the waypoint p i j can only be calculated at the precedent sailing stage based on the extracted information the sailing operational costs associated with the sub paths edges can be calculated through the instantaneous cost objective function in terms of the wave environment w and operational condition u each edge a i j k is assigned with a cost weight c i j k 12 c i j k f u p i j k w p i j k δ t i j k where δ t i j k is the time needed to sail from the precedent waypoints to the current waypoint the cost function c i j can be of different forms e g fuel consumption maximum ship motions estimated time of arrival eta fatigue damage accumulation or crack propagation in a ship s structure wang et al 2017 etc since this study investigates the voyage optimization with minimum fuel consumption a ship s fuel performance model is needed to estimate the ship s fuel consumption rate f u w the cost function of the entire voyage can be estimated by 13 c t 0 t n f u g w g d t where f u g w g is the instantaneous cost function for waypoints in the grid system g as in eqs 4 and 6 with metocean environments w and operational conditions u t 0 and t n are the departure time and arrival time respectively during the optimization process the instantaneous cost function is computed to get the fuel consumption rate for all waypoints at the current stage finally the overall objective is to find suitable waypoints p and operational control sets u p these waypoints form to the optimum route with a minimum value of c and encountering metocean conditions w p 14 p p 0 p 1 ϕ 1 t 1 ϕ 1 φ 1 p i ϕ i t i ϕ i φ i p n 1 ϕ n 1 t n 1 are the indexes of geographic and temporal locations in the i th discretized sailing stage of the optimum route the purpose of any voyage optimization algorithm is to find the indexes of the waypoints in the established grid graph system as in figs 3 and 4 to form an optimum ship route after establishing the grid graph system for searching optimum routing solution around the ship s sailing area the so called dijkstra s method will be implemented as the optimization algorithm for both the gc speed optimization and the cs course optimization methods the dijkstra s algorithm operates in a waypoint grid graph system by visiting sub paths edges starting from the departure node waypoint it follows two basic principles dijkstra 1959 firstly a sub route of the shortest route is itself a shortest route and secondly with a given shortest distance x between points a and c a path going from point a to c through a third point b will always be of a distance greater than or equal to x the main difference between implementing the two optimization methods i e gc speed optimization and cs course optimization methods is how to construct the grid graph system in the grid graph system of the cs course optimization the arrival time of each waypoint is an unknown variable during the iteration of dijkstra s algorithm in the cs course optimization the optimal arrival time of each waypoint is assigned as an identical attribute of the location vertex in the grid graph system while in the gc speed optimization the arrival times of each geographical location are pre assigned as various waypoints thus the costs of the sub path edges can be pre calculated before implementing dijkstra s algorithm thus the graph generated by the gc speed optimization is considered as a static weighted graph in which each edge is given a numerical weight dijkstra s algorithm can be implemented to search the path with the lowest cost in the weighted graph 2 3 cost function of ship fuel performance calculation in this study the ship s speed engine power is chosen as inputs for voyage optimization the instantaneous cost function f u g w g here chosen as the fuel consumption rate along a sub path edge is not a simple explicit function but should be calculated following systematic procedures as in fig 5 while some statistical methods are also available to calculate the cost function as in mao et al 2016 firstly based on the encountered sea conditions a ship s characteristics and operational profiles etc the ship s total resistance can be estimated by adding the calm water resistance and the added resistance due to wind wave and current the total resistance needs to be compensated by the thrust force provided by the engine and propellers dependent on the engine type and propeller properties used on a specific ship various propulsion efficiencies are estimated to get the final fuel consumption for the input sailing speeds in the resistance calculation one of the main parameters is the speed through water v the speed through water is approximated by subtracting the current speed v c from a ship s speed over ground v g also known as the gps speed based on the simple approximation formula from iso15016 2015 the total resistance is estimated by 15 r t o t u w r t r a a r a w where u is the ship s operational conditions under the encountered metocean conditions denoted by w r t o t is the ship s total resistance r t is the calm water resistance r a a is the added resistance due to wind r a w is the added resistance due to waves the calm water resistance r t can be estimated by empirical formulas obtained by regression from a large number of test results in holtrop and mennen 1984 and ittc 2015 it is composed of frictional resistance the resistance of appendages wave making and wave breaking resistance the additional pressure resistance of bulbous bow and immersed transom stern etc it gives rather a good estimation of average resistances for some standard ship types however some errors or uncertainties cannot be avoided in these formulas to get the wetted surface viscous pressure and wave pattern resistance tillig et al 2018 for a reliable voyage optimization it is essential to accurately estimate the ship s added resistance in waves the waves under real sea conditions are known as irregular waves which can be represented as a linear superposition of the components of regular waves the added resistance due to regular waves of a unit wave amplitude and a series of wave frequencies ω under the operational condition v θ is often divided into two components 16 r a w ω v θ r a w r ω v θ r a w m ω v θ g θ where r awr and r awm denote wave reflection and ship motion induced resistances v and θ represent a ship s speed and the angle between the wave and the ship different empirical formulas and hydrodynamic theory based numerical methods are available to get the added resistance due to waves furthermore based on the results of wave resistance at various wave basin a gaussian function g θ is proposed here to model the impact of heading angles for added resistance in waves in this study the mean added resistance when sailing under an actual sea state of irregular waves represented by a significant wave height h s and mean wave period t z is estimated by integrating the product of wave spectrum s ω and the ship s wave resistance r aw as in eq 16 viz 17 r a w 0 s ω h s t z r a w ω v θ d ω where s ω h s t z is described by the ittc the international towing tank conference wave spectrum the wind resistance is estimated by 18 r a a 0 5 ρ a c a a ψ w r r e f a x v v w r r e f 2 0 5 ρ a c a a 0 a x v v g 2 where r aa is the resistance increase due to relative wind c aa is the wind resistance coefficient ρ a is the mass density of air a xv is the transverse projected area above the waterline including superstructures ψ wrref is the relative wind direction v wrref is the relative wind velocity at the reference height v g is the measured ship s speed over ground then the total resistance r tot is estimated as the summation of all the calm water resistance added resistances due to wind wave shallow water etc finally for the cost of the sub path edge associated with the waypoint p i j under the operation conditions u p i j k and encountering sea environment w p i j k a ship s fuel consumption under the sailing speed through water v i j k at the waypoint can be estimated by 19 c i j k p b i j k s f o c t i j k t i 1 j k and p b i j k r t o t u p i j k w p i j k v i j k η 0 η h η s where sfoc unit g kwh is the specific fuel oil consumption an example of sfoc for the case study ship is presented in fig 6 t i j k t i 1 j k is the sailing time from the i th stage to the next stage and varies depending on individual waypoints η h η o η s are the hull efficiency propeller open water efficiency and engine shaft efficiency that can be estimated by holtrop and mennen 1984 3 uncertain components as input in voyage optimization for a ship s voyage planning with minimum fuel consumption there are five major components as inputs to the voyage optimization system as in fig 7 except for the sailing constraints that must be insured for ship safety large uncertainties are expected in other inputs shown as the green containers in fig 7 this study investigates uncertainties associated with metocean forecasts ship fuel consumption model and optimization methods the forecast and hindcast of metocean conditions are retrieved from ecmwf mars ecmwf 2019 and era5 datasets copernicus 2019 respectively taking into account the uncertainties associated with all these inputs and operational strategies very sophisticated 3 dimensional optimization algorithms which generate an optimal route significantly different from the shortest route may not be the best route from a post voyage analysis on the contrary those complex optimization methods based on uncertain inputs may provide worse results than the simple great circle sailing 3 1 uncertainties to model a ship s fuel consumption for a ship s voyage optimization with minimum fuel consumption the objective j is to minimize the total fuel cost consumed along a given voyage thus the instantaneous cost function f is another important input in voyage optimization methods for a minimum fuel voyage optimization the cost function is to describe a ship s speed and power relationships in terms of encountered metocean environments as in subsection 2 3 in the cost model the most important parameter is the added resistance speed loss in waves i e the so called weather impact the most accurate way to get the cost model is based on a ship s full scale measurement of her energy performance when sailing at sea however these measurements are seldom available for such purpose a practical voyage optimization system often utilizes well developed models to calculate the fuel consumption for various sailing conditions according to skoglund et al 2015 and wang et al 2019 if an energy performance model can describe the basic characteristics of a ship s speed power relationship at sea it should give rather good results of voyage optimizations while if there is a fundamental difference in various energy performance models their usage in voyage optimizations will generate very uncertain solutions for optimum ship routes several semi empirical models were proposed to describe such a performance model that can be used for voyage optimization such as kwon s method kwon 2008 the semi empirical method based on liu et al 2016 liu s method for example fig 8 compares the speed losses under different sea states estimated by the two methods in comparison with the full scale measurements of a chemical tanker the full scale measurements contain some basic information regarding the ship s sailing such as times locations speeds and heading associated with all passing waypoints recorded every 15 min as well as the shaft power in fig 8 the red line represents the speed loss estimated from full scale measurement data it is clearly indicated that the speed loss estimated by those methods differ significantly from that obtained from the measurement in particular when the encountered significant wave height h s increases the large discrepancy of speed losses estimated by different models become more pronounced in order to quantify the impact of different energy performance models to voyage optimization the kwon s method and the semi empirical method based on liu et al 2016 are employed to estimate the ship s costs fuel consumption in the two proposed voyage optimization methods as in section 2 1 a spring voyage20090329 is used to demonstrate the uncertainty of voyage optimization due to different energy performance models the two optimization algorithms are 1 gc speed optimization and 2 cs course optimization figs 9 and 10 present the results of the optimum ship routes generated by the two voyage optimization methods while the two weather impact models are used as inputs for fuel consumption estimation fig 9 presents the ship s sailing speeds encounter h s and relative heading angles 0 means head sea operations while 180 means following sea operations along the optimum ship routes generated by the gc speed optimization method in which the two weather impact models are used as inputs when the cs course optimization method is used for the ship s voyage optimization fig 10 a presents trajectories of the two generated optimum ship routes fig 10 b presents similar results as fig 9 but for the routes generated as in fig 10 a the differences in ship trajectories sailing speeds and encountered h s along different optimum ship routes indicate the influence of weather impact models on a ship s voyage optimization table 1 lists the sailing distance eta and fuel consumptions of those optimum ship routes generated by various voyage optimization methods in comparison with the ship s actual sailing routes as well as the conventional great circle sailing routes for the voyage 20090309 it should be noted that all ship s fuel consumptions estimated from the kwon s method are scaled to make the actual fuel costs estimated by the two weather impact models equivalent in general a large difference is observed between optimized ship routes and the ship s actual sailing even for ship routes generated by the same voyage optimization method there are about 4 difference in sailing distance and more than 10 difference in fuel consumption the difference is solely caused by the uncertainties associated with fuel cost models therefore large uncertainties will be expected in a ship s voyage optimization if various fuel cost models are used it should be noted that the difference in relative wave heading angle among various methods is relatively small especially for routes with the same trajectories gc optimization method this is because storms are always moving from the west to the east in the north atlantic sailing area 3 2 uncertainties in forecasts of metocean conditions in a ship s voyage optimization the instantaneous cost function f should be computed for all searching waypoints one of the main inputs in f is the forecast metocean conditions at these waypoints w p due to the limited spatial and temporal resolutions of provided the forecast data some interpolation methods should be used to approximate w p which is often different from the actual metocean conditions at these waypoints more importantly due to the complexity and imperfection of the physical description in today s metocean forecast models as well as some uncertain and incomplete initial inputs into the forecast models the forecast metocean data is inevitable including large uncertainties for example the accuracy of weather forecasts will be significantly reduced after 3 5 days it can even lead to unreliable forecast information after 5 days to describe these forecast uncertainties an ensemble forecast technique is used to generate the scatter of weather forecast by varying the initial environmental inputs into the metocean forecast models fig 11 b presents an example of significant wave height h s for a waypoint located at the north atlantic as in fig 11 a the plotted h s is obtained from the ensemble forecast and hindcast reanalysis data it should be noted that the normal forecast metocean conditions is one of the ensemble forecast samples the scatter of forecasted h s become wide after 3 days it indicates that the accuracy of the forecasted metocean conditions starts to decrease a north atlantic crossing voyage normally costs 5 7 days for fast containerships metocean forecast during this period is required for voyage optimizations if a voyage optimization method is based on an uncertain forecast of metocean parameters a generated optimum ship route may differ significantly from the shortest route to avoid harsh storms if the ship s sailing strictly follows that optimum route her actual encountered metocean environment maybe even worse than that sailing along the shortest route one such example has been presented in fig 1 furthermore the sailing distance of those optimum ship routes may be much longer than the shortest routes it may cost much more fuel and sailing time leading to high operational costs therefore it is important to investigate the reliability and sensitivities of voyage optimization algorithms due to uncertain metocean forecasts as inputs in case of an extremely uncertain forecast from shipping companies perspectives it is important to compare the risks and benefits when different voyage planning results are generated by different methods 3 3 uncertain operation strategies for voyage planning in today s shipping market captains are using different operational strategies to operate their ships jeong et al 2019 such as sprint and loiter sailing high speed sailing for the majority of a ship s voyage and slow down at the final leg to ensure arrival on time ballou et al 2008 constant speed constant rpm or engine power sailing etc furthermore since a ship s resistance is normally proportional to her sailing speed to the power between 3 and 4 lowering a ship s sailing speed can significantly reduce her resistance and thus fuel consumption therefore slow steaming is a common operation strategy today to minimize a ship s fuel consumption when sailing at sea for example the actual engine powers of a fleet of containerships and vlcc from their worldwide operation are extracted from their noon reports and presented in fig 12 the average engine power of containerships navigation is only about 30 of a ship s mcr while the average sailing engine power for the vlcc ships is about 50 mcr however slow steaming can bring many challenges to shipping companies such as the economic feasibility of longer sailing time for certain voyages furthermore a ship s engine and propeller are designed with their highest propulsion efficiencies at a ship s service speed and rpms the engine and propeller running efficiencies of a slow steaming ship may be significantly reduced leading to high total fuel cost and the reduced sailing speeds may also change the capability of a ship s voyage optimization strategies to avoid harsh sea environments for the slow steaming voyage optimizations the ship s reserved engine power may give the gc speed optimization algorithm more freedom to adjust the sailing speeds to avoid a harsh sea environment moreover it is essential to investigate proper voyage optimization algorithms that should be combined with a ship s slow steaming operations since the longer sailing time can further increase the uncertainties of metocean forecast during this sailing period 3 4 the case study ship voyages and investigation summary in this study a 2800teu container ship sailing in the north atlantic is chosen as a case study ship mao 2014 the main particulars of the ship are listed in table 2 for this case study ship the full scale measurements of the ship s sailing during the entire year 2009 are available to this study for the investigation of the two proposed voyage optimization methods with respect to the minimum fuel consumption a ship s voyage is discretized into a series of time stages waypoints composed of locations passing times and sailing speeds the ship energy performance model presented in eq 15 using the semi empirical wave resistance model based on liu et al 2016 is utilized to estimate the cost fuel consumption of all searching waypoints this study mainly investigates the impact of uncertain metocean forecast as inputs on a ship s voyage optimization solutions with an intention to propose recommend a robust optimization method to compensate forecast uncertainties the recommended optimization method should not be very sensitive to such forecast uncertainties fig 13 presents the trajectories of all the measured voyages which are divided into westbound voyages and eastbound voyages for the westbound voyages large scatter is observed in their sailing trajectories in particular for the westbound winter voyages this is because storms in north atlantic always moves from the east to the west traditionally it is rather important for captains to carefully plan their route for westbound winter voyages to ensure ship cargo safety and save fuel while eastbound voyages usually involve fewer aids from modern weather routing systems it is shown that the trajectories for all eastbound voyages are quite similar i e the simple rhumb line operations except for two winter voyages one towards the north and the other towards the south in order to demonstrate and compare the capabilities of the proposed voyage optimization methods with conventional sailing methods five westbound and four eastbound voyages including both winter and summer seasons are chosen as case study voyages for the following analysis the following sensitivity and capability analysis of various voyage optimization methods due to uncertain metocean parameters as inputs are divided into two sections based on two operational strategies normal sailing operation and slow steaming operation shown in fig 14 both forecast and hindcast metocean data are used as inputs for the comparison the forecast data is updated every 12 h and the time resolution of the forecast data is 3 h and every update of the forecast data contains 10 days of weather forecast information the fuel consumption is estimated by the semi empirical models based on liu et al 2016 presented in section 2 3 four voyage planning methods as in fig 14 are executed to generate optimum routes for those case study voyages through comparing the effectiveness of these voyage optimization methods considering uncertain metocean inputs this study is also expected to demonstrate the capability of the proposed gc speed optimization method when a ship s sailing metocean environment is very uncertain 4 impact of metocean forecast uncertainties on voyage optimization methods for the following impact analysis the departure and destination locations for the three voyage planning methods great circle sailing gc speed optimization and cs course optimization as in fig 14 are assumed to be the same as the measured case study voyages while the total sailing times i e eta are set as close as possible to the measured eta for each case study voyage the uncertainty and comparison analysis using various voyage optimization methods are conducted by the following steps 1 the three voyage optimization methods are executed using metocean forecast before the voyage starts the sailing distance and eta of all the routes are obtained the forecast metocean conditions along all the three generated optimal routes and the measured route are extracted from the forecast metocean dataset mars then fuel consumptions along all the routes are estimated by the cost model presented in section 2 3 using the forecast metocean data it is denoted as the forecast fuel in the following result tables furthermore the results i e speed series encountered h s and relative heading angles of the three optimal routes and one measured route are presented in the left plots of following figures which show the impact of various voyage optimization methods on a ship s voyage planning results 2 the actual metocean conditions along the four routes generated in step 1 are extracted from the hindcast metocean dataset era5 then the actual fuel consumptions along the three optimal and one measured route are estimated by the same cost model as step 2 but using the actual metocean conditions from hindcast it is denoted as the hindcast fuel in the following result tables 3 the cs course optimization method and the gc speed optimization method are executed to generate two optimal routes using the hindcast data and generate two optimal routes using the forecast data similar results as in step 1 of all the four optimal routes are compared in the right plots of the following figures which shows the impact of uncertain metocean inputs on a ship s voyage planning results 4 1 general results on westbound voyage optimizations the sailing distance sailing time eta forecast fuel consumption and actual fuel consumption for all these investigated voyages are listed in table 3 for all the chosen westbound voyages in general the three investigated voyage optimization planning methods behave much better than the ship s actual sailing in terms of fuel consumption longer sailing distance often leads to high fuel consumption for example the actual sailing routes consume on average 7 less fuel than the conventional great circle shortest distance sailing routes this is partly because the sailing distance of actual routes is about 6 longer than the great circle routes one exceptional case is the voyage20091119 whose route is only a little longer but consumes about 2 less fuel than the great circle route this voyage will be further investigated in detail in the following subsections furthermore when various voyage optimization methods are compared using metocean forecast information the gc speed optimization method generates better results for most of the case study voyages except the voyage20090202 which consumes significantly higher fuel than other voyages probably due to encountered harsh metocean environments and much longer sailing time and distance due to rather longer sailing distance the forecast metocean data becomes much more uncertain the uncertain forecasts lead to the fact that the ship routes generated by the best performed optimization method i e cs course optimization method based on the metocean forecast will actually consume 3 more fuel than the gc speed optimization method if the hindcast actual information is taken into account this voyage will be further investigated in the following subsections finally it should be noted that simple 2 dimensional voyage optimization methods that help to seek for calm navigation environments by deviating their sailing course from the great circle shortest distance routes may result in higher fuel consumption for most of the chosen westbound voyages for relatively calm sea navigations speed optimizations along the great circle courses should be able to generate good voyage planning to reduce fuel cost the course optimization method may work well for winter voyages of harsh metocean environments such as the optimization for the voyage20090202 using forecast metocean information however large uncertainties in metocean forecast especially for a long sailing voyage with harsh sea environments may counteract benefits from the course optimization methods it is confirmed by the optimization results for the voyage20090202 using both forecast and hindcast metocean conditions 4 2 sensitive study of westbound voyage optimization due to uncertain metocean data two particular westbound voyages i e voyage20090202 and voyage20091119 are selected to further investigate how uncertainties of metocean inputs can affect results from various voyage optimization methods in terms of minimum fuel consumption trajectories of the optimized routes generated by various optimization methods are presented in fig 15 a for the voyage20090202 and fig 15 b for the voyage20091119 respectively in addition to the ship s actual sailing routes and the great circle routes the optimal routes generated by the cs course optimization methods using both the forecast and hindcast metocean information are also presented in the figure for the voyage 20090202 due to harsh sea environments along the winter voyage the actual sailing course and optimal course generated by the cs course optimization method differ significantly from the great circle route the voyage 20091119 encounters very calm sea conditions the actual sailing course is similar to the great circle route the cs course optimization method using hindcast and forecast metocean data generates very close optimal courses but the two optimized courses differ toward the north than the great circle route the results of optimized routes generated by various methods as in the step 1 and step 3 for the two selected case study voyages are presented in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively the results of the step 1 are shown in fig 16 a for the voyage 20090202 fig 17 a for the voyage 20091119 the results for the two voyage analysis in the step 2 are shown in figs 16 b and fig 17 b for the voyage 20090202 the largest encountered h s exceeds 10 m for all the generated routes as shown in fig 16 a the actual sailing route was going toward the southmost in order to avoid hitting large storms it is shown that the most efficient way to avoid severe sea environments is to navigate away from the gc route both the actual sailing routes and the route generated by the cs course optimization encounter relative smaller h s than the gc routes because of their divergence from the gc route in comparison with the conventional great circle fixed speed voyage planning method the gc speed optimization method avoids the first storm by significantly reducing ship speed but due to the constraint on eta the sailing speeds cannot be reduced along the entire voyage then the ship was hit by the second storm this voyage will be further studied by the slow steaming operation in the next section the difference in relative wave heading angles among the optimal routes generated by various methods is quite small especially for the gc speed optimization methods it means that the fuel saving by this method is mainly due to the speed adjustment when encountering different metocean conditions while the difference in heading angles between the great circle routes and the cs course optimization methods is relatively large which contributes to different encountered metocean conditions by adjusting a ship s sailing trajectories this is true for the following analysis and results of the relative wave heading angles are not presented for the slow steaming analysis in section 5 for the voyage20091119 because of relatively calm sea environments the gc speed optimization method can easily avoid big h s by slowing down at the beginning of the voyage furthermore when encountered with large sea environments the ship s sailing speeds at the storm area are often relatively smaller to reduce fuel consumption but the conventional great circle sailing and the actual sailing also encountered much higher h s than the routes optimized by the two methods figs 16 b and 17 b compare the results of voyage optimizations performed by the two methods i e gc speed optimization and cs course optimization methods due to uncertainties between the forecast and hindcast metocean conditions even for such short ship routes of about 4 days the metocean uncertainties will cause different optimization results in terms of both sailing course speeds and encountered h s the fuel consumption along these optimized routes for the two westbound voyages are listed in table 4 the fuel consumptions are estimated using metocean conditions extracted from the step 1 2 and 3 respectively large scatters of fuel consumption along various optimized routes can be observed due to the metocean uncertainties for the voyage 20090202 if the weather forecast is used for the voyage optimization the cs course optimization method can generate an optimal route with 10 less fuel cost than the gc speed optimization method however the actual fuel consumption estimated by the hindcast data along the optimal route generated by the cs course optimization method is actually 3 more than the other method for the voyage 20091119 due to relatively calm metocean environments and short sailing time the gc speed optimization always generates better voyage planning results but the benefits of fuel saving are reduced when the hindcast metocean data instead of the forecast metocean data is used for the voyage optimization 4 3 general results and sensitive study on eastbound voyages optimizations in the north atlantic ocean the storms are usually moving from the east to the west normally it is relatively easy for captains to plan eastbound voyages which are often sailing in either conventional great circle or rhumb line routes especially in summer similar as in table 3 the characteristics of optimized routes generated by various optimization methods are listed in table 5 for the three out of four chosen eastbound voyages the gc speed optimization method can produce the best results of voyage planning in terms of minimum fuel consumption in comparison with actual sailing it can save about 7 5 of fuel in comparison with the cs course optimization methods it can save about 2 5 3 of fuel dependent on if the forecast or hindcast metocean data is used for the analysis while for the voyage20090121 the cs course optimization method generated routes with 3 5 less fuel cost than the gc speed optimization method however when the hindcast data is used for the two voyage optimization methods the fuel consumption of two generated routes are very similar as shown in table 4 but the cs course optimization method generates route about 6 5 longer than the gc speed optimization method which may lead to quite big uncertainties of actual fuel consumptions furthermore the trajectories of optimized routes generated by different optimization methods are presented in fig 18 for the voyage 20090121 these trajectories differ significantly when different methods are compared as shown in fig 19 a the sailing speeds and encountered h s also differ significantly for routes generated by different methods the gc speed optimization method can guide the ship to operate fast when encountering very calm sea conditions while slow down for large sea conditions because the weather impact considered in the ship s fuel cost models for the following sea operations is not as serious as in the head sea operations the optimal route generated by this method still encountering higher h s than the cs course optimization method in addition the trajectories of routes optimized by the cs course optimization method are quite similar when either forecast or hindcast metocean data is used however the sailing speeds and encountered h s shown in fig 19 b as well as the fuel consumption listed in table 4 differ significantly due to such metocean uncertainties it also indicates a big impact of uncertain metocean forecast on voyage optimizations in particular for long sailing routes with harsh metocean conditions 5 impact of uncertain metocean forecast on slow steaming voyage optimizations in this study one winter westbound voyage voyage20090202 one winter and one summer eastbound voyages i e voyage20090121 and voyage20090618 are chosen to compare the capabilities of the gc speed optimization and the cs course optimization methods to handle metocean uncertainties during the slow steaming operations in the previous analysis the ship s actual sailing uses an 85 mcr maximum continuous rating as the service engine power in the voyage optimization analysis in this study two slow steaming settings i e 75 and 50 of service engine power corresponding to 63 75 and 42 5 mcr are chosen to investigate the capabilities of various voyage optimization methods 5 1 results of voyage optimization and uncertain metocean forecast for slow steaming operations similar as in table 4 the two optimization methods i e gc speed optimization and cs course optimization methods are used to investigate the impact of metocean uncertainties on voyage optimizations for the two chosen voyages the voyage optimization results of eta sailing distance and fuel consumption estimated using both forecast and extracted hindcast metocean data are listed in table 6 then the hindcast metocean data is used for the voyage optimizations where the etas are assumed to be the same as the forecast optimization the corresponding sailing distance and fuel consumption are presented in table 6 as well the voyage optimizations are carried out for the service power p s 75 and 50 service power operations respectively for the westbound winter voyage20090202 when the forecast metocean information is used for the voyage optimization of minimum fuel consumption the cs course optimization method can generate better results than the gc speed optimization method for both the normal power and two slow steaming operations this is partly because very unusual harsh sea conditions two big storms occurred during this voyage and strict requirements on eta setup in the gc speed optimization method ship speeds cannot be largely reduced to wait for the storms to pass but the slow steaming operations show big capabilities to enable more flexibility of speed variation in the gc speed optimization method i e a ship can catch up with a required eta even speeds have been significantly reduced at the beginning of a voyage for example the difference of fuel consumption between the course optimization and speed optimization methods is reduced from 10 to less than 5 from the normal power operations to the 50 slow steaming operations if the weather forecast is used while if the actual weather information along those optimized routes is extracted from the hindcast data the fuel consumptions along the routes generated by the gc speed optimization method are actually less than the cs course optimization method for the normal power and 50 slow steaming operations when the hindcast metocean information is used for the comparison of different voyage optimization methods even though the cs course optimization method generates better voyage planning with 4 less fuel consumption than the gc speed optimization method for the normal operation a ship route with 10 less fuel consumption is generated by the gc speed optimization method for the 50 slow steaming operation furthermore the metocean uncertainties i e the difference between forecasts and hindcast metocean data have a very large impact on the ship s voyage optimizations for the optimized ship routes using the forecast data the actual fuel consumption estimated using the extracted hindcast data differ on average 16 with its maximum value up to 25 when both the forecast and hindcast metocean data is used for the voyage optimizations the fuel consumption along routes generated by the same method can differ by about 11 those uncertainties can totally counteract all benefits of fuel saving from any voyage optimization methods therefore it should be extremely cautious to use the optimal routes from the course optimization method if the routes differ significantly from our conventional routes such as the great circle routes it should also be noted that when reducing the engine power to 75 of the normal power setting for the slow steaming the fuel saving is not very obvious about 6 5 but the fuel consumption of 50 slow steaming is significantly reduced about 40 because the voyage optimization is more capable to search for sailing waypoints to avoid harsh sea environments the interactions between the slow steaming and voyage optimization are further investigated in the next subsection for this specific voyage20090202 normally the voyage planning for eastbound voyages is rather easy since the metocean conditions are relatively calm and storms are always moving from the west to the east for the winter eastbound voyage20090121 the cs course optimization method generates a bit better results than the gc speed optimization method but large uncertainties are also observed when metocean forecasts and hindcasts are used for the fuel consumption analysis within the voyage optimizations for the typical summer voyage20090618 the cs course optimization method generates routes consuming 3 4 7 more fuel than the gc speed optimization method for normal 75 and 50 slow steaming operations if the forecast metocean data is used for the voyage optimization when the hindcast data is used for the voyage optimization the gc speed optimization method results in on average 4 less fuel than the cs course optimization method the sailing courses of most summer eastbound voyages are quite similar either sailing along the great circle route or the rhumb line routes the most benefit of fuel saving is observed by the 50 slow steaming combined with the gc speed optimization method the fuel consumption has been reduced by more than 50 in comparison with the normal power ship operations finally the cs course optimization method generates routes whose sailing distance might be 10 20 longer than the shortest routes the cs course optimization method optimizes a voyage by diverging the course from the great circle route to find avoid some harsh sea environments predicted along the shortest route however due to uncertainties of metocean forecasts the longer sailing routes generated by the cs course optimization method may results in larger fuel consumption if actual metocean environment is considered in the post voyage analysis the trajectories of all the planned routes optimized by the cs course optimization method are presented in fig 20 for all the two chosen winter voyages the voyage optimizations are carried out for both the normal power and slow steaming operations for the winter westbound voyages metocean uncertainties have a big impact on the trajectories of optimized routes furthermore operations of various power settings also differ significantly while for the eastbound voyages the trajectories of the optimized routes are quite similar 5 2 analysis of benefits for slow steaming and its impact due to uncertain metocean forecast in fig 21 the sailing speeds and encountered h s obtained from the gc speed optimization method and cs course optimization method are presented for the normal power 75 and 50 slow steaming operations respectively the westbound voyage 20090202 is chosen for the following investigation firstly the forecast metocean data is used for the voyage optimization and the sailing speeds and encountered h s along the optimized routes are presented in fig 21 a secondly the actual metocean conditions along the above optimized routes are extracted from the hindcast data the results are presented in fig 21 b finally the voyage optimizations are performed using the hindcast data and the corresponding results are presented in fig 21 c they are corresponding to the step 1 2 and 3 in section 4 fig 21 a shows that even using the same metocean data source i e the forecast metocean information the encountered h s along the routes generated by various optimization methods can differ significantly the cs course optimization method generates optimal routes with relatively calm metocean conditions by long sailing distance the gc speed optimization method adjusts a ship s sailing speed to avoid large storms of big h s both sailing speeds and encountered h s are different for various normal slow steaming operations even though the cs course optimization method generates routes with relative calm sea environments based on the forecast metocean information the actual encountered h s along these routes are generally larger than the routes generated by the gc speed optimization method as shown in fig 21 b this is mainly due to the uncertainties of metocean forecast as inputs into the voyage optimization methods it also indicates potential risks of wasting fuel when a cs course optimization method recommends an optimized route with long sailing distance this fact is also indicated by the comparison of predicted fuel consumption using metocean forecast and actual fuel consumption using hindcast data as in table 6 finally when the actual metocean data i e hindcast data is used for the voyage optimization the trend of results presented in fig 21 c looks quite similar to fig 21 a in general the cs course optimization method is more effective for voyage planning with relatively calm metocean conditions but the total fuel consumptions are not necessarily less than the gc speed optimization method due to longer sailing distance as shown in the results of tables 3 6 however it should be noted that actual hindcast data will never be available for ship voyage optimizations large uncertainties in metocean forecasts may lead to the fact that the cs course optimization method may generate routes encountering larger h s than the gc speed optimization method it has been shown in table 6 that the performance of the 75 slow steaming operation with 6 5 fuel saving to normal power operation does not work well in comparison with the 50 slow steaming operation with 50 fuel saving the voyage optimizations are carried out by the gc speed optimization method using the hindcast data the sailing speeds and encountered hs along the optimized route are presented in fig 21 c in addition fig 22 illustrates the simple weight graph encountered h s 2 for the great circle route with various speed configurations within the gc speed optimization method fig 21 a is for the eastbound voyage20090121 while the fig 22 b is for the westbound voyage20090202 the boundaries of 0 4v and 1 2v where v is the ship s service speed at the normal power operations imply that how useful the gc speed optimization can be applied to avoid encountering storms along the great circle route for the winter westbound voyage20090202 there are two storms moving against the great circle route it is shown that the ship s speeds under the normal power and 75 slow steaming operations are fast at the beginning of the voyage this helps the ships to avoid encountering the centre area of the first storm unfortunately the 50 slow steaming operation did not manage to avoid the centre area of the first storm since the first storm was moving crossing the route the sailing time inside the storm is not that long furthermore the speeds are adjusted to the lowest level by the gc speed optimization method the ship s fuel consumption when sailing around the first storm is not very high and then in the following operations the ship under 50 slow steaming operations is always navigated in quite calm sea conditions obviously with optimized speed configurations with respect to fuel saving to optimize the ship s speed during the storm can be more efficient in this case however it should be noted that for safety reasons the extremely slow steaming can be quite challenging for example in this case the 50 slow steaming operation encounters the largest h s while for the eastbound voyage20090121 it is clearly shown that the gc speed optimization method successfully helps the 50 slow steaming operations avoid two big storms 6 conclusion many uncertain factors are involved in a ship s voyage optimization process such as the fuel cost speed power relationship models metocean forecast models and various operation inputs concerning the negatives impacts associated with these uncertainties more complex 3 dimensional voyage optimization methods may lead to worse voyage planning results than a simple conventional great circle sailing this study proposed a speed optimization method for a fixed great circle course to counteract the negative impact of these uncertain inputs especially the uncertainties of forecast metocean conditions the proposed gc speed optimization method is compared with a conventional 2 dimensional cs course optimization method with respect to minimizing a ship s fuel consumption while keeping the same expected time of arrival eta the gc speed optimization method aims at avoiding harsh metocean environments by optimizing the ship s sailing speeds at the waypoints along the fixed reference great circle route while the cs course optimization method is performed by searching for waypoints course with calm metocean conditions the full scale measurements of a 2800teu containership during the entire year 2009 are used to quantify the impact of these uncertainties on the ship s voyage optimizations for minimum fuel cost firstly if two different speed power fuel cost estimation models are used for the voyage optimization the fuel consumption along the optimized routes can differ from 4 to 10 due to the fuel cost model uncertainties furthermore the comparison with ensemble metocean forecasts and the actual weather information from hindcast data shows that metocean forecast becomes unreliable after 2 3 days in particular for harsh metocean environments in addition today s ships are often operated in a very slow steaming condition using about 30 50 main engine power the slow steaming operations also influence a ship s voyage optimization the uncertainties in metocean forecast have significant impacts on the ship s voyage optimizations i e a 3 10 difference in fuel consumption even for the optimal routes generated by the same voyage optimization method for the two chosen winter voyages the difference can be as high as 16 on average in addition there is a large difference in the ship s trajectories of the optimized ship routes associated with the inputs of uncertain metocean conditions in voyage optimization methods furthermore for the extremely unusual harsh metocean environments around the sailing area of a specific voyage the course optimization method can generate better optimal routes by sailing 10 more distance with less fuel consumption than the shortest route however for most of the chosen voyages the gc speed optimization method can generate better optimal routes with less fuel consumption for both eastbound and westbound voyages for the slow steaming operations the gc speed optimization method gives more freedom to optimize a ship s speeds because of large reserved engine power comparing the results from 100 service power voyage optimizations for the ship operated with 50 service power shows much more significant improvement of fuel saving than the optimization results for the 75 service power slow steaming operation for the slow steaming operations a voyage optimization method should be strongly recommended to achieve higher fuel saving because the sailing course and speeds along the optimized route will be significantly different from the normal operations credit authorship

22027,ship voyage optimization systems are widely used in today s ocean crossing ships to consider a ship s sailing safety and energy efficiency large uncertainties from the inputs of today s voyage optimization algorithms can reduce the reliability of voyage optimization systems especially for more complex algorithms that involve more control variables in the optimization this study first proposes a speed optimization algorithm which considers the voluntary speed reduction for a ship voyage with fixed trajectories then the capability of the proposed speed optimization method is investigated by comparing with conventional voyage planning methods that optimize a ship s sailing courses trajectories in particular the effectiveness of handling uncertain inputs during the optimization process such as ship speed power performance models metocean forecasts is investigated for the two types of voyage optimization methods finally the benefits of potential fuel saving are studied by incorporating this proposed algorithm for a ship s slow steaming strategies keywords voyage optimization voluntary speed reduction fuel consumption metocean forecast uncertainties great circle routes 1 introduction in today s shipping industry the increasing regulatory requirements and intense competition caused by the market overcapacity have attracted great attention to developing energy efficiency measures which can help to gain more economic benefits and reduce air emissions from shipping among all the well known measures the so called weather routing system is regarded as one of the most promising approaches tillig et al 2018 according to the extensive market survey conducted by dnv gl 2015 weather routing systems have been implemented by 68 of shipping companies and 20 planned to be implemented to save fuel a weather routing system is used to propose courses schedules to help ships sailing to their destinations with certain pre defined objectives e g the expected time of arrival with minimum fuel consumption and air emissions etc bowditch 2002 james 1957 the core element of such a weather routing system is a proper voyage optimization algorithm which generates optimal ship routing based on the metocean meteorological and oceanographic conditions surrounding the ship s sailing area the ship s characteristics and operational capabilities as well as some constraints of a specific voyage simonsen et al 2015 wang et al 2019 normally the final outcome of a voyage optimization system is to optimize a ship s sailing waypoints and or speeds ship engine rpm and shaft power etc along the voyage conventional voyage planning methods often employ two dimensional optimization algorithms to search for the optimum trajectory waypoints composed of longitudes and latitudes of a given voyage dijkstra 1959 calvert 1990 larsson et al 2015 two dimensional voyage optimization algorithms can be generally divided into static grid based methods and dynamic grid based methods wang et al 2017 static grid based methods search for optimum waypoints in the pre defined grid waypoints systems various methods have been developed in the maritime community such as the dynamic programming method bellman 1952 dijkstra s algorithm dijkstra 1959 a algorithm hart et al 1968 etc from implementation perspectives chen 1978 calvert 1990 and de wit 1990 employed a search method for voyage progress as the stage variable and used a backward algorithm implemented with dynamic programming padhy et al 2008 proposed to utilize dijkstra s algorithm to solve the voyage optimization problem the optimal routes generated by the above static grid based methods should be theoretically identical when those methods are implemented in the same grid system with the same input variables dijkstra s algorithm employs a priority queue but dynamic programming is not able to accomplish in the same setting in voyage optimization problems one can implement dijkstra s algorithm as a dynamic programming algorithm where the same optimal results can be obtained however dijkstra s algorithm can be derived in many different ways for both single objective and multi objective voyage optimization problems and it is more efficient and better structured while the difference between the a algorithm and dijkstra s algorithm is that the a algorithm contains a heuristic function the function helps the algorithm to find the optimal solutions faster than dijkstra s algorithm but both algorithms should give identical results if only the sailing trajectory is of interest for the voyage optimization dynamic grid based methods define a voyage into several time stages at each stage the algorithms proceed with the voyage optimization and generate the local grid waypoint system simultaneously the most representative method is the isochrone method it was first introduced by james 1957 and modified by hagiwara 1989 to be more suitable for the computerization of ship voyage optimization the method can optimize a ship s voyage with minimum sailing time it can also be used to obtain a ship s optimal route with a minimum fuel cost by recursively adjusting propeller revolutions or engine power for a minimum time of arrival furthermore more complex voyage optimization algorithms have been developed in recent years such as 3d dynamic programming method by shao and zhou 2012 zaccone et al 2018 montewka et al 2019 3d isochrone method by lin et al 2013 lin 2018 improved isochrone method by roh 2013 evolutionary algorithms as well as multi objective approaches for voyage optimization problems by hinnenthal 2008 marie and courteille 2009 szłapczynska and smierzchalski 2009 maki et al 2011 vettor and guedes soares 2016 kim and kim 2017 veneti et al 2017 these algorithms can optimize both sailing trajectories and speeds at each waypoint but the computation efforts are also dramatically increased however the special settings in those 3d voyage optimization methods may only provide locally optimal voyage planning results furthermore due to the limited accepted waiting time from shipping end users to perform a voyage optimization larsson and simonsen 2014 the weather routing markets are mainly implementing two dimensional optimization algorithms for a ship s voyage planning moreover because of large uncertainties in a ship s voyage optimization process such as ship performance models metocean forecasts navigation methods etc more complex optimization algorithms may result in more uncertain voyage planning results for example a simple two dimensional voyage optimization method may generate an optimum route with its course significantly deviated from the shortest route great circle in order to avoid harsh metocean conditions due to large uncertainties associated with metocean forecast and ship speed power models as inputs in the voyage optimization algorithms a ship s actual fuel consumption along the generated optimum route with long sailing distance may be much higher than that sailing in the great circle route for example according to the post voyage analysis of a handy size container ship s winter navigation in 2008 the ship was recommended to sail toward significant south of the great circle to avoid harsh sea storms based on the uncertain metocean forecasts mao et al 2012 2016 but after the ship completed the voyage it is found that she encountered three storms in the optimum route as in fig 1 actually if the ship was sailing along the traditional great circle route the ship could easily avoid the three storms in the end it leads to a 100 increase of sailing time much higher fuel consumption and risks associated with 3 big storms encountered because the optimal route diverges far away from the great circle route considering various uncertain information inputted in complex voyage optimization algorithms manipulating a ship s trajectories course speed power rpm it can be more secure and efficient to optimize a ship s speeds along the great circle routes to avoid encountering big storms then the ship can slow down to let storms pass and speed up to catch the expected time of arrival along the shortest route chen 2013 while conventional ships are still sailing along the shortest great circle routes ballou et al 2008 therefore in this study we first propose a fixed course speed optimization method that can help to adjust a ship s speed along e g the great circle routes for minimum fuel voyage optimization secondly the potentials of the proposed optimization method for fuel saving are investigated by comparing with two dimensional voyage optimization methods that optimize a ship s sailing trajectories in particular due to large uncertain inputs in those voyage optimization methods the risk of even higher fuel costs when sailing along the generated optimum routes is also investigated finally the slow steaming strategy is widely used in today s shipping market to reduce fuel consumption the longer sailing time associated with even larger forecast uncertainties of metocean conditions and large reserved engine power will have a direct impact on a ship s voyage planning this study will investigate the capability of the proposed speed optimization algorithm which can be combined with the slow steaming to further reduce the fuel consumptions and air emissions for the completeness of the paper the following section 2 presents an overview of the voyage optimization algorithm in particular the proposed 2d fixed course speed optimization algorithm is present as well as the conventional fixed speed course optimization methods section 3 presents some uncertain inputs and their impacts on voyage optimization of a case study containership with full scale measurements when sailing in the north atlantic section 4 and 5 present results and discussion in detail regarding how uncertain metocean forecast and slow steaming operations can affect the ship s voyage optimization conclusion and references are given in the end 2 concept of voyage optimization in weather routing systems before the departure of an ocean crossing voyage captains should first make a preliminary voyage planning of a ship s sailing course and speed arrival times at various waypoints along the course according to some transport requirements for modern ship navigation a weather routing service is often engaged in the voyage planning process it helps a ship to find the best route based on metocean forecasts ship performance characteristics and special voyage requirements such as maximum allowed motions expected time of arrival eta etc the optimization is often involved in the voyage planning process therefore the planning purpose is not to completely avoid all harsh storm conditions but rather to seek the best balance to minimize the ship s operational cost and meanwhile satisfying other requirements such as ensure eta and ship safety in this study a ship s operational cost is limited to the ship s fuel consumption when sailing at sea 2 1 mathematical description of a voyage optimization problem since a ship can sail in any locations waypoints in the open sea between departure and destination ports the first step in a voyage optimization process is to discretize the ship s potential sailing area into a waypoint grid system two types of grid systems are used in today s weather routing market namely the dynamic and static grid systems as in fig 2 in both grid systems a ship s voyage is discretized into various sailing stages the dynamic grid system progressively discretizes a ship s sailing area i e it only discretizes the searching space from waypoints of the current stage until the next stage as in fig 2 a this grid system is often used in the so called isochrone or isopone methods which are more specialized in ensuring a ship s expected fastest time of arrival wang et al 2017 the static grid system discretizes the entire sailing area at the beginning of voyage planning the resolution of the grid should be predefined and cannot be adjusted in the middle of the searching optimization process as in fig 2 b because of its efficiency in computation most of today s ship voyage optimization algorithms are based on the static grid system it is also more capable to be implemented for voyage optimization with objectives of minimum fuel consumption therefore the voyage optimization algorithms used in this study are also based on the static grid system for the static waypoint grid graph system let a ship s voyage be discretized into n time stages 1 g p 0 t 0 g 1 g 2 g i g n 1 p n t n where p 0 and p n represent the departure and destination locations while t 0 and t n represent the departure and arrival times of the voyage then the departure and destination waypoints include both geographical and temporal information are denoted as 2 p 0 t 0 x 0 y 0 t 0 p n t n x n y n t n where x and y denote the longitudes and latitudes of the waypoints for the i th stage there are j i locations nodes in the grid graph system then the geographical locations of all waypoints in the i th stage are denoted by 3 g i p i 1 p i 2 p i j p i ji where p i j x i j y i j the spatial resolution δx x i j x i 1 j δy y i j y i 1 j is often defined based on the temporal resolution of metocean forecast data in the grid system waypoints between two adjacent stages can form various sub routes as the ship voyage advances i e the time stage increases as shown in fig 2 b possible candidate sub routes will increase exponentially furthermore each geographic location is also associated with different passing times which make the number of potential sub routes increase dramatically for example if a three dimensional optimization algorithm is used i e the sailing speed or engine power is set to vary at each location the number of potential sub routes in the i th sailing stage is proportional to the number of locations in each time stage multiplied by the pre defined sailing speeds at each location to the power i according to wang et al 2019 most of today s 3 dimensional optimization algorithms will generate locally optimum solutions this study will mainly investigate the efficiency of 2 dimensional voyage algorithms i e either to fix ship speed or engine power but allow sailing courses to vary or to fix ship course but allow speed to vary the grid systems of these two optimization methods are shortly presented as follows 2 1 1 grid graph system in great circle speed optimization gc speed optimization even in today s shipping market a large number of ships especially bulk carriers are still operated following the shortest distance routes i e the great circle routes for such a voyage planning fixed ship speed is roughly calculated by captains according to the expected time of arrival based on the metocean forecast and corresponding ship weather impact however with the computer aided voyage optimization the sailing speeds at each time stage along the voyage could be optimized to allow minimum fuel consumption and ensure eta in the gc speed optimization method the ship course is fixed to the great circle route and the discretized waypoints in the grid graph system are presented in fig 3 a in the grid graph system a time set time dimension is added to the discretized waypoints as nodes vertices a time set is an array denoted by t i which contains a series of feasible arrival times for each waypoint then the grid system can be written as 4 g p 0 t 0 p 1 t 1 p 2 t 2 p i t i p n 1 t n 1 p n t n where p i x i y i the time set t i associated with each location p i also represents various sailing speeds at p i first let discretize the time set with a given resolution δt and assign the same time set to all the waypoints p i viz 5 t i t 0 t 0 δ t t 0 2 δ t 2 t n t 0 where i 1 2 n 1 by considering a ship s engine capability and weather impact in waves let assume a ship s sailing speed can vary between 0 2v and 1 2v where v is the ship s service speed under this practical assumption some unrealistic passing times for certain waypoints will be automatically deleted by the method for example in fig 3 b the crosses represent unrealistic passing times because of either too fast low speeds required while the dots represent the possible passing times for the predefined ship speeds even though a ship s sailing course is set to be fixed in the gc speed optimization method a large number of potential ship routes needed to be calculated in the voyage planning in order to find the best optimum ship route normally some voyage optimization algorithms are needed to increase the searching efficiency with respect to certain sailing objectives such as specific eta minimum fuel and ensured safety etc in this paper the introduced grid system in fig 3 integrated with the dijkstra s optimization algorithm is proposed for the gc speed optimization method the details of the proposed optimization implementation will be further presented in section 2 3 2 1 2 grid graph system in constant speed course optimization cs course optimization alternatively another 2 dimensional voyage planning method is used to allow the ship sailing course trajectory to vary but with fixed speed power as inputs for the voyage optimization it is named as cs course optimization the waypoints in the grid graph system within this method are discretized around a reference ship course route most often the great circle is used as the reference route which covers the accessible sailing area of the voyage during the process of generating the graph constraints such as land crossing constraint maximum course change constraint are also included to eliminate the infeasible sub paths edges and improve the efficiency of any chosen optimization algorithm an example of the grid graph system in the cs course optimization method is shown in fig 4 similar to the grid system denoted by eq 3 the geographic locations of waypoints in the i th stage of the cs course optimization method can be written as 6 g i p i 1 t i 1 p i 2 t i 2 p i j t i j p i j i t i j i where p i j x i j y i j represents the geographic locations of the waypoints the passing time set t i j differs for waypoints from various stages and it also varies for waypoints at the same discretized sailing stages 7 t i j t i 1 1 δ p i j p i 1 1 v 0 t i 1 2 δ p i j p i 1 2 v 0 t i 1 j i 1 δ p i j p i 1 j i 1 v 0 where t i 1 j j 1 2 j i 1 represent the passing time set associated with the location p i 1 j δ p i j p i 1 j represents the distance between the two locations p i j and p i 1 j and v 0 denotes the pre defined input speed for voyage optimization it should be noted that if a ship encounters harsh metocean environments at sea the speed v 0 may be reduced involuntarily due to engine capabilities therefore the time set t i 1 j is not a pre defined variable but calculated during the optimization iteration process finally it should be noted that the number of potential waypoints i e passing times associated with one location increases exponentially as the voyage advances as 8 t i j n 1 i 1 j n for j 1 2 j i where t i j represents the number of passing times t i j and j n represents the number of discretized locations at the n th sailing stage by connecting all waypoints composed of both locations and all passing times at adjacent stages makes the potential sub routes increase exponentially as the increase of ship sailing stages the computation effort for finding optimum ship routes can easily exceed current computation capability therefore optimization algorithms should be employed to eliminate some badly performed sub routes based on the given predefined optimization objectives in the following the voyage planning objectives are defined as minimum fuel consumption and meanwhile keeping the expected time of arrival eta for a given voyage 2 2 implementation of optimization algorithms for voyage planning in the above grid graph system another important component is the sailing sub paths edges that connect two waypoints at adjacent stages the sub paths edges associated with the waypoints p i j are denoted by 9 a i j p i 1 1 t i 1 p i j p i 1 2 t i j p i j p i 1 j i 1 t i 1 j i 1 p i j where means that two waypoints are connected in both space and time for the voyage optimization every sailing sub path edge is assigned with sailing distance encountered metocean conditions w containing wind wave current data etc operational conditions u and ship sailing constraints viz 10 w a i j k h s t z s ω h s t z c u c v v w u v w v t 11 u a i j k v θ t where k represents the number of each sub path edge associated with the waypoint p i j for such a sub path edge the corresponding wave conditions are denoted by the significant wave height h s mean wave period t z and wave spectrum s ω h s t z the ocean current velocity is denoted by c u c v the wind velocity is denoted by v w u v w v etc the subscript u v of current and wind represent the velocity components of the horizontal current wind towards east and north respectively in eq 11 v and θ denote the ship s sailing speed and heading angle relative to waves respectively the ship sailing constraints includes land crossing constraints marine engine power constraints and safety constraints etc here safety constraints are treated as the severest metocean conditions a ship allowed to be encountered the variables within eqs 10 11 for all waypoints and sub paths edges should be extracted stage by stage since the passing time t i j of the waypoint p i j can only be calculated at the precedent sailing stage based on the extracted information the sailing operational costs associated with the sub paths edges can be calculated through the instantaneous cost objective function in terms of the wave environment w and operational condition u each edge a i j k is assigned with a cost weight c i j k 12 c i j k f u p i j k w p i j k δ t i j k where δ t i j k is the time needed to sail from the precedent waypoints to the current waypoint the cost function c i j can be of different forms e g fuel consumption maximum ship motions estimated time of arrival eta fatigue damage accumulation or crack propagation in a ship s structure wang et al 2017 etc since this study investigates the voyage optimization with minimum fuel consumption a ship s fuel performance model is needed to estimate the ship s fuel consumption rate f u w the cost function of the entire voyage can be estimated by 13 c t 0 t n f u g w g d t where f u g w g is the instantaneous cost function for waypoints in the grid system g as in eqs 4 and 6 with metocean environments w and operational conditions u t 0 and t n are the departure time and arrival time respectively during the optimization process the instantaneous cost function is computed to get the fuel consumption rate for all waypoints at the current stage finally the overall objective is to find suitable waypoints p and operational control sets u p these waypoints form to the optimum route with a minimum value of c and encountering metocean conditions w p 14 p p 0 p 1 ϕ 1 t 1 ϕ 1 φ 1 p i ϕ i t i ϕ i φ i p n 1 ϕ n 1 t n 1 are the indexes of geographic and temporal locations in the i th discretized sailing stage of the optimum route the purpose of any voyage optimization algorithm is to find the indexes of the waypoints in the established grid graph system as in figs 3 and 4 to form an optimum ship route after establishing the grid graph system for searching optimum routing solution around the ship s sailing area the so called dijkstra s method will be implemented as the optimization algorithm for both the gc speed optimization and the cs course optimization methods the dijkstra s algorithm operates in a waypoint grid graph system by visiting sub paths edges starting from the departure node waypoint it follows two basic principles dijkstra 1959 firstly a sub route of the shortest route is itself a shortest route and secondly with a given shortest distance x between points a and c a path going from point a to c through a third point b will always be of a distance greater than or equal to x the main difference between implementing the two optimization methods i e gc speed optimization and cs course optimization methods is how to construct the grid graph system in the grid graph system of the cs course optimization the arrival time of each waypoint is an unknown variable during the iteration of dijkstra s algorithm in the cs course optimization the optimal arrival time of each waypoint is assigned as an identical attribute of the location vertex in the grid graph system while in the gc speed optimization the arrival times of each geographical location are pre assigned as various waypoints thus the costs of the sub path edges can be pre calculated before implementing dijkstra s algorithm thus the graph generated by the gc speed optimization is considered as a static weighted graph in which each edge is given a numerical weight dijkstra s algorithm can be implemented to search the path with the lowest cost in the weighted graph 2 3 cost function of ship fuel performance calculation in this study the ship s speed engine power is chosen as inputs for voyage optimization the instantaneous cost function f u g w g here chosen as the fuel consumption rate along a sub path edge is not a simple explicit function but should be calculated following systematic procedures as in fig 5 while some statistical methods are also available to calculate the cost function as in mao et al 2016 firstly based on the encountered sea conditions a ship s characteristics and operational profiles etc the ship s total resistance can be estimated by adding the calm water resistance and the added resistance due to wind wave and current the total resistance needs to be compensated by the thrust force provided by the engine and propellers dependent on the engine type and propeller properties used on a specific ship various propulsion efficiencies are estimated to get the final fuel consumption for the input sailing speeds in the resistance calculation one of the main parameters is the speed through water v the speed through water is approximated by subtracting the current speed v c from a ship s speed over ground v g also known as the gps speed based on the simple approximation formula from iso15016 2015 the total resistance is estimated by 15 r t o t u w r t r a a r a w where u is the ship s operational conditions under the encountered metocean conditions denoted by w r t o t is the ship s total resistance r t is the calm water resistance r a a is the added resistance due to wind r a w is the added resistance due to waves the calm water resistance r t can be estimated by empirical formulas obtained by regression from a large number of test results in holtrop and mennen 1984 and ittc 2015 it is composed of frictional resistance the resistance of appendages wave making and wave breaking resistance the additional pressure resistance of bulbous bow and immersed transom stern etc it gives rather a good estimation of average resistances for some standard ship types however some errors or uncertainties cannot be avoided in these formulas to get the wetted surface viscous pressure and wave pattern resistance tillig et al 2018 for a reliable voyage optimization it is essential to accurately estimate the ship s added resistance in waves the waves under real sea conditions are known as irregular waves which can be represented as a linear superposition of the components of regular waves the added resistance due to regular waves of a unit wave amplitude and a series of wave frequencies ω under the operational condition v θ is often divided into two components 16 r a w ω v θ r a w r ω v θ r a w m ω v θ g θ where r awr and r awm denote wave reflection and ship motion induced resistances v and θ represent a ship s speed and the angle between the wave and the ship different empirical formulas and hydrodynamic theory based numerical methods are available to get the added resistance due to waves furthermore based on the results of wave resistance at various wave basin a gaussian function g θ is proposed here to model the impact of heading angles for added resistance in waves in this study the mean added resistance when sailing under an actual sea state of irregular waves represented by a significant wave height h s and mean wave period t z is estimated by integrating the product of wave spectrum s ω and the ship s wave resistance r aw as in eq 16 viz 17 r a w 0 s ω h s t z r a w ω v θ d ω where s ω h s t z is described by the ittc the international towing tank conference wave spectrum the wind resistance is estimated by 18 r a a 0 5 ρ a c a a ψ w r r e f a x v v w r r e f 2 0 5 ρ a c a a 0 a x v v g 2 where r aa is the resistance increase due to relative wind c aa is the wind resistance coefficient ρ a is the mass density of air a xv is the transverse projected area above the waterline including superstructures ψ wrref is the relative wind direction v wrref is the relative wind velocity at the reference height v g is the measured ship s speed over ground then the total resistance r tot is estimated as the summation of all the calm water resistance added resistances due to wind wave shallow water etc finally for the cost of the sub path edge associated with the waypoint p i j under the operation conditions u p i j k and encountering sea environment w p i j k a ship s fuel consumption under the sailing speed through water v i j k at the waypoint can be estimated by 19 c i j k p b i j k s f o c t i j k t i 1 j k and p b i j k r t o t u p i j k w p i j k v i j k η 0 η h η s where sfoc unit g kwh is the specific fuel oil consumption an example of sfoc for the case study ship is presented in fig 6 t i j k t i 1 j k is the sailing time from the i th stage to the next stage and varies depending on individual waypoints η h η o η s are the hull efficiency propeller open water efficiency and engine shaft efficiency that can be estimated by holtrop and mennen 1984 3 uncertain components as input in voyage optimization for a ship s voyage planning with minimum fuel consumption there are five major components as inputs to the voyage optimization system as in fig 7 except for the sailing constraints that must be insured for ship safety large uncertainties are expected in other inputs shown as the green containers in fig 7 this study investigates uncertainties associated with metocean forecasts ship fuel consumption model and optimization methods the forecast and hindcast of metocean conditions are retrieved from ecmwf mars ecmwf 2019 and era5 datasets copernicus 2019 respectively taking into account the uncertainties associated with all these inputs and operational strategies very sophisticated 3 dimensional optimization algorithms which generate an optimal route significantly different from the shortest route may not be the best route from a post voyage analysis on the contrary those complex optimization methods based on uncertain inputs may provide worse results than the simple great circle sailing 3 1 uncertainties to model a ship s fuel consumption for a ship s voyage optimization with minimum fuel consumption the objective j is to minimize the total fuel cost consumed along a given voyage thus the instantaneous cost function f is another important input in voyage optimization methods for a minimum fuel voyage optimization the cost function is to describe a ship s speed and power relationships in terms of encountered metocean environments as in subsection 2 3 in the cost model the most important parameter is the added resistance speed loss in waves i e the so called weather impact the most accurate way to get the cost model is based on a ship s full scale measurement of her energy performance when sailing at sea however these measurements are seldom available for such purpose a practical voyage optimization system often utilizes well developed models to calculate the fuel consumption for various sailing conditions according to skoglund et al 2015 and wang et al 2019 if an energy performance model can describe the basic characteristics of a ship s speed power relationship at sea it should give rather good results of voyage optimizations while if there is a fundamental difference in various energy performance models their usage in voyage optimizations will generate very uncertain solutions for optimum ship routes several semi empirical models were proposed to describe such a performance model that can be used for voyage optimization such as kwon s method kwon 2008 the semi empirical method based on liu et al 2016 liu s method for example fig 8 compares the speed losses under different sea states estimated by the two methods in comparison with the full scale measurements of a chemical tanker the full scale measurements contain some basic information regarding the ship s sailing such as times locations speeds and heading associated with all passing waypoints recorded every 15 min as well as the shaft power in fig 8 the red line represents the speed loss estimated from full scale measurement data it is clearly indicated that the speed loss estimated by those methods differ significantly from that obtained from the measurement in particular when the encountered significant wave height h s increases the large discrepancy of speed losses estimated by different models become more pronounced in order to quantify the impact of different energy performance models to voyage optimization the kwon s method and the semi empirical method based on liu et al 2016 are employed to estimate the ship s costs fuel consumption in the two proposed voyage optimization methods as in section 2 1 a spring voyage20090329 is used to demonstrate the uncertainty of voyage optimization due to different energy performance models the two optimization algorithms are 1 gc speed optimization and 2 cs course optimization figs 9 and 10 present the results of the optimum ship routes generated by the two voyage optimization methods while the two weather impact models are used as inputs for fuel consumption estimation fig 9 presents the ship s sailing speeds encounter h s and relative heading angles 0 means head sea operations while 180 means following sea operations along the optimum ship routes generated by the gc speed optimization method in which the two weather impact models are used as inputs when the cs course optimization method is used for the ship s voyage optimization fig 10 a presents trajectories of the two generated optimum ship routes fig 10 b presents similar results as fig 9 but for the routes generated as in fig 10 a the differences in ship trajectories sailing speeds and encountered h s along different optimum ship routes indicate the influence of weather impact models on a ship s voyage optimization table 1 lists the sailing distance eta and fuel consumptions of those optimum ship routes generated by various voyage optimization methods in comparison with the ship s actual sailing routes as well as the conventional great circle sailing routes for the voyage 20090309 it should be noted that all ship s fuel consumptions estimated from the kwon s method are scaled to make the actual fuel costs estimated by the two weather impact models equivalent in general a large difference is observed between optimized ship routes and the ship s actual sailing even for ship routes generated by the same voyage optimization method there are about 4 difference in sailing distance and more than 10 difference in fuel consumption the difference is solely caused by the uncertainties associated with fuel cost models therefore large uncertainties will be expected in a ship s voyage optimization if various fuel cost models are used it should be noted that the difference in relative wave heading angle among various methods is relatively small especially for routes with the same trajectories gc optimization method this is because storms are always moving from the west to the east in the north atlantic sailing area 3 2 uncertainties in forecasts of metocean conditions in a ship s voyage optimization the instantaneous cost function f should be computed for all searching waypoints one of the main inputs in f is the forecast metocean conditions at these waypoints w p due to the limited spatial and temporal resolutions of provided the forecast data some interpolation methods should be used to approximate w p which is often different from the actual metocean conditions at these waypoints more importantly due to the complexity and imperfection of the physical description in today s metocean forecast models as well as some uncertain and incomplete initial inputs into the forecast models the forecast metocean data is inevitable including large uncertainties for example the accuracy of weather forecasts will be significantly reduced after 3 5 days it can even lead to unreliable forecast information after 5 days to describe these forecast uncertainties an ensemble forecast technique is used to generate the scatter of weather forecast by varying the initial environmental inputs into the metocean forecast models fig 11 b presents an example of significant wave height h s for a waypoint located at the north atlantic as in fig 11 a the plotted h s is obtained from the ensemble forecast and hindcast reanalysis data it should be noted that the normal forecast metocean conditions is one of the ensemble forecast samples the scatter of forecasted h s become wide after 3 days it indicates that the accuracy of the forecasted metocean conditions starts to decrease a north atlantic crossing voyage normally costs 5 7 days for fast containerships metocean forecast during this period is required for voyage optimizations if a voyage optimization method is based on an uncertain forecast of metocean parameters a generated optimum ship route may differ significantly from the shortest route to avoid harsh storms if the ship s sailing strictly follows that optimum route her actual encountered metocean environment maybe even worse than that sailing along the shortest route one such example has been presented in fig 1 furthermore the sailing distance of those optimum ship routes may be much longer than the shortest routes it may cost much more fuel and sailing time leading to high operational costs therefore it is important to investigate the reliability and sensitivities of voyage optimization algorithms due to uncertain metocean forecasts as inputs in case of an extremely uncertain forecast from shipping companies perspectives it is important to compare the risks and benefits when different voyage planning results are generated by different methods 3 3 uncertain operation strategies for voyage planning in today s shipping market captains are using different operational strategies to operate their ships jeong et al 2019 such as sprint and loiter sailing high speed sailing for the majority of a ship s voyage and slow down at the final leg to ensure arrival on time ballou et al 2008 constant speed constant rpm or engine power sailing etc furthermore since a ship s resistance is normally proportional to her sailing speed to the power between 3 and 4 lowering a ship s sailing speed can significantly reduce her resistance and thus fuel consumption therefore slow steaming is a common operation strategy today to minimize a ship s fuel consumption when sailing at sea for example the actual engine powers of a fleet of containerships and vlcc from their worldwide operation are extracted from their noon reports and presented in fig 12 the average engine power of containerships navigation is only about 30 of a ship s mcr while the average sailing engine power for the vlcc ships is about 50 mcr however slow steaming can bring many challenges to shipping companies such as the economic feasibility of longer sailing time for certain voyages furthermore a ship s engine and propeller are designed with their highest propulsion efficiencies at a ship s service speed and rpms the engine and propeller running efficiencies of a slow steaming ship may be significantly reduced leading to high total fuel cost and the reduced sailing speeds may also change the capability of a ship s voyage optimization strategies to avoid harsh sea environments for the slow steaming voyage optimizations the ship s reserved engine power may give the gc speed optimization algorithm more freedom to adjust the sailing speeds to avoid a harsh sea environment moreover it is essential to investigate proper voyage optimization algorithms that should be combined with a ship s slow steaming operations since the longer sailing time can further increase the uncertainties of metocean forecast during this sailing period 3 4 the case study ship voyages and investigation summary in this study a 2800teu container ship sailing in the north atlantic is chosen as a case study ship mao 2014 the main particulars of the ship are listed in table 2 for this case study ship the full scale measurements of the ship s sailing during the entire year 2009 are available to this study for the investigation of the two proposed voyage optimization methods with respect to the minimum fuel consumption a ship s voyage is discretized into a series of time stages waypoints composed of locations passing times and sailing speeds the ship energy performance model presented in eq 15 using the semi empirical wave resistance model based on liu et al 2016 is utilized to estimate the cost fuel consumption of all searching waypoints this study mainly investigates the impact of uncertain metocean forecast as inputs on a ship s voyage optimization solutions with an intention to propose recommend a robust optimization method to compensate forecast uncertainties the recommended optimization method should not be very sensitive to such forecast uncertainties fig 13 presents the trajectories of all the measured voyages which are divided into westbound voyages and eastbound voyages for the westbound voyages large scatter is observed in their sailing trajectories in particular for the westbound winter voyages this is because storms in north atlantic always moves from the east to the west traditionally it is rather important for captains to carefully plan their route for westbound winter voyages to ensure ship cargo safety and save fuel while eastbound voyages usually involve fewer aids from modern weather routing systems it is shown that the trajectories for all eastbound voyages are quite similar i e the simple rhumb line operations except for two winter voyages one towards the north and the other towards the south in order to demonstrate and compare the capabilities of the proposed voyage optimization methods with conventional sailing methods five westbound and four eastbound voyages including both winter and summer seasons are chosen as case study voyages for the following analysis the following sensitivity and capability analysis of various voyage optimization methods due to uncertain metocean parameters as inputs are divided into two sections based on two operational strategies normal sailing operation and slow steaming operation shown in fig 14 both forecast and hindcast metocean data are used as inputs for the comparison the forecast data is updated every 12 h and the time resolution of the forecast data is 3 h and every update of the forecast data contains 10 days of weather forecast information the fuel consumption is estimated by the semi empirical models based on liu et al 2016 presented in section 2 3 four voyage planning methods as in fig 14 are executed to generate optimum routes for those case study voyages through comparing the effectiveness of these voyage optimization methods considering uncertain metocean inputs this study is also expected to demonstrate the capability of the proposed gc speed optimization method when a ship s sailing metocean environment is very uncertain 4 impact of metocean forecast uncertainties on voyage optimization methods for the following impact analysis the departure and destination locations for the three voyage planning methods great circle sailing gc speed optimization and cs course optimization as in fig 14 are assumed to be the same as the measured case study voyages while the total sailing times i e eta are set as close as possible to the measured eta for each case study voyage the uncertainty and comparison analysis using various voyage optimization methods are conducted by the following steps 1 the three voyage optimization methods are executed using metocean forecast before the voyage starts the sailing distance and eta of all the routes are obtained the forecast metocean conditions along all the three generated optimal routes and the measured route are extracted from the forecast metocean dataset mars then fuel consumptions along all the routes are estimated by the cost model presented in section 2 3 using the forecast metocean data it is denoted as the forecast fuel in the following result tables furthermore the results i e speed series encountered h s and relative heading angles of the three optimal routes and one measured route are presented in the left plots of following figures which show the impact of various voyage optimization methods on a ship s voyage planning results 2 the actual metocean conditions along the four routes generated in step 1 are extracted from the hindcast metocean dataset era5 then the actual fuel consumptions along the three optimal and one measured route are estimated by the same cost model as step 2 but using the actual metocean conditions from hindcast it is denoted as the hindcast fuel in the following result tables 3 the cs course optimization method and the gc speed optimization method are executed to generate two optimal routes using the hindcast data and generate two optimal routes using the forecast data similar results as in step 1 of all the four optimal routes are compared in the right plots of the following figures which shows the impact of uncertain metocean inputs on a ship s voyage planning results 4 1 general results on westbound voyage optimizations the sailing distance sailing time eta forecast fuel consumption and actual fuel consumption for all these investigated voyages are listed in table 3 for all the chosen westbound voyages in general the three investigated voyage optimization planning methods behave much better than the ship s actual sailing in terms of fuel consumption longer sailing distance often leads to high fuel consumption for example the actual sailing routes consume on average 7 less fuel than the conventional great circle shortest distance sailing routes this is partly because the sailing distance of actual routes is about 6 longer than the great circle routes one exceptional case is the voyage20091119 whose route is only a little longer but consumes about 2 less fuel than the great circle route this voyage will be further investigated in detail in the following subsections furthermore when various voyage optimization methods are compared using metocean forecast information the gc speed optimization method generates better results for most of the case study voyages except the voyage20090202 which consumes significantly higher fuel than other voyages probably due to encountered harsh metocean environments and much longer sailing time and distance due to rather longer sailing distance the forecast metocean data becomes much more uncertain the uncertain forecasts lead to the fact that the ship routes generated by the best performed optimization method i e cs course optimization method based on the metocean forecast will actually consume 3 more fuel than the gc speed optimization method if the hindcast actual information is taken into account this voyage will be further investigated in the following subsections finally it should be noted that simple 2 dimensional voyage optimization methods that help to seek for calm navigation environments by deviating their sailing course from the great circle shortest distance routes may result in higher fuel consumption for most of the chosen westbound voyages for relatively calm sea navigations speed optimizations along the great circle courses should be able to generate good voyage planning to reduce fuel cost the course optimization method may work well for winter voyages of harsh metocean environments such as the optimization for the voyage20090202 using forecast metocean information however large uncertainties in metocean forecast especially for a long sailing voyage with harsh sea environments may counteract benefits from the course optimization methods it is confirmed by the optimization results for the voyage20090202 using both forecast and hindcast metocean conditions 4 2 sensitive study of westbound voyage optimization due to uncertain metocean data two particular westbound voyages i e voyage20090202 and voyage20091119 are selected to further investigate how uncertainties of metocean inputs can affect results from various voyage optimization methods in terms of minimum fuel consumption trajectories of the optimized routes generated by various optimization methods are presented in fig 15 a for the voyage20090202 and fig 15 b for the voyage20091119 respectively in addition to the ship s actual sailing routes and the great circle routes the optimal routes generated by the cs course optimization methods using both the forecast and hindcast metocean information are also presented in the figure for the voyage 20090202 due to harsh sea environments along the winter voyage the actual sailing course and optimal course generated by the cs course optimization method differ significantly from the great circle route the voyage 20091119 encounters very calm sea conditions the actual sailing course is similar to the great circle route the cs course optimization method using hindcast and forecast metocean data generates very close optimal courses but the two optimized courses differ toward the north than the great circle route the results of optimized routes generated by various methods as in the step 1 and step 3 for the two selected case study voyages are presented in fig 16 and fig 17 respectively the results of the step 1 are shown in fig 16 a for the voyage 20090202 fig 17 a for the voyage 20091119 the results for the two voyage analysis in the step 2 are shown in figs 16 b and fig 17 b for the voyage 20090202 the largest encountered h s exceeds 10 m for all the generated routes as shown in fig 16 a the actual sailing route was going toward the southmost in order to avoid hitting large storms it is shown that the most efficient way to avoid severe sea environments is to navigate away from the gc route both the actual sailing routes and the route generated by the cs course optimization encounter relative smaller h s than the gc routes because of their divergence from the gc route in comparison with the conventional great circle fixed speed voyage planning method the gc speed optimization method avoids the first storm by significantly reducing ship speed but due to the constraint on eta the sailing speeds cannot be reduced along the entire voyage then the ship was hit by the second storm this voyage will be further studied by the slow steaming operation in the next section the difference in relative wave heading angles among the optimal routes generated by various methods is quite small especially for the gc speed optimization methods it means that the fuel saving by this method is mainly due to the speed adjustment when encountering different metocean conditions while the difference in heading angles between the great circle routes and the cs course optimization methods is relatively large which contributes to different encountered metocean conditions by adjusting a ship s sailing trajectories this is true for the following analysis and results of the relative wave heading angles are not presented for the slow steaming analysis in section 5 for the voyage20091119 because of relatively calm sea environments the gc speed optimization method can easily avoid big h s by slowing down at the beginning of the voyage furthermore when encountered with large sea environments the ship s sailing speeds at the storm area are often relatively smaller to reduce fuel consumption but the conventional great circle sailing and the actual sailing also encountered much higher h s than the routes optimized by the two methods figs 16 b and 17 b compare the results of voyage optimizations performed by the two methods i e gc speed optimization and cs course optimization methods due to uncertainties between the forecast and hindcast metocean conditions even for such short ship routes of about 4 days the metocean uncertainties will cause different optimization results in terms of both sailing course speeds and encountered h s the fuel consumption along these optimized routes for the two westbound voyages are listed in table 4 the fuel consumptions are estimated using metocean conditions extracted from the step 1 2 and 3 respectively large scatters of fuel consumption along various optimized routes can be observed due to the metocean uncertainties for the voyage 20090202 if the weather forecast is used for the voyage optimization the cs course optimization method can generate an optimal route with 10 less fuel cost than the gc speed optimization method however the actual fuel consumption estimated by the hindcast data along the optimal route generated by the cs course optimization method is actually 3 more than the other method for the voyage 20091119 due to relatively calm metocean environments and short sailing time the gc speed optimization always generates better voyage planning results but the benefits of fuel saving are reduced when the hindcast metocean data instead of the forecast metocean data is used for the voyage optimization 4 3 general results and sensitive study on eastbound voyages optimizations in the north atlantic ocean the storms are usually moving from the east to the west normally it is relatively easy for captains to plan eastbound voyages which are often sailing in either conventional great circle or rhumb line routes especially in summer similar as in table 3 the characteristics of optimized routes generated by various optimization methods are listed in table 5 for the three out of four chosen eastbound voyages the gc speed optimization method can produce the best results of voyage planning in terms of minimum fuel consumption in comparison with actual sailing it can save about 7 5 of fuel in comparison with the cs course optimization methods it can save about 2 5 3 of fuel dependent on if the forecast or hindcast metocean data is used for the analysis while for the voyage20090121 the cs course optimization method generated routes with 3 5 less fuel cost than the gc speed optimization method however when the hindcast data is used for the two voyage optimization methods the fuel consumption of two generated routes are very similar as shown in table 4 but the cs course optimization method generates route about 6 5 longer than the gc speed optimization method which may lead to quite big uncertainties of actual fuel consumptions furthermore the trajectories of optimized routes generated by different optimization methods are presented in fig 18 for the voyage 20090121 these trajectories differ significantly when different methods are compared as shown in fig 19 a the sailing speeds and encountered h s also differ significantly for routes generated by different methods the gc speed optimization method can guide the ship to operate fast when encountering very calm sea conditions while slow down for large sea conditions because the weather impact considered in the ship s fuel cost models for the following sea operations is not as serious as in the head sea operations the optimal route generated by this method still encountering higher h s than the cs course optimization method in addition the trajectories of routes optimized by the cs course optimization method are quite similar when either forecast or hindcast metocean data is used however the sailing speeds and encountered h s shown in fig 19 b as well as the fuel consumption listed in table 4 differ significantly due to such metocean uncertainties it also indicates a big impact of uncertain metocean forecast on voyage optimizations in particular for long sailing routes with harsh metocean conditions 5 impact of uncertain metocean forecast on slow steaming voyage optimizations in this study one winter westbound voyage voyage20090202 one winter and one summer eastbound voyages i e voyage20090121 and voyage20090618 are chosen to compare the capabilities of the gc speed optimization and the cs course optimization methods to handle metocean uncertainties during the slow steaming operations in the previous analysis the ship s actual sailing uses an 85 mcr maximum continuous rating as the service engine power in the voyage optimization analysis in this study two slow steaming settings i e 75 and 50 of service engine power corresponding to 63 75 and 42 5 mcr are chosen to investigate the capabilities of various voyage optimization methods 5 1 results of voyage optimization and uncertain metocean forecast for slow steaming operations similar as in table 4 the two optimization methods i e gc speed optimization and cs course optimization methods are used to investigate the impact of metocean uncertainties on voyage optimizations for the two chosen voyages the voyage optimization results of eta sailing distance and fuel consumption estimated using both forecast and extracted hindcast metocean data are listed in table 6 then the hindcast metocean data is used for the voyage optimizations where the etas are assumed to be the same as the forecast optimization the corresponding sailing distance and fuel consumption are presented in table 6 as well the voyage optimizations are carried out for the service power p s 75 and 50 service power operations respectively for the westbound winter voyage20090202 when the forecast metocean information is used for the voyage optimization of minimum fuel consumption the cs course optimization method can generate better results than the gc speed optimization method for both the normal power and two slow steaming operations this is partly because very unusual harsh sea conditions two big storms occurred during this voyage and strict requirements on eta setup in the gc speed optimization method ship speeds cannot be largely reduced to wait for the storms to pass but the slow steaming operations show big capabilities to enable more flexibility of speed variation in the gc speed optimization method i e a ship can catch up with a required eta even speeds have been significantly reduced at the beginning of a voyage for example the difference of fuel consumption between the course optimization and speed optimization methods is reduced from 10 to less than 5 from the normal power operations to the 50 slow steaming operations if the weather forecast is used while if the actual weather information along those optimized routes is extracted from the hindcast data the fuel consumptions along the routes generated by the gc speed optimization method are actually less than the cs course optimization method for the normal power and 50 slow steaming operations when the hindcast metocean information is used for the comparison of different voyage optimization methods even though the cs course optimization method generates better voyage planning with 4 less fuel consumption than the gc speed optimization method for the normal operation a ship route with 10 less fuel consumption is generated by the gc speed optimization method for the 50 slow steaming operation furthermore the metocean uncertainties i e the difference between forecasts and hindcast metocean data have a very large impact on the ship s voyage optimizations for the optimized ship routes using the forecast data the actual fuel consumption estimated using the extracted hindcast data differ on average 16 with its maximum value up to 25 when both the forecast and hindcast metocean data is used for the voyage optimizations the fuel consumption along routes generated by the same method can differ by about 11 those uncertainties can totally counteract all benefits of fuel saving from any voyage optimization methods therefore it should be extremely cautious to use the optimal routes from the course optimization method if the routes differ significantly from our conventional routes such as the great circle routes it should also be noted that when reducing the engine power to 75 of the normal power setting for the slow steaming the fuel saving is not very obvious about 6 5 but the fuel consumption of 50 slow steaming is significantly reduced about 40 because the voyage optimization is more capable to search for sailing waypoints to avoid harsh sea environments the interactions between the slow steaming and voyage optimization are further investigated in the next subsection for this specific voyage20090202 normally the voyage planning for eastbound voyages is rather easy since the metocean conditions are relatively calm and storms are always moving from the west to the east for the winter eastbound voyage20090121 the cs course optimization method generates a bit better results than the gc speed optimization method but large uncertainties are also observed when metocean forecasts and hindcasts are used for the fuel consumption analysis within the voyage optimizations for the typical summer voyage20090618 the cs course optimization method generates routes consuming 3 4 7 more fuel than the gc speed optimization method for normal 75 and 50 slow steaming operations if the forecast metocean data is used for the voyage optimization when the hindcast data is used for the voyage optimization the gc speed optimization method results in on average 4 less fuel than the cs course optimization method the sailing courses of most summer eastbound voyages are quite similar either sailing along the great circle route or the rhumb line routes the most benefit of fuel saving is observed by the 50 slow steaming combined with the gc speed optimization method the fuel consumption has been reduced by more than 50 in comparison with the normal power ship operations finally the cs course optimization method generates routes whose sailing distance might be 10 20 longer than the shortest routes the cs course optimization method optimizes a voyage by diverging the course from the great circle route to find avoid some harsh sea environments predicted along the shortest route however due to uncertainties of metocean forecasts the longer sailing routes generated by the cs course optimization method may results in larger fuel consumption if actual metocean environment is considered in the post voyage analysis the trajectories of all the planned routes optimized by the cs course optimization method are presented in fig 20 for all the two chosen winter voyages the voyage optimizations are carried out for both the normal power and slow steaming operations for the winter westbound voyages metocean uncertainties have a big impact on the trajectories of optimized routes furthermore operations of various power settings also differ significantly while for the eastbound voyages the trajectories of the optimized routes are quite similar 5 2 analysis of benefits for slow steaming and its impact due to uncertain metocean forecast in fig 21 the sailing speeds and encountered h s obtained from the gc speed optimization method and cs course optimization method are presented for the normal power 75 and 50 slow steaming operations respectively the westbound voyage 20090202 is chosen for the following investigation firstly the forecast metocean data is used for the voyage optimization and the sailing speeds and encountered h s along the optimized routes are presented in fig 21 a secondly the actual metocean conditions along the above optimized routes are extracted from the hindcast data the results are presented in fig 21 b finally the voyage optimizations are performed using the hindcast data and the corresponding results are presented in fig 21 c they are corresponding to the step 1 2 and 3 in section 4 fig 21 a shows that even using the same metocean data source i e the forecast metocean information the encountered h s along the routes generated by various optimization methods can differ significantly the cs course optimization method generates optimal routes with relatively calm metocean conditions by long sailing distance the gc speed optimization method adjusts a ship s sailing speed to avoid large storms of big h s both sailing speeds and encountered h s are different for various normal slow steaming operations even though the cs course optimization method generates routes with relative calm sea environments based on the forecast metocean information the actual encountered h s along these routes are generally larger than the routes generated by the gc speed optimization method as shown in fig 21 b this is mainly due to the uncertainties of metocean forecast as inputs into the voyage optimization methods it also indicates potential risks of wasting fuel when a cs course optimization method recommends an optimized route with long sailing distance this fact is also indicated by the comparison of predicted fuel consumption using metocean forecast and actual fuel consumption using hindcast data as in table 6 finally when the actual metocean data i e hindcast data is used for the voyage optimization the trend of results presented in fig 21 c looks quite similar to fig 21 a in general the cs course optimization method is more effective for voyage planning with relatively calm metocean conditions but the total fuel consumptions are not necessarily less than the gc speed optimization method due to longer sailing distance as shown in the results of tables 3 6 however it should be noted that actual hindcast data will never be available for ship voyage optimizations large uncertainties in metocean forecasts may lead to the fact that the cs course optimization method may generate routes encountering larger h s than the gc speed optimization method it has been shown in table 6 that the performance of the 75 slow steaming operation with 6 5 fuel saving to normal power operation does not work well in comparison with the 50 slow steaming operation with 50 fuel saving the voyage optimizations are carried out by the gc speed optimization method using the hindcast data the sailing speeds and encountered hs along the optimized route are presented in fig 21 c in addition fig 22 illustrates the simple weight graph encountered h s 2 for the great circle route with various speed configurations within the gc speed optimization method fig 21 a is for the eastbound voyage20090121 while the fig 22 b is for the westbound voyage20090202 the boundaries of 0 4v and 1 2v where v is the ship s service speed at the normal power operations imply that how useful the gc speed optimization can be applied to avoid encountering storms along the great circle route for the winter westbound voyage20090202 there are two storms moving against the great circle route it is shown that the ship s speeds under the normal power and 75 slow steaming operations are fast at the beginning of the voyage this helps the ships to avoid encountering the centre area of the first storm unfortunately the 50 slow steaming operation did not manage to avoid the centre area of the first storm since the first storm was moving crossing the route the sailing time inside the storm is not that long furthermore the speeds are adjusted to the lowest level by the gc speed optimization method the ship s fuel consumption when sailing around the first storm is not very high and then in the following operations the ship under 50 slow steaming operations is always navigated in quite calm sea conditions obviously with optimized speed configurations with respect to fuel saving to optimize the ship s speed during the storm can be more efficient in this case however it should be noted that for safety reasons the extremely slow steaming can be quite challenging for example in this case the 50 slow steaming operation encounters the largest h s while for the eastbound voyage20090121 it is clearly shown that the gc speed optimization method successfully helps the 50 slow steaming operations avoid two big storms 6 conclusion many uncertain factors are involved in a ship s voyage optimization process such as the fuel cost speed power relationship models metocean forecast models and various operation inputs concerning the negatives impacts associated with these uncertainties more complex 3 dimensional voyage optimization methods may lead to worse voyage planning results than a simple conventional great circle sailing this study proposed a speed optimization method for a fixed great circle course to counteract the negative impact of these uncertain inputs especially the uncertainties of forecast metocean conditions the proposed gc speed optimization method is compared with a conventional 2 dimensional cs course optimization method with respect to minimizing a ship s fuel consumption while keeping the same expected time of arrival eta the gc speed optimization method aims at avoiding harsh metocean environments by optimizing the ship s sailing speeds at the waypoints along the fixed reference great circle route while the cs course optimization method is performed by searching for waypoints course with calm metocean conditions the full scale measurements of a 2800teu containership during the entire year 2009 are used to quantify the impact of these uncertainties on the ship s voyage optimizations for minimum fuel cost firstly if two different speed power fuel cost estimation models are used for the voyage optimization the fuel consumption along the optimized routes can differ from 4 to 10 due to the fuel cost model uncertainties furthermore the comparison with ensemble metocean forecasts and the actual weather information from hindcast data shows that metocean forecast becomes unreliable after 2 3 days in particular for harsh metocean environments in addition today s ships are often operated in a very slow steaming condition using about 30 50 main engine power the slow steaming operations also influence a ship s voyage optimization the uncertainties in metocean forecast have significant impacts on the ship s voyage optimizations i e a 3 10 difference in fuel consumption even for the optimal routes generated by the same voyage optimization method for the two chosen winter voyages the difference can be as high as 16 on average in addition there is a large difference in the ship s trajectories of the optimized ship routes associated with the inputs of uncertain metocean conditions in voyage optimization methods furthermore for the extremely unusual harsh metocean environments around the sailing area of a specific voyage the course optimization method can generate better optimal routes by sailing 10 more distance with less fuel consumption than the shortest route however for most of the chosen voyages the gc speed optimization method can generate better optimal routes with less fuel consumption for both eastbound and westbound voyages for the slow steaming operations the gc speed optimization method gives more freedom to optimize a ship s speeds because of large reserved engine power comparing the results from 100 service power voyage optimizations for the ship operated with 50 service power shows much more significant improvement of fuel saving than the optimization results for the 75 service power slow steaming operation for the slow steaming operations a voyage optimization method should be strongly recommended to achieve higher fuel saving because the sailing course and speeds along the optimized route will be significantly different from the normal operations credit authorship

22028,under fatigue loading crack damage shaped by stress concentration of pitting corrosion in the steel plate adversely affects the strength of ship structure a nonlinear finite element study is carried out in this paper to investigate how coupled corrosion and crack damage influences the ultimate strength of ship plate the parameters such as the length angle and transverse position of cracks corrosion density and depth and the plate slenderness ratio are taken into account in the present study it is presumed that the crack is through thickness and symmetrically distributed inside and on both sides of the corrosion pits and no contact of crack faces occurs at the ultimate limit state reasonable crack gap and a shape of semicircular tip are employed based on numerical results the crack propagation is not considered in this paper it is found that the major crack impacts on the ultimate strength depend on the interactions between the length and location as well as the plate slenderness ratio in addition the effect of different corrosion factors can be attributed to the corrosion volume when the crack and corrosion exist together in the plate their reduction for the ultimate strength is less than their superposition when they exist alone moreover the difference of these two reductions becomes larger as the crack angle increases based on numerical results two mathematical formulas for predicting the residual ultimate strength of steel unstiffened plates with coupled corrosion and crack damage are proposed for longitudinal cracks transverse and inclined cracks respectively keywords pitting corrosion crack ship plate ultimate strength nonlinear finite element 1 introduction the overall failure mode of hull structure is often manifested as a fracture of aging ship due to severe corrosion and crack damage which significantly lead to deteriorating their performance therefore the fracture obviously poses a great threat to the safety of ships and people in general the destruction of hull structure is characterized by the buckling failure of basic components such as ship plates after the plate is corroded the crack caused by the stress concentration under the fatigue loading has an adverse effect on the ultimate strength consequently it is essential to study the ultimate strength of ship plate with coupled corrosion and crack damage numerous significant results on the studies with regard to the ultimate strength of unstiffened and stiffened plates with crack damage and pitting corrosion have been previously obtained by the following scholars paik and thayamballi 2002 as well as paik et al 2003 conducted experimental tests to inspect dop on the hull plate and found that when the dop is about 10 the ultimate strength is reduced by 20 then a designed formula was proposed for the ultimate strength of the pitting plate based on the minimum cross sectional area rahbar ranji 2012 studied the ultimate strength of corroded steel plates with irregular surfaces under in plane compression and evaluated the ultimate strength as a function of corrosion conditions huang et al 2010 simplified the pitting shape to cylinder cone and hemisphere the analysis results showed that the shape has little effect on the ultimate strength with the same corrosion volume loss furthermore an ultimate strength reduction formula based on corrosion volume losses was established jiang et al 2009 carried on finite element analyses on corroded milled steel plates and found that the corrosion volume is the main factor to the corroded hull plate besides the plate slenderness ratio and it was concluded that one sided corrosion is more dangerous than double sided corrosion wang et al 2018 conducted a series of nonlinear analyses on unstiffened plates and stiffened panels to research the mechanisms of structural collapse due to random pitting damage garbatov et al 2014 2016 2017 carried on experiments of corroded stiffened plates and found that the material properties and ultimate strength of stiffened plates are significantly reduced by seawater corrosion regression equations were derived for the material properties as a function of the degree of corrosion degradation combined with the guideline procedure the ultimate strength of severe corroded stiffened plates can be evaluated in the regard of evaluating the residual ultimate strength of hull structures with crack damage a large number of studies also have been carried out in the field of ship and marine engineering paik et al 2005 and paik 2008 2009 experimentally and numerically studied the influences of transverse and longitudinal cracks on the ultimate strength of steel plate alinia et al 2007 found that the combinational effects of crack length and angle can lead to significant degradation of the ultimate strength and stiffness of shear panels the study of bayatfar et al 2014 showed that the cracks located at the peak or trough of the half wave will greatly weaken the ultimate strength cui et al 2016 put forward a formula based on the projected length of central inclined crack to predict the residual ultimate strength of the plate xia et al 2018 put forward that the effects of crack initial deformation and residual stress on the ultimate strength can not be simply superimposed yu et al 2018 established a mathematical formula to evaluate the ultimate strength of stiffened cracked plate babazadeh and khedmati 2019 analyzed the reduction behavior of the ultimate strength with varying the length of central crack slenderness ratio and aspect ratio of the plate shi et al 2019 proposed that the ultimate strength characteristics of cracked stiffened plate subject to axial compression are more complex than the tensile one literature review indicates that the studies of the residual ultimate strength of hull plates mainly focuses on the effect of the single corrosion or crack and there is no quantitative research report on the influences of couled corrosion and crack damage in order to bridge this research gap this paper aims to comprehensively understand the influence mechanism of specific corrosion and crack parameters on the structural residual strength a series of nonlinear finite element analyses were carried out to investigate the effects of coupled corrosion and crack damage varying with the length angle and transverse position of cracks corrosion density and depth as well as slenderness ratio it is presumed that the crack is through thickness and symmetrically distributed inside and on both sides of the corrosion pits and no contact occurs between their faces at the ultimate limit state it should be pointed out that the crack propagation is not considered in this paper based on lots of simulation analyses two mathematical formulas aiming at assessing the residual ultimate strength of ship plates with coupled corrosion and crack damage are proposed for longitudinal cracks transverse and inclined cracks respectively 2 finite element modeling 2 1 geometry and material the finite element model of ship plate adopted in the present study is taken from paik et al 2003 the dimension length breadth thickness is a b t 2400 800 t mm three plate thicknesses are considered in this paper which are t 11 83 16 56 27 6 mm the plate slenderness ratio defined as β b t σ y e 1 2 is 1 2 2 0 and 2 8 respectively as shown in fig 1 the longitudinal and transverse centerline of the panel are individually parallel to the x axis and y axis the corroded and cracked plate model used in this paper has been idealized to some extent jiang and guedes soares 2012 investigated the influence of double sided pitting corrosion on the ultimate strength of rectangular plate under compression shi et al 2018 numerically assessed the corrosion effect on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels in their studies corrosion pits are uniformly distributed in the plate and the pit shapes are all cylindrical in order to simplify the finite element model the same distribution form and pit shape are also used in this paper the depth and diameter of the corrosion pit are t r and d r respectively for the corrosion pit diameter d r 40 mm is employed in the subsequent analyses the corrosion density is defined as the ratio of the corrosion area to the panel area namely dop a corrosion a panel the crack formed by corrosion pit due to stress concentration and fatigue may penetrate through multiple pits it is assumed in this paper that the crack is through thickness and symmetrically distributed inside and on both sides of the corrosion pit which is located at the transverse centerline of the plate when the crack length increases the number of pits penetrated by the crack also grows the distance from crack center to the longitudinal centerline is s and the crack length and gap are 2c and w the angle between the crack edge and the longitudinal centerline is θ so the projected crack length normal to the longitudinal centerline is e 2csinθ cui et al 2016 have researched the influence of crack position on the residual ultimate strength of steel plate their study demonstrated that the effect of longitudinal position is relatively small while the transverse position has a significant impact thus only transverse position is considered first in this paper the material properties used in the numerical model are the same as those of paik et al 2003 the elastic modulus is e 205800 mpa poisson s ratio υ 0 3 and the yield stress σ y 352 8 mpa it should be noted that the hardening of the material is ignored in this paper 2 2 boundary and loading conditions the panels with pitting corrosion and crack damage surrounded by stiffeners are usually extracted from continuous stiffened bottom plates and deck plates compared to the bending rigidity of the stiffener that of the plate is much smaller so the restraints of the four edges are between those of simple and clamped support in order to conservatively evaluate the residual ultimate strength of the damaged plate as shown in fig 2 simply supported boundary conditions similar to sultana et al 2015 are employed in the present study uniform longitudinal displacement is applied on one short side to make the plate collapses gradually under compression while the in plane movement of the other short side is restrained against in addition the rx rotations of short edges and ry of long edges as well as the displacements in z direction of all edges are also constrained transverse y direction displacement of one long side is restricted while the other one is not limited 2 3 initial imperfection different initial defects such as initial deformation and welding residual stress are often produced in ship plates during manufacturing and welding which may reduce the ultimate bearing capacity in order to simplify the finite element model we only consider the initial deformation and the residual stress is ignored many scholars have conducted a lot of investigations on the initial deformation of ship plate however due to its complexity it is typically assumed the initial deformation follows the shape of the lowest buckling mode as shown in eq 1 the amplitude is a 0 0 1β 2 t in eq 1 m is the bucking half wave number of the panel in the longitudinal direction when a b is an integer it is equal to a b therefore m 2400 800 3 in this paper fig 3 shows an example of the initial deformation for the plate with coupled damage of double sided pitting corrosion and crack 1 w 0 a 0 sin m π x a sin π y b 2 4 element type and convergence study the numerical results of yu et al 2018 demonstrated that the s4r element of abaqus software can well simulate the collapse process of steel stiffened plates with crack damage it is a 4 node quadrilateral element with 6 degrees of freedom for each node which is suitable for analyzing large deformation problems of thin shell structures as a result the s4r element is used to predict the residual strength of corroded and cracked plate in the present study appropriate mesh sizes are supposed to be considered in the fe model to accurately simulate the platting collapse at the same time the calculation cost should be reduced as much as possible in order to decide reasonable mesh sizes to balance the accuracy of calculation and computational cost a corroded and cracked plate is selected to conduct convergence study before numerical simulation the parameters of this plate are as follows β 2 0 dop 4 91 t r t 0 5 d r 40 mm 2c b 0 5 θ 90 s b 0 w 3 mm as presented in fig 4 the plate is divided into four regions namely corrosion pits crack tips crack edges and their vicinity and the remaining regions these regions are meshed by coarse middle and refined sizes to compare the ultimate strength of the panel the relative differences of the ultimate strength of coarse and refined meshes are small which can be seen in table 1 fig 5 shows the membrane stress distributions and deformations of the crack tips and their vicinity of different mesh sizes when the plate reaches the ultimate limit state obviously middle sized meshes can well predict the stress distributions in the areas of crack and corrosion pit compared to refined meshes so they are adopted in the fe simulations 2 5 effects of crack tip shape and gap babazadeh and khedmati 2019 have studied the influences of crack tip shape and gap on the ultimate strength of cracked plates the effects of these factors on the ultimate strength and deformation of corroded and cracked plates are also investigated in the present study it can be seen from table 2 that the relative errors of the ultimate strength are small for different crack tip shapes and gaps fig 6 shows the membrane stress distributions and deformations of different crack tip shapes the deformation of semicircular tip is more gentle and its stress concentration is not serious comparatively therefore semicircular crack tip shape is employed in this paper it should be pointed out that the crack propagation is not considered in our research referring to cui et al 2017 fig 7 presents the membrane stress distributions and deformations of the crack centers with different gaps for case of w 1 mm the crack faces have already contacted it can be further seen from table 2 that the crack face distance at the uls is 0 32 mm which does not satisfy the assumption that the crack faces will not contact when the plate reaches the ultimate limit state so the crack gap w 3 mm chosen by babazadeh and khedmati 2019 is also employed in the fe simulations 2 6 finite element model verification the reliability of the finite element model is verified in this paper before numerical simulations the finite element results of the corroded plate and cracked plate of paik et al 2003 and paik 2009 are viewed as the validation standards respectively it should be noted that in the their models the residual stress and material hardening are not considered the geometric and material properties are shown in fig 8 a and b as illustrated in fig 8c the stress strain relationships of this paper and paik agree well the differences of the ultimate strength of the corroded plate and cracked plate are 1 5 and 3 8 respectively and their initial stiffness is nearly the same which indicates that the finite element model adopted in this study is reliable 3 finite element analysis results in this section the initial defects of corroded and cracked plates are established by abaqus software and then introduced into the post buckling analyses the arc length method is used to calculate the ultimate strength of the plates under longitudinal compression the researched parameters of the corroded and cracked plates are shown in table 3 the definitions of these parameters in the table are as follows dop is the relative corrosion area which can be seen as above and t r t relative corrosion depth δv v 0 relative corrosion volume that is δv v 0 dop t r t 2c b relative crack length s b relative transverse position three transverse positions are included in our consideration as can be seen from fig 9 for different dop and 2c b s b is various when s b is equal to 0 the crack center is located at the panel center it is not difficult to understand that if s b is the maximum for different 2c b and dop the crack tip will be closest to the long edge of the plate however the cracks are always symmetrically distributed about the penetrated pits besides the coincident parts of the crack and pits will increase with 2c b t r t and dop three crack angles are considered which are θ 0 longitudinal 45 inclined 90 transverse in order to research the influences of the interactions between the crack and pitting corrosion on the ultimate strength of ship plate this chapter not only calculates the ultimate strength of the plates with both damages but also computes that when they exist alone based on a series of nonlinear fe analyses the influences of various parameters on the ultimate strength of corroded and cracked plates are discussed as follows 3 1 effect of crack 3 1 1 effects of crack length and angle fig 10 shows the non dimensional average stress strain relationships of corroded plates with central cracks of different relative lengths and angles when dop 15 9 t 16 56 mm β 2 t r t 0 5 and s b 0 in fig 10a and b σ is the average stress of the corroded plate and that with coupled damage of crack and corrosion the crack length and angle have no effect on the initial stiffness of the corroded plate however as can be seen from fig 10c the ultimate strength reduction factor σ u σ u1 decreases significantly with the increase of the relative crack length 2c b and angle θ where σ u and σ u1 are the ultimate strength of the corroded plate with crack damage and that only with corrosion respectively additionally the influence of longitudinal crack θ 0 on the ultimate strength should not be ignored the corroded and cracked plates are divided into two types based on the differences of the ultimate strength characteristics of the plates with different crack angles the first type is the case of longitudinal crack θ 0 and second type transverse crack θ 90 and inclined crack θ 45 fig 11 a and b shows separately σ u σ u1 variations of the first type cracks with 2c b and those of the second type with relative projected length e b it is obvious that σ u σ u1 has a linear relationship with 2c b and e b in the both cases fig 12 illustrates the failure modes and membrane stress distributions of the corroded and cracked plates with different angles when 2c b 0 35 and that only with corrosion the stress distribution and deformation of the corroded plate is seriously changed by the cracks comparatively the stress distributions in the areas near crack tips differ from those of crack centers in addition it can be found from the figure that the corrosion pits penetrated by cracks also produce great stresses due to the reduced thicknesses 3 1 2 effect of plate slenderness ratio on the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the fe results of babazadeh and khedmati 2019 with the plate slenderness ratio decreases the ultimate strength reduction rate increases when the central transverse crack is lengthened in this part not only the effect of the slenderness ratio on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the corroded and cracked plate with transverse crack damage is investigated but also that of longitudinal crack is studied fig 13 a and b shows the characteristics of ultimate strength reduction factor varying with relative lengths of central longitudinal and transverse cracks when s b 0 the slope of the fitted straight line is the ultimate strength reduction rate m β which is considered as a positive value in this paper it can be seen from the figures that m β decreases when the plate slenderness increases in the case of transverse crack this result is evidently consistent with that of babazadeh and khedmati 2019 however for longitudinal crack the decreasing trend of m β is not obvious comparatively these two reduction rates m β of transverse and longitudinal cracked plates are fitted by eqs 2 and 3 respectively their curves can be seen in fig 13c 2 m 1 β 0 0647 β 2 0 2285 β 0 0903 3 m 2 β 0 0947 β 2 0 104 β 0 8942 3 1 3 joint effects of crack length and transverse position together with plate slenderness ratio on the basis of the numerical results the effect of transverse position on the ultimate strength is related to the crack length and slenderness ratio figs 14 and 15 present how σ u σ u1 of the corroded and cracked plates decreases with s b 2 when β 1 2 2 0 2 8 dop 15 9 t r t 0 5 2c b 0 2 0 35 0 5 θ 0 90 it is evident that if the longitudinal and transverse cracks are close the panel edges the ultimate strength reduction factor will be smaller in the situations of both transverse and longitudinal cracks when the slenderness ratio and relative length of cracks increase the decreasing slope a 2c b β of the fitted straight line which can be seen as a reduction rate of transverse position also becomes greater a 2c b β is a quantity closely related to 2c b and β treated as a positive value in this research fig 16 a and b illustrate this reduction rate for θ 0 and θ 90 respectively whose definition can be seen from eqs 4 and 5 obviously for transverse crack the reduction effect of the transverse position on the ultimate strength is more significant 4 a 2 c b β 0 35

effect of corrosion huang et al 2010 have studied the effects of various corrosion parameters on the residual ultimate strength of ship plates finally it was found in their paper that the corrosion volume is the key influencing factor based on the plate with only crack damage the mechanism of different corrosion parameters on the ultimate strength is investigated in this section fig 17 a presents the characteristics of the ultimate strength reduction factor σ u σ u2 varying with different dop t r t and β when 2c b 0 5 θ 90 s b 0 σ u and σ u2 shown in the figure are the ultimate strength of the cracked plate with corrosion damage and the cracked plate respectively it can be understood that σ u σ u2 declines with dop and t r t but effected little by the plate slenderness ratio fig 17b shows the variation of σ u σ u2 with the relative corrosion volume δv v 0 under different β where δv and v 0 are the loss volume due to corrosion and the plate volume respectively as can be seen from fig 17b σ u σ u2 reduces linearly with δv v 0 and with a ratio of 1 7 3 3 combined effects of crack and corrosion in order to examine the interaction between the crack and corrosion the reduction of the ultimate strength of the complete plate by them when they exist together is contrasted with the superimposed one when they exist alone figs 18 and 19 present the characteristics of reduction percentage δσ 1 of complete plate ultimate strength by the crack and corrosion when they coexist and the superimposed one δσ 2 when they exist alone with different β 2c b and δv v 0 in the case of s b 0 θ 0 90 δσ 1 and δσ 2 in the figures are defined by eqs 6 and 7 respectively besides σ u0 is the ultimate strength of the complete plate σ u σ u1 and σ u2 are defined as above it can be seen from these figures that δσ 2 is generally greater than δσ 1 so it is known that the superposition effect caused by the crack and corrosion is more serious when they exist alone but the differences between δσ 1 and δσ 2 are not the same for different crack angles as illustrated in fig 18 δσ 1 and δσ 2 are roughly the same varying different slenderness ratios relative crack lengths and corrosion volumes it is indicated that the influences of longitudinal crack and pitting corrosion on the complete plate ultimate strength can be linearly superimposed however according to fig 19 the differences between δσ 1 and δσ 2 gradually become greater when the relative crack lengths and corrosion volumes increase and the slenderness ratio decreases therefore the simple superposition of the effects of transverse crack and pitting corrosion may produce great errors the reason for the differences is that the coincident volumes of corrosion pits and longitudinal cracks which penetrate the plate thicknesses have little effect on the ultimate strength conversely the impact of coincident volumes formed by transverse crack and corrosion pits on the ultimate strength is gradually enhanced with this volumes increase 6 δ σ 1 σ u0 σ u σ u0 100 7 δ σ 2 σ u0 σ u 1 σ u0 σ u 2 σ u0 100 4 empirical formulas for predicting the ultimate strength of steel unstiffened plates with coupled corrosion and crack damage it is evident from the previous discussions that the effects of longitudinal cracks and transverse and inclined cracks on the ultimate strength are different based on the numerical results two formulas for evaluating the residual ultimate strength of the corroded and cracked plates are proposed for longitudinal cracks transverse and inclined cracks respectively which can be seen in eqs 8 and 9 m 1 β and m 2 β are the ultimate strength reduction rates of the plate with longitudinal crack and the one with transverse or inclined crack respectively presented in eqs 2 and 3 as defined by eqs 4 and 5 a 2c b β and a e b β are the reduction rates of transverse position it has previously put forward that when 2c b and δv v 0 are greater as well as β is smaller the influences of transverse crack and pitting corrosion on the ultimate strength cannot be simply superimposed as a result on the basics of the fe results obtained in this paper the corrected factor is proposed in eq 9 namely c with a value of 0 055 it should be noted that the relative corrosion volume δv v 0 in eqs 8 and 9 is expressed as a percentage 8 σ u σ u 0 1 m 1 β 2 c b 1 a 2 c b β s b 2 1 7 δ v 100 v 0 9 σ u σ u 0 1 m 2 β e b 1 a e b β s b 2 1 7 δ v 100 v 0 c fig 20 shows the error analysis results of eq 8 applicable to the longitudinal crack fig 20a presents the comparisons of ultimate strength reduction factors of 108 fe models with longitudinal crack damage and those calculated by eq 8 as can be seen from the figure all results points are close to the red symmetry line both results have a good correlation with cov 0 003 and the average value of the ratios of fem results to formula results is mean 1 02 moreover from the error distribution shown in fig 20b it is evident that the relative errors of eq 8 are mostly less than 5 compared to nonlinear fem the proportion of errors less than 7 and more than 5 is only 6 5 obviously eq 8 can effectively evaluate the residual ultimate strength of corroded plate with longitudinal crack damage finally error analysis of eq 9 suitable for the transverse and inclined cracks is carried out in fig 21 the ultimate strength reduction factors of 216 models calculated by nonlinear fem and eq 9 are shown in fig 21a all data points are approximately evenly located on both sides of the symmetry line the results have a good correlation with mean 0 991 and cov 0 012 fig 21b shows the relative error distribution as can be seen that the models with errors between 5 and 5 account for 94 furthermore all errors have an absolute value with less than 10 evidently eq 9 can also accurately assess the residual ultimate strength of corroded plate with transverse or inclined crack 5 conclusion in the present study nonlinear finite element method is used to investigate the ultimate strength reduction characteristics of steel unstiffened plate with coupled corrosion and crack damage under longitudinal compression effects of crack length angle and transverse position corrosion density and depth as well as the plate slenderness ratio have been analyzed it is assumed that the crack is through thickness and has no propagation and no contact between their faces at the ultimate limit state the sensitive factors such as element type mesh density crack gap and tip shape which may interfere with the calculation results of the ultimate strength are discussed the reliability of the finite element model is verified by the finite element results of the corroded plate and cracked plate of paik et al 2003 and paik 2009 based on a series of numerical results calculated by abaqus software the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for corroded plate with transverse or inclined crack the ultimate strength decreases linearly with crack projected length for corroded plate with longitudinal crack it is also decreased linearly with actual crack length the ultimate strength of corroded plate with crack damage of different angles reduces when the crack is close to the panel edge in addition the reduction rate increases with the crack length and slenderness ratio increase if the crack length increases the ultimate strength reduction rate of the corroded plate with crack damage will present diverse variation with different crack angles that is for transverse crack the reduction rate decreases evidently as the slenderness ratio increases but this reduction is not remarkable for longitudinal crack the effects of corrosion density and depth on the ultimate strength of cracked plate can be attributed to the effect of corrosion volume the ultimate strength reduction factor decreases linearly with the corrosion volume in the case of constant crack parameters 2 when the crack and corrosion exist alone in a complete panel their superposition of the ultimate strength reduction is generally greater than that when they coexist yet for longitudinal crack the superposition is almost equal to the reduction when they coexist therefore the influences of the longitudinal crack and corrosion on the ultimate strength of the complete plate can be linearly superimposed for the case of transverse and inclined cracks when the coincident volumes of the crack and corrosion pits increase or the slenderness ratio decreases the superposition becomes greater than the reduction as they coexist consequently the effects of corrosion and transverse or inclined crack cannot be simply superimposed a corrected factor is proposed in the present study to solve this problem 3 based on a large number of nonlinear finite element results two empirical formulas for evaluating the residual ultimate strength of corroded and cracked plates are proposed for longitudinal cracks transverse and inclined cracks respectively compared to all nonlinear fe results the relative errors of both formulas are small credit author statement liang feng conceptualization methodology software writing reviewing and

22028,under fatigue loading crack damage shaped by stress concentration of pitting corrosion in the steel plate adversely affects the strength of ship structure a nonlinear finite element study is carried out in this paper to investigate how coupled corrosion and crack damage influences the ultimate strength of ship plate the parameters such as the length angle and transverse position of cracks corrosion density and depth and the plate slenderness ratio are taken into account in the present study it is presumed that the crack is through thickness and symmetrically distributed inside and on both sides of the corrosion pits and no contact of crack faces occurs at the ultimate limit state reasonable crack gap and a shape of semicircular tip are employed based on numerical results the crack propagation is not considered in this paper it is found that the major crack impacts on the ultimate strength depend on the interactions between the length and location as well as the plate slenderness ratio in addition the effect of different corrosion factors can be attributed to the corrosion volume when the crack and corrosion exist together in the plate their reduction for the ultimate strength is less than their superposition when they exist alone moreover the difference of these two reductions becomes larger as the crack angle increases based on numerical results two mathematical formulas for predicting the residual ultimate strength of steel unstiffened plates with coupled corrosion and crack damage are proposed for longitudinal cracks transverse and inclined cracks respectively keywords pitting corrosion crack ship plate ultimate strength nonlinear finite element 1 introduction the overall failure mode of hull structure is often manifested as a fracture of aging ship due to severe corrosion and crack damage which significantly lead to deteriorating their performance therefore the fracture obviously poses a great threat to the safety of ships and people in general the destruction of hull structure is characterized by the buckling failure of basic components such as ship plates after the plate is corroded the crack caused by the stress concentration under the fatigue loading has an adverse effect on the ultimate strength consequently it is essential to study the ultimate strength of ship plate with coupled corrosion and crack damage numerous significant results on the studies with regard to the ultimate strength of unstiffened and stiffened plates with crack damage and pitting corrosion have been previously obtained by the following scholars paik and thayamballi 2002 as well as paik et al 2003 conducted experimental tests to inspect dop on the hull plate and found that when the dop is about 10 the ultimate strength is reduced by 20 then a designed formula was proposed for the ultimate strength of the pitting plate based on the minimum cross sectional area rahbar ranji 2012 studied the ultimate strength of corroded steel plates with irregular surfaces under in plane compression and evaluated the ultimate strength as a function of corrosion conditions huang et al 2010 simplified the pitting shape to cylinder cone and hemisphere the analysis results showed that the shape has little effect on the ultimate strength with the same corrosion volume loss furthermore an ultimate strength reduction formula based on corrosion volume losses was established jiang et al 2009 carried on finite element analyses on corroded milled steel plates and found that the corrosion volume is the main factor to the corroded hull plate besides the plate slenderness ratio and it was concluded that one sided corrosion is more dangerous than double sided corrosion wang et al 2018 conducted a series of nonlinear analyses on unstiffened plates and stiffened panels to research the mechanisms of structural collapse due to random pitting damage garbatov et al 2014 2016 2017 carried on experiments of corroded stiffened plates and found that the material properties and ultimate strength of stiffened plates are significantly reduced by seawater corrosion regression equations were derived for the material properties as a function of the degree of corrosion degradation combined with the guideline procedure the ultimate strength of severe corroded stiffened plates can be evaluated in the regard of evaluating the residual ultimate strength of hull structures with crack damage a large number of studies also have been carried out in the field of ship and marine engineering paik et al 2005 and paik 2008 2009 experimentally and numerically studied the influences of transverse and longitudinal cracks on the ultimate strength of steel plate alinia et al 2007 found that the combinational effects of crack length and angle can lead to significant degradation of the ultimate strength and stiffness of shear panels the study of bayatfar et al 2014 showed that the cracks located at the peak or trough of the half wave will greatly weaken the ultimate strength cui et al 2016 put forward a formula based on the projected length of central inclined crack to predict the residual ultimate strength of the plate xia et al 2018 put forward that the effects of crack initial deformation and residual stress on the ultimate strength can not be simply superimposed yu et al 2018 established a mathematical formula to evaluate the ultimate strength of stiffened cracked plate babazadeh and khedmati 2019 analyzed the reduction behavior of the ultimate strength with varying the length of central crack slenderness ratio and aspect ratio of the plate shi et al 2019 proposed that the ultimate strength characteristics of cracked stiffened plate subject to axial compression are more complex than the tensile one literature review indicates that the studies of the residual ultimate strength of hull plates mainly focuses on the effect of the single corrosion or crack and there is no quantitative research report on the influences of couled corrosion and crack damage in order to bridge this research gap this paper aims to comprehensively understand the influence mechanism of specific corrosion and crack parameters on the structural residual strength a series of nonlinear finite element analyses were carried out to investigate the effects of coupled corrosion and crack damage varying with the length angle and transverse position of cracks corrosion density and depth as well as slenderness ratio it is presumed that the crack is through thickness and symmetrically distributed inside and on both sides of the corrosion pits and no contact occurs between their faces at the ultimate limit state it should be pointed out that the crack propagation is not considered in this paper based on lots of simulation analyses two mathematical formulas aiming at assessing the residual ultimate strength of ship plates with coupled corrosion and crack damage are proposed for longitudinal cracks transverse and inclined cracks respectively 2 finite element modeling 2 1 geometry and material the finite element model of ship plate adopted in the present study is taken from paik et al 2003 the dimension length breadth thickness is a b t 2400 800 t mm three plate thicknesses are considered in this paper which are t 11 83 16 56 27 6 mm the plate slenderness ratio defined as β b t σ y e 1 2 is 1 2 2 0 and 2 8 respectively as shown in fig 1 the longitudinal and transverse centerline of the panel are individually parallel to the x axis and y axis the corroded and cracked plate model used in this paper has been idealized to some extent jiang and guedes soares 2012 investigated the influence of double sided pitting corrosion on the ultimate strength of rectangular plate under compression shi et al 2018 numerically assessed the corrosion effect on the ultimate strength of stiffened panels in their studies corrosion pits are uniformly distributed in the plate and the pit shapes are all cylindrical in order to simplify the finite element model the same distribution form and pit shape are also used in this paper the depth and diameter of the corrosion pit are t r and d r respectively for the corrosion pit diameter d r 40 mm is employed in the subsequent analyses the corrosion density is defined as the ratio of the corrosion area to the panel area namely dop a corrosion a panel the crack formed by corrosion pit due to stress concentration and fatigue may penetrate through multiple pits it is assumed in this paper that the crack is through thickness and symmetrically distributed inside and on both sides of the corrosion pit which is located at the transverse centerline of the plate when the crack length increases the number of pits penetrated by the crack also grows the distance from crack center to the longitudinal centerline is s and the crack length and gap are 2c and w the angle between the crack edge and the longitudinal centerline is θ so the projected crack length normal to the longitudinal centerline is e 2csinθ cui et al 2016 have researched the influence of crack position on the residual ultimate strength of steel plate their study demonstrated that the effect of longitudinal position is relatively small while the transverse position has a significant impact thus only transverse position is considered first in this paper the material properties used in the numerical model are the same as those of paik et al 2003 the elastic modulus is e 205800 mpa poisson s ratio υ 0 3 and the yield stress σ y 352 8 mpa it should be noted that the hardening of the material is ignored in this paper 2 2 boundary and loading conditions the panels with pitting corrosion and crack damage surrounded by stiffeners are usually extracted from continuous stiffened bottom plates and deck plates compared to the bending rigidity of the stiffener that of the plate is much smaller so the restraints of the four edges are between those of simple and clamped support in order to conservatively evaluate the residual ultimate strength of the damaged plate as shown in fig 2 simply supported boundary conditions similar to sultana et al 2015 are employed in the present study uniform longitudinal displacement is applied on one short side to make the plate collapses gradually under compression while the in plane movement of the other short side is restrained against in addition the rx rotations of short edges and ry of long edges as well as the displacements in z direction of all edges are also constrained transverse y direction displacement of one long side is restricted while the other one is not limited 2 3 initial imperfection different initial defects such as initial deformation and welding residual stress are often produced in ship plates during manufacturing and welding which may reduce the ultimate bearing capacity in order to simplify the finite element model we only consider the initial deformation and the residual stress is ignored many scholars have conducted a lot of investigations on the initial deformation of ship plate however due to its complexity it is typically assumed the initial deformation follows the shape of the lowest buckling mode as shown in eq 1 the amplitude is a 0 0 1β 2 t in eq 1 m is the bucking half wave number of the panel in the longitudinal direction when a b is an integer it is equal to a b therefore m 2400 800 3 in this paper fig 3 shows an example of the initial deformation for the plate with coupled damage of double sided pitting corrosion and crack 1 w 0 a 0 sin m π x a sin π y b 2 4 element type and convergence study the numerical results of yu et al 2018 demonstrated that the s4r element of abaqus software can well simulate the collapse process of steel stiffened plates with crack damage it is a 4 node quadrilateral element with 6 degrees of freedom for each node which is suitable for analyzing large deformation problems of thin shell structures as a result the s4r element is used to predict the residual strength of corroded and cracked plate in the present study appropriate mesh sizes are supposed to be considered in the fe model to accurately simulate the platting collapse at the same time the calculation cost should be reduced as much as possible in order to decide reasonable mesh sizes to balance the accuracy of calculation and computational cost a corroded and cracked plate is selected to conduct convergence study before numerical simulation the parameters of this plate are as follows β 2 0 dop 4 91 t r t 0 5 d r 40 mm 2c b 0 5 θ 90 s b 0 w 3 mm as presented in fig 4 the plate is divided into four regions namely corrosion pits crack tips crack edges and their vicinity and the remaining regions these regions are meshed by coarse middle and refined sizes to compare the ultimate strength of the panel the relative differences of the ultimate strength of coarse and refined meshes are small which can be seen in table 1 fig 5 shows the membrane stress distributions and deformations of the crack tips and their vicinity of different mesh sizes when the plate reaches the ultimate limit state obviously middle sized meshes can well predict the stress distributions in the areas of crack and corrosion pit compared to refined meshes so they are adopted in the fe simulations 2 5 effects of crack tip shape and gap babazadeh and khedmati 2019 have studied the influences of crack tip shape and gap on the ultimate strength of cracked plates the effects of these factors on the ultimate strength and deformation of corroded and cracked plates are also investigated in the present study it can be seen from table 2 that the relative errors of the ultimate strength are small for different crack tip shapes and gaps fig 6 shows the membrane stress distributions and deformations of different crack tip shapes the deformation of semicircular tip is more gentle and its stress concentration is not serious comparatively therefore semicircular crack tip shape is employed in this paper it should be pointed out that the crack propagation is not considered in our research referring to cui et al 2017 fig 7 presents the membrane stress distributions and deformations of the crack centers with different gaps for case of w 1 mm the crack faces have already contacted it can be further seen from table 2 that the crack face distance at the uls is 0 32 mm which does not satisfy the assumption that the crack faces will not contact when the plate reaches the ultimate limit state so the crack gap w 3 mm chosen by babazadeh and khedmati 2019 is also employed in the fe simulations 2 6 finite element model verification the reliability of the finite element model is verified in this paper before numerical simulations the finite element results of the corroded plate and cracked plate of paik et al 2003 and paik 2009 are viewed as the validation standards respectively it should be noted that in the their models the residual stress and material hardening are not considered the geometric and material properties are shown in fig 8 a and b as illustrated in fig 8c the stress strain relationships of this paper and paik agree well the differences of the ultimate strength of the corroded plate and cracked plate are 1 5 and 3 8 respectively and their initial stiffness is nearly the same which indicates that the finite element model adopted in this study is reliable 3 finite element analysis results in this section the initial defects of corroded and cracked plates are established by abaqus software and then introduced into the post buckling analyses the arc length method is used to calculate the ultimate strength of the plates under longitudinal compression the researched parameters of the corroded and cracked plates are shown in table 3 the definitions of these parameters in the table are as follows dop is the relative corrosion area which can be seen as above and t r t relative corrosion depth δv v 0 relative corrosion volume that is δv v 0 dop t r t 2c b relative crack length s b relative transverse position three transverse positions are included in our consideration as can be seen from fig 9 for different dop and 2c b s b is various when s b is equal to 0 the crack center is located at the panel center it is not difficult to understand that if s b is the maximum for different 2c b and dop the crack tip will be closest to the long edge of the plate however the cracks are always symmetrically distributed about the penetrated pits besides the coincident parts of the crack and pits will increase with 2c b t r t and dop three crack angles are considered which are θ 0 longitudinal 45 inclined 90 transverse in order to research the influences of the interactions between the crack and pitting corrosion on the ultimate strength of ship plate this chapter not only calculates the ultimate strength of the plates with both damages but also computes that when they exist alone based on a series of nonlinear fe analyses the influences of various parameters on the ultimate strength of corroded and cracked plates are discussed as follows 3 1 effect of crack 3 1 1 effects of crack length and angle fig 10 shows the non dimensional average stress strain relationships of corroded plates with central cracks of different relative lengths and angles when dop 15 9 t 16 56 mm β 2 t r t 0 5 and s b 0 in fig 10a and b σ is the average stress of the corroded plate and that with coupled damage of crack and corrosion the crack length and angle have no effect on the initial stiffness of the corroded plate however as can be seen from fig 10c the ultimate strength reduction factor σ u σ u1 decreases significantly with the increase of the relative crack length 2c b and angle θ where σ u and σ u1 are the ultimate strength of the corroded plate with crack damage and that only with corrosion respectively additionally the influence of longitudinal crack θ 0 on the ultimate strength should not be ignored the corroded and cracked plates are divided into two types based on the differences of the ultimate strength characteristics of the plates with different crack angles the first type is the case of longitudinal crack θ 0 and second type transverse crack θ 90 and inclined crack θ 45 fig 11 a and b shows separately σ u σ u1 variations of the first type cracks with 2c b and those of the second type with relative projected length e b it is obvious that σ u σ u1 has a linear relationship with 2c b and e b in the both cases fig 12 illustrates the failure modes and membrane stress distributions of the corroded and cracked plates with different angles when 2c b 0 35 and that only with corrosion the stress distribution and deformation of the corroded plate is seriously changed by the cracks comparatively the stress distributions in the areas near crack tips differ from those of crack centers in addition it can be found from the figure that the corrosion pits penetrated by cracks also produce great stresses due to the reduced thicknesses 3 1 2 effect of plate slenderness ratio on the ultimate strength reduction rate according to the fe results of babazadeh and khedmati 2019 with the plate slenderness ratio decreases the ultimate strength reduction rate increases when the central transverse crack is lengthened in this part not only the effect of the slenderness ratio on the ultimate strength reduction rate of the corroded and cracked plate with transverse crack damage is investigated but also that of longitudinal crack is studied fig 13 a and b shows the characteristics of ultimate strength reduction factor varying with relative lengths of central longitudinal and transverse cracks when s b 0 the slope of the fitted straight line is the ultimate strength reduction rate m β which is considered as a positive value in this paper it can be seen from the figures that m β decreases when the plate slenderness increases in the case of transverse crack this result is evidently consistent with that of babazadeh and khedmati 2019 however for longitudinal crack the decreasing trend of m β is not obvious comparatively these two reduction rates m β of transverse and longitudinal cracked plates are fitted by eqs 2 and 3 respectively their curves can be seen in fig 13c 2 m 1 β 0 0647 β 2 0 2285 β 0 0903 3 m 2 β 0 0947 β 2 0 104 β 0 8942 3 1 3 joint effects of crack length and transverse position together with plate slenderness ratio on the basis of the numerical results the effect of transverse position on the ultimate strength is related to the crack length and slenderness ratio figs 14 and 15 present how σ u σ u1 of the corroded and cracked plates decreases with s b 2 when β 1 2 2 0 2 8 dop 15 9 t r t 0 5 2c b 0 2 0 35 0 5 θ 0 90 it is evident that if the longitudinal and transverse cracks are close the panel edges the ultimate strength reduction factor will be smaller in the situations of both transverse and longitudinal cracks when the slenderness ratio and relative length of cracks increase the decreasing slope a 2c b β of the fitted straight line which can be seen as a reduction rate of transverse position also becomes greater a 2c b β is a quantity closely related to 2c b and β treated as a positive value in this research fig 16 a and b illustrate this reduction rate for θ 0 and θ 90 respectively whose definition can be seen from eqs 4 and 5 obviously for transverse crack the reduction effect of the transverse position on the ultimate strength is more significant 4 a 2 c b β 0 35

effect of corrosion huang et al 2010 have studied the effects of various corrosion parameters on the residual ultimate strength of ship plates finally it was found in their paper that the corrosion volume is the key influencing factor based on the plate with only crack damage the mechanism of different corrosion parameters on the ultimate strength is investigated in this section fig 17 a presents the characteristics of the ultimate strength reduction factor σ u σ u2 varying with different dop t r t and β when 2c b 0 5 θ 90 s b 0 σ u and σ u2 shown in the figure are the ultimate strength of the cracked plate with corrosion damage and the cracked plate respectively it can be understood that σ u σ u2 declines with dop and t r t but effected little by the plate slenderness ratio fig 17b shows the variation of σ u σ u2 with the relative corrosion volume δv v 0 under different β where δv and v 0 are the loss volume due to corrosion and the plate volume respectively as can be seen from fig 17b σ u σ u2 reduces linearly with δv v 0 and with a ratio of 1 7 3 3 combined effects of crack and corrosion in order to examine the interaction between the crack and corrosion the reduction of the ultimate strength of the complete plate by them when they exist together is contrasted with the superimposed one when they exist alone figs 18 and 19 present the characteristics of reduction percentage δσ 1 of complete plate ultimate strength by the crack and corrosion when they coexist and the superimposed one δσ 2 when they exist alone with different β 2c b and δv v 0 in the case of s b 0 θ 0 90 δσ 1 and δσ 2 in the figures are defined by eqs 6 and 7 respectively besides σ u0 is the ultimate strength of the complete plate σ u σ u1 and σ u2 are defined as above it can be seen from these figures that δσ 2 is generally greater than δσ 1 so it is known that the superposition effect caused by the crack and corrosion is more serious when they exist alone but the differences between δσ 1 and δσ 2 are not the same for different crack angles as illustrated in fig 18 δσ 1 and δσ 2 are roughly the same varying different slenderness ratios relative crack lengths and corrosion volumes it is indicated that the influences of longitudinal crack and pitting corrosion on the complete plate ultimate strength can be linearly superimposed however according to fig 19 the differences between δσ 1 and δσ 2 gradually become greater when the relative crack lengths and corrosion volumes increase and the slenderness ratio decreases therefore the simple superposition of the effects of transverse crack and pitting corrosion may produce great errors the reason for the differences is that the coincident volumes of corrosion pits and longitudinal cracks which penetrate the plate thicknesses have little effect on the ultimate strength conversely the impact of coincident volumes formed by transverse crack and corrosion pits on the ultimate strength is gradually enhanced with this volumes increase 6 δ σ 1 σ u0 σ u σ u0 100 7 δ σ 2 σ u0 σ u 1 σ u0 σ u 2 σ u0 100 4 empirical formulas for predicting the ultimate strength of steel unstiffened plates with coupled corrosion and crack damage it is evident from the previous discussions that the effects of longitudinal cracks and transverse and inclined cracks on the ultimate strength are different based on the numerical results two formulas for evaluating the residual ultimate strength of the corroded and cracked plates are proposed for longitudinal cracks transverse and inclined cracks respectively which can be seen in eqs 8 and 9 m 1 β and m 2 β are the ultimate strength reduction rates of the plate with longitudinal crack and the one with transverse or inclined crack respectively presented in eqs 2 and 3 as defined by eqs 4 and 5 a 2c b β and a e b β are the reduction rates of transverse position it has previously put forward that when 2c b and δv v 0 are greater as well as β is smaller the influences of transverse crack and pitting corrosion on the ultimate strength cannot be simply superimposed as a result on the basics of the fe results obtained in this paper the corrected factor is proposed in eq 9 namely c with a value of 0 055 it should be noted that the relative corrosion volume δv v 0 in eqs 8 and 9 is expressed as a percentage 8 σ u σ u 0 1 m 1 β 2 c b 1 a 2 c b β s b 2 1 7 δ v 100 v 0 9 σ u σ u 0 1 m 2 β e b 1 a e b β s b 2 1 7 δ v 100 v 0 c fig 20 shows the error analysis results of eq 8 applicable to the longitudinal crack fig 20a presents the comparisons of ultimate strength reduction factors of 108 fe models with longitudinal crack damage and those calculated by eq 8 as can be seen from the figure all results points are close to the red symmetry line both results have a good correlation with cov 0 003 and the average value of the ratios of fem results to formula results is mean 1 02 moreover from the error distribution shown in fig 20b it is evident that the relative errors of eq 8 are mostly less than 5 compared to nonlinear fem the proportion of errors less than 7 and more than 5 is only 6 5 obviously eq 8 can effectively evaluate the residual ultimate strength of corroded plate with longitudinal crack damage finally error analysis of eq 9 suitable for the transverse and inclined cracks is carried out in fig 21 the ultimate strength reduction factors of 216 models calculated by nonlinear fem and eq 9 are shown in fig 21a all data points are approximately evenly located on both sides of the symmetry line the results have a good correlation with mean 0 991 and cov 0 012 fig 21b shows the relative error distribution as can be seen that the models with errors between 5 and 5 account for 94 furthermore all errors have an absolute value with less than 10 evidently eq 9 can also accurately assess the residual ultimate strength of corroded plate with transverse or inclined crack 5 conclusion in the present study nonlinear finite element method is used to investigate the ultimate strength reduction characteristics of steel unstiffened plate with coupled corrosion and crack damage under longitudinal compression effects of crack length angle and transverse position corrosion density and depth as well as the plate slenderness ratio have been analyzed it is assumed that the crack is through thickness and has no propagation and no contact between their faces at the ultimate limit state the sensitive factors such as element type mesh density crack gap and tip shape which may interfere with the calculation results of the ultimate strength are discussed the reliability of the finite element model is verified by the finite element results of the corroded plate and cracked plate of paik et al 2003 and paik 2009 based on a series of numerical results calculated by abaqus software the following conclusions can be drawn 1 for corroded plate with transverse or inclined crack the ultimate strength decreases linearly with crack projected length for corroded plate with longitudinal crack it is also decreased linearly with actual crack length the ultimate strength of corroded plate with crack damage of different angles reduces when the crack is close to the panel edge in addition the reduction rate increases with the crack length and slenderness ratio increase if the crack length increases the ultimate strength reduction rate of the corroded plate with crack damage will present diverse variation with different crack angles that is for transverse crack the reduction rate decreases evidently as the slenderness ratio increases but this reduction is not remarkable for longitudinal crack the effects of corrosion density and depth on the ultimate strength of cracked plate can be attributed to the effect of corrosion volume the ultimate strength reduction factor decreases linearly with the corrosion volume in the case of constant crack parameters 2 when the crack and corrosion exist alone in a complete panel their superposition of the ultimate strength reduction is generally greater than that when they coexist yet for longitudinal crack the superposition is almost equal to the reduction when they coexist therefore the influences of the longitudinal crack and corrosion on the ultimate strength of the complete plate can be linearly superimposed for the case of transverse and inclined cracks when the coincident volumes of the crack and corrosion pits increase or the slenderness ratio decreases the superposition becomes greater than the reduction as they coexist consequently the effects of corrosion and transverse or inclined crack cannot be simply superimposed a corrected factor is proposed in the present study to solve this problem 3 based on a large number of nonlinear finite element results two empirical formulas for evaluating the residual ultimate strength of corroded and cracked plates are proposed for longitudinal cracks transverse and inclined cracks respectively compared to all nonlinear fe results the relative errors of both formulas are small credit author statement liang feng conceptualization methodology software writing reviewing and

22029,the deep sea cable system attached with an 11 000 m depth autonomous remotely vehicle arv is composed of two types of cables fiber optical micro cable fomc and umbilical cable the fomc can be automatically released from a canister according to the tension of the cable in the motion of arv the length velocity and tension of the fomc are uncertain which increases the complexity of dynamics calculation of the cable system the nonlinear governing equations are set upon the basis of mechanical equilibrium owing to the complexity of the cable system we employed the hybrid optimization method to search the best solution to the nonlinear equations which makes full use of the globalization of particle swarm optimization pso searching and the rapidness of newton raphson nr iteration numerical results of dynamics calculation verify the robustness of the hybrid optimization method and the feasibility of the arv cable system keywords marine cable autonomous remotely vehicle dynamics calculation particle swarm optimization 1 introduction nowadays the deep sea exploration attracts the oceanographers from all around the world more and more underwater vehicles are required for the deep sea exploration however the conventional remotely operated vehicle rov with a heavy umbilical cable has a limited operating range and the traditional autonomous underwater vehicle auv cannot achieve detailed real time control owing to the communication problem a new concept of underwater vehicle autonomous remotely vehicle arv arouses people s attention it can be operated as an untethered auv or a tethered rov goheen and jefferys 1990 fletcher et al 2008 demonstrated the feasibility of nereus a hybrid remotely operated vehicle aiming to provide a new level of maximum depth of oceanographic research of 11000 m the fiber optical micro cable fomc was used to connect the underwater vehicle and the mother ship young et al 2006 it can transmit data efficiently compared to the conventional umbilical cable fomc has greater flexibility and smaller diameter which reduces the drag resistance to the arv murashima et al 2003 however the cable is very fragile and easy to be damaged especially in complex sea conditions once the cable is broken the underwater vehicle will have the possibility of losing contact with the mother ship and even getting lost momma et al 2004 for the consideration of safety it is necessary to analyze the configuration and tension of the deep sea cable system to study of the dynamic characteristics of the cable a lot of cable modelling methods had been built up in the present methods the cable was often divided into a series of segments park and jung 2002 vaz and patel 2000 for instance the flexible cable was simplified as a series of pin connected straight segment to simulate the large scale and 3 d cable motion without considering the bending moment huston and kamman 1982 hover et al 1994 similarly a flexible segment model based on nonlinear beam theory had been introduced by xu et al 2013 in some other methods the cable was discretized into elastic frictionless and massless springs connected by nodes e g huang 1994 wang et al 2008 no matter what physical model is used the governing equations of segments are mainly composed of geometrical compatibility equations and mechanical equilibrium equations there are nonlinear terms in these governing equations so numerical solutions such as newton raphson nr iteration lin and sayer 2015 and runge kutta rk method patel and vaz 1995 chang et al 2012 are widely used to solve the problem the local optimization performance of the nr or rk algorithm is very good but it is dependent on the selection of initial value in some cases it is hard to guess a suitable initial value so the nr or rk algorithm may fail to get the convergent result jaberipour et al 2011 therefore this paper proposes a hybrid method to solve the problem this method uses particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to find a reasonable initial value for the nr algorithm pso was firstly proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 then had been widely experimented and applied by researchers in the world liu et al 2007 employed pso to solve the fourth order boundary value problem in beam equilibrium jaberipour et al 2011 demonstrated the efficiency of solving nonlinear equations by pso due to its flexibility many variants of pso were applied to nonlinear problems sharifi et al 2015 combined pso and local search tactics for dynamics optimization problems zhang et al 2017 applied multi swarm cooperative improved pso to the optimal design of subsea oil pipelines the hybrid optimization mainly consists of two steps firstly adopt pso algorithm to find initial value for nr algorithm and then employ nr algorithm to find the optimal solution the pso algorithm has good global optimization performance but may suffer from stagnation once particles near the top optimal the nonlinear equations of marine cable can be transformed into fitness functions which change over iteration according to the characteristics of pso and nr algorithms the pso algorithm can be used for the global search in a wide range while the nr algorithm is suitable for the local search the remaining sections are organized as follows section 2 demonstrates our arv cable system and its complexity section 3 presents the physical model of the cable system and the derivation of nonlinear governing equations section 4 introduces the hybrid optimization method in detail section 5 shows the application of the hybrid optimization method section 6 summarizes the contents 2 arv cable system and complexity as shown in fig 1 our arv system involves a long heavy umbilical cable a terminator a long fomc a bobber a short light umbilical cable an arv and so on the arv is set to work at the 11 000 m water depth the long heavy umbilical cable with a higher density than water is connected with the winch on the mother ship it has a bent segment at the lower part which effectively reduces the impact of ship s heave motion on the terminator the terminator suspends at the water depth of 6000 m and keeps at a fixed position by controlling the dynamic positioning thrusters installed on it below the terminator there is a long fomc the terminator can actively pay out or recover the fomc by a built in winch the fomc is very slender and easy to be broken by the possible heavy tension to improve the underwater safety of the long fomc a bobber and a short light umbilical cable are set between the lower end of fomc and the arv the bobber suspends in water and has a passive fomc payout canister in it the fomc will be pulled out from the bobber canister if the tension exceeds a certain value below the bobber a 20 50 m light umbilical cable is connected with the 11 000 arv since the terminator is stationary in water and the fomc is very fragile the safety of fomc below the terminator is mainly concerned the ultra long 5000 m complex cable system below the terminator may undergo any deformation under unknown currents the arv will accelerate from standstill to the set velocity towing the umbilical cable moving with it the payout rate of fomc at the bobber is uncertain determined by the tension to be calculated the whole length of fomc will increase related to the cable payout rate in addition the presence of the bobber adds unknown lumped force to the cable system all these factors increase the complexity of dynamics calculation of the cable system so the hybrid optimization method based on pso is implemented 3 physical model in fig 2 a the cable system we concerned here only consists of two types of marine cables long fomc and short light umbilical cable the fomc is very long and may take on any configuration under complex current condition to simplify the problem all the cables are assumed to be continuous and extensible as fig 2 b shows the cable system is discretized into n extensible segments marked by s 1 s 2 s n at the ends of these segments there are n 1 nodes marked by n 1 n 2 n n n n 1 n 1 is the upper end connected with the terminator n n 1 is the lower end moving with the arv the bobber is set at the node n b 1 b n 1 for each segment s i both ends are n i and n i 1 and the midpoint is c i as shown in fig 2 c the segments are pin connected with each other and each segment is straight and elastic the external force acting on the bobber is assumed to lump at n b denoted by f b in the same way f t is the terminal force exerted by the arv lumped at n i 1 3 1 coordinate transformation the global and local coordinate systems are shown in fig 2 b the global fixed coordinate system xyz is set as axis x and axis y parallel to the horizontal plane axis z pointing to the sea floor its origin is fixed at the upper end of the cable system at each node n i there is a local moving coordinate system b i n i t i assume the rotational transform from xyz to b i n i t i is carried out as the following steps 1 rotate θ i around axis x 2 then rotate ϕ i around axis y the unit vector of axis t i can be denoted by 1 t i sin θ i sin ϕ i cos θ i cos ϕ i cos θ i t the first and second derivatives of t i can be calculated by 2 t i θ i cos θ i ϕ i c o s ϕ i c o s θ i θ i s i n ϕ i s i n θ i ϕ i s i n ϕ i c o s θ i θ i c o s ϕ i s i n θ i t i 3 θ i c o s θ i θ i 2 s i n θ i ϕ i 2 θ i 2 s i n ϕ i c o s θ i 2 ϕ i θ i c o s ϕ i s i n θ i ϕ i c o s ϕ i c o s θ i θ i s i n ϕ i s i n θ i ϕ i 2 θ i 2 c o s ϕ i c o s θ i 2 ϕ i θ i s i n ϕ i s i n θ i ϕ i s i n ϕ i c o s θ i θ i c o s ϕ i s i n θ i where the superscript single or double dot means the first or second derivatives by time the coordinate transformation between n i 1 and n i can be approximated by 4 x i 1 x i l i 1 ε i t i where x i is the displacement vector of n i and l i is the length of each segment and ε i is the elongating rate of s i the velocity and acceleration of node n n 1 can be calculated by 5 x i 1 x i l i ε i t i l i 1 ε i t i 6 x i 1 x i l i ε i t i 2 l i ε i t i l i 1 ε i t i the coordinate transformation between c i and n i can be obtained by 7 x c i x i l i 2 1 ε i t i where x c i is the displacement of c i accordingly the velocity and acceleration of c i can be got by 8 x c i x i l i 2 ε i t i l i 2 1 ε i t i 9 x c i x i l i 2 ε i t i l i ε i t i l i 2 1 ε i t i 3 2 external forces on segments in the non inertial coordinate system the external forces acting on cables includes hydrodynamic force net gravity inertia force and terminal force these external forces must reach mechanical equilibrium anywhere along the cables for the segment s i the summed external forces acting on it can be obtained by 10 f i f h i f g i f i i where f h i f g i and f i i respectively means hydrodynamic force net gravity and inertia force all assumed to lump at the midpoint c i the terminal force only works at the end of cable system using the semi empirical morrison method the hydrodynamic force of the segment s i is approximated by 11 f h i 0 l i 1 2 c d ρ w d 0 v cn i v cn i d l 0 l i c m ρ w a i v cn i ρ w a i x c n i d l where c d is the drag coefficient c m is the inertia coefficient ρ w is the density of seawater d 0 is the cable diameter a i is the cross section area of s i v cn i is the normal part of inflow velocity and x c n i is the normal part of x c i v cn i and x c n i are calculated by 12 a v cn i v w x c i v w x c i t i t i 12 b x c n i x c i x c i t i t i where v w is the current velocity since the cross section area of each segment is much smaller than the whole surface area of segment the segment can be viewed approximately enclosed by water the net gravity at c i is calculated by 13 f g i a i l i ρ c g where ρ c is the cable density in seawater g is the gravity vector according to d alembert s principle the inertia force at c i is calculated by 14 f i i a i l i ρ r x c i where ρ r is the cable density in air for the segment s i the tension at n i can be calculated by 15 t i t i t f t f b j i n f j for i b t i t f t j i n f j for b i n the tension at n i 1 is coincident with the terminal force f t the lumped force f b is the hydrodynamic force acting on the bobber calculated by 16 f b 1 2 ρ w c d j s j v r j v r j e j j 1 2 3 where c d j and s j are the drag coefficient and the inflow area of the bobber in 3 directions respectively along with local coordinate axis b b axis n b and axis t b e j is the unit vector v r is the velocity of current relative to the bobber and v r j means its j th component can be deduced by 17 v r i t b t b t v w x b where i is the unit matrix the bobber is set at the node n b the movement velocity is x b and t b is the unit vector of axis t b at the node n b the terminal force f t is uncertain and can t be calculated directly it is determined by the velocity of the arv and the external forces of cable system the lower end of cable system is dragged by the arv so the position of node n n 1 coincides with the arv 18 x n 1 x arv 0 where x arv is the displacement of the arv the bobber can pay out fomc if the tension at the bobber exceeds a certain value the fomc payout rate v b is designed as 19 v b 0 f o r t b t t b t γ for t b t where t b is the tension at the bobber t is the threshold of tension and γ is the damping coefficient the payout rate will influence the length of the fomc segment s b 1 so the total length of the fomc cable may change during the arv motion for the segment s i the relationship between tension and strain can be approximated by 20 t i t i 1 2 e a i 1 ε i ε i 0 3 3 equilibrium of moment the moment at n i caused by the external forces is calculated by 21 m i x b x i f b x n 1 x i f t j i n x c j x i f j f o r i b x n 1 x i f t j i n x c j x i f j f o r b i n 1 where x b is the displacement of the bobber the bending moment at n i along x and y axes are zero owing to the pin connection expressed by 22 m i x 1 0 0 m i 0 23 m i y 0 1 0 m i 0 3 4 numerical calculation according to geometrical compatibility and mechanical equilibrium eqs 20 22 and 23 are set up as the governing equations for each segment the cable system is divided into n segments so there are 3n governing equations if the current condition and the cable features is already known all the items in the governing equations are related to the vectors of φ φ and φ where φ can be denoted by φ θ 1 θ n ϕ 1 ϕ n ε 1 ε n t for the convenience of numerical solution a linear iteration scheme is employed if the current φ and φ are known φ can be obtained by solving the governing equations then the next φ and φ can be got by the following iteration scheme 24 φ i 1 φ i φ i δ t 25 φ i 1 φ i 1 2 φ i φ i 1 δ t where superscript i means the calculation times δ t means the time step of each calculation in each calculation φ is set as the vector of unknown variables it will be got by solving the governing equations and then φ and φ are got by eqs 24 and 25 iteratively in the case that the length of the fomc changes over time and the cable system needs to be re divided the value of vectors φ φ and φ will be interpolated along the cable after the re division in the calculation the payout rate v b of fomc at the node n b and the terminal force f t are unknown variables also to get the values of these variables eqs 18 and 19 are used as supplementary governing equations both the terminal force f t and eq 18 can be decomposed along axis x axis y and axis z therefore there are 3n 4 unknown variables corresponding to 3n 4 governing equations the calculation goes by solving these governing equations to get the values of all unknown variables the vector of all unknown variables can be denoted by y φ f t v b θ 1 θ n ϕ 1 ϕ n ε 1 ε n f t x f t y f t z v b t 4 hybrid optimization method the governing equations have strong nonlinearity which is mainly reflected in the trigonometric function of coordinate transformation and the square term in hydrodynamics in order to solve these equations we use numerical calculation based on the idea of optimization xu and zou 2015 the governing equations 20 22 and 23 can be transformed to the optimization function as 26 f i y m i x m i y l t n i t n i 1 2 e a i 1 ε i ε i where means euclidean norm of vector l is the average length of cable segment f i is the function of the vector y adding with eqs 18 and 19 the global fitness function is set as 27 g y x n 1 x arv i 1 n f i y f o r t b t t b t γ v b x n 1 x arv i 1 n f i y f o r t b t where g is the fitness value x n 1 x arv contains displacement differences in 3 directions for the optimum y the fitness value g 0 that means each f i y 0 t b t γ v b 0 and x n 1 x arv 0 the hybrid optimization algorithm combines the advantages of the global searchability of the pso algorithm and the local rapidness of the nr iteration firstly by using the pso with good global performance the solution is searched in a wide range as the evolution progresses the particle gradually approaches the theoretical optimal solution when the evolution reaches a certain extent the efficiency of pso becomes lower but the approximate region of the theoretical optimal solution has been positioned then the result of pso is used as the initial value of nr iteration for subsequent optimization in this way the search efficiency of pso keeps high and the shortcoming of the nr iteration due to the sensitivity to the initial value is overcome also in the pso algorithm the optimization process is simulated by multiple particles poli et al 2007 for the convenience of explanation y can also be recorded as y y 1 y 2 y d t where d 3 n 4 for the case of n segments in the d dimensional space there are m particles the position of particle i is y i y i 1 y i 2 y i d the velocity of particle i is v i v i 1 v i 2 v i d the best position that particle i has experienced in history is recorded as p i p i 1 p i 2 p i d the best position that all particles have experienced in history is marked by q q 1 q 2 q d the velocity of the d th component of particle i is calculated by pedersen and chipperfield 2010 28 v i d k 1 ω v i d k c 1 r 1 p i d k y i d k c 2 r 2 q d k y i d k where 1 i m 1 d d and k is iteration times c 1 and c 2 are acceleration constants adjusting the maximum step size r 1 and r 2 are random functions ranging from 0 to 1 for increasing the randomness of the search ω is the inertia weight adjusting the search ability the d th component of particle i position is calculated by 29 y i d k 1 y i d k v i d k 1 the advantages of pso are simplicity easy implementation no gradient information and few parameters at the same time it has a profound intelligent background suitable for scientific research and engineering applications however the pso has a distinct disadvantage that it is very time consuming in the cases of high dimensional problems assuming the cable system is divided into n segments there will be 3n 4 dimensions corresponding to 3n 4 unknown variables in order to improve the efficiency of pso the number of segments should be reduced after pso the cable is re divided the number of segments increases and the nr iteration is used to find the optimal solution the process of hybrid optimization method goes as following steps 1 divide cable into n 1 segments 2 use basic pso to optimize all the segments i produce the initial particles in the search range randomly ii particles evolve to find the optimum solution for function 27 iii terminate the pso algorithm when reaching the maximum number of iteration or the precision of solution 3 re divide cable into n 2 segments n 2 n 1 and the initial value of unknown vector y can be calculated by interpolation of the result of step 2 4 use the result of step 3 as the initial value and execute nr iteration if 4 successfully find the optimal solution carry out optimization calculation at the next moment if not back to step 2 the hybrid optimization method is proposed for complex dynamics calculations if the change of the variables is slow and the calculation is stable the nr iteration can be used for calculation directly the flow chart of calculation program is shown in fig 3 5 application according to fig 1 the lower end of cable system will move with the arv at a certain velocity and the upper end of cable system stands still the current goes horizontally along the global coordinate axis x and its profile is selected according to webster and bowen 2003 shown as follow v w x 0 3 m s 6 d 0 0 6 0 05 d m s 11 d 6 where v w x is current velocity along axis x d is the depth of water in km the characteristics of fomc and light umbilical cable are shown in table 1 the hydrodynamic coefficients of cables are the same as the coefficients xu and meng chose in 2018 the motion of arv consists of two directions of velocity 2 0 knots countercurrent and 3 0 knots perpendicular to the flow direction arv accelerates from standstill to the specified speed by the acceleration of 0 3 m s2 before arv starts to move the deformation of the cable system remains unchanged in the calculation of the initial cable shape φ and φ are both zeros and φ is directly used as the vector of unknown variables got by solving the governing equations during the arv movement the cable is passively pulled out from the bobber canister here the threshold of tension is set at 100 n and the damping coefficient is 80 n s m the bobber is in a spindle shape and its main features are shown in table 2 for the consideration of calculation efficiency the cable system is divided into 5 segments 3 for fomc and 2 for umbilical cable when performing pso algorithm then the cable system is divided into 32 segments 30 for fomc and 2 for umbilical cable by the interpolation method to perform nr iteration the time step of calculation is set at 0 2 s the parameters of pso algorithm are shown in table 3 if the arv accelerates from standstill to a predetermined speed the tension and the payout rate of cable will increase rapidly making dynamics calculation difficult in this case the hybrid optimization method is conducted while the arv moves at a constant speed and the calculation is stable the nr iteration can be directly used the pso algorithm processes at the 5th 15th and 25th time steps are shown in fig 4 respectively represented by blue red and green lines the fitness value g of the first iteration is about 10 14 10 16 due to the good global search performance of pso the fitness value decreases gradually with the number of iterations when the number of pso iterations reaches 20 fitness drops to less than 10 6 and then the fitness tends to be stable indicating that the degradation of pso performance when it is close to the best solution in order to verify whether the pso algorithm successfully finds a result close to the best solution the interpolated result based on the pso algorithm is compared with the best solution by the consequent nr iteration the results of the 10th time step are selected for comparison in fig 5 θ ϕ and ε at each node are shown along the length of cable system the positive value of the angle indicates the clockwise rotation along the axis while minus value means the counterclockwise rotation in fig 5 a the value of θ is very small indicating the tiny rotate deformation of cable along axis x as shown in fig 5 b and c the result of the pso interpolation on each segment is very close to the optimal solution of the nr method because of the presence of the bobber there are obvious inflection points in these curves it can be seen that the pso successfully obtains a result close to the optimal solution therefore the nr iteration can use the result of pso as the initial value to obtain the optimal solution quickly the fig 6 shows the tension history of cable system in 1000 s the blue line indicates the tension at the lower end the red line denotes the tension at the upper end the black line represents the tension at the bobber the tension at the lower end is the largest one which increases rapidly within 20 s with the maximum about 240 n the tensions at the bobber and the upper end are very close and basically keep gentle increase the maximum tension of the cable system does not exceed the allowable tension of fomc so the cable system is safe fig 7 shows the payout rate of fomc the payout rate of the cable at the bobber increases rapidly from 0 to 8 s and drops down between 8 and 20 s and then increases slowly the payout rate goes with the same trend as the tension at the bobber fig 8 shows the 3 d view and projections of cable shapes at the 0th 200th 400th 600th 800th 1000th seconds the cable system stands still at first when the arv is at rest and then the arv moves with a displacement of 1000 m along axis x and 1500 m along axis y the motion trajectory of arv can be seen from the positions of the lower end consequently the cable system keeps static at first and then changes its shape continuously 6 conclusion in this paper the deep sea arv cable system is presented in the cable system the fomc is very long and fragile easy to be

22029,the deep sea cable system attached with an 11 000 m depth autonomous remotely vehicle arv is composed of two types of cables fiber optical micro cable fomc and umbilical cable the fomc can be automatically released from a canister according to the tension of the cable in the motion of arv the length velocity and tension of the fomc are uncertain which increases the complexity of dynamics calculation of the cable system the nonlinear governing equations are set upon the basis of mechanical equilibrium owing to the complexity of the cable system we employed the hybrid optimization method to search the best solution to the nonlinear equations which makes full use of the globalization of particle swarm optimization pso searching and the rapidness of newton raphson nr iteration numerical results of dynamics calculation verify the robustness of the hybrid optimization method and the feasibility of the arv cable system keywords marine cable autonomous remotely vehicle dynamics calculation particle swarm optimization 1 introduction nowadays the deep sea exploration attracts the oceanographers from all around the world more and more underwater vehicles are required for the deep sea exploration however the conventional remotely operated vehicle rov with a heavy umbilical cable has a limited operating range and the traditional autonomous underwater vehicle auv cannot achieve detailed real time control owing to the communication problem a new concept of underwater vehicle autonomous remotely vehicle arv arouses people s attention it can be operated as an untethered auv or a tethered rov goheen and jefferys 1990 fletcher et al 2008 demonstrated the feasibility of nereus a hybrid remotely operated vehicle aiming to provide a new level of maximum depth of oceanographic research of 11000 m the fiber optical micro cable fomc was used to connect the underwater vehicle and the mother ship young et al 2006 it can transmit data efficiently compared to the conventional umbilical cable fomc has greater flexibility and smaller diameter which reduces the drag resistance to the arv murashima et al 2003 however the cable is very fragile and easy to be damaged especially in complex sea conditions once the cable is broken the underwater vehicle will have the possibility of losing contact with the mother ship and even getting lost momma et al 2004 for the consideration of safety it is necessary to analyze the configuration and tension of the deep sea cable system to study of the dynamic characteristics of the cable a lot of cable modelling methods had been built up in the present methods the cable was often divided into a series of segments park and jung 2002 vaz and patel 2000 for instance the flexible cable was simplified as a series of pin connected straight segment to simulate the large scale and 3 d cable motion without considering the bending moment huston and kamman 1982 hover et al 1994 similarly a flexible segment model based on nonlinear beam theory had been introduced by xu et al 2013 in some other methods the cable was discretized into elastic frictionless and massless springs connected by nodes e g huang 1994 wang et al 2008 no matter what physical model is used the governing equations of segments are mainly composed of geometrical compatibility equations and mechanical equilibrium equations there are nonlinear terms in these governing equations so numerical solutions such as newton raphson nr iteration lin and sayer 2015 and runge kutta rk method patel and vaz 1995 chang et al 2012 are widely used to solve the problem the local optimization performance of the nr or rk algorithm is very good but it is dependent on the selection of initial value in some cases it is hard to guess a suitable initial value so the nr or rk algorithm may fail to get the convergent result jaberipour et al 2011 therefore this paper proposes a hybrid method to solve the problem this method uses particle swarm optimization pso algorithm to find a reasonable initial value for the nr algorithm pso was firstly proposed by kennedy and eberhart 1995 then had been widely experimented and applied by researchers in the world liu et al 2007 employed pso to solve the fourth order boundary value problem in beam equilibrium jaberipour et al 2011 demonstrated the efficiency of solving nonlinear equations by pso due to its flexibility many variants of pso were applied to nonlinear problems sharifi et al 2015 combined pso and local search tactics for dynamics optimization problems zhang et al 2017 applied multi swarm cooperative improved pso to the optimal design of subsea oil pipelines the hybrid optimization mainly consists of two steps firstly adopt pso algorithm to find initial value for nr algorithm and then employ nr algorithm to find the optimal solution the pso algorithm has good global optimization performance but may suffer from stagnation once particles near the top optimal the nonlinear equations of marine cable can be transformed into fitness functions which change over iteration according to the characteristics of pso and nr algorithms the pso algorithm can be used for the global search in a wide range while the nr algorithm is suitable for the local search the remaining sections are organized as follows section 2 demonstrates our arv cable system and its complexity section 3 presents the physical model of the cable system and the derivation of nonlinear governing equations section 4 introduces the hybrid optimization method in detail section 5 shows the application of the hybrid optimization method section 6 summarizes the contents 2 arv cable system and complexity as shown in fig 1 our arv system involves a long heavy umbilical cable a terminator a long fomc a bobber a short light umbilical cable an arv and so on the arv is set to work at the 11 000 m water depth the long heavy umbilical cable with a higher density than water is connected with the winch on the mother ship it has a bent segment at the lower part which effectively reduces the impact of ship s heave motion on the terminator the terminator suspends at the water depth of 6000 m and keeps at a fixed position by controlling the dynamic positioning thrusters installed on it below the terminator there is a long fomc the terminator can actively pay out or recover the fomc by a built in winch the fomc is very slender and easy to be broken by the possible heavy tension to improve the underwater safety of the long fomc a bobber and a short light umbilical cable are set between the lower end of fomc and the arv the bobber suspends in water and has a passive fomc payout canister in it the fomc will be pulled out from the bobber canister if the tension exceeds a certain value below the bobber a 20 50 m light umbilical cable is connected with the 11 000 arv since the terminator is stationary in water and the fomc is very fragile the safety of fomc below the terminator is mainly concerned the ultra long 5000 m complex cable system below the terminator may undergo any deformation under unknown currents the arv will accelerate from standstill to the set velocity towing the umbilical cable moving with it the payout rate of fomc at the bobber is uncertain determined by the tension to be calculated the whole length of fomc will increase related to the cable payout rate in addition the presence of the bobber adds unknown lumped force to the cable system all these factors increase the complexity of dynamics calculation of the cable system so the hybrid optimization method based on pso is implemented 3 physical model in fig 2 a the cable system we concerned here only consists of two types of marine cables long fomc and short light umbilical cable the fomc is very long and may take on any configuration under complex current condition to simplify the problem all the cables are assumed to be continuous and extensible as fig 2 b shows the cable system is discretized into n extensible segments marked by s 1 s 2 s n at the ends of these segments there are n 1 nodes marked by n 1 n 2 n n n n 1 n 1 is the upper end connected with the terminator n n 1 is the lower end moving with the arv the bobber is set at the node n b 1 b n 1 for each segment s i both ends are n i and n i 1 and the midpoint is c i as shown in fig 2 c the segments are pin connected with each other and each segment is straight and elastic the external force acting on the bobber is assumed to lump at n b denoted by f b in the same way f t is the terminal force exerted by the arv lumped at n i 1 3 1 coordinate transformation the global and local coordinate systems are shown in fig 2 b the global fixed coordinate system xyz is set as axis x and axis y parallel to the horizontal plane axis z pointing to the sea floor its origin is fixed at the upper end of the cable system at each node n i there is a local moving coordinate system b i n i t i assume the rotational transform from xyz to b i n i t i is carried out as the following steps 1 rotate θ i around axis x 2 then rotate ϕ i around axis y the unit vector of axis t i can be denoted by 1 t i sin θ i sin ϕ i cos θ i cos ϕ i cos θ i t the first and second derivatives of t i can be calculated by 2 t i θ i cos θ i ϕ i c o s ϕ i c o s θ i θ i s i n ϕ i s i n θ i ϕ i s i n ϕ i c o s θ i θ i c o s ϕ i s i n θ i t i 3 θ i c o s θ i θ i 2 s i n θ i ϕ i 2 θ i 2 s i n ϕ i c o s θ i 2 ϕ i θ i c o s ϕ i s i n θ i ϕ i c o s ϕ i c o s θ i θ i s i n ϕ i s i n θ i ϕ i 2 θ i 2 c o s ϕ i c o s θ i 2 ϕ i θ i s i n ϕ i s i n θ i ϕ i s i n ϕ i c o s θ i θ i c o s ϕ i s i n θ i where the superscript single or double dot means the first or second derivatives by time the coordinate transformation between n i 1 and n i can be approximated by 4 x i 1 x i l i 1 ε i t i where x i is the displacement vector of n i and l i is the length of each segment and ε i is the elongating rate of s i the velocity and acceleration of node n n 1 can be calculated by 5 x i 1 x i l i ε i t i l i 1 ε i t i 6 x i 1 x i l i ε i t i 2 l i ε i t i l i 1 ε i t i the coordinate transformation between c i and n i can be obtained by 7 x c i x i l i 2 1 ε i t i where x c i is the displacement of c i accordingly the velocity and acceleration of c i can be got by 8 x c i x i l i 2 ε i t i l i 2 1 ε i t i 9 x c i x i l i 2 ε i t i l i ε i t i l i 2 1 ε i t i 3 2 external forces on segments in the non inertial coordinate system the external forces acting on cables includes hydrodynamic force net gravity inertia force and terminal force these external forces must reach mechanical equilibrium anywhere along the cables for the segment s i the summed external forces acting on it can be obtained by 10 f i f h i f g i f i i where f h i f g i and f i i respectively means hydrodynamic force net gravity and inertia force all assumed to lump at the midpoint c i the terminal force only works at the end of cable system using the semi empirical morrison method the hydrodynamic force of the segment s i is approximated by 11 f h i 0 l i 1 2 c d ρ w d 0 v cn i v cn i d l 0 l i c m ρ w a i v cn i ρ w a i x c n i d l where c d is the drag coefficient c m is the inertia coefficient ρ w is the density of seawater d 0 is the cable diameter a i is the cross section area of s i v cn i is the normal part of inflow velocity and x c n i is the normal part of x c i v cn i and x c n i are calculated by 12 a v cn i v w x c i v w x c i t i t i 12 b x c n i x c i x c i t i t i where v w is the current velocity since the cross section area of each segment is much smaller than the whole surface area of segment the segment can be viewed approximately enclosed by water the net gravity at c i is calculated by 13 f g i a i l i ρ c g where ρ c is the cable density in seawater g is the gravity vector according to d alembert s principle the inertia force at c i is calculated by 14 f i i a i l i ρ r x c i where ρ r is the cable density in air for the segment s i the tension at n i can be calculated by 15 t i t i t f t f b j i n f j for i b t i t f t j i n f j for b i n the tension at n i 1 is coincident with the terminal force f t the lumped force f b is the hydrodynamic force acting on the bobber calculated by 16 f b 1 2 ρ w c d j s j v r j v r j e j j 1 2 3 where c d j and s j are the drag coefficient and the inflow area of the bobber in 3 directions respectively along with local coordinate axis b b axis n b and axis t b e j is the unit vector v r is the velocity of current relative to the bobber and v r j means its j th component can be deduced by 17 v r i t b t b t v w x b where i is the unit matrix the bobber is set at the node n b the movement velocity is x b and t b is the unit vector of axis t b at the node n b the terminal force f t is uncertain and can t be calculated directly it is determined by the velocity of the arv and the external forces of cable system the lower end of cable system is dragged by the arv so the position of node n n 1 coincides with the arv 18 x n 1 x arv 0 where x arv is the displacement of the arv the bobber can pay out fomc if the tension at the bobber exceeds a certain value the fomc payout rate v b is designed as 19 v b 0 f o r t b t t b t γ for t b t where t b is the tension at the bobber t is the threshold of tension and γ is the damping coefficient the payout rate will influence the length of the fomc segment s b 1 so the total length of the fomc cable may change during the arv motion for the segment s i the relationship between tension and strain can be approximated by 20 t i t i 1 2 e a i 1 ε i ε i 0 3 3 equilibrium of moment the moment at n i caused by the external forces is calculated by 21 m i x b x i f b x n 1 x i f t j i n x c j x i f j f o r i b x n 1 x i f t j i n x c j x i f j f o r b i n 1 where x b is the displacement of the bobber the bending moment at n i along x and y axes are zero owing to the pin connection expressed by 22 m i x 1 0 0 m i 0 23 m i y 0 1 0 m i 0 3 4 numerical calculation according to geometrical compatibility and mechanical equilibrium eqs 20 22 and 23 are set up as the governing equations for each segment the cable system is divided into n segments so there are 3n governing equations if the current condition and the cable features is already known all the items in the governing equations are related to the vectors of φ φ and φ where φ can be denoted by φ θ 1 θ n ϕ 1 ϕ n ε 1 ε n t for the convenience of numerical solution a linear iteration scheme is employed if the current φ and φ are known φ can be obtained by solving the governing equations then the next φ and φ can be got by the following iteration scheme 24 φ i 1 φ i φ i δ t 25 φ i 1 φ i 1 2 φ i φ i 1 δ t where superscript i means the calculation times δ t means the time step of each calculation in each calculation φ is set as the vector of unknown variables it will be got by solving the governing equations and then φ and φ are got by eqs 24 and 25 iteratively in the case that the length of the fomc changes over time and the cable system needs to be re divided the value of vectors φ φ and φ will be interpolated along the cable after the re division in the calculation the payout rate v b of fomc at the node n b and the terminal force f t are unknown variables also to get the values of these variables eqs 18 and 19 are used as supplementary governing equations both the terminal force f t and eq 18 can be decomposed along axis x axis y and axis z therefore there are 3n 4 unknown variables corresponding to 3n 4 governing equations the calculation goes by solving these governing equations to get the values of all unknown variables the vector of all unknown variables can be denoted by y φ f t v b θ 1 θ n ϕ 1 ϕ n ε 1 ε n f t x f t y f t z v b t 4 hybrid optimization method the governing equations have strong nonlinearity which is mainly reflected in the trigonometric function of coordinate transformation and the square term in hydrodynamics in order to solve these equations we use numerical calculation based on the idea of optimization xu and zou 2015 the governing equations 20 22 and 23 can be transformed to the optimization function as 26 f i y m i x m i y l t n i t n i 1 2 e a i 1 ε i ε i where means euclidean norm of vector l is the average length of cable segment f i is the function of the vector y adding with eqs 18 and 19 the global fitness function is set as 27 g y x n 1 x arv i 1 n f i y f o r t b t t b t γ v b x n 1 x arv i 1 n f i y f o r t b t where g is the fitness value x n 1 x arv contains displacement differences in 3 directions for the optimum y the fitness value g 0 that means each f i y 0 t b t γ v b 0 and x n 1 x arv 0 the hybrid optimization algorithm combines the advantages of the global searchability of the pso algorithm and the local rapidness of the nr iteration firstly by using the pso with good global performance the solution is searched in a wide range as the evolution progresses the particle gradually approaches the theoretical optimal solution when the evolution reaches a certain extent the efficiency of pso becomes lower but the approximate region of the theoretical optimal solution has been positioned then the result of pso is used as the initial value of nr iteration for subsequent optimization in this way the search efficiency of pso keeps high and the shortcoming of the nr iteration due to the sensitivity to the initial value is overcome also in the pso algorithm the optimization process is simulated by multiple particles poli et al 2007 for the convenience of explanation y can also be recorded as y y 1 y 2 y d t where d 3 n 4 for the case of n segments in the d dimensional space there are m particles the position of particle i is y i y i 1 y i 2 y i d the velocity of particle i is v i v i 1 v i 2 v i d the best position that particle i has experienced in history is recorded as p i p i 1 p i 2 p i d the best position that all particles have experienced in history is marked by q q 1 q 2 q d the velocity of the d th component of particle i is calculated by pedersen and chipperfield 2010 28 v i d k 1 ω v i d k c 1 r 1 p i d k y i d k c 2 r 2 q d k y i d k where 1 i m 1 d d and k is iteration times c 1 and c 2 are acceleration constants adjusting the maximum step size r 1 and r 2 are random functions ranging from 0 to 1 for increasing the randomness of the search ω is the inertia weight adjusting the search ability the d th component of particle i position is calculated by 29 y i d k 1 y i d k v i d k 1 the advantages of pso are simplicity easy implementation no gradient information and few parameters at the same time it has a profound intelligent background suitable for scientific research and engineering applications however the pso has a distinct disadvantage that it is very time consuming in the cases of high dimensional problems assuming the cable system is divided into n segments there will be 3n 4 dimensions corresponding to 3n 4 unknown variables in order to improve the efficiency of pso the number of segments should be reduced after pso the cable is re divided the number of segments increases and the nr iteration is used to find the optimal solution the process of hybrid optimization method goes as following steps 1 divide cable into n 1 segments 2 use basic pso to optimize all the segments i produce the initial particles in the search range randomly ii particles evolve to find the optimum solution for function 27 iii terminate the pso algorithm when reaching the maximum number of iteration or the precision of solution 3 re divide cable into n 2 segments n 2 n 1 and the initial value of unknown vector y can be calculated by interpolation of the result of step 2 4 use the result of step 3 as the initial value and execute nr iteration if 4 successfully find the optimal solution carry out optimization calculation at the next moment if not back to step 2 the hybrid optimization method is proposed for complex dynamics calculations if the change of the variables is slow and the calculation is stable the nr iteration can be used for calculation directly the flow chart of calculation program is shown in fig 3 5 application according to fig 1 the lower end of cable system will move with the arv at a certain velocity and the upper end of cable system stands still the current goes horizontally along the global coordinate axis x and its profile is selected according to webster and bowen 2003 shown as follow v w x 0 3 m s 6 d 0 0 6 0 05 d m s 11 d 6 where v w x is current velocity along axis x d is the depth of water in km the characteristics of fomc and light umbilical cable are shown in table 1 the hydrodynamic coefficients of cables are the same as the coefficients xu and meng chose in 2018 the motion of arv consists of two directions of velocity 2 0 knots countercurrent and 3 0 knots perpendicular to the flow direction arv accelerates from standstill to the specified speed by the acceleration of 0 3 m s2 before arv starts to move the deformation of the cable system remains unchanged in the calculation of the initial cable shape φ and φ are both zeros and φ is directly used as the vector of unknown variables got by solving the governing equations during the arv movement the cable is passively pulled out from the bobber canister here the threshold of tension is set at 100 n and the damping coefficient is 80 n s m the bobber is in a spindle shape and its main features are shown in table 2 for the consideration of calculation efficiency the cable system is divided into 5 segments 3 for fomc and 2 for umbilical cable when performing pso algorithm then the cable system is divided into 32 segments 30 for fomc and 2 for umbilical cable by the interpolation method to perform nr iteration the time step of calculation is set at 0 2 s the parameters of pso algorithm are shown in table 3 if the arv accelerates from standstill to a predetermined speed the tension and the payout rate of cable will increase rapidly making dynamics calculation difficult in this case the hybrid optimization method is conducted while the arv moves at a constant speed and the calculation is stable the nr iteration can be directly used the pso algorithm processes at the 5th 15th and 25th time steps are shown in fig 4 respectively represented by blue red and green lines the fitness value g of the first iteration is about 10 14 10 16 due to the good global search performance of pso the fitness value decreases gradually with the number of iterations when the number of pso iterations reaches 20 fitness drops to less than 10 6 and then the fitness tends to be stable indicating that the degradation of pso performance when it is close to the best solution in order to verify whether the pso algorithm successfully finds a result close to the best solution the interpolated result based on the pso algorithm is compared with the best solution by the consequent nr iteration the results of the 10th time step are selected for comparison in fig 5 θ ϕ and ε at each node are shown along the length of cable system the positive value of the angle indicates the clockwise rotation along the axis while minus value means the counterclockwise rotation in fig 5 a the value of θ is very small indicating the tiny rotate deformation of cable along axis x as shown in fig 5 b and c the result of the pso interpolation on each segment is very close to the optimal solution of the nr method because of the presence of the bobber there are obvious inflection points in these curves it can be seen that the pso successfully obtains a result close to the optimal solution therefore the nr iteration can use the result of pso as the initial value to obtain the optimal solution quickly the fig 6 shows the tension history of cable system in 1000 s the blue line indicates the tension at the lower end the red line denotes the tension at the upper end the black line represents the tension at the bobber the tension at the lower end is the largest one which increases rapidly within 20 s with the maximum about 240 n the tensions at the bobber and the upper end are very close and basically keep gentle increase the maximum tension of the cable system does not exceed the allowable tension of fomc so the cable system is safe fig 7 shows the payout rate of fomc the payout rate of the cable at the bobber increases rapidly from 0 to 8 s and drops down between 8 and 20 s and then increases slowly the payout rate goes with the same trend as the tension at the bobber fig 8 shows the 3 d view and projections of cable shapes at the 0th 200th 400th 600th 800th 1000th seconds the cable system stands still at first when the arv is at rest and then the arv moves with a displacement of 1000 m along axis x and 1500 m along axis y the motion trajectory of arv can be seen from the positions of the lower end consequently the cable system keeps static at first and then changes its shape continuously 6 conclusion in this paper the deep sea arv cable system is presented in the cable system the fomc is very long and fragile easy to be broken in the ocean condition to improve underwater safety a bobber canister is set to release fomc passively according to the tension the length of fomc is unknown which increases the difficulty of the dynamics calculation of cable system in the dynamics calculation the governing equations are set up with the existing model but these equations are nonlinear and related to many unknown variables due to the complexity of dynamics calculation a hybrid optimization method is proposed to solve the governing equations the nonlinear governing equations are transformed into a global optimization
