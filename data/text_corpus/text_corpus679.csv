3395,the geologically complex western aquifers of hawai i island serve as the primary reservoir of fresh potable water for residents yet the area s hydrogeologic characteristics are still not well understood groundwater age is a fundamental parameter used to better understand groundwater flow and storage yet few studies have attempted to estimate apparent groundwater ages in hawai i this study implements a multi tracer approach using chlorofluorocarbons sulfur hexafluoride and tritium helium 3 to determine the apparent ages of young water masses from the west hawai i aquifers chlorofluorocarbon and tritium helium 3 tracer measurements suggest that the aquifers contain young groundwater with a median age of 53 years but that a significant volume of older groundwater exists which was recharged prior to the release of these anthropogenic tracers mixing models suggest that the groundwater consists of mixtures with an average 28 modern water 70 years with the remainder being recharged prior to 1953 further helium measurements demonstrate that the area s groundwater is influenced by hydrothermal and magmatic processes from hualālai volcano which bias estimated groundwater ages if not properly considered it is therefore beneficial to utilize a multi tracer approach in an oceanic volcanic island setting where groundwater ages are impacted by various external processes the analysis of young apparent ages and proportions can aid in coastal aquifer characterization and subsequent groundwater quality assessment and is crucial for sustainable groundwater management keywords groundwater age chlorofluorocarbons sulfur hexafluoride tritium helium hawai i 1 introduction groundwater resources on hawai i island as on many small volcanic islands are limited in quantity and highly vulnerable to saltwater intrusion and anthropogenic contamination izuka et al 2018 these resources are critical for supplying nearly all fresh potable demands for the islands residents gingerich and oki 2000 fukunaga associates inc 2017 careful management of groundwater resources and setting values for sustainable yields require the understanding of some of the aquifer s characteristics that relate to both water residence and travel times e g bethke and johnson 2008 groundwater age can be used to investigate flow and storage properties which are important factors to consider ensuring accurate site characterization and sustainable aquifer management reynolds and marimuthu 2007 ginn et al 2009 leray et al 2012 chambers et al 2019 however hawai i island is characterized by an extraordinarily complex geologic nature hawai i island is formed from five separate but interflowing volcanoes each with its own internal structure but lack of well defined subsurface margins all of these attributes impact groundwater storage and flow further volcanic ocean islands present unique geochemical challenges with marine saltwater intrusion hydrothermal processes and magmatic contributions impacting commonly used natural and anthropogenic isotopic and chemical age tracers to mitigate some of these challenges this study has applied a variety of tracers for age determination of young water masses to better define recharge sources and flow paths for aquifers on the west flank of hawai i island chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are chemically inert compounds in the troposphere that are dominantly produced by modern refrigeration air conditioning and industrial applications e g plummer and busenberg 2006a there are three cfc compounds cfc 12 dichlorodifluoromethane cf2cl2 cfc 11 trichlorofluoromethane cfcl3 and cfc 113 trichlorotrifluoroethane c2f3cl3 industrial production of cfc 12 started in 1930 followed by cfc 11 in 1936 and cfc 113 in 1944 plummer and busenberg 2006a atmospheric cfc mixing ratios decreased after the adoption of the montreal protocol in 1987 plummer and busenberg 2006b chambers et al 2019 the production and release of another type of inert gas sulfur hexafluoride sf6 started in 1953 and concentrations continue to rise at present busenberg and plummer 2000 the sf6 is often combined with cfc tracers to determine groundwater age because although both were released at similar times the production and release of sf6 has resulted in different transient atmospheric concentrations since the historic atmospheric concentrations of all three cfcs and sf6 have been well documented these compounds are excellent tracers for relatively young groundwater that is typically 70 years in age e g busenberg and plummer 2000 further the apparent ages derived from cfc ratios can be compared to apparent ages derived from individual compound concentrations to better refine recharge years when groundwater mixing occurs e g happell et al 2006 tritium t or 3h is a radioactive isotope with a half life of 12 32 years e g lindsey et al 2019 atmospheric tritium concentrations peaked around 1963 due to above ground nuclear bomb tests that started in 1953 solomon and sudicky 1991 ingraham 1998 tritium measurements in groundwater can be referenced to the mid 1960s nuclear bomb detonation peak thus are useful for inferring apparent groundwater age solomon and sudicky 1991 szabo et al 1996 tritium decays to the noble gas helium 3 3he and the tritium helium 3 ratio 3h 3he can be used to determine the apparent age of young groundwater solomon et al 1998 however dissolved 3he can be sourced from atmospheric tritiogenic nucleogenic and terrigenic origins which all need to be considered while calculating apparent groundwater ages solomon and sudicky 1991 outside of hawai i young apparent groundwater ages were estimated for groundwaters from martinique a volcanic tropical island that is part of the french republic gourcy et al 2009 a multi tracer approach utilizing cfcs sf6 and tritium demonstrated some samples contained 95 old groundwater and concluded that the use of a multi tracer approach was necessary for their study where sampling sites can be limited and where sf6 measurements may be contaminated by terrigenic sources kusano et al 2014 used multiple geochemical tracers to estimate apparent ages of groundwater from nakano shima island japan they found that samples from shallow wells and springs contained higher concentrations of cfcs and tritium compared to samples from deeper wells suggesting that the deeper well samples contain a higher proportion of old groundwater that is free of cfcs prior to the present study only limited investigations of groundwater ages and associated flow paths have been conducted in hawai i and little is known about hawai i island s groundwater ages kelly and glenn 2015 used cfcs to determine groundwater ages in west hawai i island whereas scholl et al 1996 used tritium to estimate groundwater ages from kīlauea hawai i both determined that the sampled groundwater in those settings was a mixture of modern water that recharged in the mid 1900s and older water that was free of cfcs and atmospheric tritium those studies however each only utilized a single tracer to assess apparent ages therefore this study will implement a multi tracer approach using cfcs and 3h 3he as well as sf6 to better estimate the relative fractions of modern and premodern water contributions to the west hawai i aquifers and define the apparent ages of the modern groundwater it has also been suggested that nutrient contamination is broadly controlled by groundwater ages and travel time castaldo et al 2021 because modern waters are more likely to transport manmade contaminants and are more vulnerable to land use effects sophocleous 2012 therefore there is an increased need to estimate young apparent ages to aid in groundwater quality management newman et al 2010 the residence time of old groundwater from west hawai i and the use of age data for island aquifer characterization will be discussed in a subsequent manuscript 2 methods 2 1 study area hawai i island is the largest 10 464 km2 and youngest island in the hawaiian archipelago with its entire surface less than one million years old clague and dalrymple 1987 izuka et al 2018 the island was built by five shield volcanoes kohala mauna kea hualālai mauna loa and kīlauea although surficial maps indicate distinct boundaries between each volcano the sequential growth of successive volcanoes to form the island results in substantial areas where a younger volcano encroaches over its older sister volcano izuka et al 2018 hence a vertical section through regions of the island might intercept aquifers with groundwater recharge originating from the slopes of two or even three different volcanoes hualālai is the third oldest volcano on the island with a peak elevation of approximately 2 500 m the hualālai volcanics are primarily composed of basalts except for trachyte flows erupted from pu u wa awa a and pu u anahulu stearns and macdonald 1946 hualālai is lined with cones which delineate the volcano s three rift zones north northwest and southeast although the north rift zone is not well defined the surface expression of the rift zones is underlain by dike complexes which are dense intrusive rocks that form near vertical structures as magma fed through subsurface fractures during their transit to surface vents cooled in place stearns and macdonald 1946 izuka et al 2018 the study area of west hawai i includes five aquifer systems waimea anaeho omalu kīholo keauhou and kealakekua that encompass the hualālai volcano and western slopes of mauna kea and mauna loa volcanoes fig 1 the west hawai i aquifer systems exhibit an unusual hydraulic head gradient that is most prominent in the keauhou and kealakekua aquifers here groundwater is generally classified into two categories basal groundwater where water levels are typically 3 m above mean sea level msl and high level groundwater where water levels drastically increase 100 m above msl the location of the increased water levels which is referred to as the high low divide is approximately 6 km inland and is roughly parallel to the coastline a hydrogeologic subsurface structure located at the high low divide likely prevents high level groundwater from easily flowing to the coastline oki 1999 additionally another subsurface feature is theorized to exist below the primary basal aquifer attias et al 2020 this subsurface feature likely facilitates deeper groundwater transport and thus creates a multilayer freshwater aquifer thomas et al 1996 the exact nature of these two significant features however are still poorly characterized although the exact nature and extent of the subsurface structure located at the high low divide has not yet been identified models of gravity survey data indicate the presence of a very dense structure in this area kauahikaua et al 2000 flinders et al 2013 the gravity anomaly is located approximately 4 km southwest of the hualālai rift zone which trends northwest southeast kauahikaua et al 2000 this gravity anomaly is hypothesized to be caused by buried dikes or dense lava flows kauahikaua et al 1998 oki 1999 gravity profiles measured by kauahikaua et al 1998 display an asymmetrical shape suggesting that the lava flows are dipping westward rather than forming near vertical dikes regardless of how the high low divide was formed it serves as an important hydrogeologic feature that restricts groundwater flow and creates a productive aquifer oki 1999 2 2 sampling methods cfc and sf6 concentrations were measured from pumping and monitoring wells in both the basal and high level aquifers and submarine groundwater discharge sgd across west hawai i fig 1 using copper tubing that was attached to well ports triplicate samples were collected in 500 ml boston glass bottles following the u s geological survey usgs procedures u s geological survey 2021a briefly the bottles were placed in a larger container filled with water and allowed to overflow until fully submerged to ensure the samples did not come in contact with air before being capped underwater the sgd samples were collected following the same methods but the copper tube was attached to a peristaltic pump and one meter stainless steel push point sampler mhe products to capture the groundwater before it mixed with seawater water samples flowed through a short length 25 cm of tygon thermoplastic tubing which ran through the peristaltic pump and connected to the push point sampler and copper tubing while copper tubing does not contaminate water samples with cfcs tygon thermoplastic tubing has been found to contaminate water samples with small amounts of cfc 11 and cfc 113 and with trace amounts of cfc 12 cook et al 2006 all cfc and sf6 samples were analyzed at the university of miami rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science tritium laboratory using a purge and trap gas chromatograph with electron capture detection all concentrations are reported on the sio2005 absolute calibration scale the detection limit for all three cfcs is 0 005 pmol kg and is 0 05 fmol kg for sf6 tritium samples were collected from seven pumping wells and two monitoring wells fig 1 the samples were collected in 30 inch length ⅜ inch outer diameter copper tubes following the usgs 3h 3he noble gas sampling methods u s geological survey 2021b briefly a copper tube was attached to the well port via clear vinyl tubing and a brass ball valve was attached to the discharge side of the copper tube the copper tube was flushed and filled with water and the brass ball valve was closed to apply back pressure and prevent bubble formation once the copper tubes were filled with water and all bubbles dislodged the ends of the copper tubes were sealed with clamps mounted in aluminum channels two monitoring well samples kahaluu dmw and keopu 2 dmw fig 1 were collected using a thief sampler in this method the captured water was released into the vinyl tubing and copper tube which was allowed to flush before back pressure was applied bubbles were dislodged and the copper tubes were clamped just as was done at the pumping wells since these samples were exposed to the atmosphere as the water was released from the sampler the results from these two monitoring wells are considered less accurate or reliable all samples were analyzed at the lamont doherty earth observatory environmental tracer group ldeo etg at columbia university following methods described by bayer et al 1989 salinity for all samples were measured using a multiparameter probe ysi professional plus multiparameter instrument model 6 050 000 and 605790 4 2 3 recharge elevations and temperatures since the solubility of cfcs are pressure and temperature dependent recharge elevation and temperature are required to estimate groundwater ages from cfc concentrations recharge elevations were estimated based on the δ18o values of rainwater and groundwater from fackrell et al 2020 kelly and glenn 2015 and hudson 2017 hudson 2017 estimated recharge elevations for all of the sampled sgd samples fig 1 fackrell et al 2020 calculated recharge elevations for eight of the sampled pumping wells while kelly and glenn 2015 calculated recharge elevations for an additional two wells halekii dw and keei d dw fig 1 samples that were not directly calculated in previous studies were estimated based on nearby isotopic compositions as follows recharge elevations for wells huehue ranch 4 and huehue ranch 5 were based on average ka ūpūlehu upland δ18o values keopu dw was based on δ18o values from well 3957 005 and kahaluu c dw was based on δ18o values from well 3557 004 fackrell et al 2020 a recharge elevation for keei a dw was based on keei d dw δ18o values from kelly and glenn 2015 pumping wells from the waimea aquifer were not analyzed in previous studies therefore an assumed recharge elevation of 4 000 m was applied to waikii ranch extending to the summit of mauna kea while an assumed recharge elevation of 2 000 m was applied to lalamilo c dw parker 4 dw waikoloa 3 and waikoloa dw 6 extending to the summit of kohala it has been suggested that the bottom of the northern waimea wells possibly penetrate lava flows from kohala volcano despite being located on surficial mauna kea lava bauer 2003 water levels also suggest that groundwater flows differently in the northern waimea aquifer in comparison to the southern aquifer bauer 2003 though not currently defined recharge from the mahukona aquifer kohala may be entering the northern waimea aquifer t nance personal communication recharge temperatures were estimated based on lapse rates established for hawai i and the mean annual air temperature of the west coast of hawai i island 23 7 c was assumed as the temperature for 0 m elevation kelly and glenn 2015 recharge temperatures trecharge were computed using the equation nullet and sanderson 1993 1 t rech arg e 23 7 c l a p s e r a t e r e c h arg e e l e v a t i o n where the lapse rate for samples recharged at elevations below 1 100 m is 7 3 10 3 c m and the lapse rate for samples recharged at elevations above 1 100 m is 4 1 10 3 c m to assess how sensitive estimated cfc apparent ages are to recharge elevations and temperatures the cfc measurements were first analyzed using two sets of elevations the minimum elevations where most of the recent recharge would occur and the maximum possible elevations as suggested by fackrell et al 2020 and kelly and glenn 2015 2 4 computing cfc and sf6 apparent ages apparent ages of cfcs were computed using the usgs cfc report program u s geological survey 2014 following the iaea use of chlorofluorocarbons in hydrology guidelines plummer et al 2006c apparent ages of sf6 were computed by the university of miami rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science tritium laboratory using the same guidelines briefly apparent ages of each cfc and sf6 compound follow henry s law if a water sample is in equilibrium with air then the concentration of the measured cfc or sf6 gas dissolved in the water ci is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas pi within the air and is computed with 2 c i k h p i where kh is the henry s law gas solubility constant mol kg atm for the cfc and sf6 being evaluated the solubility of the compound is dependent on recharge elevation through the temperature of the water and the partial pressures of the compound and on the salinity of the water in which the compound is dissolved the partial pressure pi is further defined as 3 p i x i p p h 2 o where xi is the cfc or sf6 dry air mole fraction pptv p is the total atmospheric pressure atm and ph2o is the water vapor pressure atm following these equations the measured cfc or sf6 concentration is converted to a dry air atmospheric mixing ratio xi which is then compared to the historical atmospheric ratios to estimate a recharge year these apparent ages follow piston flow which is a concept in which groundwater flows as a discrete packet that is not affected by mixing diffusion or advection bethke and johnson 2008 shapiro et al 2012 since the three cfcs varied in atmospheric concentration over time fig 2 a the cfc mixing ratios can also be used to estimate a recharge year for binary mixtures of young water that contains cfcs and old cfc free water plummer et al 2006d happell et al 2006 for the example of cfc 12 and cfc 113 the cfc concentrations in the mixed water are 4 c f c 113 m i x 1 x c f c 113 y 5 c f c 12 m i x 1 x c f c 12 y where cfc mix values are the respective cfc concentrations in the mixed water x is the fraction of cfc free water and cfc y values are the respective cfc concentrations in the fraction of water that contains cfcs by dividing equations 4 and 5 a tracer ratio is computed using 6 c f c 113 m i x c f c 113 y c f c 12 m i x c f c 12 y the tracer ratio calculated using eq 6 will determine the apparent age of the fraction of water containing cfcs cfc y it is important to note the tracer ratio is the ratio between two tracers and not the mixing ratio which is the concentration in equilibrium with the atmosphere once the apparent age of the cfc containing water is determined the tracer ratio of the sampled water is compared to the tracer ratio expected of a sample with the same apparent age that did not undergo mixing with cfc free water fig 2b this determines the fraction of young cfc containing water within the sample plummer et al 2003 2 5 computing 3h apparent ages and r ra assuming that 4he is solely sourced from the atmosphere tritiogenic 3he concentrations 3hetrit were calculated using the following equation 7 he trit 3 4 021 10 14 he s 4 r s r a he eq 4 r a 1 α where the constant 4 021 1014 converts units of cubic centimeters at standard temperature and pressure cm3stp g to tritium units tu 4hes is the 4he content in the sample units of cm3stp g 4heeq is the 4he content of recharge equilibrated with the atmosphere cm3stp g rs is the 3he 4he ratio in the sample ra is the 3he 4he ratio of air 1 384 10 6 clarke et al 1976 and α is the equilibrium he isotope fractionation factor constant 0 983 schlosser et al 1988 benson and krause 1980 however water samples may contain excess helium which could be sourced from mantle or crustal origins excess helium can be recognized in sample using the calculated r ra values which compare the measured 3he 4he ratios in water samples to atmospheric 3he 4he ratios r ra values were calculated using the following equation 8 r r a r s r a he 3 he 4 sample he 3 he 4 atmosphere clarke et al 1976 heilweil et al 2009 the terrigenic 4he 4heterr concentrations can be calculated using equilibrium concentrations of a noble gas in this case neon 9 he terr 4 he s 4 ne s ne eq he 4 ne atm he eq 4 where nes is the measured neon concentration neeq is the neon concentration in water that is in equilibrium with air and 4he ne atm is the atmospheric ratio 0 288 schlosser et al 1989 to account for 4heterr 3he is corrected using the following equation 10 he trit cor 3 4 021 10 14 he s 4 r s r a he eq 4 r a 1 α he terr 4 r a r terr where 3hetrit is the terrigenically corrected 3he concentration and rterr is the 3he 4he ratio of the terrigenic source schlosser et al 1988 samples with terrigenic helium were corrected using a 3he 4he ratio specific to hualālai of 1 25 10 5 kurz 1993 apparent tritium ages t were then calculated using the following equation 11 t t 1 2 ln 2 ln 1 he trit 3 h 3 where t1 2 is the half life of 12 32 years and 3hetrit is tritiogenic 3he from 3h decay e g aeschbach hertig et al 1998 lindsey et al 2019 3 results and discussion the data analyses indicate that all groundwater and sgd samples have detectable cfcs sf6 and tritium concentrations which demonstrate that at least a portion of the groundwater sampled contains young modern water that recharged within the last 70 years specifically apparent transient tracer ages based on sf6 cfc 11 cfc 12 cfc 113 and 3h 3he measurements range from 7 to 83 years table 1 because these tracers were anthropogenically released into the atmosphere and have unique well documented concentrations fig 2 history matching methods are utilized to estimate travel times based on measured concentrations bethke and johnson 2008 3 1 fundamental cfc sensitivities and influences to assess sensitivity to recharge elevation apparent cfc ages were calculated using a minimum and maximum elevation the average absolute difference in apparent ages of the three cfc compounds between the minimum and maximum elevations is 0 57 0 10 years the average absolute difference in apparent ages of cfc 113 cfc 12 tracer ratios is 1 04 1 51 years and the average difference in the fraction of young water is 1 43 2 36 hence while the recharge elevations are somewhat uncertain in this system this uncertainty does not introduce a significant error in apparent age and fraction of young water calculations all ages are reported hereon based on the integrated elevations as previously determined by fackrell et al 2020 and kelly and glenn 2015 in this hydrologically conductive setting all nearshore basal wells are influenced by tidal cycles inducing water level fluctuation oki 1999 which may promote aeration of nearshore groundwater and further induce saltwater intrusion via tidal pumping mckenzie et al 2021 these interactions could drastically affect the samples by adding more tracer producing relatively young apparent ages and high proportions of young water fig 3 samples located closest to the coastline and pumped closest to the water table had the highest salinity concentrations fig 3 samples with salinity measurements 1 ppt had the youngest apparent ages based on cfc 12 mixing ratios and the highest fraction of young water based on cfc 113 cfc 12 tracer ratios fig 3 this correlation suggests that the high concentrations of cfc measured in samples collected near the coastline are likely affected by intruding young saltwater unfortunately because cfc concentrations change with ocean depth and the depth at which seawater intrudes into the basal aquifer is unknown it is impossible to accurately determine the gas content of this intruding seawater and apply any age corrections to the impacted groundwater the sgd samples are assumed to contain surface seawater that is in equilibrium with present day atmosphere considering that water samples were pumped from a very shallow depth below the ground surface 1m where coastal plumes intersect the shoreline therefore a surface seawater sample collected at the kona coastline was used to salinity correct the cfc concentrations of the sgd samples with the consideration of seawater intrusion the apparent ages of the sgd samples only changed by a maximum of two years however it is still possible that these coastal samples were affected by atmospheric contamination since these samples are pumped near the water table surface the coastal water is likely in continuous circulation with atmospheric gases the cfc based apparent ages and young water fractions of the coastal samples should therefore be considered unreliable general spatial and salinity dependent patterns however are still evident fig 3 3 2 apparent cfc and sf6 tracer ages almost all well samples have younger cfc 113 ages than cfc 11 or cfc 12 table 1 this age discrepancy qualitatively demonstrates mixing of at least two different waters plummer et al 2006d multi tracer plots are useful for showing the mixing ratios of the tracers compared to the potential models of mixing taking place within the groundwater system fig 4 plots the mixing ratios against piston flow models pfm and binary mixing models bmm most samples fall in the lower left corner of the plots which indicate relatively old apparent ages that may be difficult to define within the tracer time scale solomon et al 2010 samples that have not been affected by external processes i e contamination degradation excess air should fall within the mixing model lines plummer et al 2006d if a sample contains a mixture of multiple water masses mixing ratio results can fall anywhere between the mixing curves depending on the age of the end member assigned to the bmm plummer et al 2006d the black dashed bmm lines illustrate tracer concentrations that result from mixing between groundwater that recharged prior to the release of cfcs and groundwater that recharged in 2019 the year these samples were collected in comparison to the black dashed bmm line the red dotted bmm line was manually plotted as the best fit of the measurements indicating that binary mixing potentially occurred between cfc free water and water that recharged in 1983 fig 3a a similar relationship is demonstrated in fig 4c but with slightly more scatter surrounding the bmm line between cfc free water and water that recharged in 1983 more samples fall along the red dotted line suggesting that the water containing cfcs recharged approximately 36 years ago identifying the most appropriate mixing model in fig 4b is difficult due to the close proximity of the pfm and bmm lines of the three cfc compounds cfc 12 is typically the most resistant to contamination or degradation cook et al 2006 han et al 2014 however three sgd samples and one well sample keei d dw fall outside of the mixing lines in fig 4a and 4c but are located within the mixing lines of fig 4b these samples may therefore be degraded in cfc 113 rather than contaminated with cfc 12 and cfc 11 nonetheless the tracer plots and elevated stability of cfc 12 e g han et al 2014 suggest that this tracer s measurements provide the most reliable data for groundwater age dating most samples plot outside of the mixing lines in fig 4d f indicating an enrichment of sf6 it has been shown that sf6 can be terrigenically sourced in volcanic island settings busenberg and plummer 2000 koh et al 2007 kagabu et al 2017 which would therefore skew apparent ages based on sf6 concentrations 3 3 binary mixing of cfcs since the multi tracer plots fig 4 suggest binary mixing between cfc free water and water recharged in the 1980s binary mixing models were computed using cfc 113 cfc 12 tracer ratios eqs 4 to 6 due to an increase of atmospheric cfc 113 concentration in the late 1970 s fig 2a the cfc 113 cfc 12 or cfc 113 cfc 11 ratio best defines the age of the young water if it recharged in the 1980s whereas the cfc 11 cfc 12 ratio defines the age if the young water recharged between the 1940s to 1970s fig 2b plummer et al 2006c 2006d the results of binary mixing models show that samples located near the coast have larger fractions of young water whereas samples collected further inland have smaller fractions of young water fig 5 although kahaluu c dw and keei a dw technically pump from the basal aquifer both have 50 young water fractions similar to wells that pump from the high level aquifer honokohau dw has an estimated recharge elevation that exceeds the peak of hualālai fig 5 this higher recharge elevation suggests that groundwater recharged not just from hualālai but from the slopes of mauna loa and infiltrated into honokohau dw which requires a more complex mixing model in comparison mixing between hualālai and mauna loa recharge may not be prevalent in the keopu dw and qlt dw 3 4 apparent 3h 3he tracer ages since atmospheric tritium concentrations have been declining and with less than one tu measured in all samples it is difficult to define apparent ages within the tritium time scale additionally terrigenic helium helium from mantle and crustal origins may impact groundwater samples and bias apparent ages terrigenic influences can be quantified by measuring excess terrigenic 4he 4heterr and calculating r ra values samples that are not affected by terrigenic helium have r ra values near 1 0 whereas samples that have mantle derived helium exhibit increasing r ra trends heilweil et al 2009 for example fercho et al 2015 calculated r ra for groundwater from wells located on the hualālai rift zone and wells located off of the hualālai rift zone on rift samples had an average r ra of 8 8 n 4 whereas off rift samples averaged 4 5 n 2 thus fercho et al 2015 demonstrated the presence of terrigenic influence and concluded that more magmatic helium enters the groundwater as you move closer to the central rift zone of hualālai four of the nine samples collected from the west hawai i aquifer systems were terrigenically influenced as demonstrated by the presence of 4heterr ranging from 4 07 10 9 to 1 19 10 8 cm3stp g and higher r ra values ranging from 1 6 to 3 2 fig 6 crustal 3he 4he ratios are used to correct for 4heterr and oceanic island hotspots typically demonstrate higher terrigenic 3he 4he ratios relative to the average crustal ratio kama ehuakanaloa previously referred to as the lō ihi seamount located at the southeast end of the hawaiian island chain is recorded to have the highest 3he 4he value 30 times greater than atmospheric 3he 4he kurz 1993 sedwick et al 1994 since hualālai is no longer directly above the hawaiian hotspot mantle plume influences and 3he 4he ratios have drastically declined kurz 1993 hualālai basalts have 3he 4he ratios of approximately 9 ra equivalent to a 3he 4he ratio of 1 25 10 5 kurz 1993 when the samples were corrected for 4heterr using the hualālai 3he 4he ratio of 1 25 10 5 the apparent ages of the four terrigenically influenced samples ranged from 58 to 83 years fig 6 these terrigenically corrected tritium ages were in good agreement with apparent cfc 12 ages rmse 10 years fig 6 inset in comparison when the samples were corrected for 4heterr using an average crustal terrigenic 3he 4he ratio of 2 10 8 e g hohmann et al 1998 the apparent ages of the four terrigenically influenced samples ranged from 76 to 107 years thus tritium samples were biased towards older ages when corrected using an average crustal terrigenic 3he 4he ratio of 2 10 8 rmse 19 years e g hohmann et al 1998 this difference in apparent ages demonstrates how excess terrigenic sources can significantly impact groundwater samples where the groundwater appears older than it actually is and that it is not necessarily appropriate to use an average crustal terrigenic 3he 4he ratio in a unique environment such as hawai i 3 5 3h 3he as an indicator of groundwater mixing because cfc measurements indicate mixing between young groundwater and older cfc free groundwater tritium samples were also used to categorically classify the samples into modern premodern and mixed groundwater since atmospheric tritium concentrations rose in 1953 solomon and sudicky 1991 ingraham 1998 water recharged post 1953 is considered to be modern and water recharge prior to 1953 is considered to be premodern lindsey et al 2019 using reconstructed tritium deposition in precipitation over the continental united states michel et al 2018 calculated cutoff values for every sampling year to determine the modern and premodern thresholds briefly the modern threshold is the minimum post peak 1963 tritium concentration of historical deposition records that are decayed to the time of sampling lindsey et al 2019 the premodern threshold is the estimated 1952 tritium concentration averaged from 2008 to 2012 concentrations that is decayed to the time of sampling lindsey et al 2019 since atmospheric tritium concentrations vary both spatially and temporally e g solomon and sudicky 1991 and hawai i is not located within the continental united states southern california was used to determine threshold concentrations for west hawai i samples collected in 2018 with a modern and premodern threshold of 1 034 tu and 0 097 tu respectively fig 7 jurgens 2018 michel et al 2018 for comparison jasechko taylor 2015 also reconstructed tritium deposition in precipitation on a global scale and results over hawai i fig 7 were similar to los angeles results from michel et al 2018 following methods from lindsey et al 2019 all west hawai i samples fell between the 1 034 tu and 0 097 tu thresholds fig 7 this implies that the sampled groundwater is a mixture of both modern and premodern water which agrees with cfc 113 cfc 12 analysis fig 4 further these modern and premodern thresholds were used to estimate the fraction of the groundwater sample that recharged post 1953 fpost 1953 following the equation jasechko 2016 12 f p o s t 1953 t s a m p l e t p r e t p o s t t p r e where tsample is the tritium concentration measured in the sample tpre is the premodern tritium threshold of 0 097 tu and tpost is the modern tritium threshold of 1 03 tu post 1953 groundwater fractions of the nine tritium samples ranged from 11 to 68 fig 8 six of the wells that were analyzed for post 1953 tritium fractions were also analyzed for cfc 113 cfc 12 ratio ages and fraction of young groundwater there is a weak but positive correlation r2 0 24 between the young groundwater fractions estimated based on tritium measurements and young groundwater fractions estimated based on cfc 113 cfc 12 measurements in particular kohanaiki 6 demonstrated very different results where tritium analysis estimated that 35 of the groundwater sample is young in contrast to a value of 75 which was estimated by the cfc 113 cfc 12 analysis fig 8 it is important to note that kohanaiki 6 is located 1 km from the coastline and has a high salinity measurement 8 2 ppt therefore the cfc 113 cfc 12 measurement was possibly affected by saltwater intrusion which could increase estimates of cfc derived young groundwater fractions post 1953 groundwater fractions estimated using tritium measurements however typically have significant uncertainties due to the temporal and spatial variability of tritium deposition jasechko 2016 this is further exacerbated when groundwater samples are collected from heterogeneous aquifers via pumping wells with long perforated screens jasechko 2016 nonetheless these two methods agree that the aquifers are mixtures of young and old groundwater and provide ranges of the young groundwater fractions 3 6 implication of young groundwater age on nitrate contamination the quantification of young groundwater ages can be particularly important when investigating nutrient transport as previous studies suggest that apparent groundwater ages are inversely correlated to nitrogen contamination castaldo et al 2021 as shallow wells typically pump younger groundwater young apparent ages are vital to assess nutrient distribution especially in shallow aquifers along the coast of west hawai i where excess natural and anthropogenic nutrients can negatively impact coastal ecosystems e g duarte et al 2010 this trend is observed in the west hawai i aquifers fig 9 using nitrate concentrations measured from the same wells sampled for groundwater age tachera 2021 despite the low coefficients of determination between nitrate concentrations and apparent groundwater age r2 0 13 and 0 35 ages estimated using cfc 12 and 3h 3he tracers both demonstrate this negative trend although the low coefficients of determination may be influenced by other factors such as distance from contaminant sources the apparent ages estimated using cfc 12 and 3h 3he suggest that nitrate concentrations decrease at a rate of 0 01 mg l per year fig 9 this inverse correlation demonstrate that higher nitrate concentrations are likely found in groundwater that recharged in the last 70 years when significant population growth occurred and likely led to an increase in groundwater nitrate concentrations in west hawai i furthermore this case from west hawai i illustrates how groundwater age and nutrient relationships can be very valuable when investigating nutrient transport in coastal aquifers such as the studies conducted by okuhata et al 2021 and wada et al 2021 which aimed to identify the relative source contributions of nutrients detected in the keauhou aquifer 4 conclusion apparent ages of young groundwater are estimated using the recent and well documented history of transient tracers released into the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activity few studies have estimated apparent groundwater ages in west hawai i and none have implemented a multi tracer approach this study estimated young apparent ages using cfcs sf6 and 3h 3he measurements in groundwater and sgd samples all samples analyzed for transient geochemical tracers detected cfcs and tritium indicating that the west hawai i aquifers contain some proportion of groundwater that recharged no earlier than the 1950 s cfc and sf6 tracer plots exhibit the likelihood of binary mixing in almost all samples but the low concentration measurements demonstrate the commanding presence of older groundwater that cannot be defined within the cfc and sf6 tracer time scale tracer plots also suggest that sf6 measurements were contaminated potentially from volcanic deposits and therefore are not as reliable for hawaiian aquifers compared with the other tracers used apparent cfc ages from coastal samples are less reliable because of potential modern atmospheric contamination since coastal wells are highly influenced by tides and the thin freshwater lens is closer to ground elevation wells are pumped from very shallow depths these factors are therefore more likely to expose the groundwater to the atmosphere which contains modern cfc concentrations this would lead to cfc contamination which would bias the samples towards young apparent ages and higher fractions of modern water the apparent ages of the water for many wells are also at the extreme end of the tritium tracer time scale and hence there are large uncertainties in the computed ages similar to cfcs all tritium measurements indicate mixing between modern and premodern groundwater sources apparent tritium ages were initially higher than apparent cfc ages but relatively higher r ra values demonstrate that these samples are affected by excess helium from terrigenic sources therefore when tritium measurements were corrected using a hualālai specific 3he 4he ratio to account for terrigenic helium influences apparent ages are in good agreement with cfc 12 ages this age agreement between two different tracers validates the presence of young groundwater in the west hawai i aquifers and also highlights that groundwater is significantly influenced by volcanic activity from hualālai both cfc and 3h 3he measurements were utilized to estimate the proportion of young groundwater that recharged within the last 70 years and both tracer methods agreed that the west hawai i aquifers are a mixture of modern and premodern waters although the cfc and tritium methods were not in perfect agreement the results provide ranges of young water fractions thus expanding our understanding of the groundwater mixing possibilities further an inverse trend observed between young apparent groundwater ages and nitrate concentrations reveal the influence of groundwater age on nutrient distribution and contamination we present the applicability of these tracers in a volcanic island setting and the steps taken to mitigate these various influences which can be applied in other study areas with similar significant factors this multi tracer study therefore advances our understanding of west hawai i s groundwater ages and helps to develop a conceptual model to describe groundwater flow and transport through the west hawai i aquifers however since cfc and tritium concentrations are declining in the atmosphere it is becoming more difficult to detect cfc and tritium tracers in the groundwater and it will soon be impossible to use these tracers in hawai i as binary mixing models suggest that a large proportion of the groundwater recharged before the release of these anthropogenic tracers the west hawai i aquifers should be further investigated using another set of tracers that cover intermediate to older ages a subsequent study will therefore utilize radiocarbon 14c measurements to estimate the apparent ages of the old groundwater proportions suggest to mix with the young groundwater in the west hawai i aquifers funding this work was supported by the hawai i epscor program funded by the national science

3395,the geologically complex western aquifers of hawai i island serve as the primary reservoir of fresh potable water for residents yet the area s hydrogeologic characteristics are still not well understood groundwater age is a fundamental parameter used to better understand groundwater flow and storage yet few studies have attempted to estimate apparent groundwater ages in hawai i this study implements a multi tracer approach using chlorofluorocarbons sulfur hexafluoride and tritium helium 3 to determine the apparent ages of young water masses from the west hawai i aquifers chlorofluorocarbon and tritium helium 3 tracer measurements suggest that the aquifers contain young groundwater with a median age of 53 years but that a significant volume of older groundwater exists which was recharged prior to the release of these anthropogenic tracers mixing models suggest that the groundwater consists of mixtures with an average 28 modern water 70 years with the remainder being recharged prior to 1953 further helium measurements demonstrate that the area s groundwater is influenced by hydrothermal and magmatic processes from hualālai volcano which bias estimated groundwater ages if not properly considered it is therefore beneficial to utilize a multi tracer approach in an oceanic volcanic island setting where groundwater ages are impacted by various external processes the analysis of young apparent ages and proportions can aid in coastal aquifer characterization and subsequent groundwater quality assessment and is crucial for sustainable groundwater management keywords groundwater age chlorofluorocarbons sulfur hexafluoride tritium helium hawai i 1 introduction groundwater resources on hawai i island as on many small volcanic islands are limited in quantity and highly vulnerable to saltwater intrusion and anthropogenic contamination izuka et al 2018 these resources are critical for supplying nearly all fresh potable demands for the islands residents gingerich and oki 2000 fukunaga associates inc 2017 careful management of groundwater resources and setting values for sustainable yields require the understanding of some of the aquifer s characteristics that relate to both water residence and travel times e g bethke and johnson 2008 groundwater age can be used to investigate flow and storage properties which are important factors to consider ensuring accurate site characterization and sustainable aquifer management reynolds and marimuthu 2007 ginn et al 2009 leray et al 2012 chambers et al 2019 however hawai i island is characterized by an extraordinarily complex geologic nature hawai i island is formed from five separate but interflowing volcanoes each with its own internal structure but lack of well defined subsurface margins all of these attributes impact groundwater storage and flow further volcanic ocean islands present unique geochemical challenges with marine saltwater intrusion hydrothermal processes and magmatic contributions impacting commonly used natural and anthropogenic isotopic and chemical age tracers to mitigate some of these challenges this study has applied a variety of tracers for age determination of young water masses to better define recharge sources and flow paths for aquifers on the west flank of hawai i island chlorofluorocarbons cfcs are chemically inert compounds in the troposphere that are dominantly produced by modern refrigeration air conditioning and industrial applications e g plummer and busenberg 2006a there are three cfc compounds cfc 12 dichlorodifluoromethane cf2cl2 cfc 11 trichlorofluoromethane cfcl3 and cfc 113 trichlorotrifluoroethane c2f3cl3 industrial production of cfc 12 started in 1930 followed by cfc 11 in 1936 and cfc 113 in 1944 plummer and busenberg 2006a atmospheric cfc mixing ratios decreased after the adoption of the montreal protocol in 1987 plummer and busenberg 2006b chambers et al 2019 the production and release of another type of inert gas sulfur hexafluoride sf6 started in 1953 and concentrations continue to rise at present busenberg and plummer 2000 the sf6 is often combined with cfc tracers to determine groundwater age because although both were released at similar times the production and release of sf6 has resulted in different transient atmospheric concentrations since the historic atmospheric concentrations of all three cfcs and sf6 have been well documented these compounds are excellent tracers for relatively young groundwater that is typically 70 years in age e g busenberg and plummer 2000 further the apparent ages derived from cfc ratios can be compared to apparent ages derived from individual compound concentrations to better refine recharge years when groundwater mixing occurs e g happell et al 2006 tritium t or 3h is a radioactive isotope with a half life of 12 32 years e g lindsey et al 2019 atmospheric tritium concentrations peaked around 1963 due to above ground nuclear bomb tests that started in 1953 solomon and sudicky 1991 ingraham 1998 tritium measurements in groundwater can be referenced to the mid 1960s nuclear bomb detonation peak thus are useful for inferring apparent groundwater age solomon and sudicky 1991 szabo et al 1996 tritium decays to the noble gas helium 3 3he and the tritium helium 3 ratio 3h 3he can be used to determine the apparent age of young groundwater solomon et al 1998 however dissolved 3he can be sourced from atmospheric tritiogenic nucleogenic and terrigenic origins which all need to be considered while calculating apparent groundwater ages solomon and sudicky 1991 outside of hawai i young apparent groundwater ages were estimated for groundwaters from martinique a volcanic tropical island that is part of the french republic gourcy et al 2009 a multi tracer approach utilizing cfcs sf6 and tritium demonstrated some samples contained 95 old groundwater and concluded that the use of a multi tracer approach was necessary for their study where sampling sites can be limited and where sf6 measurements may be contaminated by terrigenic sources kusano et al 2014 used multiple geochemical tracers to estimate apparent ages of groundwater from nakano shima island japan they found that samples from shallow wells and springs contained higher concentrations of cfcs and tritium compared to samples from deeper wells suggesting that the deeper well samples contain a higher proportion of old groundwater that is free of cfcs prior to the present study only limited investigations of groundwater ages and associated flow paths have been conducted in hawai i and little is known about hawai i island s groundwater ages kelly and glenn 2015 used cfcs to determine groundwater ages in west hawai i island whereas scholl et al 1996 used tritium to estimate groundwater ages from kīlauea hawai i both determined that the sampled groundwater in those settings was a mixture of modern water that recharged in the mid 1900s and older water that was free of cfcs and atmospheric tritium those studies however each only utilized a single tracer to assess apparent ages therefore this study will implement a multi tracer approach using cfcs and 3h 3he as well as sf6 to better estimate the relative fractions of modern and premodern water contributions to the west hawai i aquifers and define the apparent ages of the modern groundwater it has also been suggested that nutrient contamination is broadly controlled by groundwater ages and travel time castaldo et al 2021 because modern waters are more likely to transport manmade contaminants and are more vulnerable to land use effects sophocleous 2012 therefore there is an increased need to estimate young apparent ages to aid in groundwater quality management newman et al 2010 the residence time of old groundwater from west hawai i and the use of age data for island aquifer characterization will be discussed in a subsequent manuscript 2 methods 2 1 study area hawai i island is the largest 10 464 km2 and youngest island in the hawaiian archipelago with its entire surface less than one million years old clague and dalrymple 1987 izuka et al 2018 the island was built by five shield volcanoes kohala mauna kea hualālai mauna loa and kīlauea although surficial maps indicate distinct boundaries between each volcano the sequential growth of successive volcanoes to form the island results in substantial areas where a younger volcano encroaches over its older sister volcano izuka et al 2018 hence a vertical section through regions of the island might intercept aquifers with groundwater recharge originating from the slopes of two or even three different volcanoes hualālai is the third oldest volcano on the island with a peak elevation of approximately 2 500 m the hualālai volcanics are primarily composed of basalts except for trachyte flows erupted from pu u wa awa a and pu u anahulu stearns and macdonald 1946 hualālai is lined with cones which delineate the volcano s three rift zones north northwest and southeast although the north rift zone is not well defined the surface expression of the rift zones is underlain by dike complexes which are dense intrusive rocks that form near vertical structures as magma fed through subsurface fractures during their transit to surface vents cooled in place stearns and macdonald 1946 izuka et al 2018 the study area of west hawai i includes five aquifer systems waimea anaeho omalu kīholo keauhou and kealakekua that encompass the hualālai volcano and western slopes of mauna kea and mauna loa volcanoes fig 1 the west hawai i aquifer systems exhibit an unusual hydraulic head gradient that is most prominent in the keauhou and kealakekua aquifers here groundwater is generally classified into two categories basal groundwater where water levels are typically 3 m above mean sea level msl and high level groundwater where water levels drastically increase 100 m above msl the location of the increased water levels which is referred to as the high low divide is approximately 6 km inland and is roughly parallel to the coastline a hydrogeologic subsurface structure located at the high low divide likely prevents high level groundwater from easily flowing to the coastline oki 1999 additionally another subsurface feature is theorized to exist below the primary basal aquifer attias et al 2020 this subsurface feature likely facilitates deeper groundwater transport and thus creates a multilayer freshwater aquifer thomas et al 1996 the exact nature of these two significant features however are still poorly characterized although the exact nature and extent of the subsurface structure located at the high low divide has not yet been identified models of gravity survey data indicate the presence of a very dense structure in this area kauahikaua et al 2000 flinders et al 2013 the gravity anomaly is located approximately 4 km southwest of the hualālai rift zone which trends northwest southeast kauahikaua et al 2000 this gravity anomaly is hypothesized to be caused by buried dikes or dense lava flows kauahikaua et al 1998 oki 1999 gravity profiles measured by kauahikaua et al 1998 display an asymmetrical shape suggesting that the lava flows are dipping westward rather than forming near vertical dikes regardless of how the high low divide was formed it serves as an important hydrogeologic feature that restricts groundwater flow and creates a productive aquifer oki 1999 2 2 sampling methods cfc and sf6 concentrations were measured from pumping and monitoring wells in both the basal and high level aquifers and submarine groundwater discharge sgd across west hawai i fig 1 using copper tubing that was attached to well ports triplicate samples were collected in 500 ml boston glass bottles following the u s geological survey usgs procedures u s geological survey 2021a briefly the bottles were placed in a larger container filled with water and allowed to overflow until fully submerged to ensure the samples did not come in contact with air before being capped underwater the sgd samples were collected following the same methods but the copper tube was attached to a peristaltic pump and one meter stainless steel push point sampler mhe products to capture the groundwater before it mixed with seawater water samples flowed through a short length 25 cm of tygon thermoplastic tubing which ran through the peristaltic pump and connected to the push point sampler and copper tubing while copper tubing does not contaminate water samples with cfcs tygon thermoplastic tubing has been found to contaminate water samples with small amounts of cfc 11 and cfc 113 and with trace amounts of cfc 12 cook et al 2006 all cfc and sf6 samples were analyzed at the university of miami rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science tritium laboratory using a purge and trap gas chromatograph with electron capture detection all concentrations are reported on the sio2005 absolute calibration scale the detection limit for all three cfcs is 0 005 pmol kg and is 0 05 fmol kg for sf6 tritium samples were collected from seven pumping wells and two monitoring wells fig 1 the samples were collected in 30 inch length ⅜ inch outer diameter copper tubes following the usgs 3h 3he noble gas sampling methods u s geological survey 2021b briefly a copper tube was attached to the well port via clear vinyl tubing and a brass ball valve was attached to the discharge side of the copper tube the copper tube was flushed and filled with water and the brass ball valve was closed to apply back pressure and prevent bubble formation once the copper tubes were filled with water and all bubbles dislodged the ends of the copper tubes were sealed with clamps mounted in aluminum channels two monitoring well samples kahaluu dmw and keopu 2 dmw fig 1 were collected using a thief sampler in this method the captured water was released into the vinyl tubing and copper tube which was allowed to flush before back pressure was applied bubbles were dislodged and the copper tubes were clamped just as was done at the pumping wells since these samples were exposed to the atmosphere as the water was released from the sampler the results from these two monitoring wells are considered less accurate or reliable all samples were analyzed at the lamont doherty earth observatory environmental tracer group ldeo etg at columbia university following methods described by bayer et al 1989 salinity for all samples were measured using a multiparameter probe ysi professional plus multiparameter instrument model 6 050 000 and 605790 4 2 3 recharge elevations and temperatures since the solubility of cfcs are pressure and temperature dependent recharge elevation and temperature are required to estimate groundwater ages from cfc concentrations recharge elevations were estimated based on the δ18o values of rainwater and groundwater from fackrell et al 2020 kelly and glenn 2015 and hudson 2017 hudson 2017 estimated recharge elevations for all of the sampled sgd samples fig 1 fackrell et al 2020 calculated recharge elevations for eight of the sampled pumping wells while kelly and glenn 2015 calculated recharge elevations for an additional two wells halekii dw and keei d dw fig 1 samples that were not directly calculated in previous studies were estimated based on nearby isotopic compositions as follows recharge elevations for wells huehue ranch 4 and huehue ranch 5 were based on average ka ūpūlehu upland δ18o values keopu dw was based on δ18o values from well 3957 005 and kahaluu c dw was based on δ18o values from well 3557 004 fackrell et al 2020 a recharge elevation for keei a dw was based on keei d dw δ18o values from kelly and glenn 2015 pumping wells from the waimea aquifer were not analyzed in previous studies therefore an assumed recharge elevation of 4 000 m was applied to waikii ranch extending to the summit of mauna kea while an assumed recharge elevation of 2 000 m was applied to lalamilo c dw parker 4 dw waikoloa 3 and waikoloa dw 6 extending to the summit of kohala it has been suggested that the bottom of the northern waimea wells possibly penetrate lava flows from kohala volcano despite being located on surficial mauna kea lava bauer 2003 water levels also suggest that groundwater flows differently in the northern waimea aquifer in comparison to the southern aquifer bauer 2003 though not currently defined recharge from the mahukona aquifer kohala may be entering the northern waimea aquifer t nance personal communication recharge temperatures were estimated based on lapse rates established for hawai i and the mean annual air temperature of the west coast of hawai i island 23 7 c was assumed as the temperature for 0 m elevation kelly and glenn 2015 recharge temperatures trecharge were computed using the equation nullet and sanderson 1993 1 t rech arg e 23 7 c l a p s e r a t e r e c h arg e e l e v a t i o n where the lapse rate for samples recharged at elevations below 1 100 m is 7 3 10 3 c m and the lapse rate for samples recharged at elevations above 1 100 m is 4 1 10 3 c m to assess how sensitive estimated cfc apparent ages are to recharge elevations and temperatures the cfc measurements were first analyzed using two sets of elevations the minimum elevations where most of the recent recharge would occur and the maximum possible elevations as suggested by fackrell et al 2020 and kelly and glenn 2015 2 4 computing cfc and sf6 apparent ages apparent ages of cfcs were computed using the usgs cfc report program u s geological survey 2014 following the iaea use of chlorofluorocarbons in hydrology guidelines plummer et al 2006c apparent ages of sf6 were computed by the university of miami rosenstiel school of marine and atmospheric science tritium laboratory using the same guidelines briefly apparent ages of each cfc and sf6 compound follow henry s law if a water sample is in equilibrium with air then the concentration of the measured cfc or sf6 gas dissolved in the water ci is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas pi within the air and is computed with 2 c i k h p i where kh is the henry s law gas solubility constant mol kg atm for the cfc and sf6 being evaluated the solubility of the compound is dependent on recharge elevation through the temperature of the water and the partial pressures of the compound and on the salinity of the water in which the compound is dissolved the partial pressure pi is further defined as 3 p i x i p p h 2 o where xi is the cfc or sf6 dry air mole fraction pptv p is the total atmospheric pressure atm and ph2o is the water vapor pressure atm following these equations the measured cfc or sf6 concentration is converted to a dry air atmospheric mixing ratio xi which is then compared to the historical atmospheric ratios to estimate a recharge year these apparent ages follow piston flow which is a concept in which groundwater flows as a discrete packet that is not affected by mixing diffusion or advection bethke and johnson 2008 shapiro et al 2012 since the three cfcs varied in atmospheric concentration over time fig 2 a the cfc mixing ratios can also be used to estimate a recharge year for binary mixtures of young water that contains cfcs and old cfc free water plummer et al 2006d happell et al 2006 for the example of cfc 12 and cfc 113 the cfc concentrations in the mixed water are 4 c f c 113 m i x 1 x c f c 113 y 5 c f c 12 m i x 1 x c f c 12 y where cfc mix values are the respective cfc concentrations in the mixed water x is the fraction of cfc free water and cfc y values are the respective cfc concentrations in the fraction of water that contains cfcs by dividing equations 4 and 5 a tracer ratio is computed using 6 c f c 113 m i x c f c 113 y c f c 12 m i x c f c 12 y the tracer ratio calculated using eq 6 will determine the apparent age of the fraction of water containing cfcs cfc y it is important to note the tracer ratio is the ratio between two tracers and not the mixing ratio which is the concentration in equilibrium with the atmosphere once the apparent age of the cfc containing water is determined the tracer ratio of the sampled water is compared to the tracer ratio expected of a sample with the same apparent age that did not undergo mixing with cfc free water fig 2b this determines the fraction of young cfc containing water within the sample plummer et al 2003 2 5 computing 3h apparent ages and r ra assuming that 4he is solely sourced from the atmosphere tritiogenic 3he concentrations 3hetrit were calculated using the following equation 7 he trit 3 4 021 10 14 he s 4 r s r a he eq 4 r a 1 α where the constant 4 021 1014 converts

schlosser et al 1988 benson and krause 1980 however water samples may contain excess helium which could be sourced from mantle or crustal origins excess helium can be recognized in sample using the calculated r ra values which compare the measured 3he 4he ratios in water samples to atmospheric 3he 4he ratios r ra values were calculated using the following equation 8 r r a r s r a he 3 he 4

the terrigenically corrected 3he concentration and rterr is the 3he 4he ratio of the terrigenic source schlosser et al 1988 samples with terrigenic helium were corrected using a 3he 4he ratio specific to hualālai of 1 25 10 5 kurz 1993 apparent tritium ages t were then calculated using the following equation 11 t t 1 2 ln 2 ln 1 he trit 3 h 3 where t1 2 is the half life of 12 32 years and 3hetrit is tritiogenic 3he from 3h decay e g aeschbach hertig et al 1998 lindsey et al 2019 3 results and discussion the data analyses indicate that all groundwater and sgd samples have detectable cfcs sf6 and tritium concentrations which demonstrate that at least a portion of the groundwater sampled contains young modern water that recharged within the last 70 years specifically apparent transient tracer ages based on sf6 cfc 11 cfc 12 cfc 113 and 3h 3he measurements range from 7 to 83 years table 1 because these tracers were anthropogenically released into the atmosphere and have unique well documented concentrations fig 2 history matching methods are utilized to estimate travel times based on measured concentrations bethke and johnson 2008 3 1 fundamental cfc sensitivities and influences to assess sensitivity to recharge elevation apparent cfc ages were calculated using a minimum and maximum elevation the average absolute difference in apparent ages of the three cfc compounds between the minimum and maximum elevations is 0 57 0 10 years the average absolute difference in apparent ages of cfc 113 cfc 12 tracer ratios is 1 04 1 51 years and the average difference in the fraction of young water is 1 43 2 36 hence while the recharge elevations are somewhat uncertain in this system this uncertainty does not introduce a significant error in apparent age and fraction of young water calculations all ages are reported hereon based on the integrated elevations as previously determined by fackrell et al 2020 and kelly and glenn 2015 in this hydrologically conductive setting all nearshore basal wells are influenced by tidal cycles inducing water level fluctuation oki 1999 which may promote aeration of nearshore groundwater and further induce saltwater intrusion via tidal pumping mckenzie et al 2021 these interactions could drastically affect the samples by adding more tracer producing relatively young apparent ages and high proportions of young water fig 3 samples located closest to the coastline and pumped closest to the water table had the highest salinity concentrations fig 3 samples with salinity measurements 1 ppt had the youngest apparent ages based on cfc 12 mixing ratios and the highest fraction of young water based on cfc 113 cfc 12 tracer ratios fig 3 this correlation suggests that the high concentrations of cfc measured in samples collected near the coastline are likely affected by intruding young saltwater unfortunately because cfc concentrations change with ocean depth and the depth at which seawater intrudes into the basal aquifer is unknown it is impossible to accurately determine the gas content of this intruding seawater and apply any age corrections to the impacted groundwater the sgd samples are assumed to contain surface seawater that is in equilibrium with present day atmosphere considering that water samples were pumped from a very shallow depth below the ground surface 1m where coastal plumes intersect the shoreline therefore a surface seawater sample collected at the kona coastline was used to salinity correct the cfc concentrations of the sgd samples with the consideration of seawater intrusion the apparent ages of the sgd samples only changed by a maximum of two years however it is still possible that these coastal samples were affected by atmospheric contamination since these samples are pumped near the water table surface the coastal water is likely in continuous circulation with atmospheric gases the cfc based apparent ages and young water fractions of the coastal samples should therefore be considered unreliable general spatial and salinity dependent patterns however are still evident fig 3 3 2 apparent cfc and sf6 tracer ages almost all well samples have younger cfc 113 ages than cfc 11 or cfc 12 table 1 this age discrepancy qualitatively demonstrates mixing of at least two different waters plummer et al 2006d multi tracer plots are useful for showing the mixing ratios of the tracers compared to the potential models of mixing taking place within the groundwater system fig 4 plots the mixing ratios against piston flow models pfm and binary mixing models bmm most samples fall in the lower left corner of the plots which indicate relatively old apparent ages that may be difficult to define within the tracer time scale solomon et al 2010 samples that have not been affected by external processes i e contamination degradation excess air should fall within the mixing model lines plummer et al 2006d if a sample contains a mixture of multiple water masses mixing ratio results can fall anywhere between the mixing curves depending on the age of the end member assigned to the bmm plummer et al 2006d the black dashed bmm lines illustrate tracer concentrations that result from mixing between groundwater that recharged prior to the release of cfcs and groundwater that recharged in 2019 the year these samples were collected in comparison to the black dashed bmm line the red dotted bmm line was manually plotted as the best fit of the measurements indicating that binary mixing potentially occurred between cfc free water and water that recharged in 1983 fig 3a a similar relationship is demonstrated in fig 4c but with slightly more scatter surrounding the bmm line between cfc free water and water that recharged in 1983 more samples fall along the red dotted line suggesting that the water containing cfcs recharged approximately 36 years ago identifying the most appropriate mixing model in fig 4b is difficult due to the close proximity of the pfm and bmm lines of the three cfc compounds cfc 12 is typically the most resistant to contamination or degradation cook et al 2006 han et al 2014 however three sgd samples and one well sample keei d dw fall outside of the mixing lines in fig 4a and 4c but are located within the mixing lines of fig 4b these samples may therefore be degraded in cfc 113 rather than contaminated with cfc 12 and cfc 11 nonetheless the tracer plots and elevated stability of cfc 12 e g han et al 2014 suggest that this tracer s measurements provide the most reliable data for groundwater age dating most samples plot outside of the mixing lines in fig 4d f indicating an enrichment of sf6 it has been shown that sf6 can be terrigenically sourced in volcanic island settings busenberg and plummer 2000 koh et al 2007 kagabu et al 2017 which would therefore skew apparent ages based on sf6 concentrations 3 3 binary mixing of cfcs since the multi tracer plots fig 4 suggest binary mixing between cfc free water and water recharged in the 1980s binary mixing models were computed using cfc 113 cfc 12 tracer ratios eqs 4 to 6 due to an increase of atmospheric cfc 113 concentration in the late 1970 s fig 2a the cfc 113 cfc 12 or cfc 113 cfc 11 ratio best defines the age of the young water if it recharged in the 1980s whereas the cfc 11 cfc 12 ratio defines the age if the young water recharged between the 1940s to 1970s fig 2b plummer et al 2006c 2006d the results of binary mixing models show that samples located near the coast have larger fractions of young water whereas samples collected further inland have smaller fractions of young water fig 5 although kahaluu c dw and keei a dw technically pump from the basal aquifer both have 50 young water fractions similar to wells that pump from the high level aquifer honokohau dw has an estimated recharge elevation that exceeds the peak of hualālai fig 5 this higher recharge elevation suggests that groundwater recharged not just from hualālai but from the slopes of mauna loa and infiltrated into honokohau dw which requires a more complex mixing model in comparison mixing between hualālai and mauna loa recharge may not be prevalent in the keopu dw and qlt dw 3 4 apparent 3h 3he tracer ages since atmospheric tritium concentrations have been declining and with less than one tu measured in all samples it is difficult to define apparent ages within the tritium time scale additionally terrigenic helium helium from mantle and crustal origins may impact groundwater samples and bias apparent ages terrigenic influences can be quantified by measuring excess terrigenic 4he 4heterr and calculating r ra values samples that are not affected by terrigenic helium have r ra values near 1 0 whereas samples that have mantle derived helium exhibit increasing r ra trends heilweil et al 2009 for example fercho et al 2015 calculated r ra for groundwater from wells located on the hualālai rift zone and wells located off of the hualālai rift zone on rift samples had an average r ra of 8 8 n 4 whereas off rift samples averaged 4 5 n 2 thus fercho et al 2015 demonstrated the presence of terrigenic influence and concluded that more magmatic helium enters the groundwater as you move closer to the central rift zone of hualālai four of the nine samples collected from the west hawai i aquifer systems were terrigenically influenced as demonstrated by the presence of 4heterr ranging from 4 07 10 9 to 1 19 10 8 cm3stp g and higher r ra values ranging from 1 6 to 3 2 fig 6 crustal 3he 4he ratios are used to correct for 4heterr and oceanic island hotspots typically demonstrate higher terrigenic 3he 4he ratios relative to the average crustal ratio kama ehuakanaloa previously referred to as the lō ihi seamount located at the southeast end of the hawaiian island chain is recorded to have the highest 3he 4he value 30 times greater than atmospheric 3he 4he kurz 1993 sedwick et al 1994 since hualālai is no longer directly above the hawaiian hotspot mantle plume influences and 3he 4he ratios have drastically declined kurz 1993 hualālai basalts have 3he 4he ratios of approximately 9 ra equivalent to a 3he 4he ratio of 1 25 10 5 kurz 1993 when the samples were corrected for 4heterr using the hualālai 3he 4he ratio of 1 25 10 5 the apparent ages of the four terrigenically influenced samples ranged from 58 to 83 years fig 6 these terrigenically corrected tritium ages were in good agreement with apparent cfc 12 ages rmse 10 years fig 6 inset in comparison when the samples were corrected for 4heterr using an average crustal terrigenic 3he 4he ratio of 2 10 8 e g hohmann et al 1998 the apparent ages of the four terrigenically influenced samples ranged from 76 to 107 years thus tritium samples were biased towards older ages when corrected using an average crustal terrigenic 3he 4he ratio of 2 10 8 rmse 19 years e g hohmann et al 1998 this difference in apparent ages demonstrates how excess terrigenic sources can significantly impact groundwater samples where the groundwater appears older than it actually is and that it is not necessarily appropriate to use an average crustal terrigenic 3he 4he ratio in a unique environment such as hawai i 3 5 3h 3he as an indicator of groundwater mixing because cfc measurements indicate mixing between young groundwater and older cfc free groundwater tritium samples were also used to categorically classify the samples into modern premodern and mixed groundwater since atmospheric tritium concentrations rose in 1953 solomon and sudicky 1991 ingraham 1998 water recharged post 1953 is considered to be modern and water recharge prior to 1953 is considered to be premodern lindsey et al 2019 using reconstructed tritium deposition in precipitation over the continental united states michel et al 2018 calculated cutoff values for every sampling year to determine the modern and premodern thresholds briefly the modern threshold is the minimum post peak 1963 tritium concentration of historical deposition records that are decayed to the time of sampling lindsey et al 2019 the premodern threshold is the estimated 1952 tritium concentration averaged from 2008 to 2012 concentrations that is decayed to the time of sampling lindsey et al 2019 since atmospheric tritium concentrations vary both spatially and temporally e g solomon and sudicky 1991 and hawai i is not located within the continental united states southern california was used to determine threshold concentrations for west hawai i samples collected in 2018 with a modern and premodern threshold of 1 034 tu and 0 097 tu respectively fig 7 jurgens 2018 michel et al 2018 for comparison jasechko taylor 2015 also reconstructed tritium deposition in precipitation on a global scale and results over hawai i fig 7 were similar to los angeles results from michel et al 2018 following methods from lindsey et al 2019 all west hawai i samples fell between the 1 034 tu and 0 097 tu thresholds fig 7 this implies that the sampled groundwater is a mixture of both modern and premodern water which agrees with cfc 113 cfc 12 analysis fig 4 further these modern and premodern thresholds were used to estimate the fraction of the groundwater sample that recharged post 1953 fpost 1953 following the equation jasechko 2016 12 f p o s t 1953 t s a m p l e t p r e t p o s t t p r e where tsample is the tritium concentration measured in the sample tpre is the premodern tritium threshold of 0 097 tu and tpost is the modern tritium threshold of 1 03 tu post 1953 groundwater fractions of the nine tritium samples ranged from 11 to 68 fig 8 six of the wells that were analyzed for post 1953 tritium fractions were also analyzed for cfc 113 cfc 12 ratio ages and fraction of young groundwater there is a weak but positive correlation r2 0 24 between the young groundwater fractions estimated based on tritium measurements and young groundwater fractions estimated based on cfc 113 cfc 12 measurements in particular kohanaiki 6 demonstrated very different results where tritium analysis estimated that 35 of the groundwater sample is young in contrast to a value of 75 which was estimated by the cfc 113 cfc 12 analysis fig 8 it is important to note that kohanaiki 6 is located 1 km from the coastline and has a high salinity measurement 8 2 ppt therefore the cfc 113 cfc 12 measurement was possibly affected by saltwater intrusion which could increase estimates of cfc derived young groundwater fractions post 1953 groundwater fractions estimated using tritium measurements however typically have significant uncertainties due to the temporal and spatial variability of tritium deposition jasechko 2016 this is further exacerbated when groundwater samples are collected from heterogeneous aquifers via pumping wells with long perforated screens jasechko 2016 nonetheless these two methods agree that the aquifers are mixtures of young and old groundwater and provide ranges of the young groundwater fractions 3 6 implication of young groundwater age on nitrate contamination the quantification of young groundwater ages can be particularly important when investigating nutrient transport as previous studies suggest that apparent groundwater ages are inversely correlated to nitrogen contamination castaldo et al 2021 as shallow wells typically pump younger groundwater young apparent ages are vital to assess nutrient distribution especially in shallow aquifers along the coast of west hawai i where excess natural and anthropogenic nutrients can negatively impact coastal ecosystems e g duarte et al 2010 this trend is observed in the west hawai i aquifers fig 9 using nitrate concentrations measured from the same wells sampled for groundwater age tachera 2021 despite the low coefficients of determination between nitrate concentrations and apparent groundwater age r2 0 13 and 0 35 ages estimated using cfc 12 and 3h 3he tracers both demonstrate this negative trend although the low coefficients of determination may be influenced by other factors such as distance from contaminant sources the apparent ages estimated using cfc 12 and 3h 3he suggest that nitrate concentrations decrease at a rate of 0 01 mg l per year fig 9 this inverse correlation demonstrate that higher nitrate concentrations are likely found in groundwater that recharged in the last 70 years when significant population growth occurred and likely led to an increase in groundwater nitrate concentrations in west hawai i furthermore this case from west hawai i illustrates how groundwater age and nutrient relationships can be very valuable when investigating nutrient transport in coastal aquifers such as the studies conducted by okuhata et al 2021 and wada et al 2021 which aimed to identify the relative source contributions of nutrients detected in the keauhou aquifer 4 conclusion apparent ages of young groundwater are estimated using the recent and well documented history of transient tracers released into the atmosphere due to anthropogenic activity few studies have estimated apparent groundwater ages in west hawai i and none have implemented a multi tracer approach this study estimated young apparent ages using cfcs sf6 and 3h 3he measurements in groundwater and sgd samples all samples analyzed for transient geochemical tracers detected cfcs and tritium indicating that the west hawai i aquifers contain some proportion of groundwater that recharged no earlier than the 1950 s cfc and sf6 tracer plots exhibit the likelihood of binary mixing in almost all samples but the low concentration measurements demonstrate the commanding presence of older groundwater that cannot be defined within the cfc and sf6 tracer time scale tracer plots also suggest that sf6 measurements were contaminated potentially from volcanic deposits and therefore are not as reliable for hawaiian aquifers compared with the other tracers used apparent cfc ages from coastal samples are less reliable because of potential modern atmospheric contamination since coastal wells are highly influenced by tides and the thin freshwater lens is closer to ground elevation wells are pumped from very shallow depths these factors are therefore more likely to expose the groundwater to the atmosphere which contains modern cfc concentrations this would lead to cfc contamination which would bias the samples towards young apparent ages and higher fractions of modern water the apparent ages of the water for many wells are also at the extreme end of the tritium tracer time scale and hence there are large uncertainties in the computed ages similar to cfcs all tritium measurements indicate mixing between modern and premodern groundwater sources apparent tritium ages were initially higher than apparent cfc ages but relatively higher r ra values demonstrate that these samples are affected by excess helium from terrigenic sources therefore when tritium measurements were corrected using a hualālai specific 3he 4he ratio to account for terrigenic helium influences apparent ages are in good agreement with cfc 12 ages this age agreement between two different tracers validates the presence of young groundwater in the west hawai i aquifers and also highlights that groundwater is significantly influenced by volcanic activity from hualālai both cfc and 3h 3he measurements were utilized to estimate the proportion of young groundwater that recharged within the last 70 years and both tracer methods agreed that the west hawai i aquifers are a mixture of modern and premodern waters although the cfc and tritium methods were not in perfect agreement the results provide ranges of young water fractions thus expanding our understanding of the groundwater mixing possibilities further an inverse trend observed between young apparent groundwater ages and nitrate concentrations reveal the influence of groundwater age on nutrient distribution and contamination we present the applicability of these tracers in a volcanic island setting and the steps taken to mitigate these various influences which can be applied in other study areas with similar significant factors this multi tracer study therefore advances our understanding of west hawai i s groundwater ages and helps to develop a conceptual model to describe groundwater flow and transport through the west hawai i aquifers however since cfc and tritium concentrations are declining in the atmosphere it is becoming more difficult to detect cfc and tritium tracers in the groundwater and it will soon be impossible to use these tracers in hawai i as binary mixing models suggest that a large proportion of the groundwater recharged before the release of these anthropogenic tracers the west hawai i aquifers should be further investigated using another set of tracers that cover intermediate to older ages a subsequent study will therefore utilize radiocarbon 14c measurements to estimate the apparent ages of the old groundwater proportions suggest to mix with the young groundwater in the west hawai i aquifers funding this work was supported by the hawai i epscor program funded by the national science

3396,oscillatory water levels are often observed in groundwater wells when the aquifer is perturbed by harmonic disturbances such as oscillatory pumping tide and seismic waves to interpret the measured water levels numerous models have been developed in the past decades generally water levels measured in an existing wellbore are the result of the combined action of aquifer pressure and wellbore effects however when facing different types of disturbance sources handling of wellbore effects is different the impact of wellbore effects on oscillating water levels remains controversial in this study we propose a general numerical model that integrates different types of harmonic disturbance sources to investigate the impact of wellbore effects on the water level oscillation the performance of the new model is evaluated by comparing the simulation results with the existing models for oscillatory pumping tests and seismic waves a sensitivity analysis is then conducted to investigate the influence of four key parameters i e the water column height hydraulic conductivity disturbance period and distance to the disturbance source the modeling shows that amplitude and phase of the oscillating water level are most sensitive to the distance to the disturbance source and to the hydraulic conductivity respectively the sensitivity analysis indicates that wellbore effects are relatively insensitive to the distance of the disturbance source the increase of disturbance period significantly weakens the influence of the wellbore effects on the oscillating water levels the wellbore effects are manifested with the increase of the water column height therefore we suggest to consider wellbore effects in oscillatory pumping tests especially in deep observation wells disturbed by short period sources keywords oscillatory water level response harmonic aquifer disturbance wellbore effects well aquifer modelling parameter sensitivity 1 introduction periodic water level fluctuations are often observed in groundwater wells where an aquifer is perturbed by harmonic pressure caused by different disturbance sources such as tide seismic waves or oscillatory pumping tests to date measured oscillating water levels have been extensively utilized for reservoir characterization including hydraulic transmissivity ferris 1952 hsieh et al 1987 permeability change after an earthquake elkhoury et al 2006 montgomery manga 2003 shi et al 2015 and compressibility changes dean et al 1994 the measured oscillatory signal can be separated into several weak signals of known frequencies by spectral analysis even when the signal is induced by different sources this advantage has extended the range of applications for oscillatory signals for instance recently the oscillatory hydraulic tomography has been employed to characterize aquifer heterogeneity cardiff et al 2020 fischer et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 generally four types of disturbance sources may yield oscillating water levels in groundwater wells i e seismic waves earth tide ocean tide and oscillatory pumping when far field seismic waves are only considered the sources of seismic waves and earth tide can be classified into the same category as volumetric strain vs source this is because the mechanism of water level oscillations induced by far field seismic waves and earth tide are similar groundwater flow in the wellbore is triggered by the elastic volumetric strain of the aquifer correspondingly ocean tide and oscillatory pumping can be classified into another category of pressure diffusion pd source where water level oscillations are solely attributed to the pore pressure diffusion process in aquifers a number of mathematical models have been developed to interpret measured oscillatory water levels for the vs sources cooper et al 1965 proposed a well aquifer coupling model to investigate water level response to seismic waves considering the momentum mechanism for the water column in the well casing bredehoeft 1967 further expanded this model to be applicable for the case of earth tide to remove some of the assumptions from cooper et al 1965 similar models were developed hsieh et al 1987 kipp 1985 liu et al 1989 van der kamp 1976 following hsieh et al 1987 wang et al 2018 introduced a new model for unconfined aquifers targeting the earth tide source and gao et al 2020 further improved their model by considering skin and wellbore effects in these models the complicated fluid solid interaction of the volumetric strain and the porewater pressure in an aquifer is simplified into a pure hydraulic issue by assigning a harmonic pressure disturbance immediately outside the wellbore screen the models developed to study the vs source commonly consider the momentum mechanism in the well casing however they are not suitable for the pd source as the distance between the source and the observation well is ignored for the pd source carr and van der kamp 1969 proposed a groundwater level oscillation model for a confined aquifer disturbed by ocean tide in which the time lag induced by wellbore effects was taken into account since then wellbore effects are rarely considered in other ocean tide source models water levels in the wellbore are usually viewed as an equivalence to the groundwater levels in the aquifer guo et al 2010 jiao tang 1999 li jiao 2001 townley 1995 trefry bekele 2004 this approximation also occurs in analyzing water levels observed in oscillatory pumping tests kuo 1972 conducted a theoretical study to characterize a petroleum reservoir using oscillatory testing while neglecting the wellbore effects ignoring wellbore effects was then inherited in the most of subsequent studies including the conventional periodical pumping test and the oscillatory hydraulic tomography black and kipp 1981 cardiff et al 2013 rabinovich et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2003 renner messar 2006 summarizing in contrast to vs sources models developed for pd sources typically ignored the wellbore effects therefore the influence of wellbore effects on the oscillating water levels remains uncertain regarding different types of sources in fact regardless of the type of disturbance sources water level oscillation reflects the process of reestablishing a balance between the water level in a wellbore and porewater pressure in an aquifer pressure propagation from the source to the oscillating water level consists of two parts i e pressure diffusion in the aquifer and in the wellbore as illustrated in fig 1 water level oscillation is not only driven by aquifer pressure but also affected by wellbore effects including wellbore storage water column inertia and well wall friction butler and zhan 2004 liu et al 2020 due to the inertial effects the amplitude of the well water level can be either smaller or larger than the amplitude of the driving aquifer pressure independent on the properties of the aquifer wellbore storage and well wall friction typically reduce the amplitude of the well water level and delay the phase especially in deep wells therefore water level oscillation is essentially affected by the reservoir properties wellbore effects and even the properties of the disturbance e g cooper et al 1965 huang et al 2018 and gao et al 2020 the relationship between water level oscillation and aquifer properties is the theoretical basis for estimating hydraulic parameters from oscillatory water levels ignoring wellbore effects for different disturbance sources may result in poor parameter estimations for instance by comparing aquifer parameters inferred from hydraulic testing earth tide and earthquake zhang et al 2019 pointed out that the uncertainty introduced by different assumptions of the models is the main reason for parameter estimation errors therefore it is crucial to figure out when it is necessary to consider wellbore effects and how sensitive the water level oscillations are to the involved parameters e g the water column height hydraulic conductivity disturbance period and distance to the disturbance source in this study a general numerical model that integrates different types of disturbance sources and that takes the wellbore effects into account is established for simulating water level response to harmonic disturbance in a confined aquifer to examine the performance of the new model two scenarios for oscillatory pumping tests and seismic waves are considered and the simulation results are compared with the cardiff et al 2013 model as well as the cooper et al 1965 model respectively afterward a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of four key parameters i e the water column height hydraulic conductivity disturbance period and distance to the disturbance source the impact of wellbore effects on water level oscillation is estimated through sensitivity analysis on these four parameters 2 methodology 2 1 problem statement as shown in fig 2 the disturbance propagating from the sources to the groundwater in an observation well is inevitably subjected to the properties of the subsurface and of the well conversely in order to interpret the measured oscillatory well water levels wellbore effects must also be fully considered unless their impact is so low that they can be ignored however the criteria to define the situation in which wellbore effects should not be neglected are ambiguous a general model that can uniformly consider various types of sources and wellbore effects is lacking in this study as stated above four common disturbance sources i e seismic waves earth tide ocean tide and oscillatory pumping are investigated table 1 lists the differences between the four sources considering three aspects maximum amplitude a 0 period t 0 and the imposed distance d of the disturbance from the perspective of a 0 the amplitude induced by seismic waves can be much larger than that by the other sources the difference in t 0 is also evident the time periods of ocean tide and earth tide are consistent and fixed to 12 h due to the gravitational effects by the moon and sun gao et al 2020 the t 0 induced by seismic waves is typically varying from several seconds to minutes and the variation range of t 0 is flexible for the oscillatory pumping source the distance d is commonly several hundred meters between the pumping and observational wells and it can be several kilometers when observing the ocean tide in a monitoring well for the cases of earth tide and far field seismic waves the imposed distance is set to close proximity of the wellbore screen due to the effect of volume strain although the actual distance between the source and wellbore is quite far finally although the pressure signals caused by various sources are different they can all be described mathematically in the form of trigonometric functions 2 2 governing equations of a well aquifer system a 3d coupling model is conceptualized in fig 3 to illustrate the harmonic disturbance propagation in a well aquifer system a partial penetrating well with a radius r w is installed in the confined aquifer with a thickness of b the length of the well screen is l s the water column height defined from top of the screen to the static water table is denoted by h w a harmonic pressure disturbance with an amplitude of a 0 and a period of t 0 is imposed at a horizontal distance of d away from the well the hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage s s in the aquifer are homogeneous and isotropic we assumed that the tangential velocity in the well is negligible and groundwater flow can be treated as 2 d axisymmetric the fluid movement within the wellbore can be described by the navier stokes equation mcelwee zenner 1998 1 v z t v r v z r v z v z z g 1 ρ p z μ ρ 2 v z 8 μ v z r 2 where v z and v r are the vertical and radial flow rate of groundwater in the wellbore t represents the time g denotes the acceleration by gravity and p denotes the pressure the density and dynamic viscosity of water are represented by ρ and μ following poiseuille s law butler and zhan 2004 the last term in the right side of eq 1 is the linear head loss caused by frictions on the well wall the groundwater flow in a confined aquifer follows darcy s law as 2 s s h x t t k h x t q where x is a vector of spatial coordinates h x t is the transient groundwater head and q is the hydraulic source 2 3 disturbance sources according to the loading mechanism as stated above four disturbance sources are classified into two categories i e vs source and pd source due to the difference in the way of loading oscillatory pumping and ocean tide stress can be further treated as a line pd source and surface pd source respectively which are illustrated in fig 3 2 3 1 line pd source for a oscillatory pumping well a harmonic volume flow rate q w considering the ramp up period is often assigned as cardiff et al 2013 3a q w q 0 cos 2 π t 0 t 1 e t t 0 where q 0 denotes the peak volume flow rate the imposed location of this line flux boundary condition is dependent on the real horizontal distance d between the pumping well and observation well fig 3 2 3 2 surface pd source the ocean tide source is usually represented by a harmonic pressure p d with a sinusoidal form 3b p d a 0 sin 2 π t 0 t where a 0 is the peak pressure of the disturbance source as shown in fig 3 this surface pressure boundary condition is imposed on the right side if needed it can be easily replaced with the topography of land ocean interface 2 3 3 vs source for the vs source the disturbed harmonic pressure can also be described by the eq 3b unlike the surface pd source this harmonic pressure is distributed on the whole aquifer domain as a background field thus the pressure change in aquifer domain is a superposition of the background harmonic pressure and the aquifer pressure fluctuation caused merely by the oscillating water level in the well which can be described as 3c p s a 0 sin 2 π t 0 t ρ g h r w t this superimposed pressure p s is then directly imposed on the well screen fig 3 2 4 initial and boundary conditions the boundary of water level oscillating in the observation well is a free moving boundary γ w in which the surface motion is driven by the momentum of the water column for tracing the moving boundary in the model the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is employed which has been successfully applied in catching the water level jin et al 2014 liu et al 2020 based on this method and ignoring the effect of atmospheric pressure changes the free moving boundary γ w can be defined with a moving rate u as u v z on γ w 4 to couple navier stokes flow and darcy flow on the well screen boundary γ c the continuity conditions of pressure and normal velocity are adopted p ρ g h z on γ c 5 v r k h φ on γ c 6 where φ is porosity and z is the depth below the static groundwater table moreover the top and bottom boundaries γ t and γ b in conceptual model fig 3 are treated as no flow boundaries and the remaining outer boundaries are designated as constant head boundary the numerical implementation of the mathematical model is realized by using the finite element software comsol multiphysics 2012 the darcy s law and free and porous media flow modules are utilized to simulate groundwater flow within the aquifer and the wellbore respectively to keep the stabilization in solving the navier stokes equation the streamline and crosswind diffusion methods are adopted the moving mesh module is employed to trace the water level oscillation on the free moving boundary γ w variables can be fully coupled between the two different physical domains through the boundary conditions specified on the well screen boundary γ c 3 model comparison the performance of the new model is tested by comparing the results with those of the cardiff et al 2013 model and the cooper et al 1965 model which were proposed with respect to oscillatory pumping source and seismic wave source respectively the main discrepancy among these two models is whether to consider the wellbore effects wellbore effects are included in the cooper model regarding the vs sources while excluded in the cardiff model for the cases of line pd sources note that models for vs sources are not suitable for pd sources because the disturbance sources can only be applied on the wellbore screen 3 1 model performance compared with the cardiff model cardiff et al 2013 developed a transient model for investigating water table response in an aquifer to a harmonic disturbance induced by oscillatory pumping even though some efficient analytical solutions for the steady periodic disturbance are proposed cardiff barrash 2015 dagan rabinovich 2014 the numerical solution is adopted in this study because the numerical solution can flexibly deal with different types of disturbance sources such as the line and surface pd sources and it can consider the transient aquifer response at early times the cardiff model fully considers head changes induced by the harmonic disturbance at different locations in the aquifer but ignores the wellbore effects by treating the wellbores as observation points or lines in cardiff et al 2013 a depth averaged homogenous aquifer with horizontal confining layers is assumed to be a 2 d model the governing equation is expressed as 7 s h t t h q w where s and t denote the storativity and transmissivity of aquifers respectively the pumping well is represented as a line pd source with an oscillatory pumping rate q w defined as eq 3a the cardiff model can be numerically solved by using the comsol model e g the model given by cardiff et al 2013 similar to the scenario presented in cardiff et al 2013 an oscillatory pumping test is conducted in a confined aquifer fig 4 illustrates the scenario settings under a line pd source and validation of head changes between the proposed new model and the cardiff model at three observation points the parameter values are listed in table a1 compared to the cardiff model the new model is built in 3 d and a fully penetrating observation well is installed to consider the wellbore effects in order to verify the head changes in the aquifer three observation points obs1 obs2 obs3 are arranged in the new model at the locations of 2 m 4 m and 8 m away from the line source fig 4a when the time period of the disturbance source is 10 s the periodic transient state solutions calculated by the new model and the cardiff model at the three observation points are compared in fig 4b the results show that the head changes calculated by these two models are in good agreement at each observation point additionally boundary effects from the upper and lower boundary are insignificant in the new 3d model it implies that the differences between the two models if any can only be related to the wellbore effects in the observation well owing to the water column inertia the period of the disturbance is proved to have a significant impact on the water level response particularly when the disturbance period is lower than 50 s cooper et al 1965 according to cardiff et al 2013 a stable water level oscillation can be reached after 5 periods thus three periods 40 s 20 s and 10 s are adopted all simulations are operated for 5 periods and the results are depicted in fig 5 the difference between water levels calculated by the new model and the cardiff model is minor when the disturbance period is set to 40 s evident in fig 5a however the calculated water levels differ as the period time decreases i e with increase of frequency the amplitude calculated by the new model is more attenuated and the phase is more lagged comparing to those of the cardiff model manifesting the influence of wellbore effects when the water column is forced to oscillate at a high frequency the amplitude can be attenuated according to the conservation of momentum this phenomenon is consistent with the law of mechanical vibration cooper et al 1965 established a relationship between the disturbance period and the amplitude of water level oscillation the water level amplitude decreases with the decrease of period time which is consistent with the results of the new model the comparison shows that wellbore effects may lead to the amplitude attenuation and phase lag of water level 3 2 model performance compared with the cooper model the model of cooper et al 1965 is among classic and representative models widely used for simulating the water level response to the seismic waves sun et al 2018 xiang et al 2019 this model considers the momentum mechanism in the wellbore casing and it implies three assumptions 1 the water level oscillation should be much smaller than the water column height 2 frictions on the well wall and the inner fluid is neglected i e dynamic viscosity and 3 the phase shift between water level and its induced aquifer pressure fluctuation is constant and set to be π 2 in the cooper model the water level w in wellbore is derived by cooper et al 1965 8 d 2 w d t 2 g h e x s m a 0 ρ h e s i n 2 π t 0 t η where h e represents the effective column height and equals h w 3 l s 8 η is the phase angle between disturbance source and the induced water level oscillation s m is the drawdown caused by the oscillating water level at the midpoint of the well screen according to the theis equation and duhamel s formula the drawdown s m can be expressed as cooper et al 1965 9 s m r w 2 2 t dw dt k e r α w 2 π w t 0 k e i α w where k e r and k e i are the real and imaginary part of kelvin function respectively which is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order zero and α w r w 2 π s t 0 t 1 2 these equations can be solved through numerical iteration the corresponding numerical calculation code was developed and can be found in the supplementary material water level oscillations are simulated under the disturbance of a vs source by the new model and the cooper model scenario settings are similar to that of the line pd source cases introduced in section 3 1 the conceptual model and head changes in the aquifer and wellbore simulated by the new model at the simulation time of 2 5 s are illustrated in fig 6 parameter values are listed in table a1 due to the first assumption of the cooper model that the water level oscillation should be much smaller 1 than the water column height the water column height is thus elongated to 50 m a fully penetrating well is installed in a 50 m deep confined aquifer fig 6a a sinusoidal pressure disturbance described by eq 3c is imposed on the well screen to fit the vs source condition in fig 6b it shows that the head changes around the well screen are continuous and the head changes in aquifer mainly appears at the vicinity of wellbore all simulations are operated for 5 periods and the calculated water levels are shown in fig 7 the comparison result shows a good agreement between the calculated water levels from the new model and the cooper model for the disturbance period of 40 s as evident in fig 7b with decreasing the period to 20 s the maximum amplitude of cooper model is slightly amplified this trend reverses with the further decrease of the period time fig 7c in these cases the amplitude calculated by the new model is clearly smaller than that of the cooper model the phase of the new model is lagged toward the cooper model when the period time is 20 s while it is advanced when the period is 10 s the amplitude attenuation of the new model can be attributed to two reasons 1 the frictions on the well wall and within the fluid considered in the new model as evident from eq 1 i e the faster the oscillation is the greater the frictional effects could be 2 is related to the third assumption of the cooper model which is commonly applied in solid vibration mechanics but limitedly matching in wellbore hydraulics according to poiseuille s law pressure loss and phase shift occur when the newtonian fluid flows oscillating in a long cylindrical pipe the phase shift should not be constant with the changes in water column height and period of disturbance therefore the third assumption further produces errors in amplitude calculations to eliminate the errors some corrections for the amplitude and phase have been proposed in early studies carr van der kamp 1969 hvorslev 1951 thus besides the friction in the wellbore the phase shift that is between water level and induced aquifer pressure should be flexibly adjusted according to the momentum mechanism in the well 4 parameter sensitivity 4 1 numerical tests apart from the disturbance period the performance of the new model is subjected to many other parameters fig 3 shows that there are nine influencing parameters that can be divided into three types i e wellbore geometry aquifer characteristics and disturbance source properties the water column height h w hydraulic conductivity k and disturbance period a 0 have been proven to have significant influence on the amplitude of the water level oscillation cooper et al 1965 but the impact of these parameters on the phase shift of water level have not yet been discussed furthermore distance of the disturbance source d is another important parameter that may lead to strong amplitude attenuation and phase lag guo et al 2010 yang et al 2020 these four parameters i e h w k a 0 and d are therefore selected for the sensitivity analysis in order to examine the influence of the four parameters a model disturbed by a line pd source is selected based on the aquifer settings described in section 3 1 the values of the four key parameters are varied as listed in table 2 adopting one at a time oat approach in analyzing the influence of each key parameter a total of 28 numerical tests are conducted although the oat approach does not explore all the possible combination of input parameters it is a computationally cheap approach which provides relevant information with exposing the independent importance of each parameter 4 2 sensitivity analysis according to the spectrum method 28 modeled water levels can be transformed into a specific amplitude and phase dataset using the fast fourier transform fft the amplitude and phase results of all simulations are summarized in fig 8 the top row represents the amplitude results with respect to the four parameters i e h w k t 0 and d and the bottom row illustrates the phase results of these parameters fig 8a and e show that the amplitude slightly decreases with the increase of h w and the phase is gradually lagged behind until it stabilizes this indicates that the large water column height damped the water level oscillation fig 8b and f illustrate the impact of hydraulic conductivity k on the amplitude and phase of water level with decreasing k the amplitude experiences an increase at the early stage and then drops down this is because the observation well acts as a pressure relief channel in the aquifer at early stage while this effect is gradually subjected to the low k of the aquifer at later stage until it vanishes a lower k means that longer time is required for pressure diffusion within the aquifer in fig 8c and g the impact of the disturbance period t 0 is demonstrated which shows the same influences on the amplitude and the phase at early stage the phase and amplitude increase rapidly with the increase of the period and increase gradually when the periods are larger than 10 s these results are consistent with the result of the forced over damped vibration fig 8d and h display the impact of distance of disturbance source d on the amplitude and phase of water level oscillation with increasing d the amplitude decreases exponentially and the phase experiences a linear decrease 4 3 impact of wellbore effects on water level oscillation the impact of wellbore effects on the water level oscillations is of particular importance for instance large values of h w lead to an evident amplitude attenuation and phase lag while wellbore effects almost vanish with increasing d in order to understand the influence of wellbore effects an analysis is carried out using the new model and the cardiff model representing the models with and without wellbore effects based on parameter values presented in table 2 additional 28 numerical tests using the cardiff model are conducted after the fft transformation the maximum amplitudes of water level calculated by the new model and by the cardiff model denote as a n and a c respectively and the corresponding phases are represented as p n and p c to quantify the impact of wellbore effects an amplitude ratio a and phase shift p are defined 10 a a n a c 11 p p n p c the influence of wellbore effects on amplitude ratio and phase shift with the variation of h w k t 0 and d is illustrated in fig 9 fig 9a and e show the effects of water column height on the amplitude ratio and the phase shift it is indicated that wellbore effects lead to a significant amplitude attenuation and phase lag as h w increases note that for the cardiff model the maximum amplitude a c and phase p c will not be affected by changes of h w because groundwater movement within the wellbore is ignored fig 9b and f manifest the importance of wellbore effects with the variation of k the amplification factor increases with increasing k and may become larger than 1 when k is higher than 1 10 3 m s this means that the amplitude can be amplified in a highly permeable aquifer the phase lag is reduced with the increase of k and a phase advance is observed when k is larger than 3 10 3 m s the impact of wellbore effects with the increase of t 0 is shown in fig 9c and g the variation trends of a and p in fig 9c and g are similar to those in fig 8c and g it implies that wellbore effects dominate the influence of t 0 on water level response this is because the influence of t 0 primarily manifests in the pure fluid by means of water column inertia and vanishes within the aquifer fig 9d and h show the variation of a and p with increasing d it is indicated that wellbore effects have relatively minor influence on the water level oscillation by varying d the reason is that the increase of d merely affects the aquifer pressure penetrating near the observation well which is not directly related to the groundwater flow in the wellbore therefore the influence of the wellbore effects on the oscillating water level is more significant for h w k and t 0 5 discussion the sensitivity analysis of all key parameters on amplitude and phase of the water level oscillation e g fig 8 indicates that a more reasonable interpretation of measured water level data can be obtained when these parameters are included in the parameter estimation framework however it is challenging to derive an analytical solution for the inversion framework due to the high nonlinearity of the momentum equation of the wellbore flow this obstacle led to the development of different approximation models for specific sources and application scenarios models for oscillatory pumping tests generally ignore wellbore effects the oscillatory pumping tests have a variety of applications for instance the disturbance period can be manually adjusted to a wide range and the pumping test can be applied in shallow or deep aquifers cardiff et al 2020 fischer et al 2018 however figs 8 and 9 illustrate that the significance of h w on the amplitude and phase of water level oscillation is evident when the observation well is installed in a deep aquifer ca 50 m the influence of t 0 should not be ignored especially when the disturbance period is short wellbore effects are also typically ignored in models developed for ocean tides the period is fixed at the mean ocean tide period of ca 12 5 h additionally the location of observation wells is generally set several hundred meters or kilometers away from the coast line trglavcnik et al 2018 yang et al 2020 according to figs 8 and 9 the influence of wellbore effects on water level oscillation gradually vanishes with the increase of t 0 and d thus the wellbore effects can be ignored in interpreting water level oscillations induced by ocean tide for the vs source i e seismic waves and earth tide the existing models usually incorporate inertia mechanism and wellbore storage in the well casing according to results shown in fig 7 frictions in wellbore according to poiseuille s law can lead to an evident amplitude attenuation and phase lag the aquifer parameters may be underestimated when ignoring this effect although the main focus of this study is on the wellbore effects the proposed model can be applied to investigate skin effects or aquifer heterogeneity that may also significantly influence the water level response to harmonic disturbance gao et al 2020 water level response will in fact be affected by many parameters according to the result by cardiff et al 2013 and by cooper et al 1965 four parameters are selected for the sensitivity analysis in this study the method employed here is the one at a time approach which makes the influencing trend more distinct and visible for each parameter further work on more parameters of the well aquifer system and on additional disturbance sources is needed the joint influence of parameters on well water level oscillations is complicated and should be specifically analyzed 6 conclusions in this study a numerical model for water level response to harmonic disturbances is established the model considers wellbore effects including wellbore storage water column inertia and frictions within the wellbore the performance of the model is examined by comparing the results calculated by the models proposed by cardiff et al 2013 and cooper et al 1965 regarding oscillatory pumping tests and seismic waves respectively afterwards four key parameters i e water column height h w hydraulic conductivity k disturbance period t 0 and distance of the disturbance source d are selected for conducting a sensitivity analysis it can be concluded that including inertial effect in the wellbore and well wall friction have a significant influence on water level oscillation with respect to both amplitude and phase especially when the disturbance sources are at a short period and a deep borehole is installed in an aquifer with high k all four key parameters have significant impacts on the amplitude and the phase of water level oscillations the amplitude is more sensitive to d while the phase is more sensitive to k by comparing the results of the new model and of the cardiff model i e results with and without considering wellbore effects it is concluded that wellbore effects are relatively insensitive to d larger t 0 larger than 50 s greatly weaken the influence of wellbore effects on water level oscillation wellbore effects are manifested with an increase of h w and wellbore effects are sensitive to a variation of k if greater than 1 10 5 m s the findings of this work may contribute to a more accurate evaluation of oscillatory pumping tests and other relevant aquifer parameter estimation procedures with an adapted design of monitoring wells parameter estimation errors caused by parameter sensitivity may also be avoided overall considering wellbore effects and their influence on the amplitude and the phase of well water level oscillations may lead to an improved inverse characterization of aquifer properties

3396,oscillatory water levels are often observed in groundwater wells when the aquifer is perturbed by harmonic disturbances such as oscillatory pumping tide and seismic waves to interpret the measured water levels numerous models have been developed in the past decades generally water levels measured in an existing wellbore are the result of the combined action of aquifer pressure and wellbore effects however when facing different types of disturbance sources handling of wellbore effects is different the impact of wellbore effects on oscillating water levels remains controversial in this study we propose a general numerical model that integrates different types of harmonic disturbance sources to investigate the impact of wellbore effects on the water level oscillation the performance of the new model is evaluated by comparing the simulation results with the existing models for oscillatory pumping tests and seismic waves a sensitivity analysis is then conducted to investigate the influence of four key parameters i e the water column height hydraulic conductivity disturbance period and distance to the disturbance source the modeling shows that amplitude and phase of the oscillating water level are most sensitive to the distance to the disturbance source and to the hydraulic conductivity respectively the sensitivity analysis indicates that wellbore effects are relatively insensitive to the distance of the disturbance source the increase of disturbance period significantly weakens the influence of the wellbore effects on the oscillating water levels the wellbore effects are manifested with the increase of the water column height therefore we suggest to consider wellbore effects in oscillatory pumping tests especially in deep observation wells disturbed by short period sources keywords oscillatory water level response harmonic aquifer disturbance wellbore effects well aquifer modelling parameter sensitivity 1 introduction periodic water level fluctuations are often observed in groundwater wells where an aquifer is perturbed by harmonic pressure caused by different disturbance sources such as tide seismic waves or oscillatory pumping tests to date measured oscillating water levels have been extensively utilized for reservoir characterization including hydraulic transmissivity ferris 1952 hsieh et al 1987 permeability change after an earthquake elkhoury et al 2006 montgomery manga 2003 shi et al 2015 and compressibility changes dean et al 1994 the measured oscillatory signal can be separated into several weak signals of known frequencies by spectral analysis even when the signal is induced by different sources this advantage has extended the range of applications for oscillatory signals for instance recently the oscillatory hydraulic tomography has been employed to characterize aquifer heterogeneity cardiff et al 2020 fischer et al 2018 zhou et al 2016 generally four types of disturbance sources may yield oscillating water levels in groundwater wells i e seismic waves earth tide ocean tide and oscillatory pumping when far field seismic waves are only considered the sources of seismic waves and earth tide can be classified into the same category as volumetric strain vs source this is because the mechanism of water level oscillations induced by far field seismic waves and earth tide are similar groundwater flow in the wellbore is triggered by the elastic volumetric strain of the aquifer correspondingly ocean tide and oscillatory pumping can be classified into another category of pressure diffusion pd source where water level oscillations are solely attributed to the pore pressure diffusion process in aquifers a number of mathematical models have been developed to interpret measured oscillatory water levels for the vs sources cooper et al 1965 proposed a well aquifer coupling model to investigate water level response to seismic waves considering the momentum mechanism for the water column in the well casing bredehoeft 1967 further expanded this model to be applicable for the case of earth tide to remove some of the assumptions from cooper et al 1965 similar models were developed hsieh et al 1987 kipp 1985 liu et al 1989 van der kamp 1976 following hsieh et al 1987 wang et al 2018 introduced a new model for unconfined aquifers targeting the earth tide source and gao et al 2020 further improved their model by considering skin and wellbore effects in these models the complicated fluid solid interaction of the volumetric strain and the porewater pressure in an aquifer is simplified into a pure hydraulic issue by assigning a harmonic pressure disturbance immediately outside the wellbore screen the models developed to study the vs source commonly consider the momentum mechanism in the well casing however they are not suitable for the pd source as the distance between the source and the observation well is ignored for the pd source carr and van der kamp 1969 proposed a groundwater level oscillation model for a confined aquifer disturbed by ocean tide in which the time lag induced by wellbore effects was taken into account since then wellbore effects are rarely considered in other ocean tide source models water levels in the wellbore are usually viewed as an equivalence to the groundwater levels in the aquifer guo et al 2010 jiao tang 1999 li jiao 2001 townley 1995 trefry bekele 2004 this approximation also occurs in analyzing water levels observed in oscillatory pumping tests kuo 1972 conducted a theoretical study to characterize a petroleum reservoir using oscillatory testing while neglecting the wellbore effects ignoring wellbore effects was then inherited in the most of subsequent studies including the conventional periodical pumping test and the oscillatory hydraulic tomography black and kipp 1981 cardiff et al 2013 rabinovich et al 2015 rasmussen et al 2003 renner messar 2006 summarizing in contrast to vs sources models developed for pd sources typically ignored the wellbore effects therefore the influence of wellbore effects on the oscillating water levels remains uncertain regarding different types of sources in fact regardless of the type of disturbance sources water level oscillation reflects the process of reestablishing a balance between the water level in a wellbore and porewater pressure in an aquifer pressure propagation from the source to the oscillating water level consists of two parts i e pressure diffusion in the aquifer and in the wellbore as illustrated in fig 1 water level oscillation is not only driven by aquifer pressure but also affected by wellbore effects including wellbore storage water column inertia and well wall friction butler and zhan 2004 liu et al 2020 due to the inertial effects the amplitude of the well water level can be either smaller or larger than the amplitude of the driving aquifer pressure independent on the properties of the aquifer wellbore storage and well wall friction typically reduce the amplitude of the well water level and delay the phase especially in deep wells therefore water level oscillation is essentially affected by the reservoir properties wellbore effects and even the properties of the disturbance e g cooper et al 1965 huang et al 2018 and gao et al 2020 the relationship between water level oscillation and aquifer properties is the theoretical basis for estimating hydraulic parameters from oscillatory water levels ignoring wellbore effects for different disturbance sources may result in poor parameter estimations for instance by comparing aquifer parameters inferred from hydraulic testing earth tide and earthquake zhang et al 2019 pointed out that the uncertainty introduced by different assumptions of the models is the main reason for parameter estimation errors therefore it is crucial to figure out when it is necessary to consider wellbore effects and how sensitive the water level oscillations are to the involved parameters e g the water column height hydraulic conductivity disturbance period and distance to the disturbance source in this study a general numerical model that integrates different types of disturbance sources and that takes the wellbore effects into account is established for simulating water level response to harmonic disturbance in a confined aquifer to examine the performance of the new model two scenarios for oscillatory pumping tests and seismic waves are considered and the simulation results are compared with the cardiff et al 2013 model as well as the cooper et al 1965 model respectively afterward a sensitivity analysis is conducted to investigate the influence of four key parameters i e the water column height hydraulic conductivity disturbance period and distance to the disturbance source the impact of wellbore effects on water level oscillation is estimated through sensitivity analysis on these four parameters 2 methodology 2 1 problem statement as shown in fig 2 the disturbance propagating from the sources to the groundwater in an observation well is inevitably subjected to the properties of the subsurface and of the well conversely in order to interpret the measured oscillatory well water levels wellbore effects must also be fully considered unless their impact is so low that they can be ignored however the criteria to define the situation in which wellbore effects should not be neglected are ambiguous a general model that can uniformly consider various types of sources and wellbore effects is lacking in this study as stated above four common disturbance sources i e seismic waves earth tide ocean tide and oscillatory pumping are investigated table 1 lists the differences between the four sources considering three aspects maximum amplitude a 0 period t 0 and the imposed distance d of the disturbance from the perspective of a 0 the amplitude induced by seismic waves can be much larger than that by the other sources the difference in t 0 is also evident the time periods of ocean tide and earth tide are consistent and fixed to 12 h due to the gravitational effects by the moon and sun gao et al 2020 the t 0 induced by seismic waves is typically varying from several seconds to minutes and the variation range of t 0 is flexible for the oscillatory pumping source the distance d is commonly several hundred meters between the pumping and observational wells and it can be several kilometers when observing the ocean tide in a monitoring well for the cases of earth tide and far field seismic waves the imposed distance is set to close proximity of the wellbore screen due to the effect of volume strain although the actual distance between the source and wellbore is quite far finally although the pressure signals caused by various sources are different they can all be described mathematically in the form of trigonometric functions 2 2 governing equations of a well aquifer system a 3d coupling model is conceptualized in fig 3 to illustrate the harmonic disturbance propagation in a well aquifer system a partial penetrating well with a radius r w is installed in the confined aquifer with a thickness of b the length of the well screen is l s the water column height defined from top of the screen to the static water table is denoted by h w a harmonic pressure disturbance with an amplitude of a 0 and a period of t 0 is imposed at a horizontal distance of d away from the well the hydraulic conductivity k and specific storage s s in the aquifer are homogeneous and isotropic we assumed that the tangential velocity in the well is negligible and groundwater flow can be treated as 2 d axisymmetric the fluid movement within the wellbore can be described by the navier stokes equation mcelwee zenner 1998 1 v z t v r v z r v z v z z g 1 ρ p z μ ρ 2 v z 8 μ v z r 2 where v z and v r are the vertical and radial flow rate of groundwater in the wellbore t represents the time g denotes the acceleration by gravity and p denotes the pressure the density and dynamic viscosity of water are represented by ρ and μ following poiseuille s law butler and zhan 2004 the last term in the right side of eq 1 is the linear head loss caused by frictions on the well wall the groundwater flow in a confined aquifer follows darcy s law as 2 s s h x t t k h x t q where x is a vector of spatial coordinates h x t is the transient groundwater head and q is the hydraulic source 2 3 disturbance sources according to the loading mechanism as stated above four disturbance sources are classified into two categories i e vs source and pd source due to the difference in the way of loading oscillatory pumping and ocean tide stress can be further treated as a line pd source and surface pd source respectively which are illustrated in fig 3 2 3 1 line pd source for a oscillatory pumping well a harmonic volume flow rate q w considering the ramp up period is often assigned as cardiff et al 2013 3a q w q 0 cos 2 π t 0 t 1 e t t 0 where q 0 denotes the peak volume flow rate the imposed location of this line flux boundary condition is dependent on the real horizontal distance d between the pumping well and observation well fig 3 2 3 2 surface pd source the ocean tide source is usually represented by a harmonic pressure p d with a sinusoidal form 3b p d a 0 sin 2 π t 0 t where a 0 is the peak pressure of the disturbance source as shown in fig 3 this surface pressure boundary condition is imposed on the right side if needed it can be easily replaced with the topography of land ocean interface 2 3 3 vs source for the vs source the disturbed harmonic pressure can also be described by the eq 3b unlike the surface pd source this harmonic pressure is distributed on the whole aquifer domain as a background field thus the pressure change in aquifer domain is a superposition of the background harmonic pressure and the aquifer pressure fluctuation caused merely by the oscillating water level in the well which can be described as 3c p s a 0 sin 2 π t 0 t ρ g h r w t this superimposed pressure p s is then directly imposed on the well screen fig 3 2 4 initial and boundary conditions the boundary of water level oscillating in the observation well is a free moving boundary γ w in which the surface motion is driven by the momentum of the water column for tracing the moving boundary in the model the arbitrary lagrangian eulerian ale method is employed which has been successfully applied in catching the water level jin et al 2014 liu et al 2020 based on this method and ignoring the effect of atmospheric pressure changes the free moving boundary γ w can be defined with a moving rate u as u v z on γ w 4 to couple navier stokes flow and darcy flow on the well screen boundary γ c the continuity conditions of pressure and normal velocity are adopted p ρ g h z on γ c 5 v r k h φ on γ c 6 where φ is porosity and z is the depth below the static groundwater table moreover the top and bottom boundaries γ t and γ b in conceptual model fig 3 are treated as no flow boundaries and the remaining outer boundaries are designated as constant head boundary the numerical implementation of the mathematical model is realized by using the finite element software comsol multiphysics 2012 the darcy s law and free and porous media flow modules are utilized to simulate groundwater flow within the aquifer and the wellbore respectively to keep the stabilization in solving the navier stokes equation the streamline and crosswind diffusion methods are adopted the moving mesh module is employed to trace the water level oscillation on the free moving boundary γ w variables can be fully coupled between the two different physical domains through the boundary conditions specified on the well screen boundary γ c 3 model comparison the performance of the new model is tested by comparing the results with those of the cardiff et al 2013 model and the cooper et al 1965 model which were proposed with respect to oscillatory pumping source and seismic wave source respectively the main discrepancy among these two models is whether to consider the wellbore effects wellbore effects are included in the cooper model regarding the vs sources while excluded in the cardiff model for the cases of line pd sources note that models for vs sources are not suitable for pd sources because the disturbance sources can only be applied on the wellbore screen 3 1 model performance compared with the cardiff model cardiff et al 2013 developed a transient model for investigating water table response in an aquifer to a harmonic disturbance induced by oscillatory pumping even though some efficient analytical solutions for the steady periodic disturbance are proposed cardiff barrash 2015 dagan rabinovich 2014 the numerical solution is adopted in this study because the numerical solution can flexibly deal with different types of disturbance sources such as the line and surface pd sources and it can consider the transient aquifer response at early times the cardiff model fully considers head changes induced by the harmonic disturbance at different locations in the aquifer but ignores the wellbore effects by treating the wellbores as observation points or lines in cardiff et al 2013 a depth averaged homogenous aquifer with horizontal confining layers is assumed to be a 2 d model the governing equation is expressed as 7 s h t t h q w where s and t denote the storativity and transmissivity of aquifers respectively the pumping well is represented as a line pd source with an oscillatory pumping rate q w defined as eq 3a the cardiff model can be numerically solved by using the comsol model e g the model given by cardiff et al 2013 similar to the scenario presented in cardiff et al 2013 an oscillatory pumping test is conducted in a confined aquifer fig 4 illustrates the scenario settings under a line pd source and validation of head changes between the proposed new model and the cardiff model at three observation points the parameter values are listed in table a1 compared to the cardiff model the new model is built in 3 d and a fully penetrating observation well is installed to consider the wellbore effects in order to verify the head changes in the aquifer three observation points obs1 obs2 obs3 are arranged in the new model at the locations of 2 m 4 m and 8 m away from the line source fig 4a when the time period of the disturbance source is 10 s the periodic transient state solutions calculated by the new model and the cardiff model at the three observation points are compared in fig 4b the results show that the head changes calculated by these two models are in good agreement at each observation point additionally boundary effects from the upper and lower boundary are insignificant in the new 3d model it implies that the differences between the two models if any can only be related to the wellbore effects in the observation well owing to the water column inertia the period of the disturbance is proved to have a significant impact on the water level response particularly when the disturbance period is lower than 50 s cooper et al 1965 according to cardiff et al 2013 a stable water level oscillation can be reached after 5 periods thus three periods 40 s 20 s and 10 s are adopted all simulations are operated for 5 periods and the results are depicted in fig 5 the difference between water levels calculated by the new model and the cardiff model is minor when the disturbance period is set to 40 s evident in fig 5a however the calculated water levels differ as the period time decreases i e with increase of frequency the amplitude calculated by the new model is more attenuated and the phase is more lagged comparing to those of the cardiff model manifesting the influence of wellbore effects when the water column is forced to oscillate at a high frequency the amplitude can be attenuated according to the conservation of momentum this phenomenon is consistent with the law of mechanical vibration cooper et al 1965 established a relationship between the disturbance period and the amplitude of water level oscillation the water level amplitude decreases with the decrease of period time which is consistent with the results of the new model the comparison shows that wellbore effects may lead to the amplitude attenuation and phase lag of water level 3 2 model performance compared with the cooper model the model of cooper et al 1965 is among classic and representative models widely used for simulating the water level response to the seismic waves sun et al 2018 xiang et al 2019 this model considers the momentum mechanism in the wellbore casing and it implies three assumptions 1 the water level oscillation should be much smaller than the water column height 2 frictions on the well wall and the inner fluid is neglected i e dynamic viscosity and 3 the phase shift between water level and its induced aquifer pressure fluctuation is constant and set to be π 2 in the cooper model the water level w in wellbore is derived by cooper et al 1965 8 d 2 w d t 2 g h e x s m a 0 ρ h e s i n 2 π t 0 t η where h e represents the effective column height and equals h w 3 l s 8 η is the phase angle between disturbance source and the induced water level oscillation s m is the drawdown caused by the oscillating water level at the midpoint of the well screen according to the theis equation and duhamel s formula the drawdown s m can be expressed as cooper et al 1965 9 s m r w 2 2 t dw dt k e r α w 2 π w t 0 k e i α w where k e r and k e i are the real and imaginary part of kelvin function respectively which is the modified bessel function of the second kind of order zero and α w r w 2 π s t 0 t 1 2 these equations can be solved through numerical iteration the corresponding numerical calculation code was developed and can be found in the supplementary material water level oscillations are simulated under the disturbance of a vs source by the new model and the cooper model scenario settings are similar to that of the line pd source cases introduced in section 3 1 the conceptual model and head changes in the aquifer and wellbore simulated by the new model at the simulation time of 2 5 s are illustrated in fig 6 parameter values are listed in table a1 due to the first assumption of the cooper model that the water level oscillation should be much smaller 1 than the water column height the water column height is thus elongated to 50 m a fully penetrating well is installed in a 50 m deep confined aquifer fig 6a a sinusoidal pressure disturbance described by eq 3c is imposed on the well screen to fit the vs source condition in fig 6b it shows that the head changes around the well screen are continuous and the head changes in aquifer mainly appears at the vicinity of wellbore all simulations are operated for 5 periods and the calculated water levels are shown in fig 7 the comparison result shows a good agreement between the calculated water levels from the new model and the cooper model for the disturbance period of 40 s as evident in fig 7b with decreasing the period to 20 s the maximum amplitude of cooper model is slightly amplified this trend reverses with the further decrease of the period time fig 7c in these cases the amplitude calculated by the new model is clearly smaller than that of the cooper model the phase of the new model is lagged toward the cooper model when the period time is 20 s while it is advanced when the period is 10 s the amplitude attenuation of the new model can be attributed to two reasons 1 the frictions on the well wall and within the fluid considered in the new model as evident from eq 1 i e the faster the oscillation is the greater the frictional effects could be 2 is related to the third assumption of the cooper model which is commonly applied in solid vibration mechanics but limitedly matching in wellbore hydraulics according to poiseuille s law pressure loss and phase shift occur when the newtonian fluid flows oscillating in a long cylindrical pipe the phase shift should not be constant with the changes in water column height and period of disturbance therefore the third assumption further produces errors in amplitude calculations to eliminate the errors some corrections for the amplitude and phase have been proposed in early studies carr van der kamp 1969 hvorslev 1951 thus besides the friction in the wellbore the phase shift that is between water level and induced aquifer pressure should be flexibly adjusted according to the momentum mechanism in the well 4 parameter sensitivity 4 1 numerical tests apart from the disturbance period the performance of the new model is subjected to many other parameters fig 3 shows that there are nine influencing parameters that can be divided into three types i e wellbore geometry aquifer characteristics and disturbance source properties the water column height h w hydraulic conductivity k and disturbance period a 0 have been proven to have significant influence on the amplitude of the water level oscillation cooper et al 1965 but the impact of these parameters on the phase shift of water level have not yet been discussed furthermore distance of the disturbance source d is another important parameter that may lead to strong amplitude attenuation and phase lag guo et al 2010 yang et al 2020 these four parameters i e h w k a 0 and d are therefore selected for the sensitivity analysis in order to examine the influence of the four parameters a model disturbed by a line pd source is selected based on the aquifer settings described in section 3 1 the values of the four key parameters are varied as listed in table 2 adopting one at a time oat approach in analyzing the influence of each key parameter a total of 28 numerical tests are conducted although the oat approach does not explore all the possible combination of input parameters it is a computationally cheap approach which provides relevant information with exposing the independent importance of each parameter 4 2 sensitivity analysis according to the spectrum method 28 modeled water levels can be transformed into a specific amplitude and phase dataset using the fast fourier transform fft the amplitude and phase results of all simulations are summarized in fig 8 the top row represents the amplitude results with respect to the four parameters i e h w k t 0 and d and the bottom row illustrates the phase results of these parameters fig 8a and e show that the amplitude slightly decreases with the increase of h w and the phase is gradually lagged behind until it stabilizes this indicates that the large water column height damped the water level oscillation fig 8b and f illustrate the impact of hydraulic conductivity k on the amplitude and phase of water level with decreasing k the amplitude experiences an increase at the early stage and then drops down this is because the observation well acts as a pressure relief channel in the aquifer at early stage while this effect is gradually subjected to the low k of the aquifer at later stage until it vanishes a lower k means that longer time is required for pressure diffusion within the aquifer in fig 8c and g the impact of the disturbance period t 0 is demonstrated which shows the same influences on the amplitude and the phase at early stage the phase and amplitude increase rapidly with the increase of the period and increase gradually when the periods are larger than 10 s these results are consistent with the result of the forced over damped vibration fig 8d and h display the impact of distance of disturbance source d on the amplitude and phase of water level oscillation with increasing d the amplitude decreases exponentially and the phase experiences a linear decrease 4 3 impact of wellbore effects on water level oscillation the impact of wellbore effects on the water level oscillations is of particular importance for instance large values of h w lead to an evident amplitude attenuation and phase lag while wellbore effects almost vanish with increasing d in order to understand the influence of wellbore effects an analysis is carried out using the new model and the cardiff model representing the models with and without wellbore effects based on parameter values presented in table 2 additional 28 numerical tests using the cardiff model are conducted after the fft transformation the maximum amplitudes of water level calculated by the new model and by the cardiff model denote as a n and a c respectively and the corresponding phases are represented as p n and p c to quantify the impact of wellbore effects an amplitude ratio a and phase shift p are defined 10 a a n a c 11 p p n p c the influence of wellbore effects on amplitude ratio and phase shift with the variation of h w k t 0 and d is illustrated in fig 9 fig 9a and e show the effects of water column height on the amplitude ratio and the phase shift it is indicated that wellbore effects lead to a significant amplitude attenuation and phase lag as h w increases note that for the cardiff model the maximum amplitude a c and phase p c will not be affected by changes of h w because groundwater movement within the wellbore is ignored fig 9b and f manifest the importance of wellbore effects with the variation of k the amplification factor increases with increasing k and may become larger than 1 when k is higher than 1 10 3 m s this means that the amplitude can be amplified in a highly permeable aquifer the phase lag is reduced with the increase of k and a phase advance is observed when k is larger than 3 10 3 m s the impact of wellbore effects with the increase of t 0 is shown in fig 9c and g the variation trends of a and p in fig 9c and g are similar to those in fig 8c and g it implies that wellbore effects dominate the influence of t 0 on water level response this is because the influence of t 0 primarily manifests in the pure fluid by means of water column inertia and vanishes within the aquifer fig 9d and h show the variation of a and p with increasing d it is indicated that wellbore effects have relatively minor influence on the water level oscillation by varying d the reason is that the increase of d merely affects the aquifer pressure penetrating near the observation well which is not directly related to the groundwater flow in the wellbore therefore the influence of the wellbore effects on the oscillating water level is more significant for h w k and t 0 5 discussion the sensitivity analysis of all key parameters on amplitude and phase of the water level oscillation e g fig 8 indicates that a more reasonable interpretation of measured water level data can be obtained when these parameters are included in the parameter estimation framework however it is challenging to derive an analytical solution for the inversion framework due to the high nonlinearity of the momentum equation of the wellbore flow this obstacle led to the development of different approximation models for specific sources and application scenarios models for oscillatory pumping tests generally ignore wellbore effects the oscillatory pumping tests have a variety of applications for instance the disturbance period can be manually adjusted to a wide range and the pumping test can be applied in shallow or deep aquifers cardiff et al 2020 fischer et al 2018 however figs 8 and 9 illustrate that the significance of h w on the amplitude and phase of water level oscillation is evident when the observation well is installed in a deep aquifer ca 50 m the influence of t 0 should not be ignored especially when the disturbance period is short wellbore effects are also typically ignored in models developed for ocean tides the period is fixed at the mean ocean tide period of ca 12 5 h additionally the location of observation wells is generally set several hundred meters or kilometers away from the coast line trglavcnik et al 2018 yang et al 2020 according to figs 8 and 9 the influence of wellbore effects on water level oscillation gradually vanishes with the increase of t 0 and d thus the wellbore effects can be ignored in interpreting water level oscillations induced by ocean tide for the vs source i e seismic waves and earth tide the existing models usually incorporate inertia mechanism and wellbore storage in the well casing according to results shown in fig 7 frictions in wellbore according to poiseuille s law can lead to an evident amplitude attenuation and phase lag the aquifer parameters may be underestimated when ignoring this effect although the main focus of this study is on the wellbore effects the proposed model can be applied to investigate skin effects or aquifer heterogeneity that may also significantly influence the water level response to harmonic disturbance gao et al 2020 water level response will in fact be affected by many parameters according to the result by cardiff et al 2013 and by cooper et al 1965 four parameters are selected for the sensitivity analysis in this study the method employed here is the one at a time approach which makes the influencing trend more distinct and visible for each parameter further work on more parameters of the well aquifer system and on additional disturbance sources is needed the joint influence of parameters on well water level oscillations is complicated and should be specifically analyzed 6 conclusions in this study a numerical model for water level response to harmonic disturbances is established the model considers wellbore effects including wellbore storage water column inertia and frictions within the wellbore the performance of the model is examined by comparing the results calculated by the models proposed by cardiff et al 2013 and cooper et al 1965 regarding oscillatory pumping tests and seismic waves respectively afterwards four key parameters i e water column height h w hydraulic conductivity k disturbance period t 0 and distance of the disturbance source d are selected for conducting a sensitivity analysis it can be concluded that including inertial effect in the wellbore and well wall friction have a significant influence on water level oscillation with respect to both amplitude and phase especially when the disturbance sources are at a short period and a deep borehole is installed in an aquifer with high k all four key parameters have significant impacts on the amplitude and the phase of water level oscillations the amplitude is more sensitive to d while the phase is more sensitive to k by comparing the results of the new model and of the cardiff model i e results with and without considering wellbore effects it is concluded that wellbore effects are relatively insensitive to d larger t 0 larger than 50 s greatly weaken the influence of wellbore effects on water level oscillation wellbore effects are manifested with an increase of h w and wellbore effects are sensitive to a variation of k if greater than 1 10 5 m s the findings of this work may contribute to a more accurate evaluation of oscillatory pumping tests and other relevant aquifer parameter estimation procedures with an adapted design of monitoring wells parameter estimation errors caused by parameter sensitivity may also be avoided overall considering wellbore effects and their influence on the amplitude and the phase of well water level oscillations may lead to an improved inverse characterization of aquifer properties

3397,hydrograph flashiness is a commonly used and valuable measure of hydrologic behavior calculated directly from streamflow measurements there is limited understanding of how and why flashiness varies at continental scales and within different hydroclimatic regions which can aid in predicting regional responses to an accelerating water cycle we addressed this knowledge gap by calculating a widely used metric of flashiness the richards baker flashiness index rbi for 1144 watersheds across the continental us for a ten year period using daily streamflow from usgs gages while regional studies have suggested that flashiness is organized by watershed size we show that flashiness is poorly organized by drainage area at continental scales moreover relationship strengths and directions with drainage area varied by hydroclimatic regions using a regionally based random forest analysis we show that empirical relationships between watershed characteristics and flashiness are diverse emphasizing that drivers of flashiness are likely related to regional or smaller scale features that encapsulate relationships between climate human impacts and the subsurface keywords runoff generation flashiness watersheds conus rbi 1 introduction hydrologic signatures that describe the duration frequency timing and magnitude of high and low flow periods have provided considerable insight regarding streamflow generation and routing behavior across watersheds and through time baker et al 2004 jencso mcglynn 2011 mcmillan 2020 mcmillan et al 2014 mcphillips et al 2019 tani 1997 as climate models are forecasting an acceleration of the global water cycle huntington 2006 huntington et al 2018 madakumbura et al 2019 moustakis et al 2021 precipitation inputs across much of the continental us conus have been and are anticipated to occur in fewer though more intense events myhre et al 2019 swain et al 2021 thus hydrologic signatures that specifically describe event response such as river flashiness are becoming increasingly useful for providing information regarding the impact of climate intensification on the dynamics of river systems river flashiness is a measure of how quickly and how high streamflow rises and falls in response to watershed input broadly flashiness is therefore an integrator of event dynamics e g precipitation intensity duration and antecedent conditions and watershed characteristics e g slope soil properties and land use land cover because of this the types and timing of events that generate flashy responses differ across the conus smith smith 2015 at the watershed scale it is presumed that flashier rivers generally drain areas in which water is routed quickly through hillslopes river networks or over impervious surfaces and through built infrastructure for this reason hydrographs exhibiting high flashiness are expected to occur in watersheds with more water partitioned to surface and shallow subsurface contributing areas and less to slower deeper subsurface contributing areas dwivedi et al 2019 previous work has shown that watershed size may be an important control on flashiness baker et al 2004 smith smith 2015 though small watersheds are known for exhibiting extensive variability in unit discharge gomi et al 2002 woods et al 1995 headwater catchments may also be steeper than larger higher order watersheds and therefore exhibit shallower soils characteristics that promote rapid runoff behavior mcglynn et al 2003 in contrast studies have shown that watershed properties that enhance streamflow contributions from slower deeper subsurface contributing areas are less flashy mcdonald et al 2018 while there are numerous approaches to quantifying flashiness at the watershed scale the richards baker flashiness index rbi baker et al 2004 has become one of the most commonly used indices for estimating flashiness rbi was initially used to explore spatio temporal watershed behavior in the midwestern us baker et al 2004 flashiness indices including rbi commonly compute the path length i e the distance between two consecutive streamflow values of the hydrograph within the literature rbi is widely regarded as a hydrologic signature that can provide novel information regarding the primary routing processes in watersheds booth and konrad 2017 mcmillan 2020 and is often used to measure the magnitude and rate of change of streamflow response to precipitation events to date studies that have leveraged rbi to understand controls on spatiotemporal behavior or trends have often been focused at regional scales in fact rbi was first introduced through a regional analysis of watersheds in the midwest us ranging in size from 8 5 km2 to 28 813 km2 baker et al 2004 demonstrated a size dependence associated with rbi with smaller watersheds exhibiting higher flashiness i e larger values of rbi and larger watersheds exhibiting greater flow regime stability since this initial article other studies have applied rbi to assess spatio temporal variability in watershed flashiness across regions and linked this behavior to watershed characteristics that represent partitioning between shallow and deeper contributing flowpaths holko et al 2011 mcphillips et al 2019 furthermore another study used a different flashiness metric peaks over a uniform discharge threshold 1 m2s 2km 2 per year to identify and describe the flashiest watersheds across conus smith smith 2015 by this metric the authors found the flashiest watersheds were small and in urban areas but acknowledge the use of a uniform threshold favors smaller watersheds smith smith 2015 given the wide use of descriptors of flashiness particularly rbi in hydrologic studies e g dow 2007 mcphillips et al 2019 smith smith 2015 systematic analysis of flashiness variability across hydroclimatically diverse and human impacted systems is needed in this context it is unclear if the original rbi drivers and patterns suggested by baker et al 2004 and others hold across different regions with watersheds of variable physical properties hydroclimates and land use and cover characteristics in this study we seek to address the following questions 1 which hydroclimatic regions of the conus are flashy and which display more stable hydrographs 2 are small watersheds flashier than large watersheds across the conus and or within distinct hydroclimatic regions 3 what watershed characteristics beyond or in addition to watershed size are empirically related to watershed flashiness within and between hydroclimatic regions 2 methods 2 1 site selection our analysis considers 1144 gaged watersheds across the conus fig 1 drawn from the gages ii dataset falcone 2011 we screened all gages ii watersheds to identify those with complete daily streamflow records for the 2000 to the 2009 water year streamflow observations were obtained using the dataretrieval package in r de cicco et al 2021 with watershed characteristics gathered from falcone 2011 watersheds span 1 to 25 791 km2 and nine koppen geiger climate kgc köppen 2011 zones this range in drainage area is comparable to the range in baker et al 2004 sites include those considered to be reference watersheds with minimal human impact n 924 as well as non reference sites n 220 impacted by agriculture and urban land use but largely free of upstream reservoirs and dams falcone 2011 figure s1 we applied the definition of reference watersheds as determined by falcone 2011 falcone 2011 leveraged geospatial analysis of human impacts usgs annual water data reports and visual screening at each stream gage to arrive at their classification across non reference watersheds developed land cover varies from 10 to 100 and agricultural land cover varies from 0 to 79 2 2 rbi calculation in particular we emphasize that we are examining flashiness from a lens of understanding and interpreting similarities and differences in watershed behavior we computed the unitless richards baker flashiness index rbi following rbi i 1 n q i q i 1 i 1 n q i where i is daily timesteps and q is mean daily streamflow though rbi can be used on sub daily observations we used a daily timestep to maximize data availability and to allow comparison to the original baker et al 2004 definition of the index using this equation we calculated rbi for the selected 1144 usgs gages for each water year from 2000 to 2009 we selected this period for two reasons first our analysis period corresponds to the dates of land cover information 2006 and 2011 contained within the gages ii dataset in addition we focus on a 10 year period to encapsulate variability but to avoid a longer period where trends in rbi may appear we averaged these annual values to create a mean annual rbi and also calculated the coefficient of variation cv across annual values to assess variability 2 3 random forest analysis to investigate potential drivers of changes in rbi we used a random forest model rfm random forests have been shown to be effective tools for examining relationships between watershed discharge metrics and watershed characteristics addor et al 2018 hammond et al 2021 we performed a random forest analysis using the ranger r package wright ziegler 2017 applied to mean annual rbi we initially considered 36 predictor variables including kgc zone bryant et al 2017 and 35 characteristics from the gagesii dataset falcone 2011 expected to govern spatial variability in rbi characteristics included metrics of climate e g annual average precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration watershed structure e g topography slope and aspect subsurface average sand silt and clay fractions bedrock geology natural land cover e g percentage of forested wetlands and water and anthropogenic land cover e g developed land cover agricultural land cover the suite of predictors are described in the supporting information si table 1 from this group our final selection of 19 predictors was made by serially removing numeric predictors with a correlation coefficient above 0 70 until no two parameters had a coefficient above 0 70 every dropped predictor was dropped due to a correlation with a predictor in the same group e g climate structure land cover human impacts or subsurface the only parameters that had correlations between groups were mean maximum elevation and the percentage of precipitation that fell as snow however these three parameters were all dropped due to correlations with other in group parameters the rf analysis was executed with seven tries a minimum node size of seven sites a maximum sample fraction of 80 and 500 trees we ran the same model with the same parameters on gages across the conus as well as in each kgc zone to examine relationships across the dataset we present the relative importance of predictor variables that resulted from these models relative importance is the reduction in the gini impurity the number of mischaracterized sites each time a variable is used as a node split on a tree we show individual predictors for conus and group predictor variables into four designations climate natural land cover anthropogenic land cover and watershed structure for the kgc based comparisons si table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 flashiness across the conus across 1144 gages mean annual flashiness 2000 2009 varied from 0 01 to 1 76 with 379 watersheds exhibiting relatively stable hydrographs rbi between 0 and 0 25 only a fraction of watersheds 6 4 73 gages displayed very flashy hydrographs rbi 1 these maximal values were comparable to annual rbi values for arizona watersheds from mcphillips et al 2019 and exceeded those found for midwestern watersheds in baker et al 2004 while our use of daily mean streamflow may limit the sensitivity of our analysis to sub daily events spot checks of many gages e g fig 3 b suggested the calculation was identifying flashy and non flashy watersheds calculations using instantaneous discharge measurements may offer more precision but for this conus wide 10 year study the daily calculations are likely appropriate and maximize the number of sites available for analysis the spatial distribution of mean annual rbi and the cv in annual rbi are shown in fig 2 see figure s2 and figure s3 for log transformed versions rbi values tended to be low in portions of the northwest northern midwest northeast and southeast high rbi values were associated with gages primarily in the southwestern and midwestern us as well as localized gages in mid atlantic and northeastern cities the cv of rbi used to assess variability in rbi between years was low for most sites with 81 of gages below 0 30 though gages with high variability were found throughout the conus gages with more pronounced variability were commonly located in the southwestern us 3 2 flashiness drainage area and climate despite previous work that demonstrated flashiness is inversely proportional to drainage area at regional scales baker et al 2004 mcphillips et al 2019 we found this was not true at the national scale fig 3 the relationship between flashiness and drainage area adjusted r2 0 01 at the continental scale suggests no relationship between the two while many small watersheds drainage area 100 km2 were characterized by high average flashiness rbi 1 0 we also observed several larger watersheds drainage areas between 500 and 5000 km2 exceeding this rbi value the cv of rbi was also poorly organized by drainage area though moderately sized sites 100 1000 km2 tended to exhibit the largest variability figure s4 while common wisdom would dictate that flashiness is organized by drainage area our analysis shows this is not the case at continental scales small watersheds are often colloquially described as flashy systems this likely recognizes that the continuum from a stable to a flashy hydrograph is determined by the travel time of water from receipt as precipitation to exit as streamflow through watersheds considering watershed size alone the travel times of water in small watersheds are likely to be reduced as compared to large watersheds bergstrom et al 2016 mcglynn et al 2004 however small watersheds are also known for their exceptional variability both in watershed characteristics and in hydrologic response gomi et al 2002 indeed adjacent headwater gages can display different hydrographs based on surface and subsurface properties and subsequent alterations to the pathways of water through such watersheds jencso mcglynn 2011 poff et al 2006 richardson et al 2020 at continental scales we posit instead that flashiness is primarily organized by climate when flashiness values were separated into koppen geiger climate regions fig 1b various relationships between rbi and drainage area emerged first several regions displayed no change in flashiness with watershed size these stable regions included those either in or draining mountainous areas spanning the eastern and western us dsb dfc cfb this implies that these systems receive seasonally concentrated water inputs e g seasonal precipitation snowmelt or that they are dominated by more homogeneous flowpaths in other regions flashiness decreased with watershed area these included climatic regions primarily based in the eastern us cfa dfa dfb where catchments receive precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year and the pacific northwest csb where precipitation primarily falls during winter finally in one region bsk primarily extending across the mountain west flashiness increased with watershed area this region is characterized by low total annual precipitation and high aridity and receives punctuated precipitation inputs that result in rapid short lived variability in flow and sometimes stream drying hammond et al 2021 that likely leads to flashy responses in large watersheds these findings demonstrate that relationships between drainage area and flashiness may exhibit different patterns within different climate zones these patterns likely emerge due to the interplay between precipitation behavior and hydrologic partitioning at the surface and in the subsurface this is supported by other studies that have shown that the characteristics of precipitation events can play an important role in flashiness smith smith 2015 hopkins et al 2015 3 3 the relative importance of watershed characteristics to stable and flashy hydrographs our random forest analysis revealed that climate metrics carried the highest proportion of importance at the national scale fig 4 this finding is in line with several other studies that have concluded watershed climate is the primary characteristic that organizes many metrics of watershed response this includes the relative contribution of baseflow gnann et al 2019 gnann et al 2020 the fraction of time a stream is flowing hammond et al 2021 as well as investigations that have shown climate organizes suites of different hydrologic signatures addor et al 2018 mcmillan 2020 and hydrographs at national to global scales knoben et al 2018 within six of the nine sub regions all within the western us climate metrics represented the highest proportion of importance across the top predictors identified by random forest models fig 4 this suggests that even within climatically similar regions annual air temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration still empirically explain variability in watershed flashiness our analysis points to climate especially as determined by total precipitation as a primary control on watershed flashiness and variations in flashiness with drainage area for example in western us watersheds with low total precipitation bsk fig 1 smaller watersheds exhibited reduced flashiness while larger watersheds had some of the highest rbi values observed across the conus this runs counter to the original rbi study by baker et al 2004 which showed that rbi decreases with watershed area and suggests that in some regions the accumulation of contributing surface and shallow subsurface flowpaths with increasing watershed area may dictate hydrograph behavior to a greater extent than contributions from deeper contributing flowpaths that may buffer flashiness while we quantify climate as an input variable to our analysis as long term average values we acknowledge that examining characteristics of precipitation particularly intensity and the number of high intensity events may also yield greater insight as with any data driven analysis our findings are a function of our input variables and there are likely other descriptors of watershed behavior weather and climate not included in our analysis that shape flashiness at regional scales the proportional importance of climate with respect to rbi was low in three sub regions cfa csa dfa the csa region contains only a small number of gages in this study n 19 and is therefore challenging to generalize though we note that many of these gages are located in the central valley of california this is a region of high anthropogenic regulation of water which undoubtedly impacts flashiness as observed by the dominance of top predictor variables that represent human impacts fig 4 the cfa region encompasses large portions of the southeastern us and 136 gages across this region predictor relative importance was dominated by subsurface properties and metrics of human impact fig 4 similarly predictor relative importance in the dfa region lower midwest was largely dominated by subsurface properties these findings emphasize that regional investigations may highlight key aspects of the critical zone that account for sub regional variations in hydrological behavior for example several studies in the southeastern us have highlighted anthropogenic and natural controls on runoff generation beyond climate ledford et al 2020 price 2011 rose peters 2001 though human impacts did not appear to not play a large role in flashiness in the dfa region based on the predictor variables chosen for this study we posit that the importance of subsurface properties may correlate with anthropogenic impacts that are not represented in the gages ii dataset 3 4 flashiness and human impacts metrics of human impact were only identified as key predictors of rbi within a subset of climate regions however between historical development and the ever expanding human footprint humans have fundamentally altered streamflow response especially in the eastern us but likely for most if not all watersheds considered in this study for this reason as well as the unequal distribution of sites with exceptional human impact see figure s1 we chose not to separate reference and non reference sites within our analysis metrics of human activity are widely regarded as having strong but complex empirical relationships with watershed behavior bhaskar et al 2020 smith smith 2015 and specifically flashiness hopkins et al 2015 booth and konrad 2017 mcphillips et al 2019 this is in part because both agricultural and impervious land use are often associated with replumbing of the landscape through creation of preferential flowpaths that accelerate the speed at which water reaches the river network baker et al 2004 foufoula georgiou et al 2015 mcphillips et al 2019 in areas with high imperviousness infiltration is restricted and a large fraction of precipitation moves at the land surface as runoff booth and konrad 2017 this runoff is eventually routed through storm sewers to nearby water bodies urban watersheds have long been described as flashy often in reference to the urban hydrograph however work by mcphillips et al 2019 demonstrates that even our long held beliefs regarding the relationship between imperviousness and flashiness may be shifted by watershed climate in a set of watersheds within and surrounding phoenix az mcphillips et al 2019 showed that rbi is inversely proportional to watershed imperviousness indeed in this same region our results show that rbi is inversely proportional to watershed size while flashiness was not strongly related to the percentage of developed land at the regional scale in this study figure s5 mcphillips et al 2019 used additional gage data to those from usgs exemplifying the need for regional investigation similarly hopkins et al 2015 showed that the underlying watershed properties e g slope soil permeability across nine u s cities influenced hydrologic response characteristics to urbanization suggesting more work is needed to understand how geologic and human impacts couple to influence streamflow records watersheds draining agricultural land particularly in the presence of tile drainage are often considered flashy foufoula georgiou et al 2015 though this flashiness can vary from year to year mellander et al 2015 this characterization is regularly attributed to the presence of tile drains that route water rapidly from fields and into the subsurface tile drains can be found across the us but are most concentrated within the midwest due to the presence of low drainage soils valayamkunnath et al 2020 thus it is unclear how these and other types of land management associated with agricultural practices may in turn shape flashiness or whether these human impacts are secondary to other watershed characteristics while our study does not include predictor variables that represent direct agricultural practices such as tile drains it is possible watershed properties such as percent clay may be correlated with practices used to shunt water from landscapes 3 5 primary determinants of stable versus flashy hydrographs the findings of our study that multiple characteristics spanning human activity climate watershed structure the subsurface and land cover are empirically related to the magnitude of watershed flashiness are expected if we consider the processes that provision stability versus flashiness at annual or longer time scales the ultimate determinant of flashiness is likely the interactions between travel time of water through a watershed and rates and magnitudes of precipitation in particular flashier hydrographs are generated by shortened travel times which can be created by high intensity precipitation as well as the interaction of precipitation with several watershed characteristics that determine how slowly or quickly water is transported in the subsurface as well as how it is stored i e accumulate snow and ice groundwater within or across different years as we show our expectation that drainage area would produce flashy responses consistent with rapid travel times at the continental scale does not hold across the conus the limited importance of drainage area was affirmed in random forest analysis with watershed drainage area being the eighth most important predictor this unexpected finding challenges our previously conceived notions about the hydrologic behavior in small watersheds and emphasizes that the interaction of climate with other watershed characteristics will ultimately determine the flashiness of streamflow hydrographs the relationship between flashiness and drainage area is scale and region dependent and modulated by a host of other watershed characteristics in this analysis we present a snapshot of average flashiness across a ten year period however it is likely that flashiness may temporally shift in response to changing climate and human modifications of the landscape as many regions of the us shift from snow dominated systems to more frequent rain or rain on snow events flashiness has the potential to increase likewise intensive urbanization and agricultural land management over the last century has certainly impacted watershed stability understanding these trends as well as how they compare across regions with differing climate has potential to reveal more about the so called filter that watershed characteristics apply to pathways of water at and below the surface of the earth as high flashiness is often associated with the rapid transport of nutrients and other pollutants as well as channel incision gorski zimmer 2021 detecting historical trends and projecting future responses is crucial for managing our complex landscapes 3 6 conclusions in this study we calculated the richards baker flashiness index rbi for 1144 usgs river gages across the continental united states for a ten year period in comparing watershed flashiness to watershed size we found that watersheds with smaller drainage areas were not flashier than larger watersheds at national scales instead relationships between drainage area and flashiness were complex and varied at the regional scale when grouped by koppen geiger climate zones some regions showed a positive some a negative and some no relationship between flashiness and watershed size instead of drainage area multiple additional key predictors emerged through random forest analysis at the continental and regional scale in particular climate was the primary driver of flashiness at continental scales and in most regions still land cover structure and human impact were key predictors for many areas watersheds are our primary filters on precipitation ultimately yielding more stable or flashy responses to water input based upon interactions between climate inputs watershed characteristics and human impacts as the hydrologic cycle continues to intensify and as humans continue to change the land surface we need an improved understanding of the relationship between watershed form and function to changing precipitation inputs by identifying region specific controls

3397,hydrograph flashiness is a commonly used and valuable measure of hydrologic behavior calculated directly from streamflow measurements there is limited understanding of how and why flashiness varies at continental scales and within different hydroclimatic regions which can aid in predicting regional responses to an accelerating water cycle we addressed this knowledge gap by calculating a widely used metric of flashiness the richards baker flashiness index rbi for 1144 watersheds across the continental us for a ten year period using daily streamflow from usgs gages while regional studies have suggested that flashiness is organized by watershed size we show that flashiness is poorly organized by drainage area at continental scales moreover relationship strengths and directions with drainage area varied by hydroclimatic regions using a regionally based random forest analysis we show that empirical relationships between watershed characteristics and flashiness are diverse emphasizing that drivers of flashiness are likely related to regional or smaller scale features that encapsulate relationships between climate human impacts and the subsurface keywords runoff generation flashiness watersheds conus rbi 1 introduction hydrologic signatures that describe the duration frequency timing and magnitude of high and low flow periods have provided considerable insight regarding streamflow generation and routing behavior across watersheds and through time baker et al 2004 jencso mcglynn 2011 mcmillan 2020 mcmillan et al 2014 mcphillips et al 2019 tani 1997 as climate models are forecasting an acceleration of the global water cycle huntington 2006 huntington et al 2018 madakumbura et al 2019 moustakis et al 2021 precipitation inputs across much of the continental us conus have been and are anticipated to occur in fewer though more intense events myhre et al 2019 swain et al 2021 thus hydrologic signatures that specifically describe event response such as river flashiness are becoming increasingly useful for providing information regarding the impact of climate intensification on the dynamics of river systems river flashiness is a measure of how quickly and how high streamflow rises and falls in response to watershed input broadly flashiness is therefore an integrator of event dynamics e g precipitation intensity duration and antecedent conditions and watershed characteristics e g slope soil properties and land use land cover because of this the types and timing of events that generate flashy responses differ across the conus smith smith 2015 at the watershed scale it is presumed that flashier rivers generally drain areas in which water is routed quickly through hillslopes river networks or over impervious surfaces and through built infrastructure for this reason hydrographs exhibiting high flashiness are expected to occur in watersheds with more water partitioned to surface and shallow subsurface contributing areas and less to slower deeper subsurface contributing areas dwivedi et al 2019 previous work has shown that watershed size may be an important control on flashiness baker et al 2004 smith smith 2015 though small watersheds are known for exhibiting extensive variability in unit discharge gomi et al 2002 woods et al 1995 headwater catchments may also be steeper than larger higher order watersheds and therefore exhibit shallower soils characteristics that promote rapid runoff behavior mcglynn et al 2003 in contrast studies have shown that watershed properties that enhance streamflow contributions from slower deeper subsurface contributing areas are less flashy mcdonald et al 2018 while there are numerous approaches to quantifying flashiness at the watershed scale the richards baker flashiness index rbi baker et al 2004 has become one of the most commonly used indices for estimating flashiness rbi was initially used to explore spatio temporal watershed behavior in the midwestern us baker et al 2004 flashiness indices including rbi commonly compute the path length i e the distance between two consecutive streamflow values of the hydrograph within the literature rbi is widely regarded as a hydrologic signature that can provide novel information regarding the primary routing processes in watersheds booth and konrad 2017 mcmillan 2020 and is often used to measure the magnitude and rate of change of streamflow response to precipitation events to date studies that have leveraged rbi to understand controls on spatiotemporal behavior or trends have often been focused at regional scales in fact rbi was first introduced through a regional analysis of watersheds in the midwest us ranging in size from 8 5 km2 to 28 813 km2 baker et al 2004 demonstrated a size dependence associated with rbi with smaller watersheds exhibiting higher flashiness i e larger values of rbi and larger watersheds exhibiting greater flow regime stability since this initial article other studies have applied rbi to assess spatio temporal variability in watershed flashiness across regions and linked this behavior to watershed characteristics that represent partitioning between shallow and deeper contributing flowpaths holko et al 2011 mcphillips et al 2019 furthermore another study used a different flashiness metric peaks over a uniform discharge threshold 1 m2s 2km 2 per year to identify and describe the flashiest watersheds across conus smith smith 2015 by this metric the authors found the flashiest watersheds were small and in urban areas but acknowledge the use of a uniform threshold favors smaller watersheds smith smith 2015 given the wide use of descriptors of flashiness particularly rbi in hydrologic studies e g dow 2007 mcphillips et al 2019 smith smith 2015 systematic analysis of flashiness variability across hydroclimatically diverse and human impacted systems is needed in this context it is unclear if the original rbi drivers and patterns suggested by baker et al 2004 and others hold across different regions with watersheds of variable physical properties hydroclimates and land use and cover characteristics in this study we seek to address the following questions 1 which hydroclimatic regions of the conus are flashy and which display more stable hydrographs 2 are small watersheds flashier than large watersheds across the conus and or within distinct hydroclimatic regions 3 what watershed characteristics beyond or in addition to watershed size are empirically related to watershed flashiness within and between hydroclimatic regions 2 methods 2 1 site selection our analysis considers 1144 gaged watersheds across the conus fig 1 drawn from the gages ii dataset falcone 2011 we screened all gages ii watersheds to identify those with complete daily streamflow records for the 2000 to the 2009 water year streamflow observations were obtained using the dataretrieval package in r de cicco et al 2021 with watershed characteristics gathered from falcone 2011 watersheds span 1 to 25 791 km2 and nine koppen geiger climate kgc köppen 2011 zones this range in drainage area is comparable to the range in baker et al 2004 sites include those considered to be reference watersheds with minimal human impact n 924 as well as non reference sites n 220 impacted by agriculture and urban land use but largely free of upstream reservoirs and dams falcone 2011 figure s1 we applied the definition of reference watersheds as determined by falcone 2011 falcone 2011 leveraged geospatial analysis of human impacts usgs annual water data reports and visual screening at each stream gage to arrive at their classification across non reference watersheds developed land cover varies from 10 to 100 and agricultural land cover varies from 0 to 79 2 2 rbi calculation in particular we emphasize that we are examining flashiness from a lens of understanding and interpreting similarities and differences in watershed behavior we computed the unitless richards baker flashiness index rbi following rbi i 1 n q i q i 1 i 1 n q i where i is daily timesteps and q is mean daily streamflow though rbi can be used on sub daily observations we used a daily timestep to maximize data availability and to allow comparison to the original baker et al 2004 definition of the index using this equation we calculated rbi for the selected 1144 usgs gages for each water year from 2000 to 2009 we selected this period for two reasons first our analysis period corresponds to the dates of land cover information 2006 and 2011 contained within the gages ii dataset in addition we focus on a 10 year period to encapsulate variability but to avoid a longer period where trends in rbi may appear we averaged these annual values to create a mean annual rbi and also calculated the coefficient of variation cv across annual values to assess variability 2 3 random forest analysis to investigate potential drivers of changes in rbi we used a random forest model rfm random forests have been shown to be effective tools for examining relationships between watershed discharge metrics and watershed characteristics addor et al 2018 hammond et al 2021 we performed a random forest analysis using the ranger r package wright ziegler 2017 applied to mean annual rbi we initially considered 36 predictor variables including kgc zone bryant et al 2017 and 35 characteristics from the gagesii dataset falcone 2011 expected to govern spatial variability in rbi characteristics included metrics of climate e g annual average precipitation air temperature and potential evapotranspiration watershed structure e g topography slope and aspect subsurface average sand silt and clay fractions bedrock geology natural land cover e g percentage of forested wetlands and water and anthropogenic land cover e g developed land cover agricultural land cover the suite of predictors are described in the supporting information si table 1 from this group our final selection of 19 predictors was made by serially removing numeric predictors with a correlation coefficient above 0 70 until no two parameters had a coefficient above 0 70 every dropped predictor was dropped due to a correlation with a predictor in the same group e g climate structure land cover human impacts or subsurface the only parameters that had correlations between groups were mean maximum elevation and the percentage of precipitation that fell as snow however these three parameters were all dropped due to correlations with other in group parameters the rf analysis was executed with seven tries a minimum node size of seven sites a maximum sample fraction of 80 and 500 trees we ran the same model with the same parameters on gages across the conus as well as in each kgc zone to examine relationships across the dataset we present the relative importance of predictor variables that resulted from these models relative importance is the reduction in the gini impurity the number of mischaracterized sites each time a variable is used as a node split on a tree we show individual predictors for conus and group predictor variables into four designations climate natural land cover anthropogenic land cover and watershed structure for the kgc based comparisons si table 1 3 results and discussion 3 1 flashiness across the conus across 1144 gages mean annual flashiness 2000 2009 varied from 0 01 to 1 76 with 379 watersheds exhibiting relatively stable hydrographs rbi between 0 and 0 25 only a fraction of watersheds 6 4 73 gages displayed very flashy hydrographs rbi 1 these maximal values were comparable to annual rbi values for arizona watersheds from mcphillips et al 2019 and exceeded those found for midwestern watersheds in baker et al 2004 while our use of daily mean streamflow may limit the sensitivity of our analysis to sub daily events spot checks of many gages e g fig 3 b suggested the calculation was identifying flashy and non flashy watersheds calculations using instantaneous discharge measurements may offer more precision but for this conus wide 10 year study the daily calculations are likely appropriate and maximize the number of sites available for analysis the spatial distribution of mean annual rbi and the cv in annual rbi are shown in fig 2 see figure s2 and figure s3 for log transformed versions rbi values tended to be low in portions of the northwest northern midwest northeast and southeast high rbi values were associated with gages primarily in the southwestern and midwestern us as well as localized gages in mid atlantic and northeastern cities the cv of rbi used to assess variability in rbi between years was low for most sites with 81 of gages below 0 30 though gages with high variability were found throughout the conus gages with more pronounced variability were commonly located in the southwestern us 3 2 flashiness drainage area and climate despite previous work that demonstrated flashiness is inversely proportional to drainage area at regional scales baker et al 2004 mcphillips et al 2019 we found this was not true at the national scale fig 3 the relationship between flashiness and drainage area adjusted r2 0 01 at the continental scale suggests no relationship between the two while many small watersheds drainage area 100 km2 were characterized by high average flashiness rbi 1 0 we also observed several larger watersheds drainage areas between 500 and 5000 km2 exceeding this rbi value the cv of rbi was also poorly organized by drainage area though moderately sized sites 100 1000 km2 tended to exhibit the largest variability figure s4 while common wisdom would dictate that flashiness is organized by drainage area our analysis shows this is not the case at continental scales small watersheds are often colloquially described as flashy systems this likely recognizes that the continuum from a stable to a flashy hydrograph is determined by the travel time of water from receipt as precipitation to exit as streamflow through watersheds considering watershed size alone the travel times of water in small watersheds are likely to be reduced as compared to large watersheds bergstrom et al 2016 mcglynn et al 2004 however small watersheds are also known for their exceptional variability both in watershed characteristics and in hydrologic response gomi et al 2002 indeed adjacent headwater gages can display different hydrographs based on surface and subsurface properties and subsequent alterations to the pathways of water through such watersheds jencso mcglynn 2011 poff et al 2006 richardson et al 2020 at continental scales we posit instead that flashiness is primarily organized by climate when flashiness values were separated into koppen geiger climate regions fig 1b various relationships between rbi and drainage area emerged first several regions displayed no change in flashiness with watershed size these stable regions included those either in or draining mountainous areas spanning the eastern and western us dsb dfc cfb this implies that these systems receive seasonally concentrated water inputs e g seasonal precipitation snowmelt or that they are dominated by more homogeneous flowpaths in other regions flashiness decreased with watershed area these included climatic regions primarily based in the eastern us cfa dfa dfb where catchments receive precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year and the pacific northwest csb where precipitation primarily falls during winter finally in one region bsk primarily extending across the mountain west flashiness increased with watershed area this region is characterized by low total annual precipitation and high aridity and receives punctuated precipitation inputs that result in rapid short lived variability in flow and sometimes stream drying hammond et al 2021 that likely leads to flashy responses in large watersheds these findings demonstrate that relationships between drainage area and flashiness may exhibit different patterns within different climate zones these patterns likely emerge due to the interplay between precipitation behavior and hydrologic partitioning at the surface and in the subsurface this is supported by other studies that have shown that the characteristics of precipitation events can play an important role in flashiness smith smith 2015 hopkins et al 2015 3 3 the relative importance of watershed characteristics to stable and flashy hydrographs our random forest analysis revealed that climate metrics carried the highest proportion of importance at the national scale fig 4 this finding is in line with several other studies that have concluded watershed climate is the primary characteristic that organizes many metrics of watershed response this includes the relative contribution of baseflow gnann et al 2019 gnann et al 2020 the fraction of time a stream is flowing hammond et al 2021 as well as investigations that have shown climate organizes suites of different hydrologic signatures addor et al 2018 mcmillan 2020 and hydrographs at national to global scales knoben et al 2018 within six of the nine sub regions all within the western us climate metrics represented the highest proportion of importance across the top predictors identified by random forest models fig 4 this suggests that even within climatically similar regions annual air temperature precipitation and potential evapotranspiration still empirically explain variability in watershed flashiness our analysis points to climate especially as determined by total precipitation as a primary control on watershed flashiness and variations in flashiness with drainage area for example in western us watersheds with low total precipitation bsk fig 1 smaller watersheds exhibited reduced flashiness while larger watersheds had some of the highest rbi values observed across the conus this runs counter to the original rbi study by baker et al 2004 which showed that rbi decreases with watershed area and suggests that in some regions the accumulation of contributing surface and shallow subsurface flowpaths with increasing watershed area may dictate hydrograph behavior to a greater extent than contributions from deeper contributing flowpaths that may buffer flashiness while we quantify climate as an input variable to our analysis as long term average values we acknowledge that examining characteristics of precipitation particularly intensity and the number of high intensity events may also yield greater insight as with any data driven analysis our findings are a function of our input variables and there are likely other descriptors of watershed behavior weather and climate not included in our analysis that shape flashiness at regional scales the proportional importance of climate with respect to rbi was low in three sub regions cfa csa dfa the csa region contains only a small number of gages in this study n 19 and is therefore challenging to generalize though we note that many of these gages are located in the central valley of california this is a region of high anthropogenic regulation of water which undoubtedly impacts flashiness as observed by the dominance of top predictor variables that represent human impacts fig 4 the cfa region encompasses large portions of the southeastern us and 136 gages across this region predictor relative importance was dominated by subsurface properties and metrics of human impact fig 4 similarly predictor relative importance in the dfa region lower midwest was largely dominated by subsurface properties these findings emphasize that regional investigations may highlight key aspects of the critical zone that account for sub regional variations in hydrological behavior for example several studies in the southeastern us have highlighted anthropogenic and natural controls on runoff generation beyond climate ledford et al 2020 price 2011 rose peters 2001 though human impacts did not appear to not play a large role in flashiness in the dfa region based on the predictor variables chosen for this study we posit that the importance of subsurface properties may correlate with anthropogenic impacts that are not represented in the gages ii dataset 3 4 flashiness and human impacts metrics of human impact were only identified as key predictors of rbi within a subset of climate regions however between historical development and the ever expanding human footprint humans have fundamentally altered streamflow response especially in the eastern us but likely for most if not all watersheds considered in this study for this reason as well as the unequal distribution of sites with exceptional human impact see figure s1 we chose not to separate reference and non reference sites within our analysis metrics of human activity are widely regarded as having strong but complex empirical relationships with watershed behavior bhaskar et al 2020 smith smith 2015 and specifically flashiness hopkins et al 2015 booth and konrad 2017 mcphillips et al 2019 this is in part because both agricultural and impervious land use are often associated with replumbing of the landscape through creation of preferential flowpaths that accelerate the speed at which water reaches the river network baker et al 2004 foufoula georgiou et al 2015 mcphillips et al 2019 in areas with high imperviousness infiltration is restricted and a large fraction of precipitation moves at the land surface as runoff booth and konrad 2017 this runoff is eventually routed through storm sewers to nearby water bodies urban watersheds have long been described as flashy often in reference to the urban hydrograph however work by mcphillips et al 2019 demonstrates that even our long held beliefs regarding the relationship between imperviousness and flashiness may be shifted by watershed climate in a set of watersheds within and surrounding phoenix az mcphillips et al 2019 showed that rbi is inversely proportional to watershed imperviousness indeed in this same region our results show that rbi is inversely proportional to watershed size while flashiness was not strongly related to the percentage of developed land at the regional scale in this study figure s5 mcphillips et al 2019 used additional gage data to those from usgs exemplifying the need for regional investigation similarly hopkins et al 2015 showed that the underlying watershed properties e g slope soil permeability across nine u s cities influenced hydrologic response characteristics to urbanization suggesting more work is needed to understand how geologic and human impacts couple to influence streamflow records watersheds draining agricultural land particularly in the presence of tile drainage are often considered flashy foufoula georgiou et al 2015 though this flashiness can vary from year to year mellander et al 2015 this characterization is regularly attributed to the presence of tile drains that route water rapidly from fields and into the subsurface tile drains can be found across the us but are most concentrated within the midwest due to the presence of low drainage soils valayamkunnath et al 2020 thus it is unclear how these and other types of land management associated with agricultural practices may in turn shape flashiness or whether these human impacts are secondary to other watershed characteristics while our study does not include predictor variables that represent direct agricultural practices such as tile drains it is possible watershed properties such as percent clay may be correlated with practices used to shunt water from landscapes 3 5 primary determinants of stable versus flashy hydrographs the findings of our study that multiple characteristics spanning human activity climate watershed structure the subsurface and land cover are empirically related to the magnitude of watershed flashiness are expected if we consider the processes that provision stability versus flashiness at annual or longer time scales the ultimate determinant of flashiness is likely the interactions between travel time of water through a watershed and rates and magnitudes of precipitation in particular flashier hydrographs are generated by shortened travel times which can be created by high intensity precipitation as well as the interaction of precipitation with several watershed characteristics that determine how slowly or quickly water is transported in the subsurface as well as how it is stored i e accumulate snow and ice groundwater within or across different years as we show our expectation that drainage area would produce flashy responses consistent with rapid travel times at the continental scale does not hold across the conus the limited importance of drainage area was affirmed in random forest analysis with watershed drainage area being the eighth most important predictor this unexpected finding challenges our previously conceived notions about the hydrologic behavior in small watersheds and emphasizes that the interaction of climate with other watershed characteristics will ultimately determine the flashiness of streamflow hydrographs the relationship between flashiness and drainage area is scale and region dependent and modulated by a host of other watershed characteristics in this analysis we present a snapshot of average flashiness across a ten year period however it is likely that flashiness may temporally shift in response to changing climate and human modifications of the landscape as many regions of the us shift from snow dominated systems to more frequent rain or rain on snow events flashiness has the potential to increase likewise intensive urbanization and agricultural land management over the last century has certainly impacted watershed stability understanding these trends as well as how they compare across regions with differing climate has potential to reveal more about the so called filter that watershed characteristics apply to pathways of water at and below the surface of the earth as high flashiness is often associated with the rapid transport of nutrients and other pollutants as well as channel incision gorski zimmer 2021 detecting historical trends and projecting future responses is crucial for managing our complex landscapes 3 6 conclusions in this study we calculated the richards baker flashiness index rbi for 1144 usgs river gages across the continental united states for a ten year period in comparing watershed flashiness to watershed size we found that watersheds with smaller drainage areas were not flashier than larger watersheds at national scales instead relationships between drainage area and flashiness were complex and varied at the regional scale when grouped by koppen geiger climate zones some regions showed a positive some a negative and some no relationship between flashiness and watershed size instead of drainage area multiple additional key predictors emerged through random forest analysis at the continental and regional scale in particular climate was the primary driver of flashiness at continental scales and in most regions still land cover structure and human impact were key predictors for many areas watersheds are our primary filters on precipitation ultimately yielding more stable or flashy responses to water input based upon interactions between climate inputs watershed characteristics and human impacts as the hydrologic cycle continues to intensify and as humans continue to change the land surface we need an improved understanding of the relationship between watershed form and function to changing precipitation inputs by identifying region specific controls

3398,intensity frequency duration ifd curves also known as intensity duration frequency idf curves in some regions are widely used to take into consideration the probability of occurrence of extreme precipitation for the design of water related infrastructure derivation of ifd curves is based on statistical analysis of observed extreme precipitation events and thus the reliability of the curves mostly depends on the record length of observations at sub hourly timescales however ground based precipitation observations are often absent or very limited in terms of spatial coverage and record length particularly in remote areas around the world given the availability of satellite derived precipitation products spps with finer spatiotemporal resolution and near global coverage there is great potential to use these products in the planning and design of infrastructure this paper proposes a novel framework sifd satellite derived ifd curves to combine long term daily gauge data and sub hourly spp to estimate ifd curves for time intervals from 0 5 to 24 h a recent variant of the random parameter bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model rpblrpx was used to disaggregate daily gauge data to derive ifd curves in the absence of sub daily rain gauge data the statistics required for the rpblrpx model were obtained using the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg 30 min 0 1 resolution product derived from the global precipitation measurement gpm mission performance of the sifd framework was tested against gauge data from seven australian sites across a wide range of climatologies the disaggregation scheme coupled with the rpblrpx model was capable of reproducing the wet period mean intensity wet period standard deviation and wet period fraction with reasonable accuracy across the sub daily timescales the coefficient of determination r 2 values were 0 39 mean intensity 0 38 standard deviation and 0 87 wet period fraction at 0 5 h timescale furthermore despite some differences in methodology and record length the ifd estimates computed using the sifd framework were fairly close to those of the bureau of meteorology bom the skill metrics for sydney were the best with a bias ratio br of 1 01 root mean square error rmse of 13 of the mean of the bom estimates and a nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse of 0 97 the worst case was found at hobart br 1 43 rmse 66 and nse 0 26 overall the results indicate that the proposed sifd framework could provide a viable alternative to estimate unbiased ifd curves at the sub hourly timescale in the absence of adequate sub hourly ground based observations keywords intensity frequency duration curves bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model global precipitation measurement integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm australia 1 introduction intensity frequency duration ifd curves also known as intensity duration frequency idf curves in some regions describe the relationship between storm duration and the average precipitation intensity at a given frequency of occurrence and are widely used for engineering planning and design projects e g hydraulic structures such as stormwater drains and pipes conventionally where available ground based rain gauge data are used to derive ifd curves according to the following 4 steps e g koutsoyiannis et al 1998 i annual maximum series or partial duration series of precipitation intensity are prepared for a given duration ii a theoretical probability distribution function e g generalized extreme value gev is fitted to the sampled series iii the fitted probability distribution is then used to estimate precipitation intensities for a set of selected annual exceedance probabilities aeps e g 50 20 10 2 and 1 and iv for each aep the relationship between storm duration and precipitation intensity is presented graphically and or in a tabular form derivation of ifd curves requires the utilization of a long record of precipitation observations to ensure reasonable confidence when estimating precipitation intensity of small aeps from the fitted distribution record lengths of daily precipitation accumulations are adequate kidd et al 2017 however sub daily gauges are usually sparse in space with shorter record lengths and missing data are common by comparison lewis et al 2019 westra et al 2014 in australia for instance the bureau of meteorology bom has approximately 3000 daily precipitation gauge stations with more than 100 years of record the majority 2150 out of 2280 of sub daily gauge stations however have less than 40 years of record to december 2012 with almost 1400 sub daily stations having less than 20 years of data green et al 2019 further both daily and sub daily precipitation data are unevenly distributed in space for instance the populated coastal regions of eastern and south western australia have relatively high gauge network densities 5 20 per 1 1 latitude longitude grid box while some regions in western central and northern australia have very few or no rain gauges ebert and weymouth 2003 chen et al 2013 the absence of high spatiotemporal resolution rain gauge data in many countries around the world has motivated the development of several satellite derived precipitation products spps with fine temporal and spatial resolutions and quasi global coverage these products include the global precipitation measurement gpm mission derived integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 huffman et al 2020 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap for gpm okamoto et al 2005 kubota et al 2007 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 climate prediction centre cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 amongst others these spps are extremely valuable for regions where surface based precipitation measurement facilities are either non existent or limited in terms of the spatial coverage and temporal resolution in the light of the issues mentioned above the derivation of ifd curves using spps has begun to receive attention in the literature thirty three years of daily data from the persiann cdr climate data record dataset ashouri et al 2015 was utilized to develop ifd curves in the united states for durations ranging from 1 to 60 days and aeps from 50 to 1 faridzad et al 2018 ombadi et al 2018 gado et al 2017 also used persiann cdr to perform regional frequency analysis at ungauged sites combining gauge data from neighbouring sites in colorado and california the analysis was carried out for aeps from 20 to 0 1 at the daily timescale similarly rodrigues et al 2020 estimated daily extreme precipitation amounts corresponding to 50 20 and 10 aeps with 16 years of tmpa data in northeast brazil however none of these previous studies considered sub daily storm durations in terms of using spps to derive ifd curves for sub daily durations marra et al 2017 developed ifd curves for 1 to 24 h durations and 50 to 4 aeps based on 16 years of half hourly cmporph data over the eastern mediterranean endreny and imbeah 2009 used 9 years of 3 hourly tmpa data with short records 5 24 years of sub hourly gauge data to derive ifd curves for 1 min to 24 h durations and 10 to 0 2 aeps in ghana noor et al 2021 investigated the use of gsmap both real time and gauge adjusted versions persiann and tmpa datasets to construct ifd curves from 19 years of observation in peninsular malaysia ifd curves were generated for 3 to 72 h durations and 50 to 1 aeps although these studies considered sub daily durations very short spp records all 19 years were used in the derivation of ifd curves due to the fact that longer data records of these spps were not yet available moreover the accuracy of these spps varies significantly over different parts of the world with respect to climate season and topography e g islam and cartwright 2020 stochastic precipitation generators can be used to produce long precipitation records in a recent study sun et al 2019 utilized hourly gsmap satellite data to disaggregate daily gauge data into hourly time series using the bartlett lewis rectangular pulse blrp model for a single site in singapore this approach was applied and validated only in an equatorial climate therefore it is uncertain whether this approach will provide acceptable results in regions with different climates and precipitation regimes the study in singapore used the random parameter bartlett lewis rectangular pulse rpblrp model with cell intensities from the gamma distribution this variant of the rpblrp model is not appropriate for sub hourly timescale as it does not account for any correlation between cell intensity and duration the findings reported by kaczmarska et al 2014 demonstrate that the dependency between cell intensity and duration leads to an improved performance of the rpblrp model in estimating sub hourly precipitation extremes as outlined above ifd curves using spps have so far been derived mostly for daily or longer durations or in a limited number of climatic regions in addition the only study to derive ifd curves by coupling spp with the rpblrp model was limited to the hourly duration at a single site with an equatorial climate the present study aims to extend this previous work by developing a new framework sifd satellite derived ifd curves using a new variant of the rpblrp model hereafter rpblrpx to combine daily gauge data and a sub hourly spp data to derive ifd curves for sub daily time intervals from 0 5 to 24 h the rpblrpx model addresses the dependence between cell intensity and duration to capture the precipitation variability at sub hourly timescales kaczmarska et al 2014 sifd was evaluated using precipitation data and bom ifd curves from seven australian sites across a wide range of climates 2 data and methods 2 1 sub daily gauge data and site climatology for the study period january 2001 december 2019 half hourly precipitation data were sourced from bom for seven sites distributed across different climate zones of australia fig 1 site location data completeness mean annual precipitation map and a seasonality index s i are presented in table 1 the si is expressed as follows yu 2003 1 si s w s w where s is the average precipitation over the summer months november april and w is that during the winter months may october an si value 0 13 denotes a marked wet season in summer while 0 13 denotes a marked wet season in winter yu 2003 as seen in fig 1 and table 1 five of the 7 sites are close to the coast but have substantially different climate and precipitation variability on the east coast brisbane and sydney receive almost the same amount of map however brisbane has a subtropical climate with most precipitation in summer s i 0 35 whereas sydney is temperate and precipitation is uniformly distributed throughout the year 0 13 s i 0 13 which is similar to hobart on the south western coast perth has a temperate climate receiving precipitation mostly during the winter months of may october s i 0 64 both darwin and longreach are located in the tropics where precipitation occurs almost exclusively in summer months of november april s i 0 50 although longreach has relatively low map lastly meekatharra is located in the arid region of western australia and has the lowest map of the seven sites selected this combination of sites covers almost all major precipitation zones of australia cf fig 1 half hourly precipitation data for the sites considered in the paper were available since the mid 1990s for the study period of 2001 2019 the half hourly data were first aggregated to daily totals for model validation alternative daily data for these sites were not used for model development and evaluation 2 2 satellite derived precipitation product imerg among the various spps imerg was selected as the alternative source to compute sub hourly precipitation statistics given its finer temporal 30 min and spatial 0 1 resolutions imerg was also identified as the best of five spps for australia islam et al 2020 the imerg precipitation product combines precipitation related data from various passive microwave pmw sensors and fills the gaps between two successive pmw observations with infrared ir precipitation estimates using motion vectors huffman et al 2019 huffman et al 2020 for the final product the motion vectors are derived from total precipitable water vapour tqv data of modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 reanalysis product tan et al 2019 in the precipitation processing algorithm merged pmw ir estimates are summed over a calendar month and then bias corrected against monthly gridded gauge based dataset imerg version 06b final run product hereafter only imerg was downloaded from the website located at https disc gsfc nasa gov ssw data coverage extends from june 2000 to present 2 3 bom reference ifd estimates in australia the ifd curves provided by the bom are based on a rain gauge database encompassing measurements from 8074 daily and 2280 sub daily gauge stations across the country green et al 2015 as the spatial coverage of sub daily gauge stations is considerably limited in comparison to daily gauge stations bayesian generalised least squares regression is used to extrapolate sub daily precipitation statistics at the daily gauge stations green et al 2019 the minimum record length is 30 years for daily gauges and 8 years for sub daily gauges for site selection to estimate ifd curves in australia green et al 2019 these minimum record lengths are still considered short for accurate estimation of precipitation intensities for most of the selected aeps green and jolly 2018 for this reason regionalisation is used to reduce the uncertainty and remove the bias in estimated parameters of the probability distribution function green et al 2019 regionalisation recognises that gauge data can be combined from multiple sites within a climatologically homogeneous region to estimate the parameters of the distribution function more accurately 2 4 sifd framework overview an overview of the sifd framework used to develop satellite derived ifd curves is shown in fig 2 first the 6 parameters in the rpblrpx model are calibrated using the statistics from the 30 min imerg data this is done for each month separately to account for seasonal variability leading to 12 sets of 6 parameter values for each of the 7 sites in australia cf section 2 5 2 next the calibrated rpblrpx model is used to disaggregate daily gauge data into a half hourly time series from which other durations 0 5 h are obtained by aggregation the disaggregation is performed 100 times in order to estimate the confidence intervals directly cf section 2 5 3 finally the ifd curves are derived from the disaggregated datasets in the usual manner in this case using the gev distribution cf section 2 6 the resulting ifd curves are then compared with those of bom green et al 2019 to establish whether the proposed framework is capable of reproducing the frequency characteristics of extreme precipitation events at sub hourly timescales cf section 2 7 2 5 bartlett lewis rectangular pulse models 2 5 1 background this study used an extended version of the rpblrp model i e rpblrpx developed by kaczmarska et al 2014 the rpblrpx model introduces dependency between cell intensity and duration to reproduce the increased variability that precipitation exhibits at sub hourly timescales it is reported that the rpblrpx model outperforms other types of blrp models from sub hourly up to the daily timescale cross et al 2018 onof and wang 2020 kossieris et al 2018 the blrp model is a poisson cluster process based stochastic precipitation generator and simulates storms as clusters of cells rectangular pulses to occur in time rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 the following assumptions are associated with the bartlett lewis clustering mechanism as illustrated in fig 3 each storm i starts at a time t i solid circle following a poisson process with rate λ and consists of a random number of cells each cell j arrives at a time t ij open circle within a storm i following a second poisson process with rate β the origin of first cell coincides with the storm origin the time intervals between two successive storm and cell origins are assumed to be independent and identically distributed exponential random variables the generation of cells within a storm i terminates after a time period ν i which follows the exponential distribution with parameter γ the duration of a cell j within a storm i w ij follows the exponential distribution with parameter η the intensity of a cell j within a storm i x ij follows either the exponential distribution with average cell depth μ x or the gamma distribution with average cell depth μ x and standard deviation σ x assuming the exponential distribution of cell intensity the original version of the blrp model has five parameters i e λ β γ η and μ x although this initial version of the model is able to reproduce the basic statistics i e mean variance skewness and auto correlation of precipitation time series from hourly to daily timescales it significantly overestimates the proportion of dry periods rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 the reason is that parameters β γ and η are kept constant for all storm events which limits the reproduction of different types of storm as well as the variability within the storms kossieris et al 2018 cross et al 2018 the rpblrp model extends the original model by allowing cell duration parameter η to vary from storm to storm according to the gamma distribution with the shape parameter α and scale parameter ν rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 in the rpblrp model cell arrival rate β and storm duration rate γ also vary so that the ratios κ β η and φ γ η remain constant among different storm events the rpblrp model has six parameters namely λ α ν κ φ and μ x for the exponential distribution of cell intensity in case of using the gamma distribution for cell intensity the corresponding model parameters are λ α ν κ φ μ x and r σ x μ x to introduce dependence between cell intensity and duration kaczmarska et al 2014 modified the rpblrp model so that parameter μ x is also allowed to vary between storm events by keeping the ratio ι μ x η constant this new variant i e rpblrpx has six parameters i e λ α ν κ φ and ι for the exponentially distributed cell intensity if the gamma distribution is used for cell intensity the rpblrpx model would have 7 parameters namely λ α ν κ φ ι and r in this study the 6 parameter rpblrpx model was used to allow for the reproduction of high variability of precipitation at the sub hourly timescale this model shows better performance in reproducing the main statistical characteristics of observed precipitation data for a wide range of timescales i e from sub hourly to daily at a site in bochum germany kaczmarska et al 2014 kossieris et al 2018 2 5 2 parameter estimation the six model parameters i e λ α ν κ φ and ι were estimated by minimizing the objective function g defined as follows cowpertwait et al 2007 wheater et al 2005 2 g t 0 5 1 2 6 12 24 w 1 p t p s t p s t 2 w 2 v a r t var s t var s t 2 w 3 a c o v t acov s t acov s t 2 w 4 p d t pd s t pd s t 2 where t indicates different aggregation levels i e 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h in equation 2 p t v a r t a c o v t and p d t are the modelled mean variance lag 1 auto covariance and proportion of dry respectively in terms of the six model parameters at aggregation level t detailed formulation of these terms can be found in rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 onof and wheater 1993 onof and wheater 1994 onof et al 2000 and kaczmarska et al 2014 four constants w 1 w 2 w 3 and w 4 represent the weights applied to the squared relative errors in the mean variance lag 1 auto covariance and proportion of dry respectively in the current analysis w 1 1 w 2 1 w 3 1 and w 4 1 were used to attach equal importance to these relative error components to the objective function wheater et al 2005 in equation 2 wet period mean p s p s t wet period variance var s var s t wet period lag 1 auto covariance a c o v s a c o v s t and proportion of dry pd s pd s t were computed using imerg data at the six aggregation levels i e 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h at the selected rain gauge locations having half hourly imerg precipitation depths the data at coarser timescales were obtained via aggregation the above mentioned statistics are defined as follows 3 p s l 1 n p s l n 4 var s l 1 n p s l p s 2 n 1 5 acov s l 1 n 1 p s l 1 p s p s l p s n 6 pd s n o n where subscript s represents values for imerg in equations 3 6 p s p s l is the l th imerg value in mm at a particular aggregation level e g 0 5 h n o is the number of zero imerg precipitation depth and n is the total number of imerg data in the time series in this study statistics p s var s and a c o v s were estimated from wet periods only where a wet period was defined as a 30 min precipitation accumulation greater than or equal to 0 2 mm these precipitation statistics were calculated for each calendar month separately to allow for seasonality it is worth noting that imerg represents the average precipitation depth within an area of 10 km 10 km while rain gauge records precipitation at a particular point the justification to overlook this discrepancy in scales in this instance are discussed in section 4 1 the objective function was minimized to estimate model parameter values within a given parameter space using the globalsearch algorithm from the global optimization toolbox of matlab ugray et al 2007 the lower and upper bounds of the parameters within which the parameters were estimated are given in table 2 the parameters were estimated on a monthly basis to capture the seasonal variation in the precipitation characteristics therefore 12 monthly parameter sets were obtained for each site 2 5 3 disaggregation scheme first the sequence of clusters of wet days preceded and followed by one or more dry days were obtained from the given daily time series the rpblrpx model was used to generate sequences of storms and cells for each wet period at the given sub hourly timescale the model was repeated until the generated clusters of wet days with the preceding and following one or more dry days were identical to that of the given time series secondly the cell intensities were generated and the simulated daily precipitation depths were calculated to compare with the original daily depths using the following equation koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 kossieris et al 2018 7 d k 1 l l n 2 z k c z k c 1 2 where z k and z k are the observed and simulated precipitation amounts in mm respectively for the k th day in a wet period of l days a constant c 0 1 mm was used to prevent domination of very low daily precipitation values further the logarithm was used to avoid domination of very high values for each cluster the process was repeated until the departure d was less than an acceptable limit d a the default value of d a was used in this study i e d a 0 1 as recommended kossieris et al 2018 finally generated sub hourly precipitation values for the k th day in a wet period of l days were modified according to the proportional adjustment procedure as follows koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 kossieris et al 2018 8 x m x m z k z k m 1 2 n where x m is the m th adjusted sub hourly precipitation depth in mm x m is the m th simulated sub hourly precipitation depth in mm and n is the number of sub hourly intervals in one day the rpblrpx model replicates the precipitation statistics of the observed precipitation intensities and can be used to generate multiple realisations of statistically identical precipitation series once calibrated further the proportional adjustment procedure ensures mass conservation in that generated half hourly time series of precipitation once aggregated equals the daily total exactly an ensemble of 100 realisations of 19 years data was generated to reduce the uncertainty in the random process of the rpblrpx model these random samples were used to compute disaggregated precipitation statistics at 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h temporal scales the disaggregated precipitation statistics were then compared with the observed gauge based statistics to evaluate the disaggregation scheme in the present study disaggregation of daily gauge data was performed using hyetosminute software kossieris et al 2018 which is coded in the r programming language r core team 2020 2 6 derivation of ifd curves the gev distribution was used to fit the annual maximum series ams of extreme precipitation values for 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h durations the gev distribution is a 3 parameter probability distribution function and has been widely used to model precipitation extremes faridzad et al 2018 marra et al 2017 noor et al 2021 overeem et al 2008 it combines three extreme value distributions i e gumbel type i fréchet type ii and weibull type iii into a single distribution to allow for a continuous range of possible shapes the gev cumulative distribution function f y is expressed as follows e g faridzad et al 2018 9 f y e x p 1 ξ y μ σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 10 f y e x p e x p y μ σ f o r ξ 0 where μ σ and ξ are the location scale and shape parameters of the distribution respectively in equations 9 and 10 y is the annual maximum series of precipitation intensity for a given duration note that shape parameter values of equal to 0 greater than 0 and less than 0 correspond to the gumbel fréchet and weibull distributions respectively the gevfit function from the statistics and machine learning toolbox of matlab was used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution using the maximum likelihood estimation fitting method the ifd estimate y aep for a particular aep and duration was estimated using the following gev derived equations e g faridzad et al 2018 11 y aep μ σ ξ 1 l n 1 a e

wet period mean intensity wet period standard deviation wet period lag 1 auto correlation and wet period fraction was assessed using the correlation coefficient squared r 2 for the six aggregation intervals r 2 is defined as follows 13 r 2 q 1 m q d q q d q g q q g q 1 m q d q q d 2 q 1 m q g q q g 2 2 where q d q is the q th value of the disaggregated precipitation statistics q g q is the q th value of the observed gauge based statistics and m is the number of disaggregated or observed statistics q d and q g show the mean of the disaggregated and observed statistics respectively for the m number of data pairs r 2 varies between 0 and 1 it is worth mentioning here that the r 2 value for each time interval was calculated separately for each statistic to evaluate the performance of the sifd framework the ifd estimates obtained from the framework were compared with those of bom through bias ratio br root mean square error rmse r 2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse rmse was also used to assess the effect of long term gauge records in the computation of ifd estimates using the proposed framework here br rmse and nse are defined as follows br is defined as the ratio of ifd estimate from the sifd framework to that of bom the perfect score of br is 1 while underestimation and overestimation will lead to values less than 1 and greater than 1 respectively 14 br u 1 u i d u u 1 u i b u where i d u is the u th ifd estimate obtained from the sifd framework in mm h i b u is the u th ifd estimate of bom in mm h and u is the number of sifd or bom ifd estimates rmse was used to measure the magnitude of discrepancy in ifd curves between sifd and bom rmse is dimensional and has the same unit of measurement as the original observations and rmse tends to give greater weight to the larger errors and is defined as follows 15 rmse u 1 u i d u i b u 2 u nse shows the skill of the sifd ifd estimates relative to perfect agreement with the bom estimates i e the 1 1 line 16 nse 1 u 1 u i d u i b u 2 u 1 u i b u i b 2 where i b is the mean of the bom ifd estimates in mm h nse varies from to 1 with 1 indicating perfect skill negative values indicate that the mean of the bom estimates is better than the estimate using sifd 0 indicates that the sifd estimate is as good as the mean of the bom estimates and positive values show good skill 3 results 3 1 comparison of imerg with gauge statistics fig 4 compares 4 key precipitation statistics wet period mean wet period variance wet period lag 1 auto covariance and proportion dry computed using imerg and gauge data at aggregation intervals ranging from 0 5 to 24 h at sydney airport amo station no 66037 the circles and triangles represent the statistics over the summer november april and winter may october months respectively the face colours of the circles and triangles represent the different aggregation intervals whilst imerg has reasonably good skills in estimating the mean at different aggregation levels the dataset generally underestimates the mean in winter season see fig 4 a imerg also tends to overestimate the mean above 2 h aggregation level for some calendar months in summer it is clearly seen from fig 4 b that imerg systematically underestimates the precipitation variance throughout the year at finer 2h timescales for some winter months i e may october underestimation of the variance is also evident at coarser 1h timescales the lag 1 auto covariance is reasonably well captured by the imerg dataset even though substantial differences are observed at all timescales both in summer and winter seasons fig 4 c as seen in fig 4 d the dry proportion is well captured up to 2 h aggregation level for all seasons the winter months tend to underestimate the dry proportion and the degree of underestimation increases with the increase of aggregation level on the other hand the dry proportion is overestimated for some summer months and the overestimation increases as the aggregation level increases 3 2 comparison of rpblrpx disaggregation with gauge statistics the disaggregated 0 5 h data were compared with the observed 0 5 h data in terms of the 4 most important precipitation statistics wet period mean intensity wet period standard deviation wet period lag 1 auto correlation and wet period fraction i e 1 dry proportion figs 5 and 6 show the comparison of the raw 0 5 h and aggregated 2 h intervals respectively with each scatterplot containing 84 data points 12 months 7 sites the colours of the points in the plots indicate site locations the coefficient of determination r 2 of the linear regression between the disaggregated and observed statistics is shown for each of the six aggregation intervals in table 3 the disaggregation scheme tends to overestimate the observed statistics at the 0 5 h timescale with r 2 values of 0 39 and 0 38 for the wet period mean intensity and standard deviation respectively see fig 5 and table 3 wet period fractions are well reproduced with the r 2 value equal to 0 87 although the values tend to be underestimated by the disaggregation scheme with the r 2 value of 0 08 the scheme shows the worst performance in reproducing the wet period lag 1 auto correlation it should be mentioned that the wet period lag 1 auto correlation was not included in the objective function during the estimation of rpblrpx model parameters thus the preservation of this property is not guaranteed by the rpblrpx model one can see that the discrepancy between the disaggregated and observed statistics is reduced considerably at 2 h aggregation level compare fig 6 with fig 5 for the respective statistics from table 3 it is also evident that the performance of the disaggregation scheme increases as the aggregation interval increases note that the perfect correlation at the daily duration see r 2 1 00 in table 3 is due to the proportional adjustment procedure within the scheme i e the disaggregation is constrained to have a daily aggregation equal to that of the gauge data see also section 2 5 3 overall the results are encouraging in the context of reproducing the key precipitation statistics across the timescales of interest because no sub daily gauge data were used by the rpblrpx model within the disaggregation scheme 3 3 ifd curves fig 7 compares the ifd curves published by bom and those estimated using the sifd framework median and 95 confidence intervals for sydney airport amo station no 66037 in most cases the median of the sifd estimates is close to the bom ifd curves which are calculated by integrating a large number of gauges and longer record lengths for frequency analysis see section 2 3 larger deviations from the bom estimates are observed for lower aeps further the 95 confidence intervals from the sifd framework become larger as the aeps decrease see fig 7 b and 7 c these larger deviations and confidence intervals at the lower aeps are attributed to the short record length of the disaggregated precipitation data i e 19 years the median and 95 confidence intervals are identical at daily timescale see fig 7 b and 7 c since the proportional adjustment procedure within the disaggregation scheme ensures full consistency between generated and observed daily time series see section 2 5 3 as shown in fig 7 b and 7 c the confidence intervals decrease with increasing storm duration up to 6 h duration the bom ifd curves are within the 95 confidence intervals while the 12 h and 24 h durations are outside one reason for this is the shorter record length of the disaggregated data compared to the longer gauge record length used for the development of bom ifd curves another reason is the difference between the sifd method and the method employed by bom bom uses gev distribution fitted using l moments to estimate the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events green et al 2019 further regionalisation is used by bom to reduce the uncertainty emerging from the limited years of observation during the estimation of l moments which are subsequently used to determine the parameters of a gev distribution regionalisation is based on the assumption that gauge data at all stations within a given region have the same frequency characteristics of extreme precipitation events which may not always be valid the performance metrics of the ifd estimates obtained using sifd with respect to the ifd estimates of bom are presented in table 4 for different aeps br varies between 0 94 and 0 95 and r 2 between 0 86 and 0 93 indicating very good agreement between the sifd and bom estimates it is noted however that sifd tends to underestimate the ifd estimates by 7 to 14 on average the rmse values are relatively high varying between 30 and 36 of the mean of the bom estimates the nse values are in the range 0 85 to 0 92 indicating very good skill of the sifd framework the performance statistics for different durations indicate that the sifd framework exhibits the poorest performance for 24 h duration with br of 0 74 rmse of 34 and nse of 0 52 only r 2 has its lowest value 0 68 for 0 5 h duration for the 6 h duration the sifd estimates have zero bias i e br 1 the best values for rmse r 2 and nse are 20 0 86 and 0 84 respectively which are obtained for the 1 h and 2 h durations out of the seven selected sites the sifd framework exhibits the worst performance at hobart with serious overestimation br 1 40 extremely high error rmse 60 and limited skill nse 0 30 although the r 2 value of 0 99 indicates very good correlation between the sifd and bom estimates the proposed framework also performs poorly with severe underestimation br 0 70 and very large error rmse 50 at longreach the sifd performs the best for sydney with br of 1 01 rmse of 13 r 2 of 0 99 and nse of 0 97 4 discussion 4 1 differences in the spatial scale the imerg statistics are fairly good and can be used to compute the rpblrpx model parameters apart from other errors of imerg associated with the sensors of observation sampling and estimation algorithms the discrepancy in the precipitation statistics between imerg and gauge are likely attributed to the spatial scales of the two datasets imerg provides an average value over a grid cell area of 10 km 10 km whereas gauge data are point measurements this scale gap was not considered in the current analysis as the imerg statistics were used to estimate the rpblrpx model parameters only furthermore the proportional adjustment procedure in the disaggregation scheme ensures that the generated half hourly series when aggregated to daily totals is identical to the given daily gauge record and overcomes possible under or overestimation by imerg with respect to gauge precipitation depths see section 2 5 3 in other words the sifd framework is essentially unbiased as the timescale approaches to 24 h 4 2 effect of record length 4 2 1 imerg due to the relatively short record length of imerg i e 19 years ifd curves were constructed for 50 20 10 and 5 aeps only however long records of daily gauge data can be used to construct ifd curves for lower aeps e g 1 aep using the proposed sifd framework traditionally the blrp model and its variants are calibrated based on the observed precipitation statistics under the assumption of temporal stationarity of the precipitation process kaczmarska et al 2015 park et al 2019 to address the monthly variation in precipitation characteristics the blrp model is typically calibrated for each month separately for a given duration a single set of observed statistics e g the mean variance auto covariance and proportion dry is used to calibrate the model regardless of the record length of observed time series being applied to estimate the set of statistics kaczmarska et al 2014 kossieris et al 2018 according to the assumption of stationarity the disaggregated precipitation statistics should be the same as the observed statistics for each month irrespective of the record length of daily gauge data being disaggregated therefore it is no longer necessary to validate the disaggregation scheme for the period when imerg is absent i e prior to june 2000 and the record length of imerg does not affect the selection of record length of daily gauge data 4 2 2 gauge it is worth noting here that the gauge data used to derive bom ifd estimates is identical to that of this study at the daily timescale despite the similarity at the daily timescale ifd estimates from the sifd framework considerably underestimate the bom estimates for all aeps due to the differences in record length and method see fig 7 b and 7 c in order to evaluate the effect of record length on ifd estimates computed using the proposed framework the entire daily gauge record is used for frequency analysis at the 7 selected sites fig 8 compares the ifd estimates derived from the disaggregated datasets 19 years and long term gauge records using the sifd framework with those of bom for 24 h duration the linear regression line passing through the origin is shown in each plot the record lengths of daily time series are provided in table 1 for these sites for the disaggregated data 19 years the sifd framework tends to underestimate the bom ifd estimates with different levels of underestimation for different aeps at the selected sites see fig 8 a the ifd estimates computed from the disaggregated datasets show considerable underestimation for longreach sydney and brisbane significant improvements are observed for longreach hobart and sydney when the entire gauge record is used for frequency analysis compare fig 8 b with fig 8 a meekatharra and perth show little changes in underestimation while the underestimation for darwin increases there is limited change for brisbane fig 8 as the record length of 25 years for brisbane is relatively short the sifd framework shows an improvement from 26 underestimation to 20 on average for these sites when long term daily gauge data are used fig 8 in addition the standard error se of the estimated slope is also reduced i e there is less scatter again this is likely a result of more daily data being used for each aep the effectiveness of the longer record length in improving the performance of the proposed sifd framework was assessed using rmse of the ifd estimates computed from the disaggregated datasets 19 years and long term gauge records for 24 h duration merging information for all the study sites the results are shown in table 5 where it can be clearly seen that the rmse values for ifd estimates corresponding to lower aeps are always higher for both datasets the ifd estimates derived from the long term gauge records indicate lower rmse values than those derived from the disaggregated data regardless of the choice of aep suggesting the effectiveness of the long record lengths in reducing the errors in the ifd estimates further the reduction in rmse is more prominent for the lower aeps 5 conclusions and future works in this study a new framework to estimate satellite derived ifd curves sifd has been developed for sub daily durations from 0 5 to 24 h by combining half hourly imerg and daily gauge data this is of particular interest to regions where sub hourly gauge data are either absent or limited in terms of spatial coverage and record length a recent variant of the rpblrp model that considers the dependence between cell intensity and duration rpblrpx was successfully used for the disaggregation of daily gauge data to half hourly time series based on four critical precipitation statistics estimated based on half hourly imerg data ifd curve estimates were then estimated in the usual manner by fitting the gev distribution to the annual series of peak intensities from the disaggregated data the performance of the spp rpblrpx disaggregation scheme was evaluated using precipitation data observed at seven australian sites across a wide range of climates comparison of imerg and observed statistics indicated that imerg showed reasonably good agreement with the observed statistics across the timescales the observed differences between the statistics of imerg and gauge records can be attributed to the spatial scales of these datasets point gauge data versus 10 km 10 km imerg data correction of this issue was not considered in the present study because a the imerg statistics were not used directly in the rpblrpx model and were only applied to determine the rpblrpx model parameters and b the proportional adjustment procedure within the disaggregation scheme ensures full consistency between the generated and observed daily series and avoids any biases in the imerg data comparison of the statistics derived from the disaggregated and observed time series at the sub daily timescales suggested that the disaggregation scheme coupled with the rpblrpx model was capable of reproducing the observed statistics with reasonable accuracy in the absence of gauge data at 0 5 h intervals the r 2 values were 0 39 wet period mean intensity 0 38 wet period standard deviation 0 08 wet period lag 1 auto correlation and 0 87 wet period fraction the disaggregation scheme exhibited the worst performance in reproducing the wet period lag 1 auto correlation as this property was not used when the rpblrpx model was calibrated lastly the ifd estimates obtained using the proposed sifd framework were compared with those published by bom for different aeps and durations at the 7 selected sites despite the differences in record length and method the sifd estimates were fairly close to the bom estimates the best results were obtained for sydney with very good agreement with bom estimates br 1 01 and r 2 0 99 least error rmse 13 of the mean of the bom estimates and superior skill nse 0 97 the worst performance was observed for hobart with br of 1 43 very poor agreement with the bom estimates rmse of 66 extremely high error and nse of 0 26 limited skill although the r 2 value of 0 99 showed very good correlation between the sifd and bom ifd estimates overall the results of this study highlighted that the proposed sifd framework could provide a viable alternative for estimating unbiased ifd curves at sub hourly timescales for regions with no or limited sub hourly gauge data the sifd framework consistently underestimates the bom ifd estimates for all aeps and durations as a continuation of this work a bias correction model could be developed to alleviate the underestimation of sifd estimates the performance of the disaggregation scheme in terms of ifd curves should also be examined to disaggregate the daily gauge data into finer duration intervals i e 30

3398,intensity frequency duration ifd curves also known as intensity duration frequency idf curves in some regions are widely used to take into consideration the probability of occurrence of extreme precipitation for the design of water related infrastructure derivation of ifd curves is based on statistical analysis of observed extreme precipitation events and thus the reliability of the curves mostly depends on the record length of observations at sub hourly timescales however ground based precipitation observations are often absent or very limited in terms of spatial coverage and record length particularly in remote areas around the world given the availability of satellite derived precipitation products spps with finer spatiotemporal resolution and near global coverage there is great potential to use these products in the planning and design of infrastructure this paper proposes a novel framework sifd satellite derived ifd curves to combine long term daily gauge data and sub hourly spp to estimate ifd curves for time intervals from 0 5 to 24 h a recent variant of the random parameter bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model rpblrpx was used to disaggregate daily gauge data to derive ifd curves in the absence of sub daily rain gauge data the statistics required for the rpblrpx model were obtained using the integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg 30 min 0 1 resolution product derived from the global precipitation measurement gpm mission performance of the sifd framework was tested against gauge data from seven australian sites across a wide range of climatologies the disaggregation scheme coupled with the rpblrpx model was capable of reproducing the wet period mean intensity wet period standard deviation and wet period fraction with reasonable accuracy across the sub daily timescales the coefficient of determination r 2 values were 0 39 mean intensity 0 38 standard deviation and 0 87 wet period fraction at 0 5 h timescale furthermore despite some differences in methodology and record length the ifd estimates computed using the sifd framework were fairly close to those of the bureau of meteorology bom the skill metrics for sydney were the best with a bias ratio br of 1 01 root mean square error rmse of 13 of the mean of the bom estimates and a nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse of 0 97 the worst case was found at hobart br 1 43 rmse 66 and nse 0 26 overall the results indicate that the proposed sifd framework could provide a viable alternative to estimate unbiased ifd curves at the sub hourly timescale in the absence of adequate sub hourly ground based observations keywords intensity frequency duration curves bartlett lewis rectangular pulse model global precipitation measurement integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm australia 1 introduction intensity frequency duration ifd curves also known as intensity duration frequency idf curves in some regions describe the relationship between storm duration and the average precipitation intensity at a given frequency of occurrence and are widely used for engineering planning and design projects e g hydraulic structures such as stormwater drains and pipes conventionally where available ground based rain gauge data are used to derive ifd curves according to the following 4 steps e g koutsoyiannis et al 1998 i annual maximum series or partial duration series of precipitation intensity are prepared for a given duration ii a theoretical probability distribution function e g generalized extreme value gev is fitted to the sampled series iii the fitted probability distribution is then used to estimate precipitation intensities for a set of selected annual exceedance probabilities aeps e g 50 20 10 2 and 1 and iv for each aep the relationship between storm duration and precipitation intensity is presented graphically and or in a tabular form derivation of ifd curves requires the utilization of a long record of precipitation observations to ensure reasonable confidence when estimating precipitation intensity of small aeps from the fitted distribution record lengths of daily precipitation accumulations are adequate kidd et al 2017 however sub daily gauges are usually sparse in space with shorter record lengths and missing data are common by comparison lewis et al 2019 westra et al 2014 in australia for instance the bureau of meteorology bom has approximately 3000 daily precipitation gauge stations with more than 100 years of record the majority 2150 out of 2280 of sub daily gauge stations however have less than 40 years of record to december 2012 with almost 1400 sub daily stations having less than 20 years of data green et al 2019 further both daily and sub daily precipitation data are unevenly distributed in space for instance the populated coastal regions of eastern and south western australia have relatively high gauge network densities 5 20 per 1 1 latitude longitude grid box while some regions in western central and northern australia have very few or no rain gauges ebert and weymouth 2003 chen et al 2013 the absence of high spatiotemporal resolution rain gauge data in many countries around the world has motivated the development of several satellite derived precipitation products spps with fine temporal and spatial resolutions and quasi global coverage these products include the global precipitation measurement gpm mission derived integrated multi satellite retrievals for gpm imerg huffman et al 2019 huffman et al 2020 global satellite mapping of precipitation gsmap for gpm okamoto et al 2005 kubota et al 2007 tropical rainfall measuring mission trmm multi satellite precipitation analysis tmpa huffman et al 2007 climate prediction centre cpc morphing technique cmorph joyce et al 2004 and precipitation estimation from remotely sensed information using artificial neural networks persiann sorooshian et al 2000 amongst others these spps are extremely valuable for regions where surface based precipitation measurement facilities are either non existent or limited in terms of the spatial coverage and temporal resolution in the light of the issues mentioned above the derivation of ifd curves using spps has begun to receive attention in the literature thirty three years of daily data from the persiann cdr climate data record dataset ashouri et al 2015 was utilized to develop ifd curves in the united states for durations ranging from 1 to 60 days and aeps from 50 to 1 faridzad et al 2018 ombadi et al 2018 gado et al 2017 also used persiann cdr to perform regional frequency analysis at ungauged sites combining gauge data from neighbouring sites in colorado and california the analysis was carried out for aeps from 20 to 0 1 at the daily timescale similarly rodrigues et al 2020 estimated daily extreme precipitation amounts corresponding to 50 20 and 10 aeps with 16 years of tmpa data in northeast brazil however none of these previous studies considered sub daily storm durations in terms of using spps to derive ifd curves for sub daily durations marra et al 2017 developed ifd curves for 1 to 24 h durations and 50 to 4 aeps based on 16 years of half hourly cmporph data over the eastern mediterranean endreny and imbeah 2009 used 9 years of 3 hourly tmpa data with short records 5 24 years of sub hourly gauge data to derive ifd curves for 1 min to 24 h durations and 10 to 0 2 aeps in ghana noor et al 2021 investigated the use of gsmap both real time and gauge adjusted versions persiann and tmpa datasets to construct ifd curves from 19 years of observation in peninsular malaysia ifd curves were generated for 3 to 72 h durations and 50 to 1 aeps although these studies considered sub daily durations very short spp records all 19 years were used in the derivation of ifd curves due to the fact that longer data records of these spps were not yet available moreover the accuracy of these spps varies significantly over different parts of the world with respect to climate season and topography e g islam and cartwright 2020 stochastic precipitation generators can be used to produce long precipitation records in a recent study sun et al 2019 utilized hourly gsmap satellite data to disaggregate daily gauge data into hourly time series using the bartlett lewis rectangular pulse blrp model for a single site in singapore this approach was applied and validated only in an equatorial climate therefore it is uncertain whether this approach will provide acceptable results in regions with different climates and precipitation regimes the study in singapore used the random parameter bartlett lewis rectangular pulse rpblrp model with cell intensities from the gamma distribution this variant of the rpblrp model is not appropriate for sub hourly timescale as it does not account for any correlation between cell intensity and duration the findings reported by kaczmarska et al 2014 demonstrate that the dependency between cell intensity and duration leads to an improved performance of the rpblrp model in estimating sub hourly precipitation extremes as outlined above ifd curves using spps have so far been derived mostly for daily or longer durations or in a limited number of climatic regions in addition the only study to derive ifd curves by coupling spp with the rpblrp model was limited to the hourly duration at a single site with an equatorial climate the present study aims to extend this previous work by developing a new framework sifd satellite derived ifd curves using a new variant of the rpblrp model hereafter rpblrpx to combine daily gauge data and a sub hourly spp data to derive ifd curves for sub daily time intervals from 0 5 to 24 h the rpblrpx model addresses the dependence between cell intensity and duration to capture the precipitation variability at sub hourly timescales kaczmarska et al 2014 sifd was evaluated using precipitation data and bom ifd curves from seven australian sites across a wide range of climates 2 data and methods 2 1 sub daily gauge data and site climatology for the study period january 2001 december 2019 half hourly precipitation data were sourced from bom for seven sites distributed across different climate zones of australia fig 1 site location data completeness mean annual precipitation map and a seasonality index s i are presented in table 1 the si is expressed as follows yu 2003 1 si s w s w where s is the average precipitation over the summer months november april and w is that during the winter months may october an si value 0 13 denotes a marked wet season in summer while 0 13 denotes a marked wet season in winter yu 2003 as seen in fig 1 and table 1 five of the 7 sites are close to the coast but have substantially different climate and precipitation variability on the east coast brisbane and sydney receive almost the same amount of map however brisbane has a subtropical climate with most precipitation in summer s i 0 35 whereas sydney is temperate and precipitation is uniformly distributed throughout the year 0 13 s i 0 13 which is similar to hobart on the south western coast perth has a temperate climate receiving precipitation mostly during the winter months of may october s i 0 64 both darwin and longreach are located in the tropics where precipitation occurs almost exclusively in summer months of november april s i 0 50 although longreach has relatively low map lastly meekatharra is located in the arid region of western australia and has the lowest map of the seven sites selected this combination of sites covers almost all major precipitation zones of australia cf fig 1 half hourly precipitation data for the sites considered in the paper were available since the mid 1990s for the study period of 2001 2019 the half hourly data were first aggregated to daily totals for model validation alternative daily data for these sites were not used for model development and evaluation 2 2 satellite derived precipitation product imerg among the various spps imerg was selected as the alternative source to compute sub hourly precipitation statistics given its finer temporal 30 min and spatial 0 1 resolutions imerg was also identified as the best of five spps for australia islam et al 2020 the imerg precipitation product combines precipitation related data from various passive microwave pmw sensors and fills the gaps between two successive pmw observations with infrared ir precipitation estimates using motion vectors huffman et al 2019 huffman et al 2020 for the final product the motion vectors are derived from total precipitable water vapour tqv data of modern era retrospective analysis for research and applications version 2 merra 2 reanalysis product tan et al 2019 in the precipitation processing algorithm merged pmw ir estimates are summed over a calendar month and then bias corrected against monthly gridded gauge based dataset imerg version 06b final run product hereafter only imerg was downloaded from the website located at https disc gsfc nasa gov ssw data coverage extends from june 2000 to present 2 3 bom reference ifd estimates in australia the ifd curves provided by the bom are based on a rain gauge database encompassing measurements from 8074 daily and 2280 sub daily gauge stations across the country green et al 2015 as the spatial coverage of sub daily gauge stations is considerably limited in comparison to daily gauge stations bayesian generalised least squares regression is used to extrapolate sub daily precipitation statistics at the daily gauge stations green et al 2019 the minimum record length is 30 years for daily gauges and 8 years for sub daily gauges for site selection to estimate ifd curves in australia green et al 2019 these minimum record lengths are still considered short for accurate estimation of precipitation intensities for most of the selected aeps green and jolly 2018 for this reason regionalisation is used to reduce the uncertainty and remove the bias in estimated parameters of the probability distribution function green et al 2019 regionalisation recognises that gauge data can be combined from multiple sites within a climatologically homogeneous region to estimate the parameters of the distribution function more accurately 2 4 sifd framework overview an overview of the sifd framework used to develop satellite derived ifd curves is shown in fig 2 first the 6 parameters in the rpblrpx model are calibrated using the statistics from the 30 min imerg data this is done for each month separately to account for seasonal variability leading to 12 sets of 6 parameter values for each of the 7 sites in australia cf section 2 5 2 next the calibrated rpblrpx model is used to disaggregate daily gauge data into a half hourly time series from which other durations 0 5 h are obtained by aggregation the disaggregation is performed 100 times in order to estimate the confidence intervals directly cf section 2 5 3 finally the ifd curves are derived from the disaggregated datasets in the usual manner in this case using the gev distribution cf section 2 6 the resulting ifd curves are then compared with those of bom green et al 2019 to establish whether the proposed framework is capable of reproducing the frequency characteristics of extreme precipitation events at sub hourly timescales cf section 2 7 2 5 bartlett lewis rectangular pulse models 2 5 1 background this study used an extended version of the rpblrp model i e rpblrpx developed by kaczmarska et al 2014 the rpblrpx model introduces dependency between cell intensity and duration to reproduce the increased variability that precipitation exhibits at sub hourly timescales it is reported that the rpblrpx model outperforms other types of blrp models from sub hourly up to the daily timescale cross et al 2018 onof and wang 2020 kossieris et al 2018 the blrp model is a poisson cluster process based stochastic precipitation generator and simulates storms as clusters of cells rectangular pulses to occur in time rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 the following assumptions are associated with the bartlett lewis clustering mechanism as illustrated in fig 3 each storm i starts at a time t i solid circle following a poisson process with rate λ and consists of a random number of cells each cell j arrives at a time t ij open circle within a storm i following a second poisson process with rate β the origin of first cell coincides with the storm origin the time intervals between two successive storm and cell origins are assumed to be independent and identically distributed exponential random variables the generation of cells within a storm i terminates after a time period ν i which follows the exponential distribution with parameter γ the duration of a cell j within a storm i w ij follows the exponential distribution with parameter η the intensity of a cell j within a storm i x ij follows either the exponential distribution with average cell depth μ x or the gamma distribution with average cell depth μ x and standard deviation σ x assuming the exponential distribution of cell intensity the original version of the blrp model has five parameters i e λ β γ η and μ x although this initial version of the model is able to reproduce the basic statistics i e mean variance skewness and auto correlation of precipitation time series from hourly to daily timescales it significantly overestimates the proportion of dry periods rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 the reason is that parameters β γ and η are kept constant for all storm events which limits the reproduction of different types of storm as well as the variability within the storms kossieris et al 2018 cross et al 2018 the rpblrp model extends the original model by allowing cell duration parameter η to vary from storm to storm according to the gamma distribution with the shape parameter α and scale parameter ν rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 in the rpblrp model cell arrival rate β and storm duration rate γ also vary so that the ratios κ β η and φ γ η remain constant among different storm events the rpblrp model has six parameters namely λ α ν κ φ and μ x for the exponential distribution of cell intensity in case of using the gamma distribution for cell intensity the corresponding model parameters are λ α ν κ φ μ x and r σ x μ x to introduce dependence between cell intensity and duration kaczmarska et al 2014 modified the rpblrp model so that parameter μ x is also allowed to vary between storm events by keeping the ratio ι μ x η constant this new variant i e rpblrpx has six parameters i e λ α ν κ φ and ι for the exponentially distributed cell intensity if the gamma distribution is used for cell intensity the rpblrpx model would have 7 parameters namely λ α ν κ φ ι and r in this study the 6 parameter rpblrpx model was used to allow for the reproduction of high variability of precipitation at the sub hourly timescale this model shows better performance in reproducing the main statistical characteristics of observed precipitation data for a wide range of timescales i e from sub hourly to daily at a site in bochum germany kaczmarska et al 2014 kossieris et al 2018 2 5 2 parameter estimation the six model parameters i e λ α ν κ φ and ι were estimated by minimizing the objective function g defined as follows cowpertwait et al 2007 wheater et al 2005 2 g t 0 5 1 2 6 12 24 w 1 p t p s t p s t 2 w 2 v a r t var s t var s t 2 w 3 a c o v t acov s t acov s t 2 w 4 p d t pd s t pd s t 2 where t indicates different aggregation levels i e 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h in equation 2 p t v a r t a c o v t and p d t are the modelled mean variance lag 1 auto covariance and proportion of dry respectively in terms of the six model parameters at aggregation level t detailed formulation of these terms can be found in rodriguez iturbe et al 1987 rodriguez iturbe et al 1988 onof and wheater 1993 onof and wheater 1994 onof et al 2000 and kaczmarska et al 2014 four constants w 1 w 2 w 3 and w 4 represent the weights applied to the squared relative errors in the mean variance lag 1 auto covariance and proportion of dry respectively in the current analysis w 1 1 w 2 1 w 3 1 and w 4 1 were used to attach equal importance to these relative error components to the objective function wheater et al 2005 in equation 2 wet period mean p s p s t wet period variance var s var s t wet period lag 1 auto covariance a c o v s a c o v s t and proportion of dry pd s pd s t were computed using imerg data at the six aggregation levels i e 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h at the selected rain gauge locations having half hourly imerg precipitation depths the data at coarser timescales were obtained via aggregation the above mentioned statistics are defined as follows 3 p s l 1 n p s l n 4 var s l 1 n p s l p s 2 n 1 5 acov s l 1 n 1 p s l 1 p s p s l p s n 6 pd s n o n where subscript s represents values for imerg in equations 3 6 p s p s l is the l th imerg value in mm at a particular aggregation level e g 0 5 h n o is the number of zero imerg precipitation depth and n is the total number of imerg data in the time series in this study statistics p s var s and a c o v s were estimated from wet periods only where a wet period was defined as a 30 min precipitation accumulation greater than or equal to 0 2 mm these precipitation statistics were calculated for each calendar month separately to allow for seasonality it is worth noting that imerg represents the average precipitation depth within an area of 10 km 10 km while rain gauge records precipitation at a particular point the justification to overlook this discrepancy in scales in this instance are discussed in section 4 1 the objective function was minimized to estimate model parameter values within a given parameter space using the globalsearch algorithm from the global optimization toolbox of matlab ugray et al 2007 the lower and upper bounds of the parameters within which the parameters were estimated are given in table 2 the parameters were estimated on a monthly basis to capture the seasonal variation in the precipitation characteristics therefore 12 monthly parameter sets were obtained for each site 2 5 3 disaggregation scheme first the sequence of clusters of wet days preceded and followed by one or more dry days were obtained from the given daily time series the rpblrpx model was used to generate sequences of storms and cells for each wet period at the given sub hourly timescale the model was repeated until the generated clusters of wet days with the preceding and following one or more dry days were identical to that of the given time series secondly the cell intensities were generated and the simulated daily precipitation depths were calculated to compare with the original daily depths using the following equation koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 kossieris et al 2018 7 d k 1 l l n 2 z k c z k c 1 2 where z k and z k are the observed and simulated precipitation amounts in mm respectively for the k th day in a wet period of l days a constant c 0 1 mm was used to prevent domination of very low daily precipitation values further the logarithm was used to avoid domination of very high values for each cluster the process was repeated until the departure d was less than an acceptable limit d a the default value of d a was used in this study i e d a 0 1 as recommended kossieris et al 2018 finally generated sub hourly precipitation values for the k th day in a wet period of l days were modified according to the proportional adjustment procedure as follows koutsoyiannis and onof 2001 kossieris et al 2018 8 x m x m z k z k m 1 2 n where x m is the m th adjusted sub hourly precipitation depth in mm x m is the m th simulated sub hourly precipitation depth in mm and n is the number of sub hourly intervals in one day the rpblrpx model replicates the precipitation statistics of the observed precipitation intensities and can be used to generate multiple realisations of statistically identical precipitation series once calibrated further the proportional adjustment procedure ensures mass conservation in that generated half hourly time series of precipitation once aggregated equals the daily total exactly an ensemble of 100 realisations of 19 years data was generated to reduce the uncertainty in the random process of the rpblrpx model these random samples were used to compute disaggregated precipitation statistics at 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h temporal scales the disaggregated precipitation statistics were then compared with the observed gauge based statistics to evaluate the disaggregation scheme in the present study disaggregation of daily gauge data was performed using hyetosminute software kossieris et al 2018 which is coded in the r programming language r core team 2020 2 6 derivation of ifd curves the gev distribution was used to fit the annual maximum series ams of extreme precipitation values for 0 5 h 1 h 2 h 3 h 6 h 12 h and 24 h durations the gev distribution is a 3 parameter probability distribution function and has been widely used to model precipitation extremes faridzad et al 2018 marra et al 2017 noor et al 2021 overeem et al 2008 it combines three extreme value distributions i e gumbel type i fréchet type ii and weibull type iii into a single distribution to allow for a continuous range of possible shapes the gev cumulative distribution function f y is expressed as follows e g faridzad et al 2018 9 f y e x p 1 ξ y μ σ 1 ξ f o r ξ 0 10 f y e x p e x p y μ σ f o r ξ 0 where μ σ and ξ are the location scale and shape parameters of the distribution respectively in equations 9 and 10 y is the annual maximum series of precipitation intensity for a given duration note that shape parameter values of equal to 0 greater than 0 and less than 0 correspond to the gumbel fréchet and weibull distributions respectively the gevfit function from the statistics and machine learning toolbox of matlab was used to estimate the parameters of the gev distribution using the maximum likelihood estimation fitting method the ifd estimate y aep for a particular aep and duration was estimated using the following gev derived equations e g faridzad et al 2018 11 y aep μ σ ξ 1 l n 1 a e

wet period mean intensity wet period standard deviation wet period lag 1 auto correlation and wet period fraction was assessed using the correlation coefficient squared r 2 for the six aggregation intervals r 2 is defined as follows 13 r 2 q 1 m q d q q d q g q q g q 1 m q d q q d 2 q 1 m q g q q g 2 2 where q d q is the q th value of the disaggregated precipitation statistics q g q is the q th value of the observed gauge based statistics and m is the number of disaggregated or observed statistics q d and q g show the mean of the disaggregated and observed statistics respectively for the m number of data pairs r 2 varies between 0 and 1 it is worth mentioning here that the r 2 value for each time interval was calculated separately for each statistic to evaluate the performance of the sifd framework the ifd estimates obtained from the framework were compared with those of bom through bias ratio br root mean square error rmse r 2 and nash sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency nse rmse was also used to assess the effect of long term gauge records in the computation of ifd estimates using the proposed framework here br rmse and nse are defined as follows br is defined as the ratio of ifd estimate from the sifd framework to that of bom the perfect score of br is 1 while underestimation and overestimation will lead to values less than 1 and greater than 1 respectively 14 br u 1 u i

imerg with gauge statistics fig 4 compares 4 key precipitation statistics wet period mean wet period variance wet period lag 1 auto covariance and proportion dry computed using imerg and gauge data at aggregation intervals ranging from 0 5 to 24 h at sydney airport amo station no 66037 the circles and triangles represent the statistics over the summer november april and winter may october months respectively the face colours of the circles and triangles represent the different aggregation intervals whilst imerg has reasonably good skills in estimating the mean at different aggregation levels the dataset generally underestimates the mean in winter season see fig 4 a imerg also tends to overestimate the mean above 2 h aggregation level for some calendar months in summer it is clearly seen from fig 4 b that imerg systematically underestimates the precipitation variance throughout the year at finer 2h timescales for some winter months i e may october underestimation of the variance is also evident at coarser 1h timescales the lag 1 auto covariance is reasonably well captured by the imerg dataset even though substantial differences are observed at all timescales both in summer and winter seasons fig 4 c as seen in fig 4 d the dry proportion is well captured up to 2 h aggregation level for all seasons the winter months tend to underestimate the dry proportion and the degree of underestimation increases with the increase of aggregation level on the other hand the dry proportion is overestimated for some summer months and the overestimation increases as the aggregation level increases 3 2 comparison of rpblrpx disaggregation with gauge statistics the disaggregated 0 5 h data were compared with the observed 0 5 h data in terms of the 4 most important precipitation statistics wet period mean intensity wet period standard deviation wet period lag 1 auto correlation and wet period fraction i e 1 dry proportion figs 5 and 6 show the comparison of the raw 0 5 h and aggregated 2 h intervals respectively with each scatterplot containing 84 data points 12 months 7 sites the colours of the points in the plots indicate site locations the coefficient of determination r 2 of the linear regression between the disaggregated and observed statistics is shown for each of the six aggregation intervals in table 3 the disaggregation scheme tends to overestimate the observed statistics at the 0 5 h timescale with r 2 values of 0 39 and 0 38 for the wet period mean intensity and standard deviation respectively see fig 5 and table 3 wet period fractions are well reproduced with the r 2 value equal to 0 87 although the values tend to be underestimated by the disaggregation scheme with the r 2 value of 0 08 the scheme shows the worst performance in reproducing the wet period lag 1 auto correlation it should be mentioned that the wet period lag 1 auto correlation was not included in the objective function during the estimation of rpblrpx model parameters thus the preservation of this property is not guaranteed by the rpblrpx model one can see that the discrepancy between the disaggregated and observed statistics is reduced considerably at 2 h aggregation level compare fig 6 with fig 5 for the respective statistics from table 3 it is also evident that the performance of the disaggregation scheme increases as the aggregation interval increases note that the perfect correlation at the daily duration see r 2 1 00 in table 3 is due to the proportional adjustment procedure within the scheme i e the disaggregation is constrained to have a daily aggregation equal to that of the gauge data see also section 2 5 3 overall the results are encouraging in the context of reproducing the key precipitation statistics across the timescales of interest because no sub daily gauge data were used by the rpblrpx model within the disaggregation scheme 3 3 ifd curves fig 7 compares the ifd curves published by bom and those estimated using the sifd framework median and 95 confidence intervals for sydney airport amo station no 66037 in most cases the median of the sifd estimates is close to the bom ifd curves which are calculated by integrating a large number of gauges and longer record lengths for frequency analysis see section 2 3 larger deviations from the bom estimates are observed for lower aeps further the 95 confidence intervals from the sifd framework become larger as the aeps decrease see fig 7 b and 7 c these larger deviations and confidence intervals at the lower aeps are attributed to the short record length of the disaggregated precipitation data i e 19 years the median and 95 confidence intervals are identical at daily timescale see fig 7 b and 7 c since the proportional adjustment procedure within the disaggregation scheme ensures full consistency between generated and observed daily time series see section 2 5 3 as shown in fig 7 b and 7 c the confidence intervals decrease with increasing storm duration up to 6 h duration the bom ifd curves are within the 95 confidence intervals while the 12 h and 24 h durations are outside one reason for this is the shorter record length of the disaggregated data compared to the longer gauge record length used for the development of bom ifd curves another reason is the difference between the sifd method and the method employed by bom bom uses gev distribution fitted using l moments to estimate the intensity and frequency of extreme precipitation events green et al 2019 further regionalisation is used by bom to reduce the uncertainty emerging from the limited years of observation during the estimation of l moments which are subsequently used to determine the parameters of a gev distribution regionalisation is based on the assumption that gauge data at all stations within a given region have the same frequency characteristics of extreme precipitation events which may not always be valid the performance metrics of the ifd estimates obtained using sifd with respect to the ifd estimates of bom are presented in table 4 for different aeps br varies between 0 94 and 0 95 and r 2 between 0 86 and 0 93 indicating very good agreement between the sifd and bom estimates it is noted however that sifd tends to underestimate the ifd estimates by 7 to 14 on average the rmse values are relatively high varying between 30 and 36 of the mean of the bom estimates the nse values are in the range 0 85 to 0 92 indicating very good skill of the sifd framework the performance statistics for different durations indicate that the sifd framework exhibits the poorest performance for 24 h duration with br of 0 74 rmse of 34 and nse of 0 52 only r 2 has its lowest value 0 68 for 0 5 h duration for the 6 h duration the sifd estimates have zero bias i e br 1 the best values for rmse r 2 and nse are 20 0 86 and 0 84 respectively which are obtained for the 1 h and 2 h durations out of the seven selected sites the sifd framework exhibits the worst performance at hobart with serious overestimation br 1 40 extremely high error rmse 60 and limited skill nse 0 30 although the r 2 value of 0 99 indicates very good correlation between the sifd and bom estimates the proposed framework also performs poorly with severe underestimation br 0 70 and very large error rmse 50 at longreach the sifd performs the best for sydney with br of 1 01 rmse of 13 r 2 of 0 99 and nse of 0 97 4 discussion 4 1 differences in the spatial scale the imerg statistics are fairly good and can be used to compute the rpblrpx model parameters apart from other errors of imerg associated with the sensors of observation sampling and estimation algorithms the discrepancy in the precipitation statistics between imerg and gauge are likely attributed to the spatial scales of the two datasets imerg provides an average value over a grid cell area of 10 km 10 km whereas gauge data are point measurements this scale gap was not considered in the current analysis as the imerg statistics were used to estimate the rpblrpx model parameters only furthermore the proportional adjustment procedure in the disaggregation scheme ensures that the generated half hourly series when aggregated to daily totals is identical to the given daily gauge record and overcomes possible under or overestimation by imerg with respect to gauge precipitation depths see section 2 5 3 in other words the sifd framework is essentially unbiased as the timescale approaches to 24 h 4 2 effect of record length 4 2 1 imerg due to the relatively short record length of imerg i e 19 years ifd curves were constructed for 50 20 10 and 5 aeps only however long records of daily gauge data can be used to construct ifd curves for lower aeps e g 1 aep using the proposed sifd framework traditionally the blrp model and its variants are calibrated based on the observed precipitation statistics under the assumption of temporal stationarity of the precipitation process kaczmarska et al 2015 park et al 2019 to address the monthly variation in precipitation characteristics the blrp model is typically calibrated for each month separately for a given duration a single set of observed statistics e g the mean variance auto covariance and proportion dry is used to calibrate the model regardless of the record length of observed time series being applied to estimate the set of statistics kaczmarska et al 2014 kossieris et al 2018 according to the assumption of stationarity the disaggregated precipitation statistics should be the same as the observed statistics for each month irrespective of the record length of daily gauge data being disaggregated therefore it is no longer necessary to validate the disaggregation scheme for the period when imerg is absent i e prior to june 2000 and the record length of imerg does not affect the selection of record length of daily gauge data 4 2 2 gauge it is worth noting here that the gauge data used to derive bom ifd estimates is identical to that of this study at the daily timescale despite the similarity at the daily timescale ifd estimates from the sifd framework considerably underestimate the bom estimates for all aeps due to the differences in record length and method see fig 7 b and 7 c in order to evaluate the effect of record length on ifd estimates computed using the proposed framework the entire daily gauge record is used for frequency analysis at the 7 selected sites fig 8 compares the ifd estimates derived from the disaggregated datasets 19 years and long term gauge records using the sifd framework with those of bom for 24 h duration the linear regression line passing through the origin is shown in each plot the record lengths of daily time series are provided in table 1 for these sites for the disaggregated data 19 years the sifd framework tends to underestimate the bom ifd estimates with different levels of underestimation for different aeps at the selected sites see fig 8 a the ifd estimates computed from the disaggregated datasets show considerable underestimation for longreach sydney and brisbane significant improvements are observed for longreach hobart and sydney when the entire gauge record is used for frequency analysis compare fig 8 b with fig 8 a meekatharra and perth show little changes in underestimation while the underestimation for darwin increases there is limited change for brisbane fig 8 as the record length of 25 years for brisbane is relatively short the sifd framework shows an improvement from 26 underestimation to 20 on average for these sites when long term daily gauge data are used fig 8 in addition the standard error se of the estimated slope is also reduced i e there is less scatter again this is likely a result of more daily data being used for each aep the effectiveness of the longer record length in improving the performance of the proposed sifd framework was assessed using rmse of the ifd estimates computed from the disaggregated datasets 19 years and long term gauge records for 24 h duration merging information for all the study sites the results are shown in table 5 where it can be clearly seen that the rmse values for ifd estimates corresponding to lower aeps are always higher for both datasets the ifd estimates derived from the long term gauge records indicate lower rmse values than those derived from the disaggregated data regardless of the choice of aep suggesting the effectiveness of the long record lengths in reducing the errors in the ifd estimates further the reduction in rmse is more prominent for the lower aeps 5 conclusions and future works in this study a new framework to estimate satellite derived ifd curves sifd has been developed for sub daily durations from 0 5 to 24 h by combining half hourly imerg and daily gauge data this is of particular interest to regions where sub hourly gauge data are either absent or limited in terms of spatial coverage and record length a recent variant of the rpblrp model that considers the dependence between cell intensity and duration rpblrpx was successfully used for the disaggregation of daily gauge data to half hourly time series based on four critical precipitation statistics estimated based on half hourly imerg data ifd curve estimates were then estimated in the usual manner by fitting the gev distribution to the annual series of peak intensities from the disaggregated data the performance of the spp rpblrpx disaggregation scheme was evaluated using precipitation data observed at seven australian sites across a wide range of climates comparison of imerg and observed statistics indicated that imerg showed reasonably good agreement with the observed statistics across the timescales the observed differences between the statistics of imerg and gauge records can be attributed to the spatial scales of these datasets point gauge data versus 10 km 10 km imerg data correction of this issue was not considered in the present study because a the imerg statistics were not used directly in the rpblrpx model and were only applied to determine the rpblrpx model parameters and b the proportional adjustment procedure within the disaggregation scheme ensures full consistency between the generated and observed daily series and avoids any biases in the imerg data comparison of the statistics derived from the disaggregated and observed time series at the sub daily timescales suggested that the disaggregation scheme coupled with the rpblrpx model was capable of reproducing the observed statistics with reasonable accuracy in the absence of gauge data at 0 5 h intervals the r 2 values were 0 39 wet period mean intensity 0 38 wet period standard deviation 0 08 wet period lag 1 auto correlation and 0 87 wet period fraction the disaggregation scheme exhibited the worst performance in reproducing the wet period lag 1 auto correlation as this property was not used when the rpblrpx model was calibrated lastly the ifd estimates obtained using the proposed sifd framework were compared with those published by bom for different aeps and durations at the 7 selected sites despite the differences in record length and method the sifd estimates were fairly close to the bom estimates the best results were obtained for sydney with very good agreement with bom estimates br 1 01 and r 2 0 99 least error rmse 13 of the mean of the bom estimates and superior skill nse 0 97 the worst performance was observed for hobart with br of 1 43 very poor agreement with the bom estimates rmse of 66 extremely high error and nse of 0 26 limited skill although the r 2 value of 0 99 showed very good correlation between the sifd and bom ifd estimates overall the results of this study highlighted that the proposed sifd framework could provide a viable alternative for estimating unbiased ifd curves at sub hourly timescales for regions with no or limited sub hourly gauge data the sifd framework consistently underestimates the bom ifd estimates for all aeps and durations as a continuation of this work a bias correction model could be developed to alleviate the underestimation of sifd estimates the performance of the disaggregation scheme in terms of ifd curves should also be examined to disaggregate the daily gauge data into finer duration intervals i e 30 min where the statistical properties of the target timescale are not introduced in the fitting procedure of the blrp model the use of gamma weibull and pareto distribution of cell intensity could be considered to evaluate the potential improvement in the estimations of extremes kossieris et al 2018 kaczmarska et al 2014 one additional parameter is required to use these distributions see section 2 5 1 alternatively inclusion of the third order moment i e skewness of precipitation depths in the fitting procedure may significantly improve the estimation of extremes across all timescales kim and onof 2020 onof and wang 2020 the performance of spp fitted blrp model without the disaggregation scheme could also be investigated for regions without any ground based observations credit authorship

3399,understanding water and sediment variations of the yellow river is significant for future management of the river from perspectives of water resources utilization and ecology protection the study characterized the temporal and spatial variations in its flow and sediment load based on the daily datasets of the past 60 years from all main stem hydrological gauge stations and proposed a new five segment river reach division scheme instead of the traditional three or four segment division furthermore we distinguished the key factors and their contributions that caused the flow and sediment variations offering reference for the river management strategies as per the local conditions a significant decreasing trend in annual flow and sediment load was observed in the river basin except for certain reaches in segment 1 upstream of tangnaihai the maximum flood event duration decreased significantly in segment 2 from tangnaihai to shizuishan the flood volume and sediment load during the maximum flood event also showed significant downward trend in segments 2 5 downstream of tangnaihai operation of cascade reservoirs especially in segment 2 has smoothed the annual flow process in the upstream sediment trapping in the reservoirs had little effect on the change in sediment load but reservoir regulation of flow greatly influenced siltation in the upstream river channel water abstraction has also played a significant role in flow variation consequently the ratio of flood sediment load to annual sediment load decreased significantly in the upper reach but increased significantly in the lower reach temporally the recorded period was divided into three periods using change point detection pre 1987 1987 1999 and post 1999 the ratio of flood volume to annual flow decreased significantly in the first two periods and generally increased post 1999 with the impact of aforementioned anthropogenic activities keywords river reach division scheme hydrological variation maximum event flood anthropogenic impact 1 introduction on a global scale inter annual streamflow regime and seasonal streamflow pattern of rivers have undergone large variations in recent decades along with climate change and intensive human activities this in turn has affected the regularity of water use in human society and the requirement of ecological system and has eventually induced a series of challenges for river management singh et al 2021 many regions including asia dudgeon 2000 wang et al 2011 europe batalla et al 2004 grizzetti et al 2017 america pegg et al 2003 and africa siam and eltahir 2017 are confronting various difficulties imposed by such hydrological alterations to be specific hydrological alteration in the yellow river the second largest river in china has affected the ecological environment and the water security for more than 110 million people living in the basin the flow in the river showed a significant downward trend in the past 60 years yang et al 2004 the flow at the estuary decreased by more than 70 during the 1950 s 1990 s the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources thus became a severe issue the yellow river is also globally famous for its highest sediment concentration and the large volume of sediment load it receives from the loess plateau sediment has been the crux of many problems in the yellow river especially because the excessive sediment led to serious siltation and suspended riverbed in the lower reach such high sediment load however dropped by more than 80 in the recent 60 years zhao et al 2014 the annual average sediment transport at the tongguan station fig 1 from 1919 to 1960 was 1 6 billion tons yr since 2000 it however decreased to only 0 26 billion tons yr later in 2015 it furtherly reduced to merely 0 055 billion tons yr in addition to the overall decreasing trends of annual flow and sediment load the seasonal patterns of streamflow and sediment load also greatly altered the proportion of flow in flood season to annual flow decreased the flood processes in the upper and middle reaches were levelled due to the demand for flood control and power generation minor floods aggravated channel siltation and caused the frequent occurrence of small flow discharge but high water level xu 1999 alteration of the natural flow regime and over exploitation of water resources may have adverse effects on the stability and integrity of the yellow river ecosystem for example the wetland areas such as marshes and meadows in the yellow river delta have significantly reduced li et al 2009 anthropogenic activities such as rising water resources utilization tang et al 2008 yang et al 2004 yu et al 2013 hydropower exploitation wang et al 2007 yang et al 2004 and water soil conservation feng et al 2016 peng et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 are among the key ecological stresses on the river since the 1970s landscape engineering terracing and construction and operation of check dams and reservoirs were the primary factors causing reduction in sediment load since the 1990s a large scale vegetation restoration project have additionally contributed to further reduction in soil erosion wang et al 2016 in summary previous studies were usually based on data from certain hydrological gauge stations and hence focused in a temporal perspective systematic and comprehensive report on the variations both temporally and spatially concerned based on data from gauge stations along the whole basin is lacking to filling the gap the present work aimed to make the following progresses 1 characterizing quantitatively and in much detail the spatiotemporal variations of flow sediment load of the yellow river based on daily datasets over the past 60 years from all of the 27 main stem hydrological gauge stations 2 proposing a new river reach division scheme corresponding to such flow sediment load analysis and 3 furtherly identifying quantitative effects of key factors causing the variations in flow and sediment load such progresses will benefit the yellow river s future management especially water resources allocation 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and drains into the bohai sea with a length of 5464 km and an area of 7 95 105 km2 there are 27 hydrological stations along the main stem labeled as 1 to 27 from the upstream to the downstream fig 1 and table 1 continuously monitoring and recording the daily flow discharge and sediment load in the river traditionally the yellow river is divided into three or four reaches depending on whether the source region is included into the upper reach the source region that is primarily located in the upstream of station 4 tangnaihai tnh where the alpine eco environment is vulnerable the upper reach upstream of station 15 toudaoguai tdg which is generally regarded as the major water yield region the middle reach between stations 15 tdg and 18 tongguan tg which is the major source of sediment load and the lower reach downstream of station 18 tg frequent cooling and drying climate accompanied with continuous deforestation in the last 3000 years have drastically reduced water yield in the basin the situation simultaneously enhanced the variability of water yield resulting in fluctuations in peak discharges of water and sediment load chen et al 2012 for over 2600 years the 800 km long lower yellow river downstream of the station no 18 frequently shifted its course between the bohai sea and the yellow sea largely owing to the heavily loaded flow discharge chen et al 2015 2 2 datasets the datasets of daily flow and sediment load available for the periods of 1934 2015 and 1950 2015 respectively were obtained from all the stations table 1 while encountering missing data for a few years in some stations the time series were interpolated by following the rules below 1 in the case of missing data for a single year the data were derived using the averages of flow or sediment concentration on the corresponding days in the previous and following years 2 in the case of missing data for consecutive year the data were derived using the averages of flow or sediment concentration on the corresponding days in the previous and following stations 2 3 methodologies 2 3 1 river reach division scheme according to hydrological characteristics clustering analysis ca is a widely applied method that classifies rivers based on their hydrological characteristics hannah et al 2005 hannah et al 2000 kingston et al 2011 ca serves as a technique to categorize data in order to minimize intra group variance while maximizing inter group variance wilks 2011 this is consistent with the concern on the hydrological variability from one reach to another ca required an equal length of series as the input matrix so the continuous discharge dataset from 1964 to 2004 and the continuous sediment load dataset from 1960 to 2009 were used as input datasets for river reach division initially the daily datasets were standardized in z score to avoid the influence of absolute magnitude and to focus on the variation among the different reaches subsequently agglomerative hierarchical ca was performed using ward s algorithm for classification the clustering dendrogram was used to determine the number of clusters each of which represented one reach of the river while deciding the number of clusters hypothesis testing and permutational analysis of variance permanova were applied it helped to state the significances of differences among the clusters that were derived using ca permanova is a non parametric multivariate statistical test anderson 2001 it measures the sum of squares within and between clusters by calculating the distance between two objects a statistic was constructed for f test with a significance level of 0 05 this method requires no assumption about the distributions or correlations of the variables and can help users to make rigorous probability statement depicting differences between the clusters principal component analysis pca was undertaken to derive a multivariate matrix for permanova pca converted the original variables into linearly uncorrelated variables termed as principal components pcs pcs explaining the variance of over 90 were given as input in permanova with using the clustering results for discharge and sediment load series as priori reaches the significance of differences between each of the two reaches were tested a matlab toolbox developed by jones 2014 was applied for multivariate data analysis 2 3 2 time series analysis we conducted time series analysis on multiple indicators of the hydrological variation we introduced the coefficient of variations of flow cvf and sediment load cvs to show the degree of intra annual dispersion cvf and cvs were calculated as follows 1 c vi σ i x i i f s where x i is the mean of the daily flow sediment load time series of each year at each station and σ i is the standard deviation of the same series the change point in the hydrological trend can help to locate indicate the time when climate change or human activities begun seriously altering the natural flow regime a statistical method developed by lavielle was used to detect such abrupt changes in the variance of signals lavielle 2005 various functions in matlab were employed to analyze the monthly series of discharge and sediment load the nonparametric mann kendall method was used for trend analysis in the hydrological series this method is based on the hypothesis that data in the time series tested is independent and identically distributed gao et al 2012 yue et al 2002 2 3 3 flood analysis maximum flood event was identified using a hydrograph recession algorithm vogel and kroll 1992 before employing the recession algorithm the daily discharge series was smoothed out by savitzky golay smoothing filters orfanidis 1995 these filters are more effective than standard averaging fir filters a recession begins when a smoothing record begins to decrease and ends when a smoothing record begin to increase correspondently a possible flood event begins when a smoothing record begins to increase and ends as a recession end the annual maximum flood event is the flood with the largest peak flow flood duration the coefficient of variations of flood discharge cvf for flood flood volume and the ratio of flood volume to the annual flow are selected indices for the description of the flow regime variation cvf for flood was calculated as eq 1 and the only difference was to cut the whole year time series to the annual maximum flood event for sediment load we calculated the sediment load volume for the maximum flood event and its ratio to annual sediment load as they indicated the contribution of maximum floods to the sediment load 3 results 3 1 river reach division the clustering dendrograms of hierarchical ca relating to discharge and sediment load are shown in fig 3 the horizontal axis represents the station codes both discharge and sediment load clusters show that the yellow river can be divided into five reaches most of the division schemes are the same except some disagreement on station 22 where discharge data indicates the station in cluster 4 18 22 while sediment data indicates the station in cluster 5 22 27 as the input sediment series for ca cover longer period than the input discharge series the division scheme derived from sediment series was taken preferentially and applied in the further analyses in summary the yellow river is divided into the five reaches as follows r1 no 1 4 hhy to tnh r2 no 5 12 gd to szs r3 no 13 17 bygl to lm r4 no 18 21 tg to hyk r5 no 22 27 jht to lj permanova test indicates the significance of difference among the clusters for the discharge series the top three pcs explained 92 2 of the total variance and were chosen as representative variables with redundancy reduced the five clusters showed significant difference p 0 05 table 2 pairwise comparison for each of the two groups also indicated significant difference between them for the sediment load series the top two pcs explained 91 0 of the total variance similarly both the inter cluster and pairwise comparisons showed significant difference table 3 thereby both the discharge and sediment load analyses verified the robustness of the yellow river reach division scheme as illustrated in fig 4 correlation coefficients of annual flow series among the stations within each reach could explain their coherences as shown in fig 4 b in r1 the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 646 to 0 984 with a mean of 0 795 the ranges for the other four reaches r2 r3 r4 and r5 were 0 902 0 996 0 983 0 998 0 985 0 997 and 0 977 0 999 respectively it revealed that the homogeneity within each reach was high except for the source region that is well known with its high heterogeneities in geomorphology and hydrology 3 2 abrupt change points in the discharge and sediment load series the discrete wavelet transform was employed to detect changes in the variance of monthly discharge and sediment load series e g hyk in fig 5 at all the hydrological stations fig 6 for discharge series most of the stations in the river source region r1 showed no abrupt change point indicating inter annual stability for the other reaches r2 r5 abrupt changes were detected in the period of 1986 1996 especially 1986 1989 during which 21 stations located in the downstream of tnh showed abrupt changes to be specific most of the abrupt changes occurred in the year 1986 compared to discharge series the change points in sediment load series mostly occurred later as a result of delayed response to flow change and the flow change had to be over certain threshold wu et al 2007 fig 6 similar to the situation of discharge no abrupt change was detected in most of the stations in the source region where little sediment yield and limited human disturbance the only exception was the hhy station where change point was detected in 1993 it was perhaps owing to construction of the large huangheyuan reservoir capacity 25 01 108 m3 in the upstream of hhy station in the 1990s in the other four reaches 12 stations were detected with abrupt change points during the period of 1996 2000 more specific 9 of these 12 stations located in the lower reaches r4 and r5 where 90 of sediment load series declined abruptly after 1996 especially most abrupt changes occurred in the year 1999 at qtx with drainage area ratio 33 0 szs 37 4 and smx 88 7 the abrupt changes in sediment load was observed before 1980s earlier than the changes observed in most of the other stations these abrupt changes however took place exactly after the large reservoirs being established in the upstream reaches for instance the liujiaxia reservoir ljxr and yanguoxia reservoir ygxr capacity 57 and 2 2 108 m3 constructed in 1958 and 1969 respectively caused abrupt changes to sediment load at qtx and szs in the lower reaches large reservoirs also caused such abrupt changes e g the sanmenxia reservoir smxr capacity 354 108 m3 construction beginning in 1957 caused the abrupt change in sediment load at smx 3 3 spatial and temporal annual hydrological variation based on the findings from change point detection the times series of discharge and sediment load were divided into three periods pre 1987 1987 1999 and after 1999 for each period the average annual discharge sediment load and their coefficient of variations were calculated and plotted figs 7 and 8 annual discharge of the 27 stations decreased by a range of 9 to 64 from pre 1987 to the period of 1987 1999 the annual discharge of 16 stations mainly in the lower reaches r3 r5 continued decreasing by a range of 1 to 24 from the period of 1987 1999 to post 1999 in contrast the annual discharge of the other 11 stations increased during these two periods especially after 1999 the reduction of discharge in the lower reaches of yellow river was so severe that the highest discharge appeared in the upper reach r2 instead of in the lower reach r5 which used to be the case before 1987 the coefficient of variation of average annual discharge cvf was in a narrow range 0 62 0 92 for the entire yellow river before 1987 however after 1987 cvf scattered along the river the cvf was a low ebb in the upper reach r2 while it increased rapidly in the lower reaches especially in r5 fig 7 b the trend of annual sediment load was similar to annual flow from the period pre 1987 to the period of 1987 1999 with all series declining by 16 70 the annual sediment load of most stations continued reducing from the period of 1987 1999 to post 1999 especially in the downstream of tg the annual sediment load reduced by over 50 from the period of 1987 1999 to the post 1999 with a remarkable decreasing of up to 95 at xld and up to 91 at hyk increments in flow and sediment load between every two gauge stations can reflect changing conditions that affects flow and sediment yield in the corresponding areas including natural conditions and human activities such as water utilization soil erosion water and soil conservation etc to reduce the influence of drainage area flow as well as the sediment load increments were standardized as modulus by area between the gauge stations fig 9 from pre 1987 to the period of 1987 1999 the absolute value of negative water increment became larger in the regions between lz and qtx and the downstream of hyk fig 9 a c after 1999 flow reduction became severe in the region between lz and qtx but still less notable in the downstream of hyk the regions between tdg and tg was one of the major water yield regions before 1987 the flow increment per unit area here later decreased distinctly and eventually became negative after 1987 especially in the region between tdg and wb the regions from tnh to xhy was the main sediment yield region in the upper yellow river before 1987 fig 9 a however sediment load increment modulus in this region decreased by over 60 in the periods of 1987 1999 and after 1999 the region between qtx and tdg comprising the largest irrigation zone in the upper yellow river the modulus there turned from positive pre 1987 to negative in 1987 1999 fig 9 d and e the modulus in the region between tdg and tg that contributed most to the sediment load was the largest in the basin during the periods of pre 1987 and 1987 1999 the modulus however after 1999 sharply reduced from 2 320 000 kg km2 to 650 000 kg km2 by contrast sediment load increment modulus increased in the regions of tg smx and xld lk after 1999 3 4 variation of annual maximum flood events 3 4 1 trends and variations of flood characteristics for each hydrological station the maximum flood events and the largest peak flow was identified for every year using the datasets shown in fig 2 four indices were employed to describe the flood characteristics 1 duration 2 coefficient of variation for flood 3 flood volume and 4 the ratio of flood volume to annual flow results of mann kendall test were illustrated with marks on the top of figs 10 and 12 maximum flood duration was found significantly decreasing at the 11 stations fig 10 eight of which were located in the upper reach r2 with cascade of reservoirs built after 1960s the flood events also showed different characteristics in the three different periods before 1987 1987 1999 and after 1999 their average magnitude in the different periods can reflect decadal variation of flood characteristics before 1987 flood duration curves changed along the river especially the flood duration in the upstream of xh between xh and tdg and in the downstream of tdg varied significantly for instance the duration of maximum flood event on an average was 39 6 days in the upstream of xh which decreased to 28 5 days between xh and tdg and eventually came down to only 20 3 days in the downstream of tdg the flood wave type also displayed significant difference from the upstream to the downstream similarly cvf for the maximum flood events also indicated such difference fig 10 on an average the cvf for flood was around 0 313 in the upper reaches r1 and r2 while it increased to an average of 0 412 in the lower reaches the degree of dispersion of flood process was higher in the reaches r3 r5 the different flood wave types at the stations xh tdg and hyk drainage area ratio 94 3 were illustrated in fig 11 taking the year 1984 as an example at xh and tdg durations of the maximum flood events were relatively longer over more than 30 days but the flood peaks were rather lower 4000 m3 s in contrast the duration was relatively shorter but the flood peaks were much higher at hyk as indicated by the narrow range of coefficient of variations 0 62 0 92 for average annual discharge at all the gauge stations before 1987 the natural flow regime was stable in the entire basin moreover during this period the coefficient of variations for ratio of the annual flood season flow to the annual flow was also stable in a narrow range of 0 52 0 63 which was also the least in the three periods after 1987 the flow regime was significantly altered the flood duration at the 21 stations decreased from pre 1987 to the period of 1987 1999 more specific in the upper reach r2 flood duration decreased by over 35 60 however it varied in a small scale in the lower reaches r4 and r5 during all of the three periods after 1999 the flood duration increased at the 22 stations compared to the period of 1987 1999 e g the flood duration increased by over 40 at the tnh and tdg in the source reach r1 only at the hhy the flood volume declined significantly however in the reaches r2 to r5 volumes of the maximum flood events showed statistically a significant decreasing trend except for station xld fig 12 spatial wise the flood volume in the upper reach r2 decreased by the maximum extent from over 50 108 m3 to 18 108 m3 the flood volume decreased by over 50 at the 19 stations from pre 1987 to the period 1987 1999 after 1999 the flood volume increased at the 19 stations nine of which increased by over 20 compared with the period of 1987 1999 the ratio of flood volume to the annual flow decreased significantly for the entire period at the 12 stations including all the ones in the upper reach r2 fig 12 the ratio declined at the 25 stations in the period of 1987 1999 compared to pre 1987 with the 7 stations in r2 decreased by over 50 to be more specific the ratio was over 17 in r2 before 1987 higher than the ratio observed in the lower reaches r4 and r5 but then reduced to lower than 8 in 1987 1999 and turned to be the lowest in the basin after 1999 the ratio increased at 20 stations compared to 1987 1999 it even reached to the highest value for the entire period at 8 stations 3 4 2 trends and variation for sediment load during flood events the sediment load volume for the maximum flood event and its ratio to annual sediment load was evaluated the results of the mann kendall test for these two indices were illustrated in fig 13 the flood sediment load from pre 1987 to 1987 1999 displayed significant decreasing trends at the 18 stations including all ones in the reaches r2 to r5 except for smx and xld fig 13 at smx and xld the flood sediment load still increased despite a decrease in both annual sediment load and annual flow after 1999 this index furtherly reduced at the 19 stations with 16 ones showing reduction over 50 at xld and hyk the reduction was as high as over 90 the ratio of flood sediment load to annual sediment load decreased significantly at the 6 stations hhy tnh xc lz and xhy while increased at another 3 stations as lk lj located in the lower reach r5 from pre 1987 to 1987 1999 the ratio declined at all the ten stations in r1 to r3 and increased in the remaining stations after 1999 the ratio decreased at almost all the stations except for the ones in the lower reach r5 4 discussion in the recent 60 years a large number of human activities have emerged throughout the yellow river basin that altered the hydrological geomorphological and ecological status of the river and its basin according to this study the hydrological characteristics of the yellow river suggest that the river be divided into five reaches each of which experienced and are experiencing different alterations caused by climate change and anthropogenic impact therefore understanding the certain changes in nature and society for each of the reaches will benefit their nature based solutions for river management by linking all the spatial and temporal changes in hydrological characteristic with the specific changes in climate conditions and human activities in the yellow river we could explain the hydrological variations to a very large extend hereby we specifically focus on the reaches that showed remarkable hydrological variations and try to explain the major factors and mechanisms that caused the abrupt changes and spatial and temporal hydrological variations to be specific for the upper and lower reaches the effects of reservoir regulation and water resources utilization on alteration of discharge and sediment load are discussed with detailed data and evidences as follows 4 1 effects of reservoir regulation on alteration of flow and sediment load up till 2018 more than 30 reservoirs have already been constructed along the main stem of the yellow river fig 14 out of these reservoirs 17 are located in the upper reach from tnh to szs including the huge reservoirs liujiaxia ljxr and longyangxia lyxr capacity 247 108 m3 their regulation for power generation flood control water supply and navigation has altered inter and intra annual flow patterns since impoundment of lyxr in 1986 its joint operation with ljxr has smoothed seasonal streamflow and caused the significant reduce in the duration of maximum flood events the dispersion degree of streamflow and the ratio of flood season flow to annual flow figs 7 and 10 regulation of the reservoirs is thus regarded as the main cause for abrupt change in flow and the change point in the year 1986 in the upper reaches fig 15 a illustrates annual sediment deposition in ljxr and lyxr in the period of 1968 2005 during 1968 1986 ljxr intercepted averagely 0 77 108 tons yr of sediment after 1986 the annual sediment deposition reduced to an average of 0 43 108 t a and 0 29 108 tons yr in the periods of 1987 1999 and 2000 2005 respectively mann kendall trend test also showed that the annual sediment load intercepted by ljxr decreased significantly during the period of 1987 2005 meanwhile lyxr trapped around 0 2 108 tons of sediment per year between 1987 and 1999 in 1999 2005 the mean annual sediment deposition in lyxr was around 0 17 108 tons which was still close to the previous period during 1987 1999 the annual sediment intercepted by lyxr and ljxr together was 0 63 108 tons yr which was lower than the amount it received between the years 1968 1986 after 2005 12 more reservoirs were established successively in the upstream of qtx figs 14 16 according to the estimates these reservoirs including lyxr and ljxr intercepted approximately 0 43 108 tons of sediment per year during the period of 2000 2014 which was yet lower than the quantity intercepted during the period of 1987 1999 compared with the upper reaches there were fewer reservoirs in the middle and lower reaches in the midst of those 6 established reservoirs including sanmenxia smxr and xiaolangdi xldr dominated in sediment interception and regulation since the beginning of smxr operation in 1960 it rapidly received massive fluvial sediment deposition fig 15 b until 1967 the reservoir already trapped around 61 85 108 tons of sediment since 1965 the operational mode of smxr has changed several times which alleviated the sediment deposition during 1960 1986 the average amount of sediment trapped by this reservoir was 2 29 108 tons yr which was 19 9 of average annual sediment load at xld the average interception however reduced to 0 79 108 tons yr during the period of 1987 1999 from 1960 1986 to 1987 1999 the annual sediment load increment between tdg and xld decreased from 8 65 108 tons yr to 7 18 108 tons yr in another word instead of trapping sediment smxr released sediment to the downstream and thus contribution of reservoir trapping sediment to reduction of sediment load was negative the xldr started operating and intercepting sediment in 1998 the annual sediment interception was 2 15 108 tons yr between 2000 and 2017 additionally the other reservoirs along the main stem between tdg to lm trapped another 0 29 108 tons of sediment per year after 1999 hu et al 2012 as a result between tdg xld from 1987 1999 to post 2000 sediment intercepted by the reservoirs increased by 1 65 108 tons yr which accounted for 19 9 of reduction of annual sediment load fig 16 4 2 impacts of water utilization on alteration of flow and sediment load water utilization throughout the yellow river basin has played a crucial role on reduction of annual flow this paper collected and synthesized several water utilization datasets which only took the surface water from the river basin into consideration from different researches hou et al 2012 hu et al 2008 liu and zhang 2004 liu 2016 yang et al 2004 besides these datasets were further calibrated using the data obtained from the yellow river water resources bulletin yrcc 1998 2017 variation of water utilization was analyzed to assess its impact on flow alteration from the upstream to the downstream of the river in the upper reaches upstream of tdg the annual water utilization for irrigation and other demands was around 104 7 108 m3 during the period 1960 1987 fig 17 that was equivalent to 41 5 of the observed annual flow at tdg later in 1987 1999 the annual water utilization in this region further increased to 123 9 108 m3 meanwhile the annual flow at tdg decreased from 252 3 108 m3 to 163 8 108 m3 the water utilization increment thus accounted for approximately 21 7 of the flow reduction fig 18 from 1987 1999 to 1999 2017 the annual water utilization further reached to 129 2 108 m3 and the increment exceeded the flow reduction at tdg i e contributing to 126 4 of the flow reduction most of the upstream water utilization took place in the region of lz tdg where the large irrigated areas e g qingtongxia hetao and weijing were located for specific hetao irrigated area was the largest water consumer its average annual water utilization was around 52 of the total annual water utilization in lz tdg from 1960 1986 to 1987 1999 the water utilization increment in this region contributed 87 1 to the flow reduction from 1987 1999 to 2000 2017 the annual flow in lz tdg declined by 18 9 108 m3 and 46 9 of such reduction was attributed to water utilization increment as shown in fig 17 b water utilization continued growing in the three periods and the flow deficit in the region lz tdg thus became severe continuously annual water utilization in the upstream of lz was estimated to be around 21 9 108 m3 and 29 2 108 m3 during the period of 1960 1986 and 1987 1999 respectively such water utilization increment only accounted for 9 9 of the annual flow reduction at lz during 2000 2017 the annual water utilization there decreased to 25 6 108 m3 further contributing 24 4 to the flow increase therefore compared with flow in lz tdg flow in the upstream of lz was less influenced by water utilization climate change especially significant temperature rising since 1950s was regarded as the main reason inducing flow variation in this region xu et al 2009 winter warming led to degeneration of permafrost frozen soil and glacier melt retreat resulting in the hydrological variations zheng et al 2009 in addition precipitation reduction since 1980s to 1990s led to grassland degradation and decline of the region s conservation capacity in the region of tdg xld annual water utilization during 1960 1986 was 30 5 108 m3 equivalent to about 20 2 of the flow fig 17 c in the period of 1987 1999 annual water utilization increased by 27 leading to 13 0 reduction of the annual flow in this region the annual water utilization eventually reached 50 1 108 m3 during 2000 2017 meanwhile the annual flow declined from 88 8 108 m3 to 69 3 108 m3 around 59 0 of such reduction was caused by water utilization increase in the lower reach xld lj where large volume of river water was taken for industrial and agricultural utilization although this region accounts only 10 of the yellow river basin area the average annual water utilization here accounts for over 35 of the total water utilization in the basin in 1960 1986 annual water utilization in xld lj was around 79 2 108 m3 fig 17 d which further increased by 76 up to 139 4 108 m3 in the period of 1987 1999 such increment contributed to 70 1 of the annual flow reduction in this region after 1999 along with the unified water allocation scheme in the yellow river basin scheme 1987 in short approved in 1987 by the state council which was also the first river water allocation scheme in china annual water utilization again declined to 121 3 108 m3 the annual flow in this region thus increased by 25 0 108 m3 72 7 of which was attributed to the reduction in water utilization therefore water utilization was one of the main factors contributing to the flow reduction in the basin fig 18 for example at lj station from the period of 1960 1986 to 1987 1999 the increase in annual water utilization in the basin accounted for almost 37 0 of the decrease in annual flow from 1987 1999 to 2000 2017 the contribution rate of annual water utilization reduction to annual flow increment was 104 9 along with flow alteration sediment carrying capacity of flow changed and thus sediment load altered accordingly nevertheless for the middle reach that passes through the loess plateau known for its severe soil erosion climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities e g soil and water conservation measures are regarded as the main factors responsible for the dramatic declines in flow discharge and sediment load fu et al 2017 the considerable loss of soil on the loess plateau has led to high sediment load before the 1950s risk of land degradation threat to ecosystem sustainability and widespread socioeconomic concern wang et al 2016 to mitigate the severe soil erosion on the loess plateau many soil and water conservation practices were adopted after 1970s classified broadly as channel measures including construction of dams and reservoirs in gullies and river channels and slope measures including terracing grass planting afforestation and closure measures to promote revegetation on slopes fu et al 2017 our previous study indicated that precipitation reduction attributed to 35 and 34 of flow reduction and sediment load reduction channel measures caused 32 and 39 of flow reduction and sediment load reduction whereas slope measures caused 33 and 27 of flow reduction and sediment load reduction wang et al 2022 5 conclusion this study offers a river reach division scheme for the yellow river basin as a framework to reduce complexity of the large river system and redundancy of time series analyses and to characterize spatial and temporal hydrological variations within the basin based on the time series analyses for discharge and sediment load the river was divided into five reaches abrupt changes were detected in the years 1986 and 1999 when magnitude and variance of both annual flow and sediment load decreased sharply dividing the historical period into three before 1987 1987 1999 after 1999 besides the large number of human activities in the loess plateau that has significantly altered the hydrological geomorphological and ecological status of the river basin reservoirs construction and regulation as well as river water utilization are also playing determinative roles in the hydrological variations in the downstream of tnh the annual flow and sediment load decreased significantly especially in the recent decades the sediment transport per unit area in tdg tg used to be the largest in the basin which declined notably after 1999 and was eventually surpassed by that in tg as as a consequence of water and sediment regulation by xldr since 2002 the reservoirs altered seasonal streamflow patterns greatly especially in the regions upstream of szs where 17 reservoirs including ljxr and lyxr were established along the main stem these reservoirs used to intercept a large volume of sediments before 1970 s such high sediment interception however declined between 1970 s and 1990 s and in fact showed little effect on the reduction of sediment transport in recent years as water and soil conservation measures attributing the major reduction increasing water utilization was one of the leading factors inducing the flow variation in the yellow river from 1960 1986 to 1987 1999 the annual water utilization increment accounted for 21 7 of the flow reduction in the upper reaches especially further increase of water utilization in the region of lz tdg has contributed around 87 1 of the flow reduction in the middle and lower reaches the impact of increasing water utilization on flow reduction was 13 0 and 70 1 respectively from 1987 1999 to 2000 2017 the increase of annual water utilization in the upper and middle reaches has attributed approximately 126 4 and 59 0 of the flow reduction respectively the average annual water utilization accounted for 72 7 of the annual flow in the lower reaches in conclusion except for the source region the hydrological variations of the yellow river have almost been characterized by anthropogenic activities this study provides reliable framework and scientific basis for guiding anthropogenic activities management strategies in the river basin suitable reservoir construction and regulation as well as water resources utilization can benefit the integrated management and sustainable development of the river basin declaration of

3399,understanding water and sediment variations of the yellow river is significant for future management of the river from perspectives of water resources utilization and ecology protection the study characterized the temporal and spatial variations in its flow and sediment load based on the daily datasets of the past 60 years from all main stem hydrological gauge stations and proposed a new five segment river reach division scheme instead of the traditional three or four segment division furthermore we distinguished the key factors and their contributions that caused the flow and sediment variations offering reference for the river management strategies as per the local conditions a significant decreasing trend in annual flow and sediment load was observed in the river basin except for certain reaches in segment 1 upstream of tangnaihai the maximum flood event duration decreased significantly in segment 2 from tangnaihai to shizuishan the flood volume and sediment load during the maximum flood event also showed significant downward trend in segments 2 5 downstream of tangnaihai operation of cascade reservoirs especially in segment 2 has smoothed the annual flow process in the upstream sediment trapping in the reservoirs had little effect on the change in sediment load but reservoir regulation of flow greatly influenced siltation in the upstream river channel water abstraction has also played a significant role in flow variation consequently the ratio of flood sediment load to annual sediment load decreased significantly in the upper reach but increased significantly in the lower reach temporally the recorded period was divided into three periods using change point detection pre 1987 1987 1999 and post 1999 the ratio of flood volume to annual flow decreased significantly in the first two periods and generally increased post 1999 with the impact of aforementioned anthropogenic activities keywords river reach division scheme hydrological variation maximum event flood anthropogenic impact 1 introduction on a global scale inter annual streamflow regime and seasonal streamflow pattern of rivers have undergone large variations in recent decades along with climate change and intensive human activities this in turn has affected the regularity of water use in human society and the requirement of ecological system and has eventually induced a series of challenges for river management singh et al 2021 many regions including asia dudgeon 2000 wang et al 2011 europe batalla et al 2004 grizzetti et al 2017 america pegg et al 2003 and africa siam and eltahir 2017 are confronting various difficulties imposed by such hydrological alterations to be specific hydrological alteration in the yellow river the second largest river in china has affected the ecological environment and the water security for more than 110 million people living in the basin the flow in the river showed a significant downward trend in the past 60 years yang et al 2004 the flow at the estuary decreased by more than 70 during the 1950 s 1990 s the contradiction between supply and demand of water resources thus became a severe issue the yellow river is also globally famous for its highest sediment concentration and the large volume of sediment load it receives from the loess plateau sediment has been the crux of many problems in the yellow river especially because the excessive sediment led to serious siltation and suspended riverbed in the lower reach such high sediment load however dropped by more than 80 in the recent 60 years zhao et al 2014 the annual average sediment transport at the tongguan station fig 1 from 1919 to 1960 was 1 6 billion tons yr since 2000 it however decreased to only 0 26 billion tons yr later in 2015 it furtherly reduced to merely 0 055 billion tons yr in addition to the overall decreasing trends of annual flow and sediment load the seasonal patterns of streamflow and sediment load also greatly altered the proportion of flow in flood season to annual flow decreased the flood processes in the upper and middle reaches were levelled due to the demand for flood control and power generation minor floods aggravated channel siltation and caused the frequent occurrence of small flow discharge but high water level xu 1999 alteration of the natural flow regime and over exploitation of water resources may have adverse effects on the stability and integrity of the yellow river ecosystem for example the wetland areas such as marshes and meadows in the yellow river delta have significantly reduced li et al 2009 anthropogenic activities such as rising water resources utilization tang et al 2008 yang et al 2004 yu et al 2013 hydropower exploitation wang et al 2007 yang et al 2004 and water soil conservation feng et al 2016 peng et al 2010 zhang et al 2008 zheng et al 2009 are among the key ecological stresses on the river since the 1970s landscape engineering terracing and construction and operation of check dams and reservoirs were the primary factors causing reduction in sediment load since the 1990s a large scale vegetation restoration project have additionally contributed to further reduction in soil erosion wang et al 2016 in summary previous studies were usually based on data from certain hydrological gauge stations and hence focused in a temporal perspective systematic and comprehensive report on the variations both temporally and spatially concerned based on data from gauge stations along the whole basin is lacking to filling the gap the present work aimed to make the following progresses 1 characterizing quantitatively and in much detail the spatiotemporal variations of flow sediment load of the yellow river based on daily datasets over the past 60 years from all of the 27 main stem hydrological gauge stations 2 proposing a new river reach division scheme corresponding to such flow sediment load analysis and 3 furtherly identifying quantitative effects of key factors causing the variations in flow and sediment load such progresses will benefit the yellow river s future management especially water resources allocation 2 material and methods 2 1 study area the yellow river originates from the qinghai tibet plateau and drains into the bohai sea with a length of 5464 km and an area of 7 95 105 km2 there are 27 hydrological stations along the main stem labeled as 1 to 27 from the upstream to the downstream fig 1 and table 1 continuously monitoring and recording the daily flow discharge and sediment load in the river traditionally the yellow river is divided into three or four reaches depending on whether the source region is included into the upper reach the source region that is primarily located in the upstream of station 4 tangnaihai tnh where the alpine eco environment is vulnerable the upper reach upstream of station 15 toudaoguai tdg which is generally regarded as the major water yield region the middle reach between stations 15 tdg and 18 tongguan tg which is the major source of sediment load and the lower reach downstream of station 18 tg frequent cooling and drying climate accompanied with continuous deforestation in the last 3000 years have drastically reduced water yield in the basin the situation simultaneously enhanced the variability of water yield resulting in fluctuations in peak discharges of water and sediment load chen et al 2012 for over 2600 years the 800 km long lower yellow river downstream of the station no 18 frequently shifted its course between the bohai sea and the yellow sea largely owing to the heavily loaded flow discharge chen et al 2015 2 2 datasets the datasets of daily flow and sediment load available for the periods of 1934 2015 and 1950 2015 respectively were obtained from all the stations table 1 while encountering missing data for a few years in some stations the time series were interpolated by following the rules below 1 in the case of missing data for a single year the data were derived using the averages of flow or sediment concentration on the corresponding days in the previous and following years 2 in the case of missing data for consecutive year the data were derived using the averages of flow or sediment concentration on the corresponding days in the previous and following stations 2 3 methodologies 2 3 1 river reach division scheme according to hydrological characteristics clustering analysis ca is a widely applied method that classifies rivers based on their hydrological characteristics hannah et al 2005 hannah et al 2000 kingston et al 2011 ca serves as a technique to categorize data in order to minimize intra group variance while maximizing inter group variance wilks 2011 this is consistent with the concern on the hydrological variability from one reach to another ca required an equal length of series as the input matrix so the continuous discharge dataset from 1964 to 2004 and the continuous sediment load dataset from 1960 to 2009 were used as input datasets for river reach division initially the daily datasets were standardized in z score to avoid the influence of absolute magnitude and to focus on the variation among the different reaches subsequently agglomerative hierarchical ca was performed using ward s algorithm for classification the clustering dendrogram was used to determine the number of clusters each of which represented one reach of the river while deciding the number of clusters hypothesis testing and permutational analysis of variance permanova were applied it helped to state the significances of differences among the clusters that were derived using ca permanova is a non parametric multivariate statistical test anderson 2001 it measures the sum of squares within and between clusters by calculating the distance between two objects a statistic was constructed for f test with a significance level of 0 05 this method requires no assumption about the distributions or correlations of the variables and can help users to make rigorous probability statement depicting differences between the clusters principal component analysis pca was undertaken to derive a multivariate matrix for permanova pca converted the original variables into linearly uncorrelated variables termed as principal components pcs pcs explaining the variance of over 90 were given as input in permanova with using the clustering results for discharge and sediment load series as priori reaches the significance of differences between each of the two reaches were tested a matlab toolbox developed by jones 2014 was applied for multivariate data analysis 2 3 2 time series analysis we conducted time series analysis on multiple indicators of the hydrological variation we introduced the coefficient of variations of flow cvf and sediment load cvs to show the degree of intra annual dispersion cvf and cvs were calculated as follows 1 c vi σ i x i i f s where x i is the mean of the daily flow sediment load time series of each year at each station and σ i is the standard deviation of the same series the change point in the hydrological trend can help to locate indicate the time when climate change or human activities begun seriously altering the natural flow regime a statistical method developed by lavielle was used to detect such abrupt changes in the variance of signals lavielle 2005 various functions in matlab were employed to analyze the monthly series of discharge and sediment load the nonparametric mann kendall method was used for trend analysis in the hydrological series this method is based on the hypothesis that data in the time series tested is independent and identically distributed gao et al 2012 yue et al 2002 2 3 3 flood analysis maximum flood event was identified using a hydrograph recession algorithm vogel and kroll 1992 before employing the recession algorithm the daily discharge series was smoothed out by savitzky golay smoothing filters orfanidis 1995 these filters are more effective than standard averaging fir filters a recession begins when a smoothing record begins to decrease and ends when a smoothing record begin to increase correspondently a possible flood event begins when a smoothing record begins to increase and ends as a recession end the annual maximum flood event is the flood with the largest peak flow flood duration the coefficient of variations of flood discharge cvf for flood flood volume and the ratio of flood volume to the annual flow are selected indices for the description of the flow regime variation cvf for flood was calculated as eq 1 and the only difference was to cut the whole year time series to the annual maximum flood event for sediment load we calculated the sediment load volume for the maximum flood event and its ratio to annual sediment load as they indicated the contribution of maximum floods to the sediment load 3 results 3 1 river reach division the clustering dendrograms of hierarchical ca relating to discharge and sediment load are shown in fig 3 the horizontal axis represents the station codes both discharge and sediment load clusters show that the yellow river can be divided into five reaches most of the division schemes are the same except some disagreement on station 22 where discharge data indicates the station in cluster 4 18 22 while sediment data indicates the station in cluster 5 22 27 as the input sediment series for ca cover longer period than the input discharge series the division scheme derived from sediment series was taken preferentially and applied in the further analyses in summary the yellow river is divided into the five reaches as follows r1 no 1 4 hhy to tnh r2 no 5 12 gd to szs r3 no 13 17 bygl to lm r4 no 18 21 tg to hyk r5 no 22 27 jht to lj permanova test indicates the significance of difference among the clusters for the discharge series the top three pcs explained 92 2 of the total variance and were chosen as representative variables with redundancy reduced the five clusters showed significant difference p 0 05 table 2 pairwise comparison for each of the two groups also indicated significant difference between them for the sediment load series the top two pcs explained 91 0 of the total variance similarly both the inter cluster and pairwise comparisons showed significant difference table 3 thereby both the discharge and sediment load analyses verified the robustness of the yellow river reach division scheme as illustrated in fig 4 correlation coefficients of annual flow series among the stations within each reach could explain their coherences as shown in fig 4 b in r1 the correlation coefficient ranged from 0 646 to 0 984 with a mean of 0 795 the ranges for the other four reaches r2 r3 r4 and r5 were 0 902 0 996 0 983 0 998 0 985 0 997 and 0 977 0 999 respectively it revealed that the homogeneity within each reach was high except for the source region that is well known with its high heterogeneities in geomorphology and hydrology 3 2 abrupt change points in the discharge and sediment load series the discrete wavelet transform was employed to detect changes in the variance of monthly discharge and sediment load series e g hyk in fig 5 at all the hydrological stations fig 6 for discharge series most of the stations in the river source region r1 showed no abrupt change point indicating inter annual stability for the other reaches r2 r5 abrupt changes were detected in the period of 1986 1996 especially 1986 1989 during which 21 stations located in the downstream of tnh showed abrupt changes to be specific most of the abrupt changes occurred in the year 1986 compared to discharge series the change points in sediment load series mostly occurred later as a result of delayed response to flow change and the flow change had to be over certain threshold wu et al 2007 fig 6 similar to the situation of discharge no abrupt change was detected in most of the stations in the source region where little sediment yield and limited human disturbance the only exception was the hhy station where change point was detected in 1993 it was perhaps owing to construction of the large huangheyuan reservoir capacity 25 01 108 m3 in the upstream of hhy station in the 1990s in the other four reaches 12 stations were detected with abrupt change points during the period of 1996 2000 more specific 9 of these 12 stations located in the lower reaches r4 and r5 where 90 of sediment load series declined abruptly after 1996 especially most abrupt changes occurred in the year 1999 at qtx with drainage area ratio 33 0 szs 37 4 and smx 88 7 the abrupt changes in sediment load was observed before 1980s earlier than the changes observed in most of the other stations these abrupt changes however took place exactly after the large reservoirs being established in the upstream reaches for instance the liujiaxia reservoir ljxr and yanguoxia reservoir ygxr capacity 57 and 2 2 108 m3 constructed in 1958 and 1969 respectively caused abrupt changes to sediment load at qtx and szs in the lower reaches large reservoirs also caused such abrupt changes e g the sanmenxia reservoir smxr capacity 354 108 m3 construction beginning in 1957 caused the abrupt change in sediment load at smx 3 3 spatial and temporal annual hydrological variation based on the findings from change point detection the times series of discharge and sediment load were divided into three periods pre 1987 1987 1999 and after 1999 for each period the average annual discharge sediment load and their coefficient of variations were calculated and plotted figs 7 and 8 annual discharge of the 27 stations decreased by a range of 9 to 64 from pre 1987 to the period of 1987 1999 the annual discharge of 16 stations mainly in the lower reaches r3 r5 continued decreasing by a range of 1 to 24 from the period of 1987 1999 to post 1999 in contrast the annual discharge of the other 11 stations increased during these two periods especially after 1999 the reduction of discharge in the lower reaches of yellow river was so severe that the highest discharge appeared in the upper reach r2 instead of in the lower reach r5 which used to be the case before 1987 the coefficient of variation of average annual discharge cvf was in a narrow range 0 62 0 92 for the entire yellow river before 1987 however after 1987 cvf scattered along the river the cvf was a low ebb in the upper reach r2 while it increased rapidly in the lower reaches especially in r5 fig 7 b the trend of annual sediment load was similar to annual flow from the period pre 1987 to the period of 1987 1999 with all series declining by 16 70 the annual sediment load of most stations continued reducing from the period of 1987 1999 to post 1999 especially in the downstream of tg the annual sediment load reduced by over 50 from the period of 1987 1999 to the post 1999 with a remarkable decreasing of up to 95 at xld and up to 91 at hyk increments in flow and sediment load between every two gauge stations can reflect changing conditions that affects flow and sediment yield in the corresponding areas including natural conditions and human activities such as water utilization soil erosion water and soil conservation etc to reduce the influence of drainage area flow as well as the sediment load increments were standardized as modulus by area between the gauge stations fig 9 from pre 1987 to the period of 1987 1999 the absolute value of negative water increment became larger in the regions between lz and qtx and the downstream of hyk fig 9 a c after 1999 flow reduction became severe in the region between lz and qtx but still less notable in the downstream of hyk the regions between tdg and tg was one of the major water yield regions before 1987 the flow increment per unit area here later decreased distinctly and eventually became negative after 1987 especially in the region between tdg and wb the regions from tnh to xhy was the main sediment yield region in the upper yellow river before 1987 fig 9 a however sediment load increment modulus in this region decreased by over 60 in the periods of 1987 1999 and after 1999 the region between qtx and tdg comprising the largest irrigation zone in the upper yellow river the modulus there turned from positive pre 1987 to negative in 1987 1999 fig 9 d and e the modulus in the region between tdg and tg that contributed most to the sediment load was the largest in the basin during the periods of pre 1987 and 1987 1999 the modulus however after 1999 sharply reduced from 2 320 000 kg km2 to 650 000 kg km2 by contrast sediment load increment modulus increased in the regions of tg smx and xld lk after 1999 3 4 variation of annual maximum flood events 3 4 1 trends and variations of flood characteristics for each hydrological station the maximum flood events and the largest peak flow was identified for every year using the datasets shown in fig 2 four indices were employed to describe the flood characteristics 1 duration 2 coefficient of variation for flood 3 flood volume and 4 the ratio of flood volume to annual flow results of mann kendall test were illustrated with marks on the top of figs 10 and 12 maximum flood duration was found significantly decreasing at the 11 stations fig 10 eight of which were located in the upper reach r2 with cascade of reservoirs built after 1960s the flood events also showed different characteristics in the three different periods before 1987 1987 1999 and after 1999 their average magnitude in the different periods can reflect decadal variation of flood characteristics before 1987 flood duration curves changed along the river especially the flood duration in the upstream of xh between xh and tdg and in the downstream of tdg varied significantly for instance the duration of maximum flood event on an average was 39 6 days in the upstream of xh which decreased to 28 5 days between xh and tdg and eventually came down to only 20 3 days in the downstream of tdg the flood wave type also displayed significant difference from the upstream to the downstream similarly cvf for the maximum flood events also indicated such difference fig 10 on an average the cvf for flood was around 0 313 in the upper reaches r1 and r2 while it increased to an average of 0 412 in the lower reaches the degree of dispersion of flood process was higher in the reaches r3 r5 the different flood wave types at the stations xh tdg and hyk drainage area ratio 94 3 were illustrated in fig 11 taking the year 1984 as an example at xh and tdg durations of the maximum flood events were relatively longer over more than 30 days but the flood peaks were rather lower 4000 m3 s in contrast the duration was relatively shorter but the flood peaks were much higher at hyk as indicated by the narrow range of coefficient of variations 0 62 0 92 for average annual discharge at all the gauge stations before 1987 the natural flow regime was stable in the entire basin moreover during this period the coefficient of variations for ratio of the annual flood season flow to the annual flow was also stable in a narrow range of 0 52 0 63 which was also the least in the three periods after 1987 the flow regime was significantly altered the flood duration at the 21 stations decreased from pre 1987 to the period of 1987 1999 more specific in the upper reach r2 flood duration decreased by over 35 60 however it varied in a small scale in the lower reaches r4 and r5 during all of the three periods after 1999 the flood duration increased at the 22 stations compared to the period of 1987 1999 e g the flood duration increased by over 40 at the tnh and tdg in the source reach r1 only at the hhy the flood volume declined significantly however in the reaches r2 to r5 volumes of the maximum flood events showed statistically a significant decreasing trend except for station xld fig 12 spatial wise the flood volume in the upper reach r2 decreased by the maximum extent from over 50 108 m3 to 18 108 m3 the flood volume decreased by over 50 at the 19 stations from pre 1987 to the period 1987 1999 after 1999 the flood volume increased at the 19 stations nine of which increased by over 20 compared with the period of 1987 1999 the ratio of flood volume to the annual flow decreased significantly for the entire period at the 12 stations including all the ones in the upper reach r2 fig 12 the ratio declined at the 25 stations in the period of 1987 1999 compared to pre 1987 with the 7 stations in r2 decreased by over 50 to be more specific the ratio was over 17 in r2 before 1987 higher than the ratio observed in the lower reaches r4 and r5 but then reduced to lower than 8 in 1987 1999 and turned to be the lowest in the basin after 1999 the ratio increased at 20 stations compared to 1987 1999 it even reached to the highest value for the entire period at 8 stations 3 4 2 trends and variation for sediment load during flood events the sediment load volume for the maximum flood event and its ratio to annual sediment load was evaluated the results of the mann kendall test for these two indices were illustrated in fig 13 the flood sediment load from pre 1987 to 1987 1999 displayed significant decreasing trends at the 18 stations including all ones in the reaches r2 to r5 except for smx and xld fig 13 at smx and xld the flood sediment load still increased despite a decrease in both annual sediment load and annual flow after 1999 this index furtherly reduced at the 19 stations with 16 ones showing reduction over 50 at xld and hyk the reduction was as high as over 90 the ratio of flood sediment load to annual sediment load decreased significantly at the 6 stations hhy tnh xc lz and xhy while increased at another 3 stations as lk lj located in the lower reach r5 from pre 1987 to 1987 1999 the ratio declined at all the ten stations in r1 to r3 and increased in the remaining stations after 1999 the ratio decreased at almost all the stations except for the ones in the lower reach r5 4 discussion in the recent 60 years a large number of human activities have emerged throughout the yellow river basin that altered the hydrological geomorphological and ecological status of the river and its basin according to this study the hydrological characteristics of the yellow river suggest that the river be divided into five reaches each of which experienced and are experiencing different alterations caused by climate change and anthropogenic impact therefore understanding the certain changes in nature and society for each of the reaches will benefit their nature based solutions for river management by linking all the spatial and temporal changes in hydrological characteristic with the specific changes in climate conditions and human activities in the yellow river we could explain the hydrological variations to a very large extend hereby we specifically focus on the reaches that showed remarkable hydrological variations and try to explain the major factors and mechanisms that caused the abrupt changes and spatial and temporal hydrological variations to be specific for the upper and lower reaches the effects of reservoir regulation and water resources utilization on alteration of discharge and sediment load are discussed with detailed data and evidences as follows 4 1 effects of reservoir regulation on alteration of flow and sediment load up till 2018 more than 30 reservoirs have already been constructed along the main stem of the yellow river fig 14 out of these reservoirs 17 are located in the upper reach from tnh to szs including the huge reservoirs liujiaxia ljxr and longyangxia lyxr capacity 247 108 m3 their regulation for power generation flood control water supply and navigation has altered inter and intra annual flow patterns since impoundment of lyxr in 1986 its joint operation with ljxr has smoothed seasonal streamflow and caused the significant reduce in the duration of maximum flood events the dispersion degree of streamflow and the ratio of flood season flow to annual flow figs 7 and 10 regulation of the reservoirs is thus regarded as the main cause for abrupt change in flow and the change point in the year 1986 in the upper reaches fig 15 a illustrates annual sediment deposition in ljxr and lyxr in the period of 1968 2005 during 1968 1986 ljxr intercepted averagely 0 77 108 tons yr of sediment after 1986 the annual sediment deposition reduced to an average of 0 43 108 t a and 0 29 108 tons yr in the periods of 1987 1999 and 2000 2005 respectively mann kendall trend test also showed that the annual sediment load intercepted by ljxr decreased significantly during the period of 1987 2005 meanwhile lyxr trapped around 0 2 108 tons of sediment per year between 1987 and 1999 in 1999 2005 the mean annual sediment deposition in lyxr was around 0 17 108 tons which was still close to the previous period during 1987 1999 the annual sediment intercepted by lyxr and ljxr together was 0 63 108 tons yr which was lower than the amount it received between the years 1968 1986 after 2005 12 more reservoirs were established successively in the upstream of qtx figs 14 16 according to the estimates these reservoirs including lyxr and ljxr intercepted approximately 0 43 108 tons of sediment per year during the period of 2000 2014 which was yet lower than the quantity intercepted during the period of 1987 1999 compared with the upper reaches there were fewer reservoirs in the middle and lower reaches in the midst of those 6 established reservoirs including sanmenxia smxr and xiaolangdi xldr dominated in sediment interception and regulation since the beginning of smxr operation in 1960 it rapidly received massive fluvial sediment deposition fig 15 b until 1967 the reservoir already trapped around 61 85 108 tons of sediment since 1965 the operational mode of smxr has changed several times which alleviated the sediment deposition during 1960 1986 the average amount of sediment trapped by this reservoir was 2 29 108 tons yr which was 19 9 of average annual sediment load at xld the average interception however reduced to 0 79 108 tons yr during the period of 1987 1999 from 1960 1986 to 1987 1999 the annual sediment load increment between tdg and xld decreased from 8 65 108 tons yr to 7 18 108 tons yr in another word instead of trapping sediment smxr released sediment to the downstream and thus contribution of reservoir trapping sediment to reduction of sediment load was negative the xldr started operating and intercepting sediment in 1998 the annual sediment interception was 2 15 108 tons yr between 2000 and 2017 additionally the other reservoirs along the main stem between tdg to lm trapped another 0 29 108 tons of sediment per year after 1999 hu et al 2012 as a result between tdg xld from 1987 1999 to post 2000 sediment intercepted by the reservoirs increased by 1 65 108 tons yr which accounted for 19 9 of reduction of annual sediment load fig 16 4 2 impacts of water utilization on alteration of flow and sediment load water utilization throughout the yellow river basin has played a crucial role on reduction of annual flow this paper collected and synthesized several water utilization datasets which only took the surface water from the river basin into consideration from different researches hou et al 2012 hu et al 2008 liu and zhang 2004 liu 2016 yang et al 2004 besides these datasets were further calibrated using the data obtained from the yellow river water resources bulletin yrcc 1998 2017 variation of water utilization was analyzed to assess its impact on flow alteration from the upstream to the downstream of the river in the upper reaches upstream of tdg the annual water utilization for irrigation and other demands was around 104 7 108 m3 during the period 1960 1987 fig 17 that was equivalent to 41 5 of the observed annual flow at tdg later in 1987 1999 the annual water utilization in this region further increased to 123 9 108 m3 meanwhile the annual flow at tdg decreased from 252 3 108 m3 to 163 8 108 m3 the water utilization increment thus accounted for approximately 21 7 of the flow reduction fig 18 from 1987 1999 to 1999 2017 the annual water utilization further reached to 129 2 108 m3 and the increment exceeded the flow reduction at tdg i e contributing to 126 4 of the flow reduction most of the upstream water utilization took place in the region of lz tdg where the large irrigated areas e g qingtongxia hetao and weijing were located for specific hetao irrigated area was the largest water consumer its average annual water utilization was around 52 of the total annual water utilization in lz tdg from 1960 1986 to 1987 1999 the water utilization increment in this region contributed 87 1 to the flow reduction from 1987 1999 to 2000 2017 the annual flow in lz tdg declined by 18 9 108 m3 and 46 9 of such reduction was attributed to water utilization increment as shown in fig 17 b water utilization continued growing in the three periods and the flow deficit in the region lz tdg thus became severe continuously annual water utilization in the upstream of lz was estimated to be around 21 9 108 m3 and 29 2 108 m3 during the period of 1960 1986 and 1987 1999 respectively such water utilization increment only accounted for 9 9 of the annual flow reduction at lz during 2000 2017 the annual water utilization there decreased to 25 6 108 m3 further contributing 24 4 to the flow increase therefore compared with flow in lz tdg flow in the upstream of lz was less influenced by water utilization climate change especially significant temperature rising since 1950s was regarded as the main reason inducing flow variation in this region xu et al 2009 winter warming led to degeneration of permafrost frozen soil and glacier melt retreat resulting in the hydrological variations zheng et al 2009 in addition precipitation reduction since 1980s to 1990s led to grassland degradation and decline of the region s conservation capacity in the region of tdg xld annual water utilization during 1960 1986 was 30 5 108 m3 equivalent to about 20 2 of the flow fig 17 c in the period of 1987 1999 annual water utilization increased by 27 leading to 13 0 reduction of the annual flow in this region the annual water utilization eventually reached 50 1 108 m3 during 2000 2017 meanwhile the annual flow declined from 88 8 108 m3 to 69 3 108 m3 around 59 0 of such reduction was caused by water utilization increase in the lower reach xld lj where large volume of river water was taken for industrial and agricultural utilization although this region accounts only 10 of the yellow river basin area the average annual water utilization here accounts for over 35 of the total water utilization in the basin in 1960 1986 annual water utilization in xld lj was around 79 2 108 m3 fig 17 d which further increased by 76 up to 139 4 108 m3 in the period of 1987 1999 such increment contributed to 70 1 of the annual flow reduction in this region after 1999 along with the unified water allocation scheme in the yellow river basin scheme 1987 in short approved in 1987 by the state council which was also the first river water allocation scheme in china annual water utilization again declined to 121 3 108 m3 the annual flow in this region thus increased by 25 0 108 m3 72 7 of which was attributed to the reduction in water utilization therefore water utilization was one of the main factors contributing to the flow reduction in the basin fig 18 for example at lj station from the period of 1960 1986 to 1987 1999 the increase in annual water utilization in the basin accounted for almost 37 0 of the decrease in annual flow from 1987 1999 to 2000 2017 the contribution rate of annual water utilization reduction to annual flow increment was 104 9 along with flow alteration sediment carrying capacity of flow changed and thus sediment load altered accordingly nevertheless for the middle reach that passes through the loess plateau known for its severe soil erosion climate change and intensive anthropogenic activities e g soil and water conservation measures are regarded as the main factors responsible for the dramatic declines in flow discharge and sediment load fu et al 2017 the considerable loss of soil on the loess plateau has led to high sediment load before the 1950s risk of land degradation threat to ecosystem sustainability and widespread socioeconomic concern wang et al 2016 to mitigate the severe soil erosion on the loess plateau many soil and water conservation practices were adopted after 1970s classified broadly as channel measures including construction of dams and reservoirs in gullies and river channels and slope measures including terracing grass planting afforestation and closure measures to promote revegetation on slopes fu et al 2017 our previous study indicated that precipitation reduction attributed to 35 and 34 of flow reduction and sediment load reduction channel measures caused 32 and 39 of flow reduction and sediment load reduction whereas slope measures caused 33 and 27 of flow reduction and sediment load reduction wang et al 2022 5 conclusion this study offers a river reach division scheme for the yellow river basin as a framework to reduce complexity of the large river system and redundancy of time series analyses and to characterize spatial and temporal hydrological variations within the basin based on the time series analyses for discharge and sediment load the river was divided into five reaches abrupt changes were detected in the years 1986 and 1999 when magnitude and variance of both annual flow and sediment load decreased sharply dividing the historical period into three before 1987 1987 1999 after 1999 besides the large number of human activities in the loess plateau that has significantly altered the hydrological geomorphological and ecological status of the river basin reservoirs construction and regulation as well as river water utilization are also playing determinative roles in the hydrological variations in the downstream of tnh the annual flow and sediment load decreased significantly especially in the recent decades the sediment transport per unit area in tdg tg used to be the largest in the basin which declined notably after 1999 and was eventually surpassed by that in tg as as a consequence of water and sediment regulation by xldr since 2002 the reservoirs altered seasonal streamflow patterns greatly especially in the regions upstream of szs where 17 reservoirs including ljxr and lyxr were established along the main stem these reservoirs used to intercept a large volume of sediments before 1970 s such high sediment interception however declined between 1970 s and 1990 s and in fact showed little effect on the reduction of sediment transport in recent years as water and soil conservation measures attributing the major reduction increasing water utilization was one of the leading factors inducing the flow variation in the yellow river from 1960 1986 to 1987 1999 the annual water utilization increment accounted for 21 7 of the flow reduction in the upper reaches especially further increase of water utilization in the region of lz tdg has contributed around 87 1 of the flow reduction in the middle and lower reaches the impact of increasing water utilization on flow reduction was 13 0 and 70 1 respectively from 1987 1999 to 2000 2017 the increase of annual water utilization in the upper and middle reaches has attributed approximately 126 4 and 59 0 of the flow reduction respectively the average annual water utilization accounted for 72 7 of the annual flow in the lower reaches in conclusion except for the source region the hydrological variations of the yellow river have almost been characterized by anthropogenic activities this study provides reliable framework and scientific basis for guiding anthropogenic activities management strategies in the river basin suitable reservoir construction and regulation as well as water resources utilization can benefit the integrated management and sustainable development of the river basin declaration of
